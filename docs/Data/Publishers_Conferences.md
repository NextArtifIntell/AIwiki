## Introduction to Publishers

### AAAI

- [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aaai.org/)
- [Conferences](https://aaai.org/aaai-publications/aaai-conference-proceedings/)
- [About Us](https://aaai.org/about-aaai/)

Founded in 1979, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) (formerly the American Association for Artificial Intelligence) is a nonprofit scientific society devoted to advancing the scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying thought and intelligent behavior and their embodiment in machines.

### ACL

- [Association for Computational Linguistics](https://www.aclweb.org/)
- [Conferences](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/acl)
- [About Us](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/what-is-cl)

The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics or natural language processing (NLP). The association was founded in 1962, originally named the Association for Machine Translation and Computational Linguistics (AMTCL), and became the ACL in 1968. Activities of the ACL include the holding of an annual meeting each summer and the sponsoring of the journal Computational Linguistics, published by MIT Press; this conference and journal are the leading publications of the field. For more information, see: https://www.aclweb.org/.

### ACM

- [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/)
- [Conferences](https://dl.acm.org/conferences)
- [About Us](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/about-the-acm-organization)

ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking.

Founded at the dawn of the computer age, ACM’s reach extends to every part of the globe, with more than half of its more than 100,000 members residing outside the U.S.  Its growing membership has led to Councils in Europe, India, and China, fostering networking opportunities that strengthen ties within and across countries and technical communities.  Their actions enhance ACM’s ability to raise awareness of computing’s important technical, educational, and social issues around the world.

### IEEE

- [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)
- [Conferences](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/conferences/title)
- [About Us](https://www.ieee.org/about/index.html)

IEEE is the trusted voice for engineering, computing, and technology information around the globe.

IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.

### MIT

- [MIT](https://direct.mit.edu/)
- [About Us](https://direct.mit.edu/books/pages/About?)

Known for iconic design, rigorous scholarship, and creative technology, the MIT Press is a leading publisher of books and journals at the intersection of science, technology, and the arts. We work daily to reimagine what a university press can be, and to use our power as an academic publisher to elevate knowledge to inform and empower.

This vision is what inspired the launch of MIT Press Direct in January 2019 as an independent, cost-effective, and accessible way for libraries to offer MIT Press ebooks to their patrons. In 2020, we expanded the utility and reach of the platform by incorporating our journals, and in 2022 we added the essential research tool CogNet to the collection.

MIT Press Direct has also catalyzed our open access publishing initiatives for both journals and books. We now have 34 journals actively publishing in hybrid, diamond, and gold open access models. And the Direct to Open publishing model launched in 2021 has produced more than 80 open access editions of our books in its first year thanks to generous support from 265 libraries. The MIT Press is committed to responsible and ethical conduct in our workplace. View the code of conduct that governs all of our collaborations.
