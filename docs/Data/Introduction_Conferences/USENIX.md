- [About Us](https://www.usenix.org/about)

The USENIX Association is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, dedicated to supporting the advanced computing systems communities and furthering the reach of innovative research. We are known for organizing conferences and publishing research, but our greatest strength lies in building communities in computing systems. We represent the interests of our communities in a variety of ways, including our professional affiliation with the Computing Research Association.

Since 1975, USENIX has brought together the community of engineers, researchers, and practitioners working on the cutting edge of the computing world. USENIX conferences have become the essential meeting grounds for the presentation and discussion of the most advanced information on the development of all aspects of computing systems.
