Known for iconic design, rigorous scholarship, and creative technology, the MIT Press is a leading publisher of books and journals at the intersection of science, technology, and the arts. We work daily to reimagine what a university press can be, and to use our power as an academic publisher to elevate knowledge to inform and empower.

This vision is what inspired the launch of MIT Press Direct in January 2019 as an independent, cost-effective, and accessible way for libraries to offer MIT Press ebooks to their patrons. In 2020, we expanded the utility and reach of the platform by incorporating our journals, and in 2022 we added the essential research tool CogNet to the collection.

MIT Press Direct has also catalyzed our open access publishing initiatives for both journals and books. We now have 34 journals actively publishing in hybrid, diamond, and gold open access models. And the Direct to Open publishing model launched in 2021 has produced more than 80 open access editions of our books in its first year thanks to generous support from 265 libraries. The MIT Press is committed to responsible and ethical conduct in our workplace. View the code of conduct that governs all of our collaborations.
