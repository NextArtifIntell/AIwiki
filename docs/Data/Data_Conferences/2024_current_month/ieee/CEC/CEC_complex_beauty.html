  abstract  = {High-dimensional optimization problems present a significant challenge in various scientific and engineering domains due to their complexity and the exponential increase in the search space. Traditional optimization algorithms often struggle to balance exploration and exploitation efficiently in such settings. To address this challenge, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is integrated with metaheuristic algorithms in this paper. The proposed framework dynamically selects among Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms based on their performance history. The RL agent is trained via a Q- Learning algorithm with dynamically allocated rewards to ensure a fair evaluation of the improvements in objective values. It determines the most suitable algorithm to apply in each iteration, adapting its strategy as the optimization progresses. QL-H(GDPA) is evaluated on five widely recognized high-dimensional benchmark functions using statistical analyses such as the Friedman test and the Nemenyi post hoc test. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of QL-H(GDPA) over individual algorithms, highlighting its effectiveness in high-dimensional optimization. The adaptive nature of the algorithm selection process allows for more effective navigation through complex solution spaces, particularly in high-dimensional contexts. The study underscores the potential of RL in improving optimization strategies and opens avenues for more intelligent and adaptable optimization frameworks in high-dimensional scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Recently, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with an unbounded external archive (UEA) have received increasing attention in the evolutionary multi-objective optimization community. Its basic idea is to store all examined solutions during the optimization process and select representative solutions as the final output for the decision-maker (DM). Although many studies have investigated MOEAs with UEA, there is a lack of studies focusing on the final solution selection. Actually, selecting a good solution from UEA that meets the requirements of the DM is a challenging task due to the limited information processing capacity of the human decision-maker. Moreover, in many real-world scenarios, decision-makers often prefer not to evaluate a large number of solutions and may not have clear preferences over objectives. To fill this gap in post-processing for MOEAs with UEA, this paper proposes an interactive final solution selection (IFSS) method for multi-objective optimization. The proposed IFSS method aims to provide a good final solution through several interactions with the DM. In other words, the DM can obtain a satisfying solution after evaluating only a small number of solutions even without providing clearly specific preferences. Furthermore, a calibration strategy is introduced to significantly improve the performance of IFSS by slightly increasing the number of interactions. Extensive experiments are conducted on various test problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IFSS method.},

  abstract  = {In regression analysis, methodologies range from black-box approaches like artificial neural networks to white-box techniques like symbolic regression. Renowned for its trans-parency and interpretability, symbolic regression has become increasingly prominent in elucidating complex data relationships. Nevertheless, its effectiveness in managing complex piecewise symbolic regression tasks poses significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Cooperative Genetic Program-ming (HCGP) framework to address this issue. The HCGP model utilizes a unique hierarchical structure, incorporating dual cooperative genetic programming (GP) populations. This innovative design significantly enhances the capability to solve complex piecewise symbolic regression problems. Implementing a scenario-based GP is central to the HCGP framework, which strategically selects the appropriate underlying calculation GP. This feature enables the system to autonomously learn and adapt to complex scenarios, selecting the most suitable calculation GPs for each case. Our HCGP approach distinguishes itself from traditional and state-of-the-art methods. It demonstrates particular proficiency in modeling piecewise expressions within complex scenarios. The empirical evaluation of our model, conducted using benchmark datasets, has exhibited its superior accuracy and computational efficiency. This progress emphasizes the potential of HCGP in sophisticated data modeling and marks a substantial advancement in a hierarchical structure in complex piecewise symbolic regression.},

Genetic Programming (GP) has a built-in feature selection mechanism that explores the search space to include informative features in models. However, this built-in mechanism is insufficient for identifying important features, when dealing with high-dimensional feature spaces. To overcome this limitation, the paper introduces a novel feature importance measurement based on the Maximal Infor-mation Coefficient and Shapley Values. The proposed algorithm operates in two stages. In the first stage, it identifies the best individuals from different populations. In the second stage, the best individuals from the first stage are utilized for the calculation of the novel individual feature importance measurement. The new feature importance measurement offers valuable insights into the significance and relevance of the selected features. Regression experiments were conducted on six datasets to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, comparisons were made with two other algorithms to evaluate its performance. The results indicate that the proposed approach enhances GP performance for high dimensional datasets while maintaining GP trees of similar size compared to standard GP.},

However, their effectiveness is limited when dealing with LSOPs that involve expensive objective functions because the significant number of objective evaluations required before identifying the optimal solution. In this paper, two sets of subproblems are op-timized, assisted by surrogate models, to collaboratively explore the optimal solution space for large-scale expensive optimization problems (LSEOPs). A variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO), engineered to accelerate convergence, is proposed to search for the optimal solution for each subproblem. Moreover, a novel infill criterion is introduced, where the solution with the maximum expected improvement in the first set of subproblems and the solution with the minimum objective value discovered so far in the second set of subproblems are selected. Then, their mean position will be evaluated using the real objective function. Experimental findings on 15 CEC2013 benchmark problems show that our proposed approach outperforms four state-of-the-art algorithms in solving expensive large-scale optimization problems with up to 1000 decision variables.},

In this paper, we study how surrogates are helping metaheuristics from an important and understudied point of view: their energy profile. Even if surrogates are a great idea for substituting a time-demanding complex fitness function, the energy profile, general efficiency, and accuracy of the resulting surrogate-assisted metaheuristic still need considerable research. In this work, we make a first step in analyzing particle swarm optimization in different versions (including pre-trained and retrained neural networks as surrogates) for its energy profile (for both processor and memory), plus a further study on the surrogate accuracy to properly drive the search towards an acceptable solution. Our conclusions shed new light on this topic and could be understood as the first step towards a methodology for assessing surrogate-assisted algorithms not only accounting for time or numerical efficiency but also for energy and surrogate accuracy for a better, more holistic characterization of optimization and learning techniques.},

To address this issue, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been proposed, utilizing solution evaluations predicted by a machine learning model (surrogate). However, previous studies have not analyzed the impact of prediction accuracy of a surrogate on the performance in SAEAs. This study aims at analyzing the impact of the surrogate model&#39;s prediction accuracy on search performance. For this purpose, the search performance of SAEAs is compared using pseudo-surrogate models whose accuracy can be adjusted. In the experiments, two types of SAEAs, the pre-selection strategy with classification-based surrogate (PS-CS) and the individualbased strategy with absolute fitness surrogate (IB-AFS), were addressed on solving the CEC2015 benchmark problems. EAs without surrogates were also compared as a baseline method. The results showed that, for PS-CS, the surrogate model with accuracy of 1.0 demonstrated the best search performance, and higher accuracy resulted in better search performance. At an accuracy of 50 %, the performance was equivalent to or lower than that of EAs without surrogates. On the other hand, for IB-AFS, using high accuracy surrogate models was still effective, but the trend of higher accuracy leading to better search performance was less observed than PS-CS.},

Multitasking traveling salesman problem (MTSP) is one of the most important combinatorial optimization problems in EMTO. However, redundant encoding and inefficient probabilistic transfer mechanisms used in most existing works may lead to negative transfer. In this paper, a new multi-population evolutionary algorithm via seed transfer (MPEA-ST) is proposed for MTSP. Firstly, combining heuristics with EMTO, a new seed encoding strategy, and seed growth mechanism are proposed to overcome redundant coding and suppress negative transfer. Moreover, a new seed selection mechanism and transfer strategy are designed to select seeds with knowledge. Finally, a new dataset construction method is developed to address the lack of MTSP benchmarks with different similarities. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed MPEA-ST compared to other state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.},

  abstract  = {Genetic programming (GP) hyper-heuristic method has been extensively studied to solve multiple dynamic job shop scheduling tasks by generating an effective heuristic for each task simultaneously. However, a fundamental question has not been answered. Do we need to customize a specific heuristic for each task? To fill this research gap, we propose to generate a single heuristic for handling multiple tasks. Without designing complex evolution mechanisms, only during the evaluation process of GP, the fitness of a heuristic is evaluated by multiple tasks. Since there are multiple tasks, a heuristic has multiple objective values. A rank aggregation (RA) fitness evaluation strategy is designed to convert multiple objective values of multiple tasks into a fitness value for a single heuristic. To validate the effectiveness of the generated solution and the proposed RA strategy, we design multitask scenarios that encompass tasks with diverse objectives, utilization levels, and maximum operation times. The results demonstrate that the performance of the single heuristic generated in multitask scenarios is comparable to solutions generated by GP using the single-task learning paradigm, meaning that with an appropriate training method, GP can generate a heuristic with good generality.},

  abstract  = {Competitive facility location problems involve two different firms competing for customers, each aiming to increase its market share. Typically, there exists a hierarchy between the firms based on factors such as size, power, or influence in the market. In this type of problem, it is commonly assumed that both firms will open a fixed number of facilities. Moreover, the firm acting as the leader in the market must consider the reaction of the other firm, considered as the follower. The follower&#39;s decisions are conditioned by the leader&#39;s decisions, as the facilities opened by the leader directly affect the follower&#39;s choices. Both firms aim to maximize their own market share. Additionally, in this study, it is assumed that the follower is interested in locating its facilities as far apart from each other as possible. Therefore, a bilevel optimization problem is formulated, where the leader considers a mono-objective problem, and the follower considers a bi-objective problem. It is important to note that obtaining the follower&#39;s reaction introduces some ambiguity since the follower&#39;s response is given as a Pareto front. An assumption must be made regarding this crucial issue. In this study, two well-known approaches are considered: the optimistic and the pessimistic ones. To solve the problem, two versions of an evolutionary algorithm embedded with an $\varepsilon$ -constraint method and with an NSGA-II are proposed. Hence, two variants of the algorithm are implemented, one for each approach assumed. Computational experimentation is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms in solving this complex problem. Moreover, a comparison regarding the impact caused by assuming the optimistic or the pessimistic approaches is performed. The obtained results reveal relevant findings, and an interesting direction for further research is identified.},

Unlike (eli-tist) local search which exclusively accepts improving neighbors, the proposed walk explores a subset of $\lambda$ neighbors only, among which the best one is accepted, whether it improves the current solution or not. This resembles the comma-selection from evolutionary computation, which is to contrast with the plus-selection. This principle was shown to better escape basins of attraction in the context of single-objective optimization. Non-elitism has also been recently revised in the context of multiobjective optimization. However, we emphasize that we do not generate random offspring here. Instead, we create a whole set of $\lambda$ neighbors among which one is carefully selected, thus providing better control of the selection pressure. In order to extend the partial neighborhood walk principles to multiobjective search, we rely on decomposition: multiple scalarizing subproblems are uniformly defined and optimized (independently or cooperatively) in order to form a whole approximation set. Based on a benchmark of difficult NK-landscapes with two and three objectives, we show that even independent sub-problem solving results in a clear improvement over more advanced multiobjective decomposition approaches such as MOEA/D. We further report an in-depth analysis of the neighborhood sample size, the number of sub-problems, and the cooperation among them.},

  abstract  = {The shift towards transportation electrification, marked by the rising use of electric vehicles (EVs) and the development of fast charging stations (FCS), plays a crucial role in transport decarbonization initiatives. To optimize the rollout of FCS and set appropriate charging service fees (CSF)-a process referred to as the coupled FCS multi-stage bi-level operation problem (FCS-MBOP)-is essential for improving both investment and operational efficiency within the integrated power distribution and transportation network (CPTN). For operators, it&#39;s not only necessary to adapt to short-term fluctuations within the environment but also to swiftly respond to changes in the FCS layout resulting from various long-term investment decisions. To address this complexity, we introduce a dual-timescale evolutionary assist deep reinforcement learning framework, which includes two specialized agents with distinct functions: an investment agent (planner) and an operational agent (operator). The planner focuses on annual investments, evolving long-term strategies that weigh social benefits against investment costs through the use of a genetic algorithm (GA). In contrast, the operator acts on an hourly basis, fine-tuning CSF to alleviate traffic congestion and minimize the social costs, while taking into account the planner&#39;s feasible investment decisions. Leveraging the integrated capabilities of a graph neural network (GNN), long-short-term memory (LSTM), and attention mechanisms, our framework&#39;s agents are adept at extracting both temporal and spatial features and facilitating the transfer of experiences across different investment stages. Empirical evidence underscores the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its ability to surpass conventional methodologies in delivering high-quality solutions.},

Due to the utilization of high-frequency signal bands, the propagation of 5G signals is significantly influenced by distance and obstacles in indoor environments. Consequently, devising effective placement schemes faces challenges in complex indoor scenarios. This paper presents a multiobjective genetic algorithm for antenna placement optimization. It tracks the signal propagation by introducing the ray-tracing propagation model. Although the ray-tracing propagation model provides high simulation accuracy, it also incurs substantial computation costs, rendering the antenna placement problem expensive. To tackle this challenge, the algorithm introduces the idea of Bayesian optimization, where a surrogate model replaces certain calculations in the ray tracing propagation model, thereby reducing the computational burden. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to other algorithms in two real-world scenarios, as evidenced by evaluations based on hypervolume and inverted generational distance metrics.},

  abstract  = {Modeling and forecasting of atmospheric drag for space objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is a critical challenge for space situational awareness and environment safety and sustainability. The largest source of dynamics error or uncertainty affecting drag is the thermospheric density. Current operations use empirical models that lack fidelity and are deterministic resulting in unrealistic state and covariance $v_{rel}$ predictions. For more than two decades, numerical physics-based models of thermospheric density have been touted as the next big thing for drag modeling. However, the computational cost combined with the lack of mature algorithms for data assimilation (or $C_{D}$ model-data fusion) has not yet allowed them to make impact in operations. The research community has seen a recent trend towards the development of reduced order models or emulators to overcome these limitations for enabling operational deployment of numerical density models. Dimensionality reduction is an important first step in this process. We build upon previous work in the community to design a nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach based in a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE). We develop a new architecture that employs an attention module, spatial loss scaling, and weighted sampling to optimize performance and overcome data imbalance. We also employ an orthogonality constraint for enabling robust data assimilation as the next step. Results show that we achieve performance similar in terms of reconstruction error (−2%) to that of the robust but linear principal component analysis (PCA) approach while significantly improving performance during nonlinear periods of geomagnetic storms.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning has gained significant popularity in recent years, particularly for tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and other intricate pattern recognition challenges. However, training a deep learning model involves tuning millions or even billions of parameters. Consequently, this training process becomes a large-scale optimisation problem associated with a mostly unknown but highly non-convex fitness landscape. In recent decades, advances in fitness landscape analysis have revolved around characterizing landscapes representing loss functions, with Local Optima Networks (LONs) emerging as a promising tool. This paper, while focusing on LeNet-5, leverages LON to address four key questions concerning the nature of the learning problem. We emphasize the impact of experimental conditions during the analysis phase on drawing conclusions about the problem&#39;s nature. The results shed light on parametrization and optimiser selection to enhance the analysis and comprehension of deep learning loss landscapes. In particular, we identify the presence and number of funnels in the landscape&#39;s structure, study the impact of the dataset on the nature of the problem, investigate how the choice of local search optimisers may influence conclusions about the problem&#39;s structure. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted on the perturbation strength of the Basin-Hopping sampling method for LON construction.},

Specif-ically, a Pareto-aware super-surrogate construction technique is proposed aiming at efficient exploitation of knowledge from benchmarks to make transfer easier. Then, during the surrogate prediction process, appropriate sub-surrogates are sampled from the super-surrogate to jointly guide the evaluation decision. The multiobjective surrogate is also redesigned as objective-wise, decision-making, and combinative ones, so that it can make transfer flexible, as well as evade from the scalarization issue in performance measurement. This knowledge transfer scheme assists the convergence of the search process using previously constructed surrogates from multiple source problems, balancing exploration and exploitation.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to tackle many complex decision-making tasks. However, a critical problem is the unsafe exploration when deploying classical model-free RL methods in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we focus on safe RL for autonomous racing, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). We propose a novel mechanism, named Safe Action Generation (SAG), to address the above challenge. The mechanism mainly consists of two modules: a risk prediction module and an action generation module. The risk prediction module monitors the state of the vehicle in real-time, and once the state is evaluated as risky, the action generation module is activated to prevent unsafe behavior by restricting the exploration of the RL agent. Extensive experiments in The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) demonstrate that our approach can complete one lap at an average speed of 108 km/h, Compared to the baseline without the SAG mechanism, our approach reduces the instances of driving off the track by 97.7%. By using the proposed framework, the learned policy can improve vehicle safety and generalization performance.},

These functions are evolved offline prior to the execution of the neural network and remains the same during the execution of the learning algorithm. We refer to this as static function generation (SFG). This study examines generating these functions in real-time at different points during the execution of the machine learning algorithm. We refer to this as dynamic function generation (DFG). Grammatical evolution (GE) is used to generate the function. Each function is generated at every $m$ epochs of the learning algorithm. Furthermore, the grammar used by GE also changes every $g$ generations of the GE algorithm. A selection perturbative hyper-heuristic is used to determine the options to include in the grammar. In previous work the effectiveness of using GE to evolve the choice function for the Fuzzy Art algorithm was shown. We use this as a case study to investigate DFG given the success of generating choice functions for this learning algorithm in previous work. However, DFG can be used with any neural network learning algorithm. Static and dynamic function generation is evaluated for text classification using the Enron, SMS Spam, Chat GPT tweets, IMDB movie reviews and Amazon product reviews datasets. DFG improved on the performance of SFG for all datasets. Additionally, DFG was found to be competitive with the state of the art and improved on the best known results for the SMS Spam and Chat GPT Tweets datasets.},

There is an extensive variety of modules to choose from when designing algorithm variants, however, there is a rather limited understanding of how each module individually influences the algorithm performance and how the modules interact with each other when combined. We use the functional ANOVA (f-ANOVA) framework to quantify the influence of individual modules and module combinations for two algorithms, the modular Covariance Matrix Adaptation (modCMA) and the modular Differential Evolution (modDE). We analyze the performance data from 324 modCMA and 576 modDE variants on the BBOB benchmark collection, for two problem dimensions, and three computational budgets. Note-worthy findings include the identification of important modules that strongly influence the performance of modCMA, such as the weights option and mirrored modules for low dimensional problems, and the base sampler for high dimensional problems. The large individual influence of the lpsr module makes it very important for the performance of modDE, regardless of the problem dimensionality and the computational budget. When comparing modCMA and modDE, modDE undergoes a shift from individual modules being more influential, to module combinations being more influential, while modCMA follows the opposite pattern, with an increase in problem dimensionality and computational budget.},

The robot arm controlling problem is a variable dimension problem where the number of joints to optimize defines the problem&#39;s dimension. For a holistic study of global optimization methods, we studied 14 representative methods from 4 different categories, i.e., (i) local search optimization techniques with random restarts, (ii) state-of-the-art DIRECT-type methods, (iii) established Evolutionary Computation approaches, and (iv) state-of-the-art Evolutionary Computation approaches. To investigate the effect of the problem&#39;s dimensionality on the solution we generated 20 instances of various combinations among the number of predefined and open decision variables, and we performed experiments for various computational budgets. The results attest that the robot arm controlling problem provides a proper benchmark for variable dimensions.

However, one critical issue in peptide design is the large search space, which makes it impracticable to evaluate all possibilities. Furthermore, most related analyses adopt in silico molecular docking to select potential peptides, which is a time-consuming technique and highly dependent on the molecular structure of already known peptides and the target protein. Aiming to assist the evaluation, discovery and selection of peptides for docking calculation, we developed SAGAPEP, a Surrogate-Assisted Genetic Algorithm framework capable of finding peptides with potential to block the SARS-Co V-2 Spike protein. The surrogate model is used for fast and high-fidelity evaluation of the interaction energy between a peptide and the Spike protein, while the genetic algorithm seeks to discover and select high-potential peptides inspired by principles of genetics and natural selection. Experiments were conducted using a data set composed of several potential peptides obtained through molecular docking by bio-informatics specialists. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAGAPEP achieved low error predictions from its surrogate component trained over that data set, and was able to discover and select peptides with higher binding energy than all present in the data set. Moreover, the noteworthy results of SAGAPEP suggest it may also have the potential to provide promising results for other peptide design problems.},

  abstract  = {Given a bilevel optimization problem, it is often implicitly assumed that all lower level variables participate in the lower level objective/constraint evaluations. However, in theory, there can be scenarios where this assumed variable-to-objective relation is misleading. This means that some variables purportedly associated with lower level objectives might not actually contribute to their calculation. Some lower level variables may only participate in upper level objective calculation, making hard to determine their desired values through the lower-level optimization process. When such solutions are passed to the upper level for evaluation, the upper level search can easily be misled by these inferior values. This property of certain problems poses a significant challenge to the solution methodologies, and this aspect has been generally overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we propose a simple pre-processing method aimed at identifying the association between variables and objectives through a causal relation test. To ascertain if an LL variable contributes to UL/LL objective(s), it is perturbed from a baseline value, and the resulting impact on the objective(s) is observed to make the inference. Then, an improved search scheme is formulated to allocate the evaluations effectively based on the identified variable-to-objective relations. Empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive performance across various problem settings, and are particularly beneficial for so-called deceptive bilevel problems.},

To deal with the thousands of decision variables, one possible approach is to predict and remove unimportant facilities and thus decreases the dimensionality of problem instances. This paper explores the problem reduction of large-scale instances of UFLP. We propose suitable features of facilities to construct machine learning models for UFLP by learning from small instances. Based on this model, we introduce a novel problem reduction strategy-based optimization framework, and apply it to large instances. Through comprehen-sive experiments, we show that the proposed problem reduction strategy can effectively transform the UFLP instances to smaller ones. The performance of existing solution methods can be significantly enhanced, especially on large-scale instances.

Our approach consistently demonstrates superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art mod-els across a range of constrained molecule generation tasks, outperforming existing models in all four sub-tasks related to property targeting. Additionally, we suggest the importance of including toxicity in the evaluation of generative models.

  abstract  = {There is an increasing level of interest in open-endedness in the recent literature of Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence. We previously proposed the cardinality leap of possibility spaces as a promising mechanism to facilitate open-endedness in artificial evolutionary systems, and demonstrated its effectiveness using Hash Chemistry, an artificial chemistry model that used a hash function as a universal fitness evaluator. However, the spatial nature of Hash Chemistry came with extensive computational costs involved in its simulation, and the particle density limit imposed to prevent explosion of computational costs prevented unbounded growth in complexity of higher-order entities. To address these limitations, here we propose a simpler non-spatial variant of Hash Chemistry in which spatial proximity of particles are represented explicitly in the form of multisets. This model modification achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.},

  abstract  = {Games have long served as an effective method for developing and testing artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to function in a complex and possibly adversarial environment. While computers have already outperformed humans in practically all traditional board games, such as checkers, chess or Go, as well as various games with imperfect information, e.g. Poker or Bridge, certain imperfect information games, especially those devised for the purpose of testing particular capabilities of AI agents, remain a challenge. An example of such a game is Reconnaissance Blind Chess (RBC) - a variant of chess in which players do not have full access to the information defining the current board state. In this paper, we present Zubat, an AI RBC playing agent. The agent harnesses the strength of the Stockfish chess engine and enriches it with auxiliary modules. Firstly, we propose to estimate the oppnnent&#39;s uncertainty with a recurrent neural network in order to prefer positions that maximize the opponent&#39;s uncertainty, thus impeding their selection of optimal moves. Secondly, we develop the risk-taker module that identifies high-reward moves that could potentially exploit the opponent&#39;s uncertainty. The mediator module is constructed to select a move to be played by combining all three pieces of available information (the Stockfish assessment of moves, the expected opponent&#39;s uncertainty level, potential gains from risk-taking moves). Experiments conducted in the publicly available RBC match-making system show high competitiveness of the proposed agent, which, at the time of writing, was ranked 2nd out of 117 bots and human players, on the RBC leaderboard.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) method based on Natural Evolution Strategies (NES). In RL, an agent learns an action strategy (policy) that maximizes the expected cumulative reward by repeatedly interacting with an environment. Derivative-Free (DFO)-based RL methods search for policy parameters that maximize the expected cumulative reward using DFO methods. Augmented Random Search (ARS) is one of the most promising DFO-based RL methods. ARS reportedly showed competitive results with state-of-the-art RL methods such as PPO and SAC on MuJoCo locomotion tasks. However, we believe that ARS has two problems. The first problem is that the performance of state normalization in ARS could deteriorate in environments with early termination of episodes. The second problem is that ARS has many user parameters sensitive to the performance. We propose a new DFO-based RL method that addresses these two problems. In order to address the first problem of ARS, we propose state normalization taking account of early termination of episodes. In order to reduce the user parameters, we propose to employ Exponential NES (xNES) as a DFO method with three techniques: controlling excessive shrinkage of the step size, fixing the normalized transformation matrix, and the antithetic variates method. Numerical experiments using six MuJoCo locomotion tasks showed that the proposed method outperformed ARS in five tasks and showed almost the same performance in the other task. In particular, the proposed method succeeded in achieving an average reward of about 9,500 while ARS about 6,000 in 400,000 episodes in Humanoid-v4 that is one of the most difficult tasks in the MuJoCo locomotion ones. Furthermore, in the same task, the proposed method reached an average reward of 6,000 about four times faster than ARS.},

  abstract  = {The task allocation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is one of the practical problems for UAV&#39;s application and serves as the premise for tackling swarm&#39;s complex missions. By establishing a heterogeneous swarm task allocation problem featuring three types of UAVs, constraints such as UAV types, flight time and task execution sequence are considered. An objective function considering flight distance and task time of various types of UAVs is designed. Inspired by the hierarchical interaction behavior of pigeons, the hierarchical structure strategy is proposed and combined with the basic pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) to improve the population&#39;s exploration ability. Simultaneously, the finite tolerance strategy is implemented to prevent individuals from falling into local optima due to inefficient explorations. Accordingly, hierarchy tolerance PIO (HTPIO) algorithm is proposed. Through comparing with other three algorithms across benchmark functions and two examples of swarm task allocation problem, HTPIO obtains the best results on more than half of benchmark functions and all examples. It is proved that HTPIO can effectively deal with complex optimization problems without increasing computational consumption and ensures the population always maintains a strong optimization ability throughout the process.},

Concretely kNNUCS-PG is proposed to improve the sUpervised Classifier System (UCS) as one of LCSs by changing from the interval (rule) representation to the point representation to represent a prototype by employing k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to match the neighborhood prototypes. For a high classification accuracy with data reduction, selecting and generating prototypes that can maintain decision boundaries is necessary. Since UCS has generalization mechanisms, including rule merging, unnecessary rule deletion, and new rule discovery using niche Genetic Algorithm (GA), such techniques are highly useful for evolving indispensable prototypes as generalized prototypes. This paper compared conventional prototype-based methods with kNNUCS-PG in experiments using three benchmark problems and eight table datasets. kNNU CS-PG can maintain high classification accuracy even for complex problems with much overlap in the datasets. The results show that kNNUCS-PG is a robust PG that can maintain high classification accuracy while reducing data for various complex problems.},

This problem encompasses eleven complex nonlinear constraints and four conflicting objectives, presenting challenges for traditional mathematical programming methods. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel constrained many-objective optimization algorithm, named PPS-NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm partitions the objective space into subspaces, using NSGA-III to find Pareto optimal solutions in each, enhancing diversity. The push-and-pull search framework is employed to overcome local optima in each subproblem, accelerating overall convergence. Through a comparative analysis with some evolutionary algorithms, PPS-NSGA-III has shown superior performance. It delivers more effective design solutions with lower risk, reduced cost, and a higher drilling encounter rate in the proposed well trajectory optimization model.},

  abstract  = {In practical applications, combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate intrinsic complexity, predominantly characterized by discrete decision variables and fitness evaluations that are both expensive and subject to noise. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are commonly used to solve expensive optimization problems in which expensive fitness evaluations are replaced by computationally cheaper surrogate models. The quality and quantity of training data are two crucial factors affecting surrogate models&#39; accuracy, especially in noisy environments. Implicit and explicit averaging are two straightforward and effective noise-tolerant techniques, both entirely applicable to combinatorial optimization problems. In scenarios where fitness evaluations are subject to noise, and the allotted number of evaluations is constrained, implicit averaging tends to yield a considerable quantity of training data with diminished quality, whereas explicit averaging exhibits the opposite trend. This paper discusses which of these two noise-tolerant techniques is more suitable for embedding into SAEAs. The results of six multidimensional knapsack problems show that explicit averaging is a good choice, regardless of whether the noise type is additive or multiplicative.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new natural evolution strategy (NES) for implicitly constrained black-box function optimization (ICBBFO). ICBBFO problems are known to be a difficult class of problems because its objective function is not given explicitly, and only information about whether a solution is feasible or infeasible is given. FM-NES is one of the most promising methods for ICBBFO problems. FM-NES uses a multivariate Gaussian distribution (MGD) for solution generation and updates the mean vector and covariance matrix of the MGD using the natural gradient method to improve the expected value of the solutions generated from the MGD. However, when FM-NES is applied to ICBBFO problems where the optimal solution exists near or on a constraint boundary, it is observed that the performance of FM-NES deteriorates. We believe that the deterioration is caused by two problems of FM-NES. The first problem is that FM-NES performs many unnecessary updates of the MGD on a constraint boundary near the optimal solution because the MGD repeatedly moves into and out of the infeasible region. The second problem is that the shape reset of the MGD may not work properly, resulting in an increase in the number of evaluations required to find the optimal solution. To address the two problems of FM-NES, we propose the Enhanced Fast Moving Natural Evolution Strategy for Implicit Constraint (eFM-NES-IC). We conducted numerical experiments using ICBBFO benchmark problems and an 8-element standard lens system design problem that is a difficult real-world problem with implicit constraints to show the effectiveness of eFM-NES-IC. As a result, eFM-NES-IC outperformed FM-NES, DX-NES-IC, xNES, xNES with the resampling technique, CMA-ES, and CMA-ES with the resampling technique on all the benchmark problems and the 8-element standard lens system design problem.},

  abstract  = {Several of the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) are related via the food web. However, most intervention measures have been designed to achieve specific goals in isolation without assessing its impact on other goals. The food web in nature&#39;s ecosystem represents a network that can potentially serve as a proxy towards assessing the impact of certain goals on others via modern computational modelling. While previous works have largely focused on carrying out several types of analysis using graph inspired methods, none has focused on predicting the nature of relationships on the food web. In this work therefore, we propose a graph-based approach leveraging recent advances in graph neural network that captures the interactions and feeding relationships in nature&#39;s ecosystem. More specifically, we focus on two tasks of predicting first, if there exist relationships between several entities in the food web and second, the nature of these relationships given there exist one. As with all real-world datasets for sustainability research, the food web datasets are limited in size which impacts generalization negatively. To bypass this problem, we propose a novel data augmentation method. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using publicly available integrated food web datasets from three estuaries and also compare with multiple baselines. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming competing baselines on a variety of experiments. We also use a network analysis approach to identify the keystone species in this food web. Overall, our work has great implications mostly in the area of ecosystem monitoring and restoration.},

The primary metric is sequence matching fitness, evaluating how well the evolved sequence matches the target sequence. The secondary metric is sequence diversity fitness: considering pairs of sequences with the same primary fitness, this counts the number of differences that exist between them.

This paper introduces an Adaptive Metaheuristic Framework (AMF) designed for dynamic environments. It is capable of intelligently adapting to changes in the problem parameters. The AMF combines a dynamic representation of problems, a real-time sensing system, and adaptive techniques to navigate continuously changing optimization environments. Through a simulated dynamic optimization problem, the AMF&#39;s capability is demonstrated to detect environmental changes and proactively adjust its search strategy. This framework utilizes a differential evolution algorithm that is improved with an adaptation module that adjusts solutions in response to detected changes. The capability of the AMF to adjust is tested through a series of iterations, demonstrating its resilience and robustness in sustaining solution quality despite the problem&#39;s development. The effectiveness of AMF is demonstrated through a series of simulations on a dynamic optimization problem. Robustness and agility characterize the algorithm&#39;s performance, as evidenced by the presented fitness evolution and solution path visualizations. The findings show that AMF is a practical solution to dynamic optimization and a major step forward in the creation of algorithms that can handle the unpredictability of real-world problems.},

The IGP was developed to promote and maintain the population&#39;s genotypic diversity and showed superior performance compared to standard Genetic Programming (GP). In this work, two modifications to the IGP are proposed: first, the diversity promotion and maintenance mechanism is enhanced with information from the phenotype of the individuals rather than only the genotype; second, the Evolutionary Demes Despeciation Algorithm - V2 (EDDA-V2) is used to initialize the population. The phenotype is considered to differentiate the individuals also according to their behaviour rather than only their structure, while EDDA-V2 is employed to start the evolution with a simultaneously diverse and fit population, contrary to traditional initialization techniques. The algorithms incorporating these improvements are called Full Inclusive Genetic Programming (FIGP) and FIGP _E, respectively with and without the EDDA-V2 initialization. The experimental results, performed over eight benchmarks and considering six algorithms, demonstrate the superior performance of FIGP and FIGP _E in comparison to other GP formulations. Moreover, the EDDA-V2 initialization allows for a significant reduction of the computational time.},

  abstract  = {The traveling salesman problem (TSP) has long been a central focus in combinatorial optimization, with extensive applications in areas such as logistics and transportation. With the rapid development of machine learning, the research focusing on TSPs has shifted from traditional heuristics, often involving a substantial amount of manually designed rules, to machine learning-based approaches. However, due to the limitations of models and hardware, generative approaches based on machine learning often fall short of expectations in terms of effectiveness, and they generally lag behind well-established traditional heuristics. To address these limitations and leverage the strengths of both approaches, the integration of heuristics with machine learning has become a crucial branch for solving TSPs. Thus, this paper proposes an approach that combines a traditional heuristic, specifically guided fast local search, with a neural network to tackle TSPs, where reinforcement learning techniques are employed to train the neural network. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed approach over the original heuristic, outperforming the majority of mainstream machine learning-based approaches. Notably, the proposed approach achieves zero-gap results for instances with 20 and 50 nodes and a minimal gap of 0.07% for instances with 100 nodes. Compared with existing reinforcement learning-based approaches, the proposed approach also stands out with the best overall performance.},

  abstract  = {In previous work, algorithms have been decomposed into basic algorithmic components and then recomposed into brand new algorithms using a genetic algorithm. The algorithm is composed in full prior to execution of the algorithm. We refer to this as static algorithm composition (SAC). This study examines composing segmentation algorithms in real-time by varying the techniques used for each of the algorithmic components as well as the order of the algorithmic components at different points during the execution of the segmentation algorithm. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to compose the segmentation algorithm. Furthermore, the techniques that can be used for each algorithmic component changes every $g$ generations of the GA. A selection perturbative hyper-heuristic is used to determine the techniques that the GA can use for each of the algorithmic components. We refer to this as dynamic algorithm composition (DAC). Static and dynamic algorithm composition is evaluated for image segmentation using the BSD-500, PASCAL VOC, Football and COVID CT scan datasets. DAC improved on SAC for all datasets. Additionally, DAC was found to be competitive with the state of the art and improved on the best known results for the COVID CT scan datasets.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses early wildfire management using a team of UAV s for the mitigation of fires. The early detection and mitigation systems help in alleviating the destruction with reduced resource utilization. A Genetic Algorithm-based Routing and Scheduling with Time constraints (GARST) is proposed to find the shortest schedule route to mitigate the fires as Single UAV Tasks (SUT). The objective of GARST is to compute the route and schedule of the UAVs so that the UAVS reach the assigned fire locations before the fire becomes a Multi UAV Task (MUT) and completely quench the fire using the extinguisher. The fitness function used for the genetic algorithm is the total quench time for mitigation of total fires. The selection, crossover, mutation operators, and elitist strategies collectively ensure the exploration and exploitation of the solution space, maintaining genetic diversity, preventing premature convergence, and preserving high-performing individuals for the effective optimization of solutions. The GARST effectively addresses the challenges posed by the NP-complete problem of routing and scheduling for growing tasks with time constraints. The GARST is able to handle infeasible scenarios effectively, contributing to the overall optimization of the wildfire management system.},

In particular, we consider the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and search for ρ-backdoors for Boolean formulas. We analyze the problem of finding ρ-backdoors of small fixed size and adapt (1+1)-EA for its solving: in the proposed algorithm the mutation is performed in such a way that it transitions between Boolean vectors of fixed weight. The proposed algorithm was implemented in the context of a parallel asynchronous strategy based on the island paradigm. In the experimental part we demonstrate the applicability of this algorithm by using the found backdoors to solve extremely hard instances from the area of Logical Equivalence Checking for Boolean circuits: our approach on this class of benchmarks outperforms the best state-of-the-art SAT solvers.},

Ineffectively handling the constraints can result in solutions that are either not optimal or infeasible. In our research, we utilized the constraint-objective cooperative coevolution framework with the FDfar (Feasibility distance-far) method, which is a constraint consensus approach. Our proposed algorithm involves decomposing a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems (subcomponents) using the Recursive Differential Grouping technique, which assigns interrelated variables to the same subcomponent. Then, the FDfar method is selectively applied to a randomly chosen solution to enhance its feasibility. Subsequently, the population is updated while considering the newly generated solution from the FDfar method. We then assess the impact of each subcomponent on both the objective function and the constraints to identify the most effective subcomponent for evolution. The chosen subcomponent then undergoes further evolution using Differential Evolution. We tested our algorithm on a set of 12 benchmark problems. The results from these tests consistently indicated that our approach outperforms other leading methods, not only in making solutions feasible but also in improving their overall quality.},

A central focus of this field is modeling gene regulatory networks (GRN) and understanding how gene expression varies. ScRNA -Seq technology has enabled the ability to explore gene expression at the single-cell level, unlike previous technologies where only an average view of gene expression was possible. As a result, the literature has observed a significant increase in the number of inference methods, taking into account the specificities of the data from scRNA -Seq profiling, such as batch effects, biological variations, and dropouts. However, recent studies have shown that the performance of GRN inference algorithms when considering scRNA -Seq technology is close to random predictors. Furthermore, algorithms that perform well on synthetic and curated data are different from those that perform well on experimental data, indicating a lack of robustness. Considering that experimental data is more interesting for biology, as the modeling of its GRNs enables the understanding of biological phenomena, in this paper we show that the CGPGRN framework can deal with experimental data. Computational experiments are carried out and the results indicate that CGPGRN can outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in several situations and is the only one capable of obtaining correct regulatory relationships in all situations considered.},

Accurate prediction of SAG mill throughput as a crucial performance metric is of utmost importance. The potential of applying genetic programming (GP) for this purpose has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This study introduces an enhanced GP approach entitled multi-equation GP (MEGP) for more accurate prediction of SAG mill throughput. In the new proposed method multiple equations, each accurately predicting mill throughput for specific clusters of training data are extracted. These equations are then employed to predict mill throughput for test data using various approaches. To assess the effect of distance measures, four different distance measures are employed in MEGP method. Comparative analysis reveals that the best MEGP approach achieves an average improvement of 10.74% in prediction accuracy compared with standard GP. In this approach all extracted equations are utilized and both the number of data points in each data cluster and the distance to clusters are incorporated for calculating the final prediction. Further investigation of distance measures indicates that among four different metrics employed including Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Cosine distance, the Euclidean distance measure yields the most accurate results for the majority of data splits.},

  abstract  = {Push and pull search (PPS) is an approach of evolutionary constrained multi-objective optimization that involves de-composing the objective space. PPS comprises two search phases: the ‘push’ and ‘pull’ phases. In the push phase, solutions evolve towards the optimal objective trade-off ignoring constraints. Subsequently, in the pull phase, the solutions evolve towards the optimal objective trade-off satisfying constraints. Depending on the characteristics of the problem, the pull phase starts with only infeasible solutions because constraints are ignored in the previous push phase. Although the feasible solutions discarded in the push phase may have worse objective function values than the infeasible ones in the population at the end of that phase, they can still contribute to the search for optimal feasible solutions in the pull phase. This paper aims to enhance the performance of constrained multi-objective optimization based on the PPS approach. We propose PPS-DM (PPS with directed mating), which archives feasible solutions obtained in the push phase and utilizes them for the search in the pull phase. To generate a new solution, the directed mating focuses on an infeasible solution, extracts feasible solutions dominated by the focused infeasible one from the archive, and applies the differential evolution operator between them. Experimental results using LIR-CMOP test problems show that the proposed PPS-DM improves the search of the pull phase and archives totally better performance than the conventional PPS, NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOEA/D.},

The helper objective employed in the proposed is of three types: a function that adds up all the objectives of the original problem, a periodic function with global optima at equal space, and a function that partially simplifies the objectives of the original problem. The function that adds up all the objectives of the original problem aims to create new search pressure in the objective function space. The function with equally spaced global optima aims to keep the solution set diverse in the objective function space. The function that partially simplifies the original problem aim to escape from the local optima contained in the original problem. These helper objectives are added to the objective variables of the original problem. Adding helper objectives is expected to improve convergence to the global optima and diversity of the set of solutions. Through comparative experiments on the proposed method using the WFG problems as benchmark problems, the experimental results show the improvement of (1) the diversity of the solution set in the objective function space and (2) the convergence speed to the Pareto front.

  abstract  = {This paper aims to enhance the accuracy of the Pareto front estimation model as an aggregative representation of the non-dominated solutions and proposes an algorithm named the Pareto front Model Optimization Algorithm (PFMOA). The typical output of multi-objective optimization is a set of non-dominated solutions approximating the Pareto front, which is the optimal trade-off between objective function values. The more non-dominated solutions there are, the more accurately the Pareto front can be approximated. However, especially in real-world problems, there is often a limitation on increasing the number of solutions due to the time required to execute objective functions. For the issue, a Pareto front estimation method interpolates between a limited number of non-dominated solutions to represent changes in objective function values even in regions where non-dominated solutions are not actually obtained. The proposed PFMOA enhances the accuracy of the Pareto front estimation model while evaluating new solutions. PFMOA generates the estimated Pareto front based on a known non-dominated solution set using Kriging. PFMOA focuses on the point with the lowest confidence levels on the estimated Pareto front and evaluates the corresponding point on the estimated Pareto set. PFMOA also generates new solutions using evolutionary variation. PFMOA stochastically switches these two model-based and evolutionary-based solution generation methods. If the new solution is non-dominated, it is included in the known non-dominated solution set, and the process is repeated to enhance the accuracy of the Pareto front estimation model. The effectiveness of the proposed PFMOA is verified using DTLZ1-3, and WFG4 problems. The results show that, in all cases, the accuracy of the Pareto front approximation by the Pareto front estimation model is higher than that by the obtained solution set itself. Additionally, the combination of model-based and evolutionary-based solution generation is beneficial to enhancing the accuracy of the Pareto front estimation model.},

  abstract  = {The container relocation problem (CRP) in shipping terminals is becoming increasingly important due to the growing amount of transferred goods. Until now, the most commonly investigated problem variant has been the offline CRP, in which the order in which the containers need to be retrieved is known beforehand. However, in many real-world situations this is not the case, which is modelled using the online CRP variant. In this variant, not all information is available from the beginning, but rather, it becomes available as the problem is being solved. Unfortunately, many traditional metaheuristic solution methods can not be applied to such a problem variant, which prompts the application of problem-specific heuristics called relocation rules (RRs). However, RRs are challenging to design manually, which prompted the application of genetic programming (GP) to design them automatically. Since GP was used only to design RRs for the offline problem variant, we apply GP to design relocation rules for the online variant in this study. The performance of GP is investigated under different levels of information availability to measure its performance. The results demonstrate that GP can evolve RRs that perform better than existing manually designed ones. Furthermore, the results show that in certain cases, rules generated for one level of information availability perform well for other levels, demonstrating that the evolved rules exhibit a good generalisation capability.},

  abstract  = {In the Internet of Battlefield Things domain, optimal sensor placement is critical for both tactical and strategic considerations in military surveillance scenarios. Finding the optimal sensor positions for informed decision-making in critical and highly constrained environments is challenging. This paper formulates the problem and proposes a differential evolution algorithm to maximise a military base station&#39;s situational awareness by efficiently finding the optimal sensor positions, enabling timely identification and notification of potential enemy threats. The proposed algorithm also adopts heuristic initialisation and a repair method to improve performance. The approach is tested on 21 scenarios, each varying in the number of sensors, the number and size of obstacles, and the expected directions of enemy attacks. The study&#39;s results demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly introduced approach.},

  abstract  = {The emergence of bias in deep neural models represents a significant reliability concern, which may lead to overoptimistic results on seen data while compromising the model&#39;s ability to generalize effectively on unseen datasets. Recent studies conducted on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which is a publicly available repository of histopathology images, reveal that the TCGA cancerous features extracted by deep neural networks surprisingly are able to discriminate slides based on their origin sites. This finding undoubtedly indicates the existence of site-specific patterns embedded in the extracted features learned by deep networks rather than focusing on histomorphologic patterns. Consequently, this biased behavior raises concerns about the reliability of these networks. This observation motivates us to conduct a series of experiments in which we present two distinct evolutionary feature selection strategies, each differentiated by its objective function evaluation. The primary goal is to select the features with a minimized foot-print of data source signatures, thereby ensuring a more accurate and site-independent cancer classification. We have conducted nine comprehensive independent experiments across nine cancer types, employing each evolutionary strategy. The comparison between results obtained through evolutionary strategies and the original feature sets highlights the substantial impact of feature selection methods on bias reduction while maintaining accuracy in cancer-type discrimination. Furthermore, the comparison of the two strategies with each other demonstrates the intricate nature of bias and its integration with cancerous features during the training process.},

This work proposes an enhanced MQHOA with opposition-based learning (OMQHOA) to balance the exploration and exploitation. An adaptive scaling strategy and a jumping rate scheme are proposed to enhance the diversity of the particles. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated by evaluating on several benchmark problems with different dimensions, including the success rate of finding the global optimum over multiple independent trials, trajectory of convergence, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

These computational methods can be used to design and predict the properties of generated molecules. Multi-target Drug Discovery (MTDD) is an emerging paradigm for discovering drugs against complex disorders that do not respond well to more traditional target-specific treatments, such as central nervous system, immune system, and cardiovascular diseases. Still, there is yet to be an established benchmark suite for assessing the effectiveness of AI tools for designing multi-target compounds. Standardized benchmarks allow for comparing existing techniques and promote rapid research progress. Hence, this work proposes an evaluation framework for molecule generation techniques in MTDD scenarios, considering brain diseases as a case study. Our methodology involves using large language models to select the appropriate molecular targets, gathering and preprocessing the bioassay datasets, training quantitative structure-activity relationship models to predict target modulation, and assessing other essential drug-likeness properties for implementing the benchmarks. Additionally, this work will assess the performance of four deep generative models and evolutionary algorithms over our benchmark suite. In our findings, both evolutionary algorithms and generative models can achieve competitive results across the proposed benchmarks.},

Multi-objective optimization problems are common in numerous fields, such as engineering, economics, and industry, and they often involve trade-off relationships. A key challenge with these problems is identifying and incorporating preferences, which are essential for guiding satisfactory options for decision makers (DMs). Traditional methods have focused on explicit preferences provided by DMs through repetitive interactions. To avoid the inevitable frustration surrounding this task, this study introduces an innovative technique that also utilizes non-preference information (i.e., data corresponding to implied but non-selected options) based on user intentions and extant constraints to provide superior results while reducing the number of interactions required during the optimization process. It enables the discovery of solutions that more quickly approximate the DM&#39;s intentions by effectively exploiting non-preference information. A use case based on a menu-based nutrient and preference decision process demonstrates the performance of the proposed method. From this effort, a significant PBEMO gap is reduced by integrating a circumstantially more intuitive understanding of user preferences, both expressed and implied.},

A data mining component gathers data from the evolutionary steps of BRKGA and suggests chromosomes based on past observations. In this way, we address a key challenge in BRKGA - the exploration of solutions near an individual gene - by leveraging data-driven insights to refine and enhance the search space. Comparative analysis reveals that our hybrid algorithm significantly benefits from the pattern recognition capabilities of data mining, leading to improved scheduled efficiency. The results of a series of computational experiments underscore the potential of this hybrid approach that, although requiring slightly longer computational times, is better than the previous baseline BRKGA algorithm in terms of solution quality.},

We use two indicators, ensemble through an adaptive weighted sum, to play a crucial role in enhancing diversity, while local search with hybrid operators contributes to improving local convergence.

Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEA) are often utilized to address such expensive optimization problems. However, in many SAEAs, the initialization of the surrogate model usually requires lots of expensive function evaluations. Due to the limited budget for real function evaluations, it is a great challenge to complete the initialization of the surrogate model using few-shot data. This paper proposes a meta-learning-based SAEA for solving expensive multi-objective optimization problems. This algorithm first uses a gradient-based meta-learning algorithm to learn domain-specific features from related tasks, which are utilized as the common parameters of the surrogate; then, few expensive function evaluations are utilized for fast adaptation to obtain the target task-specific parameters and to complete the initialization of the surrogate; finally, the initialized surrogate is utilized in the MOEA/D-DE for the evolutionary optimization process. Numerical experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm could effectively save the evaluation budget of expensive functions, and the effectiveness is verified on a set of benchmark test problems.},

A Dynamic Path Planner (DPP) for UAV using the Spherical Vector-based Particle Swarm Optimisation (SPSO) technique is proposed in this study. The UAV is supposed to go from a starting point to an end point through an optimal path according to some flight criteria. Path length, Safety, Attitude and Path Smoothness are all taken into account upon deciding how an optimal path should be. The path is constructed as a set of way-points that stands as re-planaing checkpoints. At each path way-point, threats are allowed some constrained random motion, where their exact positions are updated and fed to the SPSO-solver. Four test scenarios are carried out using real digital elevation models. Each test gives different priorities to path length and safety, in order to show how well the SPSO-DPP is capable of generating a safe yet efficient path segments. Finally, a comparison is made to reveal the persistent overall superior performance of the SPSO, in a dynamic environment, over both the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The methods are compared directly, by averaging costs over multiple runs, and by considering different challenging levels of obstacle motion. SPSO outperformed both PSO and GA, showcasing cost re-ductions ranging from 330% to 675% compared to both algorithms.},

To solve the SLOD problem efficiently and robustly, CNDE-LS-SE, a constrained niching differential evolution algorithm, is proposed with three special efforts. First, based on employing the feasibility rule as a constraint handling technique, an information-guided strengthening evolution (IGSE) mechanism is proposed to further enhance the constraint-handling capability. IGSE is designed to perform multi-generation evolutions on inferior individuals without extra fitness evaluations, which can overcome the severe exploration stagnation issue due to a small portion of discrete feasible regions in the compact layout problem. Second, in order to maximally improve convergence speed and solution quality, an information-guided local search (IGLS) strategy is designed to select promising superior individuals for local optimization by comprehensively taking various information into consideration. Last but not least, to incorporate the multimodal property, an advanced niching method named NBC-minsize, is fulfilled to improve the efficiency of exploration and exploitation by limiting the minimum size of sub-populations and balancing the species. By comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the superiority of our proposed method on efficiency, efficacy, and robustness is demonstrated via two simplified satellite layout design cases.},

Two proposals considering fixed and incremental sampling fraction strategies are considered to reduce the cost of evaluating an individual. A memory mechanism for avoiding repeated evaluations is included. The success-history parameter adaptation for Differential Evolution (SHADE) procedure adapted to the permutational search space is applied in two additional proposals. Eighteen datasets were used for experimentation. The fixed sampling fraction proposal with the memory mechanism reached competitive accuracy results while requiring less computational time. The sampling strategies could effectively reduce the number of dataset instances used for evaluation. In addition, the memory mechanism avoids a fraction of the evaluations in the search process. The results show that two simple mechanisms can effectively decrease the computational cost of a wrapper approach for feature selection without diminishing its performance.},

  abstract  = {A free-floating space manipulator attached to a spacecraft introduces challenges in simultaneously controlling the motion of the space manipulator and its mother spacecraft&#39;s attitude. This study aims to develop a neural network-based control approach to synchronously control the space manipulator motion and spacecraft attitude, improving the control performance in trajectory tracking, error reduction and eliminating uncertainties that arise from external disturbances, high-frequency noise, oscillations and imprecise knowledge of changes in the control system. Image-based Visual Servoing (IBVS) is used to provide inputs in terms of image features of the debris to the conventional controllers such as sliding mode control (SMC) and proportional-integral-derivative (PID). SMC is used to control the motion of the space manipulator. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) provides the estimate of the spacecraft&#39;s attitude as an input to the PID controller to control the attitude. PID controller provides a feed-forward compensation to the SMC to counter spacecraft reactions to manipulator motion, while maintaining the attitude of the spacecraft. The neural network is introduced in the control strategy to enhance the performance of conventional controllers by dynamically optimising their gains and coefficients. This adaptability improves trajectory tracking accuracy, response to changes in the system and autonomy. The stability of this control approach is proven using the Lyapunov stability theorem, demonstrating a global asymptotic stability. The neural-network-based synchronous control approach is tested and validated by numerical simulations and comparative analysis in the MATLAB-Simulink environment. The results demonstrate an enhanced control performance in terms of accurate trajectory tracking, faster 100% convergence to zero error and more robustness to uncertainties. Outcomes highlight the potential of neural network-based control approaches in real-world applications that manage the free-floating space manipulators during uncooperative debris capture.},

Firstly, the algorithm utilises a dual-model management strategy, which replaces the real evaluation by constructing two models and generating deviation parameters through cross-validation. This enables the final prediction to be derived by combining the model predictions and deviation parameters. Secondly, a new optimization strategy was implemented whereby the same population of parents was selected in each generation and two candidate offspring solutions were generated using two reproduction operators, selecting the most promising as the offspring. Empirical results show that the method is competitive on a variety of benchmark problems. It can also efficiently solve expensive multi-objective optimization problems within a limited computational budget, and its performance exceeds that of other popular surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract  = {The European Green Deal has outlined ambitious near-term objectives to reduce CO 2 emissions and attain climate neutrality. Yet, effectively exploiting self-generated renewable energy within energy communities remains insufficiently explored. Energy management system aggregators often provide demand-response and ancillary services through demand-side management programs that incentivise residents using reduced energy costs or monetary compensation. However, their primary objectives of profit maximization and flexibility request satis-faction do not address the practical intricacies associated with energy self-consumption. This paper defines and formulates a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem for maximizing self-consumption within an energy community, while considering the residents&#39; welfare by maximizing satisfaction of their appliance-scheduling preferences and minimizing energy costs. We propose a Bi-level Multi-Objective Energy Management System (BiMO-EMS) based on evolutionary computation for aggregator participation in the day-ahead energy market. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that BiMO-EMS achieves a 98% approximation of the optimal solution with regards to self-consumption, while establishing a pricing scheme that offers a high-quality trade-off between the welfare-oriented objectives in terms of performance and diversity.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been successfully used for the optimization of neural networks for policy search, but they still remain sample inefficient and underperforming in some cases compared to gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL). Various methods combine the two approaches, many of them training a RL algorithm on data from EA evaluations and injecting the RL actor into the EA population. However, when using Evolution Strategies (ES) as the EA, the RL actor can drift genetically far from the the ES distribution and injection can cause a collapse of the ES performance. Here, we highlight the phenomenon of genetic drift where the actor genome and the ES population distribution progressively drift apart, leading to injection having a negative impact on the ES. We introduce Genetic Drift Regularization (GDR) 1 1 https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GDR-E784, a simple regularization method in the actor training loss that prevents the actor genome from drifting away from the ES. We show that GDR can improve ES convergence on problems where RL learns well, but also helps RL training on other tasks, fixes the injection issues better than previous controlled injection methods},

  abstract  = {Quantum-inspired optimization is an emerging computational intelligence technique that achieves quantum advan-tages through inspiration from the mechanisms of quantum properties. Parameter control is vital for optimization methods to address complex problems with extensive solution spaces. However, static parameters lack adaptability, leading to issues like premature convergence, becoming trapped in local optima, and failing to uncover the global optimum. Therefore, we develop a novel adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust parameters during algorithm execution to strike a remarkable balance between exploration and exploitation. This study first proposes the knowledge-navigated quantum-inspired tabu search (KNQTS) algorithm, which acquires insights from the ongoing process to adjust the environment-sensitive parameters adaptively and non-linearly. Differences between inter-iteration solutions can signal the extent of convergence and guide bidirectional adjustments of a parameter, facilitating the handling of com-plex optimization problems. KNQTS is applied to tackle real-world application portfolio construction problems in the financial technology field. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the substantial potential and robustness of KNQTS in rapidly identifying better solutions with higher probabilities in shorter durations compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. Statistical tests substantiate the significant superiority of KNQTS over these comparative algorithms.},

However, the unpredictable arrival of external trucks poses challenges for yard cranes in scheduling both internal loading tasks and external truck tasks simultaneously. Existing approaches on yard crane scheduling, considering uncertain arrivals, typically rely on prior knowledge, which often fails to fully capture the nature of the real-life uncertainties. In response, we propose an online scheduling approach guided by a two-stage decision model, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of uncertain arrival and has the ability to dynamically adapt to different scenarios. In the look-ahead stage, future tasks are filtered dynamically to eliminate undesired tasks, followed by a priority rule guided selection stage, where the task with the highest priority is selected. Genetic Programming (GP) is employed for automated evolution of priority rules without human intervention. Realistic experiments showcase the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic look-ahead method compared to static minimum and maximum look-ahead, as well as the superiority of GP-evolved priority rules compared to manually crafted priority rules in terms of both performance and simplicity. A comprehensive analysis of GP-evolved rules highlights GP&#39;s proficiency in problem understanding and rule extraction, comparable to human experts.},

Machine learning techniques can be applied in this context, facilitating the construction of these simulators. This work presents a simulation model based on probabilistic cellular automata capable of estimating the evolution of wood production throughout the management period. Unlike other works in the literature, the construction of the CA transition rule is based exclusively on historical data from a Tachi-branco plantation, a managed forest species. Linear and logistic regression models are applied to learn and represent the local transition rules of the automaton and simulate its evolution. The proposed CA-based approach was able to predict the future behavior of plantations in the monitored areas with errors around 4%, confirming the potential of using machine learning in discovering transition rules for precise models.},

  abstract  = {Sparse large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) that widely exist in real life are characterized by a large number of zero-valued decision variables. Detecting non-zero variables in sparse LSMOPs has recently garnered significant attention and is considered a crucial research area. However, most of the current algorithms follow an optimizing-while-detecting way, which may cause the optimization of zero variables and non-zero variables to interact with each other, hindering the evolution of the population. To this end, we suggest a two-stage optimization framework that follows a detecting-then-optimizing way. In the first stage, we propose a template perturbation to detect non-zero variables and initialize the population hierarchically by the detection results. In the second stage, we propose a simple but effective decision variable re-testing technique to correct the results of the first stage and optimize the decision variables continuously. With this two-stage optimization strategy, the cooperation between the optimizations of zero and non-zero variables can be significantly strengthened. According to the experimental results on eight benchmark problems and three real-world applications, the proposed algorithm has shown a promising performance compared with the recent peer algorithms.},

Although both the parent and archive populations should maintain good solutions, repeated generations may cause solutions in the parent population to be dominated by ones in the archive. This means that the parent population at the final generation cannot be the best solution set throughout the search. This is not problematic if the parent population, with lower optimality than the archive, is beneficial for offspring generation. However, if solutions with the highest optimality are useful for offspring generation, the archive should be used for it. This paper aims to investigate whether the parent population should always be the best non-dominated solution set. As a research methodology, this paper picks NSGA-II, NSGA-III, IBEA, NSGA-II-SDR, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ -DEA, employing the generational model and re-selecting the parent population from the archive in every certain generation to make the parent population the best. The generational interval of the re-selection is a parameter that adjusts the optimality of the parent population. The shorter the interval, the higher the optimality in the parent population. Experimental results using the knapsack problems with 2–6 objectives show that the highest parent optimality with the shortest re-selection interval maximizes the search performance for many algorithms and problems, while the highest parent optimality does not necessarily maximize the search performance for some algorithms and problems.},

In this work, we investigate FL representation by a normalized histogram of samples&#39; fitness values. The histograms are used as simple problem representations for a k-Nearest Neighbors classification to examine their ability to represent the problems. We provide a comprehensive study of classification performance on 24 single-objective benchmark problems. Especially, the impact of different sampling strategies, distance measures, and numbers of histogram bins on classification accuracy for different problems is examined. The results support the usefulness of this representation and overall approach and reveal some interesting trends.},

Structural homology between individual solutions is inferred via the exploitation of non-uniform dyadic grid structures. Social actions, including genetic crossover, are enabled by identifying nodal intersections between parent vectors in normalised time. Several alternative crossover techniques are discussed, where effectiveness is evaluated based on the likelihood of producing dominating solutions with respect to the current archive. Each technique is demonstrated and compared using a simple numerical test case representing the controlled descent of a Lunar-landing vehicle. Of the examined methods, it is found that a hybrid one/two-point crossover, biased towards higher levels of grid resolution consistently outperforms those based on more traditional, unbiased crossover.},

With the increasing complexity of EMOPs, the number of decision variables has increased from tens to hundreds or even thousands. “Curse of Dimensionality” caused by large-scale decision space poses a great challenge to current SAEAs, which require massive function evaluations (FEs). We propose an SAEA with reference vector guided variables selection, namely RVSPSO, for solving large-scale EMOPs. Specifically, the reference vector guided variable selection strategy is proposed to select critical variables for optimization, which associates reference solutions for enhancing convergence and maintaining diversity. Meanwhile, a reference guided particle swarm optimization is proposed as the optimizer, where the velocities of particles are updated according to the directions pointing from the particles to the reference solution. This update strategy aims to accelerate the convergence rate in large-scale decision space. Moreover, radial basis function networks are used as surrogate models for efficient optimization. Experiments are conducted on large-scale EMOPs with up to 2000 decision variables. Experiment results show the proposed RVSPSO can effectively solve large-scale EMOPs to obtain well-converged and diverse solutions with limited FEs, compared with five state-of-the-art SAEAs.},

This model combines the advantages of CNN-LSTM in extracting multivariate feature sequences and PSO in hyper-parametric global optimization.

  abstract  = {Dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) exhibit variations in constraints, decision parameter quantities, and the number of objectives over time, leading to changes in their optimal solutions. Prediction-based methods currently stand as the prevailing paradigm for handling DMOPs. Implicit correlations among solutions ob-tained at consecutive time steps while solving DMOPs con-tinuously can guide predictions for future time increments in the time series. Most existing methods rely on a single linear or nonlinear model to capture the correlations of historical optimal solutions. However, a linear model struggles with the nonlinear scenario, and using a nonlinear model to fit the linear relationship of the historical optimal solutions increases the training time because the nonlinear model has more parameters. This paper proposes a novel framework for time series ensemble prediction based on correlation type detection TSEPFCTD. The framework leverages correlation type detection strategy to identify the autocorrelation types in the time series of historical solutions. Subsequently, distinct prediction models are applied for different types, enhancing prediction accuracy. We implement this prediction framework on MOEA/D-DE, constructing a novel algorithm for solving DMOPs. Experimental results on a series of test suites demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in providing robust solution outcomes.},

Those algorithms often exhibit a strong convergence capability on the instances of LSMOP test suite. The purpose of this study is to show our concern that the development of algorithms may be over specialized for the LSMOP test suite. We first explain some issues in the original LSMOP test suite. Then, we propose a general LSMOP test suite (termed GLSMOP), in which the Pareto set has a more general structure in the decision space. Experimental results on two test suites suggest that the performance of some large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms will be deteriorated rapidly by the change of Pareto set.

A convenient and effective decision-making task can be achieved with well-represented Pareto solutions and by means of user-friendly and easily comprehensible visualization tools. To have a comprehensive idea of the spread of Pareto solutions obtained by evolutionary multi-criterion optimization (EMO) or other algorithms, each Pareto solution can be associated with a unique identifier - a vector of size of the dimension of the Pareto surface. While the Pareto solutions can lie on an arbitrary surface with non-domination properties but having its shape and size largely dependent on the problem being solved, these identifiers can have much simpler properties, such as lying on a unit simplex or a unit sphere, or directly relating to preference values. Once achieved, these unique identifiers can help EMO algorithms evaluate the extent of the spread of solutions during the optimization process and decision-makers to have a better understanding of trade-offs among solutions to make better decisions. Moreover, apparent gaps or other complexities of the obtained Pareto solutions can be more easily located in the identifier space. In this paper, we present and compare five identifiers - ideal point reference vectors (RV), nadir point RVs, projection RVs, pseudo-weights, and angle vectors - with respect to their advantages and disadvantages in decision-making and visualization purposes. We also demonstrate that, if desired by the decision maker, these alternative identifiers can be used during optimization to achieve a good distribution of solutions in this space.},

However, designs synthesized through automated optimization often result in ill-defined shapes, which render such designs impractical for engineering design applications. We present the first end-to-end prompt evolution design optimization (PREDO) framework contextualized in a vehicle design scenario that leverages a vision-language model to penalize impractical car designs synthesized by a generative model. The backbone of our framework is an evolutionary strategy coupled with an optimization objective function that comprises a physics-based solver and a vision-language model for practical or functional guidance in the generated car designs. In the prompt evolution search, the optimizer iteratively generates a population of text prompts, which embed user specifications on the aerodynamic performance and visual preferences of the 3D car designs. Then, in addition to the computational fluid dynamics simulations, the pre-trained vision-language model is used to penalize impractical designs and, thus, foster the evolutionary algorithm to seek more viable designs. Our investigations on a car design optimization problem show a wide spread of potential car designs generated at the early phase of the search, which indicates a good diversity of designs in the initial populations, and an increase of over 20 % in the probability of generating practical designs compared to a baseline framework without using a vision-language model. Visual inspection of the designs against the performance results demonstrates prompt evolution as a very promising paradigm for finding novel designs with good optimization performance while providing ease of use in specifying design specifications and preferences via a natural language interface.},

However, although most training-free score functions can dramatically accelerate the speed of a neural architecture evaluation, a certain number of misjudgments for neural architectures may still occur during the process of neural architecture search (NAS). To address this problem, this paper presents a new training-free score function and genetic algorithm to evaluate a neural architecture for NAS, called genetic algorithm for lightweight training-free neural architecture search (GALTNAS). The training-free score function proposed here will not only take into account the number of parameters and convolution layers of a neural architecture, but it also takes less computation costs than other training-free score functions. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with other state-of-the-art training-free and non-training-free NAS algorithms. The experimental results show that GALTNAS outperforms all the other NASs in terms of the accuracy and computational cost for complex search spaces. The results also show that GALTNAS can provide a 10% improvement in accuracy compared to other non-weight-sharing, weight-sharing, and training-free methods.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the Vehicle Routing Problem, with its variants handling complex realistic constraints, continues to be a key area of research, reflecting its enduring importance in modernized societies. Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to the variant with the flexibility of customer demands. This paper introduces the problem of addressing the integration of drones into the existing transportation system to maximize the profit of distributing freight during a limited working time by allowing flexibility in the delivered quantity. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation and a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the problem. To assess the proposed algorithm, we create the benchmark instances of the problem from published data sources. Experimental results on the instances show a significantly better performance of our proposal than MILP. Moreover, we evaluate our approach by comparing its performance with existing solutions in published closely related works.},

  abstract  = {The heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem (HFVRP) is of great significance in logistics and transportation. This paper considers a crucial and challenging HFVRP variant, namely multi-objective fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with unlimited fleet, fixed cost, and dependent cost (MO-FSMVRPFD). A decomposition-based memetic algorithm called MOEA/D-ALS is proposed to cope with MO-FSMVRPFD. MOEA/D-ALS uses the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) as the backbone. Beyond that, it adopts a replacement strategy based on maximal fitness improvement (MFI). In addition, the local search is conducted on difficult subproblems for further refinement. The experimental studies on 18 instances show that MOEA/D-ALS exhibits a significant performance superiority over two other representative algorithms. The effectiveness of both the MFI strategy and the adaptive local search procedure is also validated.},

This study introduces a novel marine propeller optimization approach. It decomposes the optimization process and proposes a new fitness function to overcome previous limitations. Based on two continuous optimization algorithms, the approach was compared to the state-of-the-art differential evolution algorithm. Results from ferry-boat propeller design experiments show the proposed approach achieves approximately 1% higher efficiency than the baseline study at 7.0 and 7.5-knot speeds. The proposed approach succeeds at 8.0 and 8.5 knots, where the baseline failed. Additionally, decomposition reduces execution time by executing in six threads.},

  abstract  = {A common aim in real-world optimisation problems is to seek a solution offering highest performance on expected scenarios, but at the same time guaranteeing an at least acceptable performance on worst-case scenarios. Competitive coevolution evolves a population of solutions alongside a population of difficult scenarios in order to find so-called robust solutions. However, solutions with maximal worst-case performance often exhibit poor performance on more typical scenarios. Existing coevolutionary approaches generally favour such solutions over ones which sacrifice only a small amount of average performance for an almost as large gain in worst-case performance, despite the latter being favourable in most practical applications. We present a new coevolutionary algorithm which treats average performance and worst-case performance as two objectives of a bicriteria optimisation problem and seeks the corresponding Pareto front. Such an algorithm enables the discovery of solutions with strong performance in both of these metrics, which would otherwise be rejected if optimising for only one. Our algorithm constitutes the first coevolutionary approach to this solution concept. We also provide experimental results on the performance of this algorithm on the design of smart controllers for the management of energy flow between buildings, renewable energy sources, and electric vehicles.},

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems. However, two main limitations are commonly pointed out. The first one is that they require long time to design. The other is that they heavily rely on labelled data, which can sometimes be costly and hard to obtain. In order to address the first problem, neuroevolution has been proved to be a plausible option to automate the design of DNNs. As for the second problem, self-supervised learning has been used to leverage unlabelled data to learn representations. Our goal is to study how neuroevolution can help self-supervised learning to bridge the gap to supervised learning in terms of performance. In this work, we propose a framework that is able to evolve deep neural networks using self-supervised learning. Our results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that it is possible to evolve adequate neural networks while reducing the reliance on labelled data. Moreover, an analysis to the structure of the evolved networks suggests that the amount of labelled data fed to them has less effect on the structure of networks that learned via self-supervised learning, when compared to individuals that relied on supervised learning.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have achieved remarkable success in tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems. However, EAs often demand carefully-designed operators with the aid of domain expertise to achieve satisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first study on large language models (LLMs) as evolutionary combinatorial optimizers. The main advantage is that it requires minimal domain knowledge and human efforts, as well as no additional training of the model. This approach is referred to as LLM-driven EA (LMEA). Specifically, in each generation of the evolutionary search, LMEA instructs the LLM to select parent solutions from current population, and perform crossover and mutation to generate offspring solutions. Then, LMEA evaluates these new solutions and include them into the population for the next generation. LMEA is equipped with a self-adaptation mechanism that controls the temperature of the LLM. This enables it to balance between exploration and exploitation and prevents the search from getting stuck in local optima. We investigate the power of LMEA on the classical traveling salesman problems (TSPs) widely used in combinatorial optimization research. Notably, the results show that LMEA performs competitively to traditional heuristics in finding high-quality solutions on TSP instances with up to 20 nodes. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of LLM-driven crossover/mutation and the self- adaptation mechanism in evolutionary search. In summary, our results reveal the great potentials of LLMs as evolutionary optimizers for solving combinatorial problems. We hope our research shall inspire future explorations on LLM-driven EAs for complex optimization challenges.},

The main challenge of RES is the uncertainty caused by parameters such as irradiation, wind velocity, or temperature. In this connection, Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) Algorithms can be used as an intelligent control system for a microgrid by ensuring continuity of power supply in case of grid failures. Based on grid reliability and local demand, MOO can make real-time decisions about disconnecting from the primary grid (islanding) and when to reconnect. It can help in MG control systems by optimizing energy storage systems (ESS) operation by determining when to charge and discharge them based on electricity prices, grid demand, and renewable energy availability. This survey discusses an MG and its different challenges with RES with Photovoltaic (PV) as a primary component and prominent energy sources such as a utility grid, Diesel Genset (DG), Wind Turbine (WT) and ESS. In this research, a unique classification approach of different problems in Microgrid (MG) is identified and discussed. This paper focuses on the MOO algorithms used in MG for their energy management systems (EMS) and technical and economic problems and investigates how MOO can play a significant role in solving such problems.},

However, the design of efficient surrogate-based optimizers remains challenging due to the difficulty of constructing surrogate models suitable for the permutation spaces. This paper presents a random forest-assisted local search algorithm for solving expensive PCOPs. Our main motivation for using a random forest model is, in the integer space, to build a surrogate model that learns various important substructures of permutations. In the proposed algorithm, permutation-based solutions are treated as integer vectors in training random forest regression models for the objective function. Then, a population-based local search is performed on the obtained models. Experimental results on benchmark problems with limited budgets of function evaluations show that the proposed algorithms are competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms adapted to expensive PCOPs. This observation suggests that surrogate models trained on the integer representation can be effective for estimating the quality of permutation-based solutions.},

Since traditional Pareto-dominance-based multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) prioritize the convergence of individuals through Pareto dominated sorting, several well-distributed individuals might be dominated by other well-converged individuals during the optimization process of MMOPs. In order to solve this problem, we propose a coevolutionary algorithm that extracts and utilizes the features of multiple populations to preserve diversity. The proposed algorithm simultaneously explores different regions of the decision space through multi-population coevolution and controls the cross-learning behavior among sub-populations. The cross-learning is conducted through a feature weight vector which maintain the characteristics of multiple populations and preserve the diversity of the decision space. Meanwhile, the assignment and merging methods are designed to adaptively adjust the scales of sub-populations to speed up the convergence. The experimental results show that the introduction of the feature weight vector is effective in maintaining the distribution of the decision space, and the proposed algorithm is competitive with other representative MMEAs.},

  abstract  = {Multi-label classification is an emerging research area that aims to assign multiple class labels to each object or instance. In the era of big data, numerous multi-label problems, such as gene function prediction, involve a large number of labels, which most multi-label algorithms cannot cope with. One approach to reduce the number of labels is to construct a small set of new labels. However, creating new labels poses the challenge of preserving label meanings. This work proposes to decrease the number of labels by selecting a small subset of original labels, referred to as label selection, which preserves the original label meanings. Since label selection is a discrete optimisation problem with a large search space, we employ evolutionary computation (EC), specifically differential evolution, to achieve label selection. The contribution of this work lies in establishing a foundation for EC-based label selection, encompassing representation, fitness function, and the testing process. Experimental results demon-strate that the proposed evolutionary label selection algorithm significantly reduces the number of labels while maintaining or even improving performance compared to using all labels. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits high stability in terms of classification performance and the selected labels.},

Its accuracy directly depends on the quality of the pubic bone trait labeling developed by the forensic practitioners, affected by an inherent uncertainty in their definition. As interpretability is a mandatory requirement, we propose an approach where the model design is based on evolutionary learning, considering genetic programming to frame the problem as a symbolic regression task. Additionally, ensemble learning is considered to address the challenges posed by noise, uncertainty, and conflicting annotations inherent in data collected from multiple subjects. Ensemble learning provides an effective approach to navigate these challenges by facilitating consensus-building through decision making and information fusion. Hence, observer committees are formed, comprising multiple forensic specialists with different skills and expertise which provide alternative annotations. Several ensemble configurations combining different weak learners and aggregation operators are tested to assess their effectiveness in improving accuracy and reliability in age-at-death predictions. Their performance is compared against models trained on single annotations, revealing an improvement in predictive accuracy. The obtained results also highlight the benefits of incorporating diverse perspectives to address the complexities associated with human variability and anatomical assessments.},

  abstract  = {Computational creativity is an emerging topic in artificial intelligence area. Past studies have shown the effectiveness of deep learning methods for image generation. Contrast to simple image generation, it is more practical to generate images according to specific description, known as text-to-image generation. However, text-to-image generation is much more difficult than simple image generation as it may involve natural language processing for semantic retrieval, learning mapping between images to semantics, and learning image generator. This study proposes an evolutionary framework for language-free text-to-image generation. There are three main features in the proposed framework. First, the framework bases on language-free model for image generation, which purifies the text-to-image generation problem as an optimization problem over a learnt image generator. Second, the use of language-free model simplifies the requirements of data preparation and learning process. Third, in the proposed framework an objective function is designed for improving the quality of the generated images in terms of both photo realisticness and semantic consistency. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in text-to-image generation on different scenarios, in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This study further provides and examines the possibility for the proposed framework on image manipulation as a potential application. This study also discusses the designed operators and hyper-parameters and provides guidelines for the settings.},

Distribution Indicators (DIs) assess the distribution of a PFA numerically, utilizing concepts like distance calculation, Biodiversity, Entropy, Potential Energy, or Clustering. Despite the diversity of DIs, their strengths and weaknesses across assessment scenarios are not well-understood. This paper introduces a taxonomy for classifying DIs, followed by a preference analysis of nine DIs, each representing a category in the taxonomy. Experimental results, considering various PFAs under controlled scenarios (loss of coverage, loss of uniformity, pathological distributions), reveal that some DIs can be misleading and need cautious use. Additionally, DIs based on Biodiversity and Potential Energy are promising for PFA evaluation and comparison of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms.},

Various risk preferences of investors should be considered to accommodate their investment choices, thereby introducing multi-objective portfolio optimization. This study utilizes an innovative and accurate evaluation model, the trend ratio (TR), to assess return and risk and construct a multi-objective optimization (MOO) model. Within a huge search space, computational intelligence techniques achieve high-performance computing through effective nature-inspired computing. The proposed TR-based MOO quantum-inspired model with an entanglement-enhanced local search (EL) mech-anism can search for Pareto optimal solutions (POSs) in global investment markets. The experimental results demonstrate that the TR-based EL mechanism effectively achieves a larger number of POSs and improves efficient frontiers to meet the different risk profiles of investors across global markets. A visualized Pareto front (PF) of the TR model helps a user identify a more straightforward return and risk balance evaluation, helping investors make informed decisions. The entanglement-simulated local search mechanism has been proven to improve the search for a better PF significantly. The TR-based, quantum-inspired MOO portfolio strategy search has paved the way for flexible solutions in global financial networks.},

  abstract  = {Multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (MMOPs) present a specific category of multiobjective problems. Unlike conventional multiobjective problems where Pareto opti-mal solutions gather in one or few regions in the decision space, MMOPs aim to find solutions spread across various regions. In particular, these solutions may share similar locations in objective space, making the problem more complex and challenging. Most multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) barely preserve diversity in decision space, whereas multimodal multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) require additional techniques such as clustering to maintain diversity in the decision space. In this study, we propose a new method that enables two sub populations and a clustering technique for diversity preservation. Furthermore, different clustering methods are compared to investigate their impact on performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better inverted generational distance in decision space (IGDX), indicating the effectiveness of the diversity preservation approach. In addition, the varying IGDX and inverted generational distance (IGD) obtained from different clustering methods reveal their different strengths in solving MMOPs.},

The outcome allows the creation of virtual stitched views from multiple video sources, being as important for practical applications as numerical accuracy.

Recent GPSR methods employ Pearson correlation coefficient for fitness assessment with post-hoc linear scaling for coefficient learning. However, this approach often leads to sub-optimal coefficient learning and inadequate consideration of nonlinear relationships between input variables and outputs. To solve those issues, this study introduces an innovative approach to integrating the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) into GPSR. Unlike Pearson correlation, CCC can effectively assess both linear and non-linear agreements between two sets of variables. Experimental results on eight regression datasets highlight the potential of CCC as a promising fitness function for GPSR without the need of a more advanced coefficient optimisation method for linear scaling.},

Furthermore, in addition to the best per-spective, the decision maker may consider multiple perspectives, such as the next best perspective. In this paper, we propose a method for revealing implicit emphasized criteria for the decision maker on social issues, visualizing multiple perspectives such as the best perspective and the next best perspective of the decision maker, and output multiple perspectives. After the decision maker confirms the effect and influence of the measure, the proposed method generates a distribution, defined as a Goodness distribution, that indicates whether the measure is good or bad. Thus using the Goodness distribution, the method reveals implicit emphasized criteria for the decision maker, visualizes multiple important perspectives for the decision maker, and presents the effective measure.},

  abstract  = {The Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSSP) represents an extension of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), in which the sequence of operations on assigned machines has to be optimized. In the FJSSP, operations can be processed by different machines, with different processing times on each machine type. The paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) variant that uses an encoding capable to be applied to as general FJSSP instances as possible and variation principles designed to maintain a population of feasible candidate solutions over the whole search process. Additionally, the GA parameter setting for each FJSSP instance is derived from problem-specific attributes, such as the production environments flexibility and the variety of duration values, and a restart scheme that accounts for the dissimilarity of the initial population is introduced to avoid premature convergence. The GA results are compared to best- known solutions in literature as well as to the solutions of the commercial solver GUROBI being applied to a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) representation of the FJSSP. In addition to demonstrating the decent results of the developed GA on 402 recognized FJSSP benchmark instances, the paper investigates the influence of different aspects of problem complexity on the relative GA performance to assert the GAs viability for more complex FJSSP variants Including uncertainties. Regardless of the machine flexibility of a FJSSP instance, the experimental results suggest that both approaches tie on smaller and medium sized problem instances. With increasing complexity in problem characteristics like problem size, flexibility, and duration variety, the GA gains advantage over the MILP/GUROBI approach. The observation substantiates the expectation that the proposed GA is well suited for practical (more realistic) scheduling problems with additional requirements like worker flexibility or uncertainty effects.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this paper is to show the possibility of generating general semi-stable periodic orbits using genetic programming (GP). This concept is a GP design of a perturbation sequence that forces a defined dynamical system to behave periodically. Recall that periodic orbits in deterministic chaotic systems are trajectories along which the system moves at regular intervals. Despite the chaotic nature of these systems, periodic orbits represent the repetition of certain states of the system over time. In chaotic systems, these orbits are usually surrounded by complex, irregular trajectories, but are themselves defined by regularity and predictability. We should add that periodic orbits are important to chaos theory because they provide a basis for understanding the internal structure of chaotic systems. Although chaos is defined by unpredictability based on initial conditions and the complexity, these periodic orbits represent islands of predictability that can be analyzed and modeled. GP and its symbolic regression capability is an ideal tool for finding both stable periodic orbits defined by stable points and general periodic orbits that rebuild attractive periodic states for the system. The objective function is also crucial for finding periodic orbits using GP. This function has been designed to achieve stable regions as well as the possibility of choosing the degree of the orbital. The test problem will consist of four systems of deterministic chaos, the so-called chaotic maps - the logistic map, the Henon map, the Lozi map and the Burgers map.},

FLPSO defines four primary states: exploration, exploitation, convergence, and escaping state. In the convergence state, an elite learning strategy is incorporated to help the algorithm escape potential local optima by targeting the global best particle. To validate the efficacy of FLPSO, the paper conducted experiments on 30 different characteristic test functions from CEC2017.

Although Metaheuristics (MHs) have proven effective in tackling this complex design challenge due to their robust characteristics, no single MH consistently delivers superior per-formance across all scenarios. The study explores the feasibility of an Automated Metaheuristic Design strategy, employing a hyper-heuristic search to develop a population-based, metaphor-free MH specifically for the MTMP. Various scenarios are assessed by varying the heat sink design specifications and benchmarking the custom MH designs against several state-of-the-art MHs. The findings of this preliminary work provide statistical evidence that the tailored MHs surpass the performance of established MHs in these scenarios. A toolkit of MH components is assembled, which can be customized to construct MHs specifically for MTMPs.

Different optimization approaches offer different strengths that are good at tackling one or more difficulty in an optimization problem. For instance, evolutionary algorithms have a niche in handling complexities like discontinuity, non-differentiability, discreteness and non-convexity. However, evolutionary algorithms may get computationally expensive for mathematically well behaved problems with large number of variables for which classical mathematical programming approaches are better suited. In this paper, we demonstrate a decomposition strategy that allows us to synergistically apply two complementary approaches at the same time on a complex optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms are useful in this context as their flexibility makes pairing with other solution approaches easy. The decomposition idea is a special case of bilevel optimization that separates the difficulties into two levels and assigns different approaches at each level that is better equipped at handling them. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed decomposition idea on a wide range of test problems.},

This paper tries to develop a rational and effective intervention strategy in response to the dynamic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. To address this issue, we first use the SEIR model to analyze the population distribution under the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, and then integrate a deep Q-neural network (DQN) to reflect an economic quantification model contextualized within the SARS-CoV-2 scenario. Next, we propose an evolutionary deep reinforcement learning to generate an optimal and adaptive intervention strategy, by optimizing the weight sequence of the DQN. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in maximizing economic benefits, while ensuring the uninterrupted functionality of medical institutions. Importantly, the learned intervention strategy exhibits the applicability to other infectious diseases.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people worldwide, with the number expected to rise in the future. As a consequence, early diagnosis and treatments are crucial aspects. Current diagnostic methods, such as clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic data, have limitations in terms of cost, invasiveness, and availability. Hand-writing analysis has been proposed as a non-invasive and cost-effective alternative for tracking disease progression and machine learning methods have been used to discriminate between healthy and diseased subjects based on handwriting dynamics. However, collecting patient data is still a challenging task. Nevertheless, these issues can be tackled using one-class classifiers, which need only samples produced by healthy subjects to recognize samples drawn by patients. The paper proposes two variants of the Negative Selection Algorithm for the diagnosis of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, i.e., RNSA-VR and RNSA-DE, which make use of detectors endowed with variable radii. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the largest dataset present in literature, i.e., the DARWIN dataset, has been used, which includes handwriting tasks executed by 174 subjects and the data were split in such a way to reproduce a data scarcity scenario, quite different from the one usually adopted for performance evaluation in classification experiments.},

  abstract  = {In surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary al-gorithms (SAMOEAs), approximation and classification models are frequently employed to screen candidate solutions, but there is a tradeoff between both models in terms of the model accuracy and the screening capacity. This tradeoff is highlighted especially when the problem dimension increases, making SAMOEAs difficult to solve high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a dual surrogate-based SAMOEA for solving high-dimensional expensive multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm, called DSEAID, is designed to adaptively select either approximation models or classification models dependent on the model accuracy. Compared to existing algorithms which use both approximation and classification models simultaneously, DSEAID possesses a robust framework against the deterioration of the model accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark problems with up to 150 decision variables show that our dual surrogate-based framework is effective in addressing high-dimensional problems. Moreover, we show DSEAID is competitive with state-of-the-art SAMOEAs.},

  abstract  = {Patch-based attacks are a major black-box attack paradigm, where there is no limit to the intensity of the perturbation. The existing patch-based attack methods focus on obtaining the optimal position, shape, and pixel values against adversarial patches, however, the generated patch looks conspicuous and makes it easy to attract people&#39;s attention. Quick response(QR) code has been widely used in various fields, such as image copyright protection, stored image information. Further, it does not get noticed when a QR code is attached to the image. Therefore, we propose a deceptive texture-based black-box adversarial attack method to address the above problem. Specifically, we use the QR code pattern as the basis of the adversarial patches. Then, we model the adversarial attack as a discrete optimization problem, where the optimization variables are designed as the center coordinates of the patch pasting locations and the pixel values. Further, an upsampling technique is introduced to reduce the dimension of the optimization variables. Finally, genetic algorithm is employed as the optimizer to obtain the optimal parameter of the patch. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare a number of the state-of-the-art patch-based attack methods on the ImageNet dataset, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively generate deceptive adversarial examples in both digital and physical space and obtain the best attack performance, especially for the defense models.},

  abstract  = {The widespread use of machine learning (ML) in software engineering (SE) encounters a notable challenge: the need for various domain-specific parameters in algorithms. The issue arises when attempting to reuse these parameters across different applications, resulting in sub-optimal outcomes. This hindrance significantly contributes to the limited migration of ML solutions from research labs to industrial settings. This paper underscores the pressing need for novel research to tackle the overarching problem of generic algorithm customisation. To address this, we propose leveraging Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approaches. These techniques automatically select intelligible models and their corresponding hyper-parameters for forecasting software defect-proneness. More specifically, this paper adapts an AutoML approach to the field of software defect prediction, namely a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for automatically designing decision tree algorithms (HEAD-DT), originally proposed to address a generic optimisation problem. We benchmark against the popular general software defect-proneness prediction framework (GSDP) and some standard classifiers. Experimental results reveal that the proposed HEAD-DT implementation surpasses other algorithms across three distinct evaluation measures.},

Conversely, the neural network showed commendable efficacy in general domain scenarios, with an average error of 8.25 %. Notably, in both instances, the average error remained below the 10% threshold, aligning closely with the uncertainty inherent in the measured data and the execution of real large-scale jobs.

However, there is a limitation in that the accuracy reduces as the lesion size decreases. Then, we assumed that using 2D images generated by multiscale patch sampling and minimum projection onto an orthogonal triplane, a deep learning model for 2D images used in general image recognition could detect small lesions with high accuracy. When the detection sensitivity of the proposed method was compared with that of the previous study&#39;s single scale equivalent by adjusting the false positive to be roughly 25 lesions per case, the detection sensitivity of the proposed method was higher, with an 0.72.

Consequently, it is usually computationally very expensive to solve bilevel optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a bilevel evolutionary algorithm based on upper-level-driven lower-level search (BLEA-UDLS). Driven by the upper-level optimization, the lower-level search in BLEA-UDLS is carried out on some upper-level superior solutions rather than equally and indiscriminately on all solutions, which makes sure that the front solutions of the population have more accurate lower-level decisions and saves lots of evaluation budgets on less important solutions. In the lower-level search, the lower-level decisions of different solutions are optimized cooperatively with the computation resources dynamically adjusted, where more computation resources are assigned for less explored solutions. Compared with some other bilevel evolutionary algorithms, the experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed BLEA-UDLS for solving BLOPs and meanwhile saving evaluation budgets.},

  abstract  = {Supervised machine learning techniques include classification and regression. In regression, the objective is to map a real-valued output to a set of input features. The main challenge that existing methods for regression encounter is how to maintain an accuracy-simplicity balance. Since Regression Trees (RTs) are simple to interpret, many existing works have focused on proposing RT and Model Tree (MT) induction algorithms. MTs are RTs with a linear function at the leaf nodes rather than a numerical value are able to describe the relationship between the inputs and the output. Traditional RT induction algorithms are based on a top-down strategy which often leads to a local optimal solution. Other global approaches based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proposed to induce RTs but they can require an important calculation time which may affect the convergence of the algorithm to the solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Bi-level Evolutionary Model Tree Induction algorithm for regression, that we call BEMTI, and which is able to induce an MT in a bi-level design using an EA. The upper-level evolves a set of MTs using genetic operators while the lower-level optimizes the Linear Models (LMs) at the leaf nodes of each MT in order to fairly and precisely compute their fitness and obtain the optimal MT. The experimental study confirms the outperformance of our BEMTI compared to six existing tree induction algorithms on nineteen datasets.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks (DNN) has achieved great successes across multiple domains. In recent years, a number of approaches have emerged on automatically finding the optimal DNN configurations. A technique among these approaches which show great promise is Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which are based on observations from natural, biological processes. However, since the EA needs to evaluate multiple DNN candidates, and if the training time for a DNN is large, then the required time would be very large. A potential solution is to use Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithm (SAEA), in which a surrogate model is used to predict performance of DNNs without training. It is noted that all popular surrogate models in the literature require a fixed-length input, while encodings of a DNN are usually variable-length, since a DNN structure is very complex and its depths, sizes, etc. cannot be known beforehand. In this paper, we propose a novel surrogate model for variable-length encoding to optimise deep learning architecture. An encoder-decoder model is used to convert the variable-length encoding into a fixed-length representation, which is used as inputs to the surrogate model to predict the DNN performance without training. The weights of the encoder-decoder model are found via training on the variable-length data, with the targets being the same as the inputs, while the surrogate model is trained on the encoder output in the encoder-decoder model. In this study, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is used as the encoder and decoder. Our proposed variable-length encoding based surrogate model is tested on a well-known method which evolves optimal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental results show that our proposed method has competitive performance while significantly reducing the time of optimisation process.},

  abstract  = {Network slicing is an essential technology in 5G and the forthcoming 6G networks. It aims to embed multiple virtual networks, i.e., network slices, on top of a shared substrate network to meet diverse service requirements. While a considerable body of existing research strives to maximize overall profits by meeting the resource demands of the network slices, optimizing their reliability is frequently overlooked. In this paper, we formalize the network slicing problem as a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to maximize total profits and reliability of network slices. To tackle this problem, we propose a new multi-objective optimization approach that improves over the state-of-the-art algorithm, which can achieve good approximate Pareto front results balancing total profits and reliability of network slices. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated on both artificial and real-world network topologies. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to the baseline algorithm, outperforming the latter in 92% of instances in terms of the Hypervolume (HV) metric.},

  abstract  = {In the face of a series of challenging control tasks, multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated its superiority. However, it suffers from certain drawbacks like deceptive reward functions, unstable training processes, and a lack of exploration for novel policies. To address these issues, the combination of evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning has been introduced, as evolutionary algorithms possess good exploration and convergence properties, enabling reinforcement learning to better leverage its performance. To enhance the complementary advantages of evolutionary algorithms and reinforcement learning, we combine them into an asymmetric reinforcement learning framework by utilizing a shared observation encoder, allowing the algorithm&#39;s performance to break through certain bottlenecks. In addition to the consideration of reward, we propose the concept of policy novelty, which measures the degree of difference between a policy&#39;s behavior and others. Consequently, the training of multiple agents is formulated as a large-scale bi-objective optimization problem, and solved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The proposed approach is tested on eight experimental tasks within the MA-MuJoCo framework, exhibiting superiority over commonly used approaches.},

  abstract  = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently received increasing attention, however, optimizing the loss function of PINNs is notoriously difficult, where the landscape of the loss function is often highly non-convex and rugged. Local optimization methods based on gradient information can converge quickly but are prone to being trapped in local minima for training PINNs. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are well known for the global search ability, which can help escape from local minima. It has been reported in the literature that EAs show some advantages over gradient-based methods in training PINNs. Inspired by the Memetic Algorithm, we combine global-search based EAs and local-search based batch gradient descent in order to make the best of both word. In addition, since the PINN loss function is composed of multiple terms, balancing these terms is also a challenging issue. Therefore, we also attempt to combine EAs with multiple-gradient descent algorithm for multi-objective optimization. Our experiments provide strong evidence for the superiority of the above algorithms.},

In this paper, we further demonstrate the versatility and applicability of the SOS concept across diverse domains, focusing on three real-world problems: engineering design problems, inventory management problems, and hyperparameter optimization problems. Additionally, as evolutionary multitasking has proven effective in generating the SOS, we investigate the performance of current evolutionary multitasking methods on these real-world problems. Subsequently, we present visualizations of the generated SOS in both decision and objective spaces, complemented by the development of a measurement to gauge the similarity between different Pareto sets corresponding to diverse tasks. Finally, we show that by systematically examining the shifts in Pareto optimal designs across different task settings though the SOS solutions, users can gain deeper understandings on the dynamic interplay between design solutions and their performance in different settings or contexts.},

In this paper, we perform a comprehensive and systematic analysis on a multi-turn interaction dataset known as SParC to compare various existing prompt engineering methods, including prompt representations and in-context learning methods. Following this, we present GAT-SQL, a novel prompt engineering approach based on three techniques: GAT representation, GAT reviser, and GAT verifier. Comparing our GAT representation and GAT verifier techniques to the previous methods of prompt engineering, they were very successful for the zero-shot experiments. GAT representations improve performance by an average of 2.9% EX and 3.8% IX across all existing question representation methods. While GAT verifier results in a greater improvement in accuracy by an average of 3.6% EX and 4% IX. Furthermore, with regard to in-context learning experiments, the GAT reviser achieved 77.4% EX and 59.9% IX, outperforming the best state-of-the-art model by 3.4% EX and 6.4% IX. As a further demonstration of the effectiveness of GAT-SQL, we tested it on another dataset of multi-turn interactions named CoSQL. GAT reviser achieved a new benchmark in the CoSQL competition, achieving 74.5% EX and 50.2% IX, higher than the closest baseline by 6.3% EX and 9.7% IX.},

The state-of-the-art cancer genomics profiling characterized many clinically and biologically relevant patterns that are not resolvable by morphology nor distinguishable under the microscope for cancer diagnosis. With that genomic information, doctors can develop an individualized treatment plan for cancer patients and provide precision medicine. However, several technical challenges (such as low tumor purity, batch effects and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue restoration) potentially led to ambiguous diagnoses that needed to be solved in the clinical setting. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust tumor classification framework to improve cancer diagnosis and provide Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based interpretable results with increased transparency model interpretability of the classification. We utilized a large set of over six thousand tumor samples (DNA methylation and gene expression) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We implemented realistic variable selection by separating the training and test datasets and removed artificial and technical sources of variabilities to overcome batch effect issues while identifying the biological variation and making the prediction meaningful and robust. The Random Forest classifier produced about 95 and 96% accuracy for mRNA and methylation-based models respectively with minimum features of 50 methylation probes and gene expression signatures. We further developed an XAI strategy and applied it to a large brain cancer patient group to make an explainable patient-specific decision while tailoring the provided recommendations based on each patient&#39;s characteristics. This strategy demonstrates more accurate and practical molecular subtype classification with explainable AI for model interpretation.},

  abstract  = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have emerged as highly effective strategies in the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases. mRNA design, a key to the success of mRNA vaccines, in-volves finding optimal codons and increasing secondary structure stability to lengthen mRNA half-life, ultimately enhancing protein expression. Despite receiving widespread attention, most methods primarily rely on manual design, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. While optimization approaches can alleviate this issue, existing methods still exhibit critical limitations caused by conflicts between codon usage and mRNA structural stability, compounded by the vast design space of mRNA resulting from the presence of synonymous codons. In this paper, a novel multi-objective evolutionary optimization-based mRNA design method is proposed. We first formulate the mRNA design problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and then develop an Elite Archive-Assisted Multi-Objective Evolutionary algorithm for mRNA Design, namely EAA-MOED, by incorporating a novel elite archive-assisted method into a weighted optimization framework to improve search efficiency. Experimental studies, involving two state-of-the-art mRNA design methods and five well-known MOEAs, show the competitiveness of the proposed EAA-MOED in mRNA design.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) has been the most common cause of dementia making cognitive score prediction and important feature identification crucial for its diagnosis. Although sparse linear regression has been used for this purpose due to its simplicity, it often selects an excessive number of features to track the disease and assumes a linear relationship between input and output, which might not always hold. To address these limitations, genetic programming-based symbolic regression (GPSR) algorithms have been proposed. GPSR can select the important features by exploring the feature space and learning a regression model without any assumption of model structure. However, the generalization ability of existing GPSR methods still needs to be improved. Considering the multiple related prediction tasks in AD studies, this work proposes a new method called linear scaled GPSR with multi-task feature selection (LSGPMTFS), to promote the prediction performance of each task by knowledge-sharing among multiple tasks. LSGPMTFS has two stages. The first stage learns a specific feature subset for each task. In the second stage, the model for each task is searched on the union of feature subsets selected from the first stage. The experimental results on authentic AD datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can select a small set of important features with better learning and generalization performance compared with other GPSR methods.},

Although some multi-modal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) have been designed to solve this problem, their search capabilities are weak. This paper designs a new MMOEA named BIMOEA. It uses improved local convergence fitness for environment selection, in which the distances between an individual and its neighbors are used to average the number of times that this individual is dominated. This improvement can reduce the occurrence probability of the same fitness and enhances the algorithm&#39;s ability to screen individuals. In addition, a new crowding distance calculation method is designed to promote population diversity in decision space. It not only calculates the crowding distances between individuals but also calculates the crowding distances between individuals and the boundary of the decision space, which promotes a more even distribution of the population in the decision space and improves the population&#39;s ability to explore unknown regions. The experiments on 17 benchmark problems show that BIMOEA can effectively improve search capabilities and provide decision-makers with more comprehensive solutions.},

However, research integrating parcel lockers with both pick-up and delivery services while considering multiple objectives in logistics is relatively scarce. This study proposes a multi-objective vehicle routing problem model with parcel lockers for simultaneous pick-up and delivery. The model takes into account critical factors such as the number of vehicles, delivery costs and customer satisfaction. Building upon the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), the study combines a Hybrid Insertion strategy (HI) to propose an improved algorithm called NSGA-II-HI, for solving the problem. The performance of the proposed NSGA-II-HI is evaluated using the hypervolume and inverted generational distance metrics on 15 datasets, in comparison with the traditional NSGA-II. The results indicate that the NSGA-II-HI generally provides superior solutions in most cases.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary computing (EC), as a metaheuristic algorithm, is widely applied in optimization problems due to its effectiveness. During the optimization process of EC, a large amount of data will be generated, which contains rich information on the evolutionary process. Mining and utilizing these data can learn promising evolutionary knowledge to assist the EC algorithms in achieving more efficient evolution. First, we analyze in detail the key differences in collecting experience and guiding evolution between particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) in the existing knowledge learning framework. Then, we propose a triple network knowledge learning (TNKL) framework to mitigate the limitations and boost knowledge learning for PSO-based algorithms. In the TNKL framework, the successful evolution experience of the current particle, the historical best position, and the global best position are collected. Three neural networks learn different knowledge from these experiences and give appropriate evolution directions. The TNKL framework then comprehensively considers these directions according to the evolution stage to guide particle evolution. Finally, we integrate the TNKL framework with PSO and its state-of-the-art variants. The benchmark function experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the TNKL framework.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks are powerful and popular learning models; however, recent studies have shown that deep neural network-based policies are susceptible to deception by adversarial attacks. A minimalistic attack is a specialized form of adversarial attack that aims to accomplish successful attacks at the lowest possible cost. Recently, transfer optimization algorithms have been applied to deceive previously trained policies by acquiring knowledge from previously solved tasks. Experiments indicate that the transfer optimization algorithms perform well compared to traditional optimization algorithms. However, current transfer algorithms for addressing minimalistic attacks not only select a single source task for knowledge transfer but also tend to overly rely on identified appropriate source tasks. To address this issue, this paper introduces a similar locality based transfer evolutionary optimization algorithm. It can adaptively select multiple source tasks and extract valuable knowledge from these source tasks. Moreover, by leveraging the concept of similar locality, the algorithm alleviates its excessive dependence on familiar tasks, thereby providing fresh knowledge for the optimization of the target task. On this basis, the algorithm can mine more valuable knowledge from the large source task space to achieve a successful attack in a shorter period. The algorithm is tested on three Atari games-BeamRider, Qbert, and Seaquest-demonstrating its ability and potential to outperform other transfer optimization algorithms currently available in solving this problem.},

  abstract  = {The high demand for energy in communication technologies is posing a major challenge in many future applications. Highly dynamic systems, such as mobile networks and renewable energy sources, are interconnected and subject to constant change, requiring situation-aware optimization. Alternative solutions necessary for decision-making based on temporary requirements can be obtained by multi-objective optimization. This paper considers a resource allocation problem related to the beamforming technology of the upcoming 6G standard and explores the feasibility of using an evolutionary algorithm (EA) in a dynamic network scenario to optimize power consumption and quality of service (QoS) simultaneously while assigning a user equipment (UE) to a base station (BS) beam. The proposed approach includes an information carry-over mechanism within the optimization process, enabling convergence despite the constantly changing network topology. The evaluation focuses on three factors that may limit applicability: network utilization, portion of moving users, and movement speed. It is conducted in a simulation environment in comparison to a heuristic approach that only takes QoS into account. The results indicate that, even in a fully dynamic network instance, the EA outperforms the heuristic approach in all experimental instances, although the performance gain decreases depending on certain combinations of influencing factors.},

  abstract  = {As electric vehicles become more prevalent, a novel vehicle routing problem (VRP) has emerged, known as the capacitated electric VRP (CEVRP). CEVRP requires determining not only the service order of customers but also the charging plans for vehicles, thereby increasing the complexity of solution construction. In response to this challenge, we propose a bilevel hybrid genetic algorithm (BHGA). BHGA models CEVRP as two levels of subproblem: 1) the upper level capacitated VRP, focusing on the service order and 2) the lower level fixed route vehicle charging problem, focusing on the charging plans. In dealing with the upper level subproblem, the hybrid genetic search algorithm is adopted to construct the routes to visit customers and an advanced screening strategy is proposed to optimize the local search process and effectively guide the evolution of population. For the lower level subproblem, an efficient heuristic method called focus enumeration is designed, which is specifically used to insert charging stations into routes to ensure battery constraint. The collaboration of the advanced screening strategy and the focus enumeration assists in more unified solving of the two subproblems. The experiments show that BHGA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark instances and has successfully updated eleven best known solutions, demonstrating its outstanding performance.},

  abstract  = {3D sandbox games like Minecraft allow users to perform innumerable actions in diverse and complex environments. The design of autonomous agents in various environments is crucial for real-world application and utilization. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) is designed to replicate human demonstrations in more complex and subtle environments and solve various tasks by autonomous agents, but it has limitations in processing complex sequence input and sufficiently suppressing incorrect policies, making it insufficient for generating complex actions for complex inputs in Minecraft. In this paper, we propose an extended GAIL that effectively addresses Minecraft tasks, considering the complexity of the inputs and outputs. The proposed method, using a global encoder shared between the agent and discriminator, ensures robustness for image sequences and improves the positive reward function to include negative values, enabling the agent to construct optimal trajectories among a variety of actions. Experiments on Minecraft game scenarios confirm the superiority of the proposed method over typical GAILs, achieving human-like scores in Navigate and TreeChop tasks. Additionally, we reveal that it is performed in a typical benchmark environment to show that it can operate in game domains. Ablation studies demonstrate that (1) the global encoder can extract meaningful representations from raw image sequence inputs, (2) the reward function significantly impacts the performance in composing actions available to the autonomous agent, and (3) the proposed method, through its adjustment of input and output in GAIL, can be applied across various GAIL-based models.},

Together with other preprocessing methods, it allows the conversion of raw data into a dataset containing only the necessary features to solve the task at hand, reducing the computational complexity of inducing models and creating models that are potentially simpler, more robust, and more interpretable. We use M3GP, a wrapper-based feature engineering algorithm, to induce a set of features that are adapted in number and in shape to several classifiers with different levels of predictive power, from decision trees with depth 3 to random forests with 100 estimators and no depth limit. Intuition tells us that classifiers that are restricted in the number of features should compensate for this restriction by using features with a high degree of correlation with the target objective. By opposition, the principle behind the boosting algorithm tells us that we can create a strong classifier using a large set of weak features. This indicates that classifiers with no restrictions should prefer many but weaker features. Our results confirm this hypothesis while also revealing that M3GP induces unnecessarily complex features. We measure complexity using several structural complexity metrics found in the literature and show that, although our pipeline consistently obtains good results, the structural complexity of the induced models varies drastically across runs. Additionally, while the test performance peaks in the early stages of the evolution, the complexity of the feature engineering models continues to grow, with little to no return in test performance. This work promotes using several complexity metrics to measure model interpretability and identifies issues related to model complexity in M3GP, proposing solutions to improve the computational cost of inducing models and the complexity of the final models.},

In this paper, we present a method for modeling user preferences and generating images that align with those preferences. The proposed method employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to learn the latent space of user preference information, which is then estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Specifically, the method utilizes reRDE-MC, a replica exchange Monte Carlo method capable of estimating multimodal distributions, which has been shown to effectively capture the complexities of user preferences. To address the reduced sampling accuracy of reRDE-MC in high-dimensional spaces like GAN latent spaces, we group generated images to facilitate the identification of user preferences. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by assuming a preferred image in the latent space and generating an image that aligns with the user&#39;s preference. The results confirm that reRDE-MC effectively extracts user preferences, unlike conventional MCMC methods that can only capture a single preference.},

  abstract  = {Many real-world optimization problems are inherently constrained, presenting significant challenges to the application of evolutionary algorithms. Successfully managing these constraints while simultaneously optimizing the objective function requires a considerable degree of population diversity. To address this, we have developed a methodology that effectively combines an $\varepsilon$ -constraint-handling method with a niching technique. The $\varepsilon$ -constraint- handling method is specifically designed to manage constraints, while the niching technique aims to preserve pop-ulation diversity. In our approach, a constrained optimization problem is transformed into a tri-objective optimization challenge, introducing two additional objectives: the density objective and the overall constraint objective. The density objective is a particularly innovative aspect of our method, as it prolongs the survival of promising yet infeasible solutions. This prolongation aids the evolutionary search in converging towards the feasible region from various directions, thereby increasing the chances of identifying optimal solutions. Moreover, an improved gradient repair mutation strategy, based on a successful information reuse approach, is implemented to further refine promising solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on 30 real-world constrained optimization problems from the CEC 2020 benchmark test suite. The results demonstrate that our approach either exceeds or is equivalent to the performance of current state-of-the-art constrained optimization algorithms.},

Traditional NAS methods perform network evaluations with full network training, typically incurring hundreds of training epochs for each candidate architecture. Such expensive search costs are infeasible in real-world applications. Several zero-cost metrics, which are computed based on randomly initialized network weights, have been proposed for efficiently estimating architecture quality as a proxy for network accuracy performance. These metrics require much less computation time but may not exhibit sufficient correlation with the actual accuracy. Using a single proxy metric might mislead the search, especially in the region of good-performing architectures in the search space. In this paper, we propose a two-phase Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with Zero-Cost Proxy-Based Hierarchical Initialization (eNAS-HI) framework. A tree search algorithm, guided by three training-free performance proxy metrics, is used to prune the search space and efficiently identify a diverse set of promising architectures in the initialization phase. These architectures then serve as the initial population for a genetic algorithm in the subsequent evolution phase. The diversity and quality of the initial population help eNAS-HI in finding top-performing architectures with reduced search costs.},

  abstract  = {The increasing volume of space objects in Earth&#39;s orbit presents a significant challenge for Space Situational Awareness (SSA). And in particular, accurate orbit prediction is crucial to anticipate the position and velocity of space objects, for collision avoidance and space debris mitigation. When performing Orbit Prediction (OP), it is necessary to consider the impact of non-conservative forces, such as atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations, that contribute to uncertainty around the future position of spacecraft and space debris alike. Conventional propagator methods like the SGP4 inadequately account for these forces, while numerical propagators are able to model the forces at a high computational cost. To address these limitations, we propose an orbit prediction algorithm utilizing machine learning. This algorithm forecasts state vectors on a spacecraft using past positions and environmental variables like atmospheric density from external sources. The orbital data used in the paper is gathered from precision ephemeris data from the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS), for the period of almost a year. We show how the use of machine learning and time-series techniques can produce low positioning errors at a very low computational cost, thus significantly improving SSA capabilities by providing faster and reliable orbit determination for an ever increasing number of space objects.},

  abstract  = {The long short term memory (LSTM) network is a popular deep learning model with a wide range of applications. Skip connection is a promising and important architectural innovation that can noticeably improve the performance of LSTM networks on complex machine learning tasks with longterm temporal/spatial dependencies. However, it is difficult to manually design skip connections in deep LSTM networks. For example, iterative analysis of skip connections is impractical and has scalability challenges. This paper proposes a new approach based on genetic algorithm (GA) and differentiable architecture search to automatically design LSTM networks with suitable skip connections. To allow an LSTM network and its skip connections to be designed jointly, we relax the search space of skip connections to be continuous. Consequently, LSTM network architectures with appropriate skip connections can be optimized directly through gradient-based network training. The cost of designing skip connections can also be maintained at a low level. Experiment results obtained from various classification and regression tasks show that the proposed algorithm excels in evolving LSTM networks that can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract  = {The objective of this study is to elucidate the role of developmental plasticity in the adaptive evolution of organisms in response to environmental change. To achieve this, we evolved flexible two-dimensional voxel-type virtual creatures using Evolution Gym. We introduced a new voxel type, named developmental plasticity voxel, capable of expressing different phenotypes (i.e., voxel types) depending on environmental conditions, and evolved genes for morphology, behavior, and developmental plasticity. In an evolutionary scenario in which the fitness measure shifted from the distance moved to the right in the first half of generations to the distance moved to the left in the second half, we observed that developmental plasticity genes that evolved neutrally in the first half of the experiment exhibited diverse morphology and behavioral patterns when the environment changed. We also found that in the case where the evolutionary process was accelerated, the adaptive morphology and behavior emerged by making use of the existing morphology and plasticity to adapt to a new environment, and were further improved by the subsequent evolution process. This phenomenon is consistent with the concept of the plasticity-first hypothesis and exaptation.},

One of the research fields that is certainly benefiting from this new computational paradigm is evolutionary optimization. In literature, efforts have been already made to run evolutionary algorithms on quantum computers using quantum effects such as superposition and entanglement to converge towards sub-optimal solutions of hard problems. However, the performance of these quantum evolutionary approaches is limited by the number of qubits available on current quantum devices. This limitation is more noticeable in the case of continuous optimization problems, where the search space is potentially infinite. This paper presents a recursive algorithmic structure that embodies a quantum evolutionary algorithm to overcome the limitations mentioned above. The result is an innovative and efficient approach in the context of quantum evolutionary optimization.},

  abstract  = {Support Vector Machines (SVMs), as well-known algorithms, have been successfully applied to classification problems. However, when dealing with imbalanced data, the classification performance of SVMs could be significantly compromised. One approach to tackle the class imbalance is oversampling the minority class, exemplified by methods like SMOTE and its variants. These methods generate new samples by interpolation between existing ones and determine the weights based on the ratio of samples from different classes, leading to inaccurate weight assignment, limited generation scope, and indiscriminate sample generation. To address these limitations, we propose novel evolutionary oversampling algorithms based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) called SEOA. SEOA leverages the inherent capability of SVM to identify the samples that have a critical influence on the decision boundary and assign them appropriate weights, thereby eliminating the reliance on human experience. Furthermore, SEOA utilizes a novel approach for sample generation and emphasizes the significance of margin for classification, introducing a mechanism that employs margin as the metric to evaluate the quality of generated samples. To assess the performance of SEOA, we conducted a comprehensive comparison against various oversampling methods across 19 real-world datasets. The results underscore SEOA&#39;s superiority, showcasing its distinct strengths in addressing the challenges posed by imbalanced classification.},

  abstract  = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely recognized for their impressive ability to generate realistic data. Despite the popularity of GANs, training them poses challenges such as mode collapse and instability. To address these issues, many variants enhance GAN performance through improvements in network architecture, modifications to loss functions, and the inclusion of regularization techniques. However, a limited number of methods focuses on optimising GAN performance from the optimiser&#39;s perspective, despite the distinct roles different optimisers play in training. Existing GANs typically employ a single optimiser throughout, with Adam being the default choice for GAN training. Approaches using multiple optimisers have shown improved performance but are often task-specific. This paper introduces a novel, portable approach that lever-ages the strengths of multiple training methods, with an evolutionary supervisor coordinating the training of different sections of the network. Initially, real-number-encoded vectors representing the optimiser for each sub-parameter layer undergo pro-gressive enhancement using a standard evolutionary algorithm (SGA). Through the evolutionary process, optimal optimiser combinations are retained based on the performance of the trained GAN. The proposed method, SGA-GANs, is validated on the CIFAR10 dataset by integrating the steps into five benchmark GAN models: GAN, DCGAN, BEGAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA-GANs outperforms single optimiser training methods, achieving superior evaluation results and generating higher-quality images.

In terms of evaluating in-fill solutions, most current optimization algorithms must evaluate all objectives using high-fidelity means, irrespective of relative differences in their evaluation times. In this paper, we address the issue of handling objective functions having heterogeneous high-fidelity evaluation times and propose a framework which combines evaluation time and surrogate accuracy of each objective to decide which population members should undergo a high-fidelity evaluation and for which objectives. Our proposed approach deals with heterogeneously evaluated solutions - some objectives with high-fidelity and some with surrogates - in a generic way. Initial results on a number of two and three-objective problems, presented in this paper, show promise for approach and encourages to launch a deeper study on more complex and constrained problems.},

Currently, deep learning-based methods are often employed for retinal fundus image segmentation. However, most deep learning models manually designed by experts are not suitable for task-specific applications. Therefore, we propose a novel retinal image segmentation method that integrates a neural architecture search framework with a non-subsampled multiscale decomposition (NSMD-NAS) technique. Specifically, the feature extraction layer includes the convolutional layer and the transformer layer. In addition, the non-subsampling filter bank is embedded into the convolutional and the transformer modules respectively to generate a new network module for exploring multiscale, multi-frequency, and multi-directional information. Unlike previous wavelet-based network modules, non-subsampling network modules have translation invariance. Subsequently, the components of the network are specified by the elaborated encoding strategy, and then the network with the highest adaptation is searched by a genetic evolutionary algorithm (GA) to finally obtain the best network structure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed model on the public benchmark datasets.},

To verify this, we introduce (1+1)-MOEA/D-CMA, where each subproblem is solved by a different (1+1)-ES solver, and the solvers collaborate through a novel solution injection scheme. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs better than several widely used algorithms.

Most existing methodologies for solving open-pit mine scheduling problems are based on conventional approaches. However, these methods face many challenges in terms of computational cost due to the high dimensionality, and physical and operational constraints. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied to a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems, as they often provide high-quality solutions to complex problems without significant design effort and computational cost. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for the open-pit mine scheduling problem. We compare the effectiveness of this algorithm with the Global Simple Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimizer (GSEMO) by analyzing well-known real-world mine deposits consisting of up to 112 687 blocks. We show that the NSGA-II algorithm has a clear advantage over GSEMO in obtaining better results. Further, we introduce the local search technique to enhance the performance of the NSGA-II.},

This research focuses on Sweden&#39;s forestry sector and explicitly addresses the crucial early stages of pine tree development. The main difficulty in categorising plant growth over time is that instances within a given category are not identical, while instances from different categories may have similarities. In this context, we present a novel measurement system that integrates the capa-bilities of evolutionary computation and deep transfer learning using image data. The image acquisition system includes a tray of plates that moves through a nursery, generating a dataset captured over 44 days of plant growth. Our newly proposed algorithm, EvoSqueezeNet, employs various search strategies for SqueezeNet deep transfer learning to find proper hyper-parameters. We opted for SqueezeNet based on our preliminary studies, revealing its superior performance compared to other pre-trained models in our case study. Given that our approach is independent of any specific evolutionary algorithm, we utilised five distinct search strategies. These include Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Covariance Ma-trix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), Comprehensive Learning PSO (CLPSO), and Linear Population Size Reduction Success-History Adaptation DE (LSHADE). Consequently, we proposed five EvoSqueezeNet schemes for temporal plant growth categorisation. One characteristic of our proposed model is that it uses a limited computation budget for search strategies, en-hancing its applicability in real-world applications. The proposed EvoSqueezeNet methodology demonstrates an error reduction of more than 40%, showcasing its superior performance compared to competing methods.},

  abstract  = {Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Sina Weibo playa crucial role in global communication but often encounter strict regulations in geopolitically sensitive regions. This situation has prompted users to ingeniously modify their way of communicating, frequently resorting to coded language in these regulated social media environments. This shift in communication is not merely a strategy to counteract regulation, but a vivid manifestation of language evolution, demonstrating how language naturally evolves under societal and technological pressures. Studying the evolution of language in regulated social media contexts is of significant importance for ensuring freedom of speech, optimizing content moderation, and advancing linguistic research. This paper proposes a multi-agent simulation frame-work using Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the evolution of user language in regulated social media environments. The framework employs LLM-driven agents: supervisory agent who enforce dialogue supervision and participant agents who evolve their language strategies while engaging in conversation, simulating the evolution of communication styles under strict regulations aimed at evading social media regulation. The study evaluates the framework&#39;s effectiveness through a range of scenarios from abstract scenarios to real-world situations. Key findings indicate that LLMs are capable of simulating nuanced language dynamics and interactions in constrained settings, showing improvement in both evading supervision and information accuracy as evolution progresses. Furthermore, it was found that LLM agents adopt different strategies for different scenarios. The reproduction kit can be accessed at https://github.com/BlueLinkXlGA-MAS.},

  abstract  = {The goal of the paper is to address the need for methods to handle time-sensitive, human-centered, multi-criteria decision-making problems. In the current literature, prevalent methods rely on expressing decision-maker/stakeholder preferences through weights, ideal points, and trade-off matrices. However, these conventional approaches prove unsuitable for time-constrained, atypical, and stressful situations, such as emergencies. In such scenarios, where both time and additional factors significantly affect decision-making abilities, the effective utilization of advanced decision-making techniques becomes chal-lenging. Therefore, this paper explores the possibility of how an intelligent agent might be used to provide possible courses of action to human decision-makers/stakeholders. The agent will be put to the test to tackle the dynamic alternate airport selection problem. In emergency and time-critical situations, like an engine fire or a medical emergency, there is often a need to select an alternate airport destination dynamically midflight. During such emergencies, a lot of information must be collected and evaluated by the pilots as a basis for the decision-making process. The pilots need to compare multiple characteristics of the available airports and weigh the pros and cons of each. Given the need for clear and interpretable retroactive analysis in decision-making in general and in the aviation field in particular, the focus was placed on more interpretable and explainable models from the field of AI. Due to this, the Learning Classifier System (LCS) is to be the primary model explored. The LCS is trained on a custom dataset composed of various decision-making scenarios. The approach shows promising results and appears to merit further investigation.},

  abstract  = {Research has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) have vulnerabilities that can lead to the misrecognition of Adversarial Examples (AEs) with specifically designed pertur-bations. Various adversarial attack methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities under hard-label black box (HL-BB) conditions in the absence of loss gradients and confidence scores. However, these methods fall into local solutions because they search only local regions of the search space. Therefore, this study proposes an adversarial attack method named EvolBA to generate AEs using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) under the HL-BB condition, where only a class label predicted by the target DNN model is available. Inspired by formula-driven supervised learning, the proposed method introduces domain-independent operators for the initial-ization process and a jump that enhances search exploration. Experimental results confirmed that the proposed method could determine AEs with smaller perturbations than previous methods in images where the previous methods have difficulty.},

This approach utilizes the transfer learning technique which reuses information from previous environments to accelerate the search process in the new environment. However, the risk of negative transfer can lead to an erroneous search direction and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multistage transfer learning DMOEA, named MSTL. The algorithm is designed to enhance the convergence and diversity of the population through the combination of the pre-transfer learning stage and the transfer learning and validation stage when environmental changes occur. In the pre-transfer learning stage, a suitable target domain, source domain, and validation classifier sample sets are generated guided by historical information. In the transfer learning and validation stage, the TrAdaboost technique to transfer knowledge from the target to the source domain, with the results verified by two validation classifiers to mitigate negative transfer.

  abstract  = {It is agreed that portfolio selection is of great importance for the financial market. Numerous outstanding exact and heuristic algorithms have been proposed in the past decades. However, their development always demands meticulous human ideas and could be time-consuming. Moreover, most of them tend to suffer from performance degradation when exposed to new portfolio selection models and different investment environments. Learning-enabled approaches have recently yielded impressive results, but these methods still grapple with challenges in model design and training. In this paper, we explore the mutual facilitation of large language models (LLMs) and huristic approaches in portfolio selection, and propose a novel LLM-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) named IlmPC-NSGA-II. In this algorithm, the LLM with carefully-designed well-structured prompts serves as a straightforward yet effective engine for generating new solutions, non-dominated sorting and crowding distance calculation are adopted to enable the LLM and the evolutionary process to mutually guide toward the optimal region of the solution space. Experimental results on various scales of constrained multi-objective portfolio selection models and four benchmark problems demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve a more competitive performance compared to widely-used MOEAs and the LLM-only method.},

  abstract  = {Learning-based methods have gained significant popularity in the field of combinatorial optimization in recent times. Researchers in the deep learning community aim to design models that, given an instance of a problem, directly generate optimal solutions in the first shot. However, due to the inherent complexity of certain combinatorial problems, achieving this in a single attempt is not trivial, and additional strategies are required to search for the optimal solution in several tries. For this purpose, researchers have proposed sampling techniques or active search which, in our opinion, are computationally wasteful with a limited performance. In this paper we develop strategies that efficiently exploit the fast inference capability of learning methods. Particularly, the objective is to solve the entire problem by solving it in fragments. It can be applied to any problem where the improvement of the overall solution is guaranteed by improving any part of the problem. To illustrate this, we focus on the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP) as a case of study. We employ a Neural Combinatorial Optimization model within a sliding-window optimization strategy, where specific parts of a candidate solution are optimized without compromising the overall solution quality. We explore various implementation aspects, including window size, step size and overlapping configurations. Experimental results show that the presented method achieves superior performance and better efficiency compared to baseline strategies and competitors, and significantly surpasses the previous learning methods for LOP instances of size 200, achieving an average gap to the best known value of only 0.04% within a 1-minute run-time.},

To address this need, we introduce a Regularized Auto-Encoder with a Genetic Algorithm (RAE-GA) approach for outlying and characterizing subspaces: i.e. a novel approach for identifying outliers and pinpointing their underlying subspaces. This method leverages autoencoders with regularized latent spaces, such as in Variational Auto Encoders (VAE) and Regularized Auto Encoders (RAE), which have proven effective in outlier detection only. So, building upon this success, the proposed RAE-GA utilizes a specially crafted, computationally efficient fitness function based on RAE. This function is integrated into the genetic algorithm to explore various potential subspaces, eliminating the need for restrictive pruning or constraints. As our experimental results indicate, RAE-GA outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in outlier interpretation.},

Fault tolerant consensus algorithms such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) require communication with all other network members up to 4 times. In a network with thousands of satellites in space on different trajectories, this time can approach millennia. There-fore, identifying a subset of satellites that can form a sub-network able to converge to a consensus decision in a useful time window, while maximising the number of members to increase consensus accuracy and trustworthiness, can be formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem. The problem is explained and defined with the optimisation method and the consensus algorithm steps described. Metrics for measuring the output of the optimal pareto front are considered and applied to the front computed. The real satellite positions used generate a non-fixed topology and high latency scenario such as that of a real on-orbit decision being made. The trend shown over 100 days of satellite positions propagation with up to 82 International Charter: Space and Major Disasters satellites shows up to 22 satellites can be used in a subset with a near linear increase in consensus time along the optimal pareto front and exponential trend for the mean values computed over 100 runs of the NSGA-II algorithm.

Indirect encoding methods, where each gene can encode for multiple weights, shorten the genome to reduce the dimensions of the search space and better exploit permutations and symmetries. The Geometric Encoding for Neural network Evolution (GENE) introduced an indirect encoding where the weight of a connection is computed as the (pseudo-)distance between the two linked neurons, leading to a genome size growing linearly with the number of genes instead of quadratically in direct encoding. However GENE still relies on hand -crafted distance functions with no prior optimization. Here we show that better performing distance functions can be found for GENE using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) in a meta-evolution approach, hence optimizing the encoding to create a search space that is easier to exploit. We show that GENE with a learned function can outperform both direct encoding and the hand-crafted distances, generalizing on unseen problems, and we study how the encoding impacts neural network properties.},

  abstract  = {Automated Program Repair (APR) has garnered significant attention in recent years, especially when combined with the latest advancements in deep learning, further enhancing its automation and repair efficiency. Traditional learning-based APR typically employs Neural Machine Translation (NMT) technology, treating the repair task as a translation process from defective code to repaired code, known as the NMT paradigm. With the emergence of large pre-trained models, a novel approach considers the repair process as a fill-in-the-blanks task, masking defective code and using Masked Language Models (MLM) to predict the masked positions, resulting in repaired code, referred to as the MLM paradigm. However, the applicability of this new learning paradigm in APR has not been widely explored, and the differences in repair effectiveness compared to the NMT paradigm remain unclear. This paper delves into the performance differences between the MLM and NMT paradigms in APR through empirical research. Although both paradigms have drawn attention in the APR domain, their methodologies differ, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation and comparison in the same experimental environment, particularly in Natural Language Models (NLM) and Code Language Models (CLM).The results reveal that in NLM, the NMT paradigm excels with higher repair accuracy, leveraging large parallel corpora for supervised training and focusing on machine translation tasks, facilitating better learning of correspondences and semantic representations between languages. However, when dealing with more complex programming languages like CLM, the repair effectiveness of the NMT paradigm lags behind that of the MLM paradigm. NMT struggles to learn the syntax and semantic relationships of real-world programming languages, while the MLM paradigm comprehends code syntax and structure more effectively. It accurately identifies variable scopes, function call relationships, and dependencies between code blocks, allowing the model to infer errors and generate repaired code that aligns with programming language specifications. In summary, each paradigm demonstrates advantages in different repair scenarios. It is recommended to choose the appropriate technical paradigm based on specific repair needs and contexts in practical applications.},

  abstract  = {We proposed a novel ensemble selection method called VISTA for multiple layers ensemble systems (MLES). Our ensemble model consists of multiple layers of ensemble of classifiers (EoC) in which the EoC in each layer is trained on the data generated by a concatenation of the original training data and the predictions by classifiers of the previous layer. The predictions of the EoC in the final layer are aggregated to obtain the final prediction. To enhance the accuracy of the MLES, we used the Variable-Length Genetic Algorithm (VLGA) to search for the optimal configuration of EoC in each layer. Since the optimisation process is computationally intensive, we use Surrogate-Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEA) to reduce the training time. Most surrogate models developed in the literature require a fixed-length input, which limits their applications when the encoding is of variable length. In this paper, we proposed to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based surrogate model, in which the LSTM transforms the variable-length encoding to a fixed-size representation which will then be used by the surrogate model to predict the fitness values in VLGA. For the surrogate model, we adopted Radial Basis Function (RBF) for surrogation. We first conducted experiments in comparing two types of LSTM converters, and the results suggest that the proposed chunk-based LSTM converter provides better results compared to the normal LSTM converter. Our experiments on 15 datasets show that VISTA outperforms several benchmark algorithms.},

The conditions that specify the ratio and distribution of tolerable deadline violations are defined through the weakly hard real-time constraints, and real-time systems that implement these constraints are referred to as weakly hard real-time systems. The majority of the existing approaches for scheduling tasks with weakly hard real-time constraints rely on classifying task instances, i.e., jobs, as either mandatory or optional (skippable), and provide a mechanism for ensuring timely completion of mandatory jobs, while aiming to maximize the number of timely completed optional jobs. However, few approaches implement online acceptance tests for optional jobs which ensure that jobs that are unable to be completed before their respective deadline are not accepted into the system. The existing acceptance tests for optional jobs have high computational complexity with respect to the number of tasks and are therefore not suitable for implementation on real-time computing platforms with limited resources. In this research, we develop a scheduling approach that maximizes the number of completed jobs and implements computationally efficient acceptance tests that ensure early rejection of jobs that cannot be completed before their deadline. This is achieved through a genetic programming approach with cooperative coevolution. Our approach uses two scheduling heuristics: a heuristic for dynamic job priority assignment, and a heuristic for evaluating acceptance for newly activated jobs. The results show that the proposed approach achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of service quality, but with significantly lower computational overhead. Unlike the state-of-the-art scheduling algorithms, the scheduling heuristics generated by the proposed approach are suitable for implementation in real-time computing platforms due to their low computational complexity.},

When a natural disaster occurred, logistics of emergency relief supplies should be built to enable prompt and accurate distribution of emergency relief supplies. For building the logistics, it is necessary to determine optimal multi-trip vehicle routing because available vehicles are limited. This problem can be formulated as a multi-trip vehicle routing problem (MTVRP) considering fairness and road closure. The proposed improved discrete cat swarm optimization modifies discrete cat swarm optimization for application to the multi-trip vehicle routing problem. Using the proposed method, solutions can be improved using parts of high quality solutions&#39; routes in the MTVRP. It is verified that the proposed method can generate higher quality optimal vehicle routing than the conventional improved reactive tabu search based method with actual evacuation center data of Chiba City. The data are planned to be utilized in case of a natural disaster. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by Welch&#39;s t-test.},

Recently, it has also been shown that scaling objective function values before ELA feature calculation can be beneficial for AS methods evaluated on the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking suite. In this paper, we aim to evaluate whether the same holds true for other benchmarks. In particular, we take into account four different benchmark suites and investigate the ability of an AS model trained on one benchmark to generalize to another benchmark. We also evaluate the impact of scaling objective function values before ELA feature calculation on AS performance. We observe a benefit of scaling objective function values in the case of the use of all ELA features together, however, conflicting outcomes are obtained when different feature groups are used individually. Our analysis shows no benefit of the joint use of the ELA features calculated on the original and scaled objective function values.},

  abstract  = {We study a distributed bit climbing algorithm for multi-objective optimization of binary problems. This algorithm decomposes the many-objective problem into a minimum number of single-objective problems, specified by the original evaluation functions and one additional scalarizing function that computes the solution hypervolume. Random bit climbers optimize sepa-rately their assigned single-objective function until they reach a local optimum and restart their search from a bounded population of non-dominated solutions collected from the solutions generated by all climbers. In this paper, we observe the climbing characteristics according to the restarting solution of the climbers to shed light on how they contribute to finding an approximation of the Pareto set. Also, we verify the effectiveness of the solution hypervolume as a scalarization function. We evaluate the method on subclasses of epistatic problems using MNK-landscapes, varying the number of objectives from 2 to 5 and the number of epistatic interactions from 1 to 20. We compare results with two popular decomposition-based multi-objective optimizers, showing that the simpler distributed bit climber performs better than the other optimizers in 2, 3, and 4 objective problems for most values of epistatic interactions.},

  abstract  = {The goal of a generic evolutionary multi- or many-objective algorithm is to explore a search space and find the trade-off optimal solutions for two or more conflicting objectives. In platform-based practical design optimization problems, it is not sufficient to just find a set of trade-off optimal solutions, certain regularity properties are expected in the entire fleet of trade-off solutions. For this purpose, we propose a scalable regularity-based optimization framework - RegEM(a)O - which automatically extracts polynomial regularity principles from the resulting Pareto-optimal front of multi- or many-objective problems. Thereafter, it attempts to search for a regular front of trade-off solutions following a similar form of polynomial regularity principles. Despite being slightly worse than the true Pareto-optimal solutions, regular solutions possess simple properties among them, making them easily interpretable, their inventory easily maintainable, and easily scalable. In this paper, we apply RegEM(a)O to a number of small and large-scale real-world engineering design problems to demonstrate its practical advantage.},

  abstract  = {Surrogate model-assisted multi-objective optimization has increasingly prevailed in solving expensive multi-/many-objective optimization problems. However, most research has advocated updating each model on each echo by the designed infill sampling approach. After the model-based search for the optimum, the approximated model of each objective may not need to be updated. Therefore, this paper proposes a GP model-assisted multi-objective optimization method with an adaptive modeling approach, with an angle and uncertainty-based infill sampling strategy assisting with updating. The estimated error change of all test samples is utilized in this adaptive modeling approach to assess if the surrogate model of each objective needs to be changed. The model, meanwhile, is improved by two infill individuals based on non-dominated sorting of estimations and uncertainties, respectively. One of the sampling criteria is to choose the potential individual for boosting the exploitation of the optimal solutions using estimation-based sorting and angles with samples. Following the uncertainty-based non-dominated sorting, the other aims to choose the infill individual for exploring the potential optimum position. Experiments on two multi-objective test suites and one real-world application indicate that the proposed method outperforms five contemporary classic optimization algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we apply the PEN DNA toolbox (Polymerase-Exonuclease-Nickase Dynamic Network Assembly toolbox), a modular framework for molecular computing, to Reservoir Computing. Reservoir Computing is a computing approach initially developed to quickly train Recurrent Neural Networks but has since been adapted to other complex systems, as long as they have appropriate recurrent properties. Previous work has shown that chemical reaction networks (CRNs), both in silico and in vitro, are among such appropriate targets. However, the full range of reservoir characteristics of CRNs, such as memory capacity or computational capabilities, has not been established yet. Moreover, while past studies have shown that large-sized chemical reaction networks are expressive enough to deal with complex behaviors, their wet-lab implementation is more challenging. Here, we aim to evaluate the range of reservoirs that can be generated with the PEN DNA toolbox and clarify the trade-off between reservoir properties and network size. We do so through an automatic exploration of the reservoir property space using a Quality-Diversity algorithm. Finally, to mitigate the high number of simulations required by the algorithm paired with their computational cost, we developed a neural-network-based surrogate model which we apply for either the first 20% or 50% of evaluations as a way to quickly seed good potential solutions. We showed that the surrogate model reduced the run time of the algorithm with no loss in the quality of the best solutions found. Such approach can thus be applied to design a wide range of molecular reservoirs with good characteristics.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) play a crucial role in the architectural configuration and training of Artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a process known as neuroevolution. However, neuroevolution is hindered by its inherent computational expense, requiring multiple generations, a large population, and numerous epochs. The most computationally intensive aspect lies in evaluating the fitness function of a single candidate solution. To address this challenge, we employ Surrogate-assisted EAs (SAEAs). While a few SAEAs approaches have been proposed in neuroevolution, none have been applied to truly large DNNs due to issues like intractable information usage. In this work, drawing inspiration from Genetic Programming semantics, we use phenotypic distance vectors, outputted from DNNs, alongside Kriging Partial Least Squares (KPLS), an approach that is effective in handling these large vectors, making them suitable for search. Our proposed approach, named Neuro-Linear Genetic Programming surrogate model (NeuroLGP-SM), efficiently and accurately estimates DNN fitness without the need for complete evaluations. NeuroLGP-SM demonstrates competitive or superior results compared to 12 other methods, including NeuroLGP without SM, convolutional neural networks, support vector machines, and autoencoders. Additionally, it is worth noting that NeuroLGP-SM is 25% more energy-efficient than its NeuroLGP counterpart. This efficiency advantage adds to the overall appeal of our proposed NeuroLGP-SM in optimising the configuration of large DNNs.},

In this paper, we design a novel evolutionary multitasking collaborative neural architecture search (EMCNAS) for remote sensing scene classification. EMCNAS mainly explores the similar features of different remote sensing scene classification tasks, and utilizes the uniformly encoded population to achieve implicit collaborative transfer. EM CNAS is able to adaptively determine the degree of exchange of genetic material based on the similarity of tasks in different scenarios, enabling more effective positive transfer. Compared with excellent manually designed neural networks and NAS peers, the proposed EMCNAS achieved competitive results on two remote sensing scene classification benchmark datasets UC Merced LandUse and NWPU-RESISC45 datasets. Ablation experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive collaborative transfer designed in EMCNAS.},

Despite a variety of transfer algorithms that have been developed over the years, the research on the design of benchmark problems for evaluating such algorithms received far less attention. Oftentimes, the source and target tasks in existing test problems are manually assembled or extended from specific practical problems, limiting their ability to represent the diverse yet complex source-target similarity relationships in real-world problems. In light of this, we propose design methods to generate multiobjective sequential transfer optimization problems (MSTOPs) systematically in this work, wherein the Pareto manifolds of individual tasks and the manifold-based similarity between the tasks can be customized with ease, enabling a broad spectrum of representation of the diverse similarity relationships between the source-target Pareto manifolds of MSTOPs. Lastly, a benchmark suite with 12 test problems is developed using the proposed methods, which would serve as an arena for electing superior multiobjective sequential transfer optimization algorithms.

One of them is the use of segmentation tools to support disease prevention and diagnosis. This makes it possible to automate this task and perform analyses regularly and for a large number of people, compared to manual analysis. However, segmentation tools must be particularly accurate for this to be possible. In this paper, we focus on improving retinal vessel segmentation methods. First of all, the U-Net network architecture has been expanded for even more accurate detection of the thinnest vessels. This is the most difficult part of the issue - spotting features in great detail. In addition, we introduced a strategy for selecting images to expand the training set, assisted by heuristic algorithms. Thanks to this, the set is expanded only to include those samples containing the most information about thin vessels. Moreover, we have also modified the method of binary pixel classification, introducing the possibility of capturing image parts with a lower probability of having a vessel, using local information. As a result of our work, we checked the effectiveness of the model with such metrics as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC, F1 score, and Intersection over Union using classic and modified thresholding. An improvement in the sensitivity value from 0.7562 to 0.7822 and an improvement in AUC from 0.8681 to 0.8776 was achieved with minor losses in other metrics.},

Building-integrated MGs offer flexibility and reliability through system optimization. In this context, the Interreg SUDOE project IMPROVEMENT (In-tegration of Combined Cooling, Heating and Power Microgrids in Zero Energy Public Buildings with High Power Quality and Continuity Requirements) was launched at the end of the year 2019 with the aim of developing efficient solutions allowing public buildings with critical loads to be turned into net-zero-energy buildings (nZEBs). The work presented in this paper deals with the development of an energy management system (EMS) for the management of thermal resources and users&#39; thermal comfort in public buildings [1]. Optimization-based/free model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are presented and validated using simulations and data collected in a public building equipped with a multi-energy MG. Models of the thermal MG components were developed. The strategy currently used in the building relies on proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and rule-based (RB) controllers. The interconnection between the thermal part and the electrical part of the building-integrated MG is managed by taking advantage of the solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation surplus. The optimization-based MPC EMS has the best performance but is rather computationally expensive. The optimization-free MPC EMS is slightly less efficient but has a significantly reduced computational cost, making it the best solution for in situ implementation.},

How-ever, the reciprocal integration of machine learning techniques into evolutionary computation remains relatively unexplored. Machine learning can substantially enhance the understanding of processes within Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) by harnessing its proficiency in identifying patterns and employing data-driven approaches. Existing studies lack a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interaction between machine learning models and evolutionary algorithms, necessi-tating prioritized investigation to ensure the efficacy, reliabil-ity, and compatibility of integrated models within optimization frameworks. This paper addresses this gap by examining the behavior of using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models as a population variation operator in Multi-objective Optimization Problems. Our experimental results reveal that Generative AI, particularly Distributional Adversarial Networks (DANs), sur-passes the performance of a traditional Generative Adversarial Network. Furthermore, DANs improve the population by gen-erating novel non-dominated solutions and augmenting overall performance and diversity. This study reveals the potential of the integration of Generative AI in evolutionary computation, presenting a pathway for advancements in addressing common challenges within multi-objective optimization problems.},

  abstract  = {Integrated decision-making regarding the selection and scheduling of a project portfolio, referred to as the project portfolio selection and scheduling problem (PPSSP), can contribute to the more favorable performance of many organizations. However, the optimization of large-scale PPSSP involving a large number of projects and complex constraints remains challenging. While exact solvers offer guaranteed optimal solutions, they are computationally intractable in large-scale PPSSP. On the contrary, metaheuristics search for approximated solutions within a reasonable time. This paper investigates the performance of a commercial exact solver and metaheuristics in addressing large- scale PPSSP within a limited time. In addition, hybrid approaches are proposed to combine the exact solver and metaheuristics in different ways to address PPSSP. Experiments are conducted on PPSSP instances with an increasing number of projects (up to 6000), demonstrating the superiority of metaheuristics in addressing large-scale PPSSP within a short time and the effectiveness of combining metaheuristics in Gurobi in facilitating the optimization process.},

  abstract  = {Legal text retrieval holds significant importance in the audit field, posing a challenge as a semantic matching problem. Despite the success of text semantic matching methods, particularly with the advent of large language models, these approaches face challenges when applied to domain-specific tasks, like legal text retrieval. Specifically, issues arise due to the concentrated distribution of data within the specific domain and the insufficient number of training samples. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a text semantic matching model tailored for the task of legal text retrieval, leveraging contrastive learning and evolutionary algorithms. A contrastive learning-based embedding model, which learns semantic representations in a feature space, is used to minimize the distance between matched text pairs and maximize the distance between unmatched text pairs. Additionally, an evolutionary algorithm-based sample augmentation model is introduced to augment the sample set and enhance the representational capabilities of the samples. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated in the context of legal text retrieval in the auditing field, and the experimental results reveal promising outcomes, with the proposed method achieving a Hits@l accuracy of 53.09%, a 2.99% improvement over the best baseline model. The Hits@20 accuracy reaches 75.15%, representing a 2.69% enhancement compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {Game economy design significantly shapes the player experience and progression speed. Modern game economies are becoming increasingly complex and can be very sensitive to even minor numerical adjustments, which may have an unexpected impact on the overall gaming experience. Consequently, thorough manual testing and fine-tuning during development are essential. Unlike existing works that address algorithmic balancing for specific games or genres, this work adopts a more abstract approach, focusing on game balancing through its economy, detached from a specific game. We propose GEEvo (Game Economy Evolution), a framework to generate graph-based game economies and balancing both, newly generated or existing economies. GEEvo uses a two-step approach where evolutionary algorithms are used to first generate an economy and then balance it based on specified objectives, such as generated resources or damage dealt over time. We define different objectives by differently parameterizing the fitness function using data from multiple simulation runs of the economy. To support this, we define a lightweight and flexible game economy simulation framework. Our method is tested and benchmarked with various balancing objectives on a generated dataset, and we conduct a case study evaluating damage balancing for two fictional economies of two popular game character classes.},

Genes produce proteins, which in turn, sit on the promoter regions of other genes to regulate their activity. Thus, a gene regulatory network is formed. This network is critical in disclosing the various mysteries in the operations of living systems. Often it is very difficult to find these networks in the Wet Lab. As a result, various computational approaches have been used to reconstruct these networks from gene ex-pression data. The techniques primarily used for this purpose include Bayesian networks, Boolean networks, recurrent neural networks, S-systems, and mutual information based methods. The contemporary literature indicates that these techniques often fail to reliably reconstruct real-life networks. In this paper, we have proposed a new technique based on a modified recurrent neural network strategy that is augmented by mutual information. The proposed methodology has been implemented on an 8-gene network of Escherichia coli and a lO-gene network, which have been extensively used by other researchers. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique achieves satisfactory results when compared to other such techniques developed by contemporary researchers.},

In this paper, we develop an evolutionary algorithm-based approach, namely, ILrLSUMM to generate concise extractive summaries for low-resource Indian languages, focusing on Hindi and Gujarati. To select the relevant sentences from a document to form a summary, our method employs a single-objective optimization process utilizing the efficacy of the differential evolutionary algorithm, which is a first of its kind as per knowledge. We investigate three key objectives: tf-idf score, sentence-to-title similarity, and thematic score. Our approach is purely unsupervised in nature; therefore, we utilized 500 articles from the M3LS dataset for a broader comparative analysis with the existing algorithms. Our evalu-ation was based on ROUGE scores, comparing our generated summaries with gold-standard summaries in the dataset. The results were promising in the sense that our method outperformed existing techniques, including large language models (LLMs) by 34% in Hindi and 53% in Gujarati on an average, according to the ROUGE-I Fl. This significant improvement highlights the effectiveness of our approach to handling text summarization for underrepresented languages.},

  abstract  = {In the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimization, the approximation of the Pareto front (PF) is achieved by utilizing a collection of representative candidate solutions that exhibit desirable convergence and diversity. Although several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been designed, they still have difficulties in keeping balance between convergence and diversity of population. To better solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), this paper proposes a Two-stage Evolutionary Framework For Multi-objective Opti-mization (TEMOF). Literally, algorithms are divided into two stages to enhance the search capability of the population. During the initial half of evolutions, parental selection is exclusively conducted from the primary population. Additionally, we not only perform environmental selection on the current population, but we also establish an external archive to store individuals situated on the first PF. Subsequently, in the second stage, parents are randomly chosen either from the population or the archive. In the experiments, one classic MOEA and two state-of-the-art MOEAs are integrated into the framework to form three new algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the superior and robust performance of the proposed framework across a wide range of MOPs. Besides, the winner among three new algorithms is compared with several existing MOEAs and shows better results. Meanwhile, we conclude the reasons that why the two-stage framework is effect for the existing benchmark functions.},

This study highlights existing research gaps in this area through a literature review. A genetic algorithm with a multimodal unarchiving mechanism (NSGA-MSPM) is proposed to explore the multimodality of MOFJSP. The experiment uses benchmark problems in shop scheduling, sets different evaluation counts for each problem, and records the number of optimal target values found by the algorithm, as well as the number of corresponding multi-modal solutions. By randomly selecting individuals and drawing a Gantt chart, this study shows various scheduling arrangements with the same target value, demonstrating the multimodality of MOFJSP.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a sequential transfer-learning approach combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm (STMO-GA) for feature selection. Firstly, for the multi-objective component of our method, we employ a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to generate a Pareto front. Then, features are ranked based on their number of appearances in the same Pareto front. Next, during the sequential knowledge transfer process, the ranked features are iteratively selected until a predetermined $n$ number of features remains. This feature subspace is further refined by a k-fold cross-validation operation, starting from the rank-one feature, to determine the cut-off of the $n$ features that will remain. Comparative evaluations against both GA-based as well as traditional feature selection methods demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification accuracy, while retaining the smallest number or a comparable number of features.},

However, they exhibit poor convergence and diversity on complex CMOPs because they may consume more evaluations for approximating the constrained Pareto Front (CPF), i.e., the infeasible regions far from the CPF. To address this issue, we propose a surrogate-assisted coevolution-ary algorithm, which improves the convergence and diversity performance by searching on auxiliary problems together with the original CMOP. Firstly, we construct a surrogate model for each objective and constraint function. The primary population searches on both objective and constrained surrogate models, which approximate for the original constrained problem. The secondary population searches on an auxiliary problem, which is a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) approximated by objective surrogate models. The two populations exchange information to enhance the convergence performance of the primary population. To improve the feasibility, the auxiliary problem is adopted with a certain probability. A novel infill criterion is proposed to guide the selection of high-quality solutions for updating the surrogate model, which relies on the feasible ratio of evaluated solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on multi-objective and many-objective benchmarks to demonstrate its competitiveness.},

It has a variety of utilization in research and industry, which facilitates scientific understanding, resource management, and safety of maritime activities. These images can be used in underwater image communication but suffer due to the limited acoustic channel bandwidth. The segmented images may be used instead for communication purposes but the process of segmentation of these images is hindered by influence of a large noise along with low resolution, complicating the segmen-tation process. In this work, an evolutionary dynamic many-objective optimization algorithm, KRR-DNSGA-III is proposed. This algorithm is equipped with KRR-ANOVA predictor for predicting the new solutions closer to the reference points. A modified mutation technique is also introduced for achieving faster convergence. Performance of the proposed algorithm is verified on four benchmark JY problems along with another problem from DF test suite. The algorithm is then used to segment a set of images from Seabed objects KLSG- II dataset.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, most music generation models are limited to accepting conditions from a single modality, whether text-based or neural signal-based. For most users, text represents the most accessible and intuitive input modality. However, this often dilutes the text&#39;s emotional characteristics, misaligning the emotional depth in the final music output. This article presents comprehensive research and improvement in the text-conditioned music generation model, named Emotion-Conditioned MusicLM. Building upon the existing text-conditioned music generation model, MusicLM, ECMusicLM is designed to generate music with a deeper emotional resonance while maintaining the high quality of musical output. Our research shows that combining text and emotional elements in music generation leads to the creation of emotionally resonant music. Through the experiments, ECMusicLM showed a notable capability in capturing implicit Valence-Arousal features from text prompts, significantly enhancing the emotional depth of the generated music. This study not only pushes the boundaries of AI in artistic creation but also opens avenues for future research in multi-modal emotional synthesis.},

Previous literature has demonstrated the use of quality and diversity (QD) algorithms in evolutionary approaches to drive the process to better quality solutions.

This paper also analyses the impact of using different behavioural characterisations (BC) in the performance of the quality of the solutions found.

  abstract  = {Cooperative co-evolution (CC) is a promising direction in solving large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs). However, most existing methods of grouping decision variables face some difficulties when searching in the huge search space. Specifically, the methods of grouping decision variables can be classified into two types, i.e., high-consumption grouping methods and non-consumption grouping methods. On the one hand, the former ones divide the decision variables into different groups based on the correlation analysis between variables, which consume much evaluation. This way may lead to premature convergence within limited computational resources. On the other hand, the later ones allocate the decision variables into sub-groups based on some metrics, e.g., order and size, which consume no evaluation while may cause the search fall into local optima. To alleviate the above issues, this paper proposes a CC-based algorithm with a variable-importance grouping (VIG) method, called VICCA. Firstly, the decision variables are classified into several subgroups according to their importance quantified by a meta-gene construction method. Secondly, a CC strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize all subgroups of decision variables formed by VIG using the differential evolution operator, which aims to accelerate the convergence speed. Thirdly, a global evolutionary strategy is proposed to optimize original decision variable space by the competitive swarm optimizer, aiming to maintain the diversity. Finally, the experiments demonstrate that our proposed VICCA has the significant advantage in solving LMOPs when compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Agent-based models (ABM) stand as a well-established paradigm in developing computational models. ABM enable the simulation of complex systems by consolidating individual-level interactions through an underlying artificial social network. Upon the accurate construction of a model, experts can employ it as a decision support system for assessing policies in hypothetical what-if scenarios and gaining insights into the operational dynamics of the target system. However, ABM still face diverse challenges such as learning realistic agents&#39; behavioral patterns to model real-world conducts and habits. Existing research shows that machine learning techniques, when used in ABM, can address such challenges. This work focuses on using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to learn agents&#39; behavior through the definition of their micro-rules, aiming to accurately model them, and thus improving the global performance of the system. To do so, we model the machine learning problem and undertake a comparative analysis of seven EAs, encompassing both classical and recent approaches, to learn agents&#39; micro-rules with a specific focus on consumers&#39; behavior for brand selection. Our investigation involves the assessment of the performance of each EA across problem instances derived from an ABM applied to real-world marketing domains such as dairy products and automakers. The findings of our study reveal a distinct dominance of SHADE-ILS and DECC-g over the remaining algorithms considered. Furthermore, we underline the advantages of these methods to assist modelers in selecting among the best solutions.},

However, continuous change, one characteristic of DOPs, still needs to be thoroughly discussed. Some environments in real-world applications can be assumed to change continuously over time or very frequently. It is essential to analyze issues by actually applying the algorithm to real problems with continuous change. Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), particularly MOT via Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) can be regarded as DOP with continuous change. Estimating the next bounding box involved in SORT needs to track object trajectories as continuous change. Applying SI algorithms can expect to track nonlinear trajectories that the original SORT can not in this estimation. This paper experiments to verify the tracking performance improvement by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), one of the SI algorithms. The experiment employs PSO-JOFB, a variant of PSO designed for tracking continuous change. Applying PSO-JOFB can expect to confirm that exploring this problem as DOPs with continuous change can lead to more effective tracking. The dataset utilized for the validation is the MOT Challenge 2015 training data in this experiment. The experimental results reveal the following implications: (1) The number of evaluations can be significantly reduced by exploring the next bounding box as DOPs with continuous change rather than as a static environment; (2) Tracking by PSO and PSO-JOFB enables the tracking trajectories that the original SORT fails to track.},

  abstract  = {Multi-loss functions are present in various aspects of deep learning. In multi-modal, cross-modal, and multi-task learning contexts, multi-loss functions are essential elements for handling complex data with diverse information sources. Different tasks or modalities may have conflicting objectives. By combining them into a single loss function, the model might struggle to strike the right balance between these objectives, leading to suboptimal performance. The Multi-objective Adam optimizer, also referred to as MAdam, is an extension of Adam optimizer that is applied for optimizing several competing loss functions in deep learning. The MAdam algorithm exhibits sensitivity to its initialization, necessitating the injection of ex-treme points into the initial population. Additionally, this scheme encounters difficulties in effectively capturing the disconnected and non-convex Pareto fronts. In this paper, an opposition-based scheme was introduced into MAdam framework as global search is necessary for escaping local optima in gradient-based multi-objective optimization approaches. The Opposition-based MAdam, explores multiple directions over the landscape, that leads to independence from specific initialization. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by capturing the entire Pareto front using the MNIST dataset for binary classification of digit images 2 and 3. This was achieved with a fully connected network, employing multi-objective mean absolute error and binary cross-entropy as losses. OMAdam matches Adam&#39;s Fl-score in the early generations, a result to its high exploratory capacity which enhances its performance in initial stages of classification tasks. This results in a reduction of computational costs compared to both Adam and MAdam. The variation in Fl-score values along the Pareto front trajectory enables practitioners to select a post hoc solution based on the trade-offs achieved among conflicting loss functions as multiple objectives. This contrasts with Adam, which offers limited options due to its single-solution approach.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection plays a pivotal role in the data preprocessing and model-building pipeline, significantly en-hancing model performance, interpretability, and resource efficiency across diverse domains. In population-based optimization methods, the generation of diverse individuals holds utmost importance for adequately exploring the problem landscape, particularly in highly multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems. Our study reveals that, in line with findings from sev-eral prior research papers, commonly employed crossover and mutation operations lack the capability to generate high-quality diverse individuals and tend to become confined to limited areas around various local optima. This paper introduces an augmen-tation to the diversity of the population in the well-established multi-objective scheme of the genetic algorithm, NSGA-II. This enhancement is achieved through two key components: the genuine initialization method and the substitution of the worst individuals with new randomly generated individuals as a re-initialization approach in each generation. The proposed multi-objective feature selection method undergoes testing on twelve real-world classification problems, with the number of features ranging from 2,400 to nearly 50,000. The results demonstrate that replacing the last front of the population with an equivalent number of new random individuals generated using the genuine initialization method and featuring a limited number of features substantially improves the population&#39;s quality and, consequently, enhances the performance of the multi-objective algorithm.},

  abstract  = {While fields like Artificial Life have made huge strides in quantifying the mechanisms that distinguish living systems from non-living ones, particular mechanisms remain difficult to reproduce in silico. In particular, biology seems to endlessly produce new, innovative states and new, innovative rules. Known as open-endedness, we&#39;ve been successful in finding mechanisms that generate new states, but have been less successful in finding mechanisms that generate new rules. In this discussion paper, we weigh whether or not analyzing the effects of internal and external system constraints on a system&#39;s dynamics would be a fruitful avenue to understanding open-endedness in future studies. We discuss the conceptual connection between physical constraints and the ways that the system can physically reach possible states while those constraints are present. It seems that the physical constraints that define biological objects (and dynamics) are maintained by dynamics that occur from within the system. This is in opposition to current modeling approaches where system constraints are maintained by external forces. We suggest that constraints can be characterized as variables whose values are either completely conserved, quasi-conserved, or conditionally conserved. Regardless of whether or not a constrained variable is a part of the biological object or present in the object&#39;s environment, we discuss how the accessible system states under that constraint can lead to local, emergent conservation laws (rules). We provide several examples of constraints based on real, well-studied systems and highlight the differences in mechanisms that constrain the variables being held constant. Finally, we discuss the possible benefits of formally understanding how system constraints that emerge from within a system lead to system dynamics that can be characterized as new, emergent rules- particularly for artificial intelligence, hybrid life, embodiment, astrobiology, and more. Understanding how new, local rules might emerge from within the system is crucial for understanding how open -ended systems continually discover new update rules, in addition to continually discovering new states.},

The intricate nature of real-world optimization problems necessitates the development of more efficient SAEAs to effectively address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, named surrogate-assisted clustering-Based evolutionary algorithm (SACBEA) for solving expensive optimization problems. SACBEA is an innovative combination of dynamic surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization (DSAP) and clustering-based local search (CBLS) for the balance between exploration and exploitation. Specifically, the DSAP employs the top-ranked solutions in the initialization of population, using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the evolutionary operator. Concurrently, a dynamic surrogate model is utilized for fitness prediction. In addition, the CBLS employs the k-means clustering algorithm to identify the promising region, initializing the population within this area for a more focused search. And the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is integrated into CBLS. SACBEA switches between DSAP and CBLS based on search performance. When one search mechanism fails to find a better solution, SACBEA seamlessly transitions to the other. To verify the effectiveness of SACBEA, a test set of 13 benchmark problems is adopted to conduct comparative experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of SACBEA over several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {With the revolutionary advancements in deep learning technologies, neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) emerges as a promising field for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) in real-world scenarios. By lever-aging the learning ability of deep neural networks, NCO trains network models to learn the mapping from problem instances to optimal solutions, offering advantages in terms of scalability and generalization to unseen instances. However, in spite of the effectiveness, existing NCO approaches have been developed under the assumption of a centralized setting, which requires all historical data to be stored and accessed centrally on a single device. In practical applications, a more common scenario is the distributed storage of data across multiple devices. Therefore, the centralized assumption in NCO is difficult to meet due to the necessity of privacy protection and data security. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving framework of federated combinatorial optimization on graphs, named FOG. We formulate COPs as graph optimization tasks and propose to train a graph neural network (GNN) model via data-driven federated learning approaches. We further introduce the edge-aware message passing mechanism in the GNN model, which enhances the model capability by integrating both the edge and node information during the inference process. The proposed framework is evaluated on the well-known TSP benchmarks with various scales, and the experimental results show that FOG achieves highly competitive performance while being able to protect data privacy.},

  abstract  = {Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become one of the hot research directions in the combination of medicine and machine learning (ML). While the characteristic of high feature number and low sample size in disease datasets makes it difficult for ML to make effective predictions. Currently, one of the most commonly used methods to address this issue is the use of heuristic algorithms for feature selection (FS). However, traditional heuristic algorithms still have certain limitations. On one hand, single-objective algorithms only focus on model&#39;s accu-racy, which always leads to a large number of redundant features remaining after FS. On the other hand, while multi-objective algorithms may result in fewer features, they often significantly reduce accuracy compared to single-objective algorithms. To solve these shortcoming, we proposes a novel FS algorithm based on harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm, attempting to achieve a better balance between the number of features and model&#39;s accuracy. Specifically, since the original HHO algorithm was only used for continuous numerical problems, we defines a new set of discrete operations for HHO to make it suitable for feature selection. Additionally, we introduce an aggregation function that allows the model to consider both model&#39;s accuracy and the number of features with a single objective. To mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by the aggregation function, a scale-free network was employed to improve the model&#39;s optimization capability. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed algorithm, we compare it with commonly used single-objective algorithms and multi-objective algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm offers a better balance compared to commonly used heuristic algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Utility AI is an effective tool used to design the behavior of AI agents in games and other multi-agent settings. Lately, it has been gaining a lot of attention in the video games domain, whereby computer players have to act quickly and maintain balance between the effectiveness (i.e., being strong) and the narrative goals (i.e., fulfilling a particular role). This paper presents a novel extension of Utility AI called Fuzzy Utility AI for game environments with uncertain and incomplete information. The main introduced ideas are fuzzy considerations, that generalize the standard considerations in Utility AI, and a new, uncertainty-aware, formula of calculating the utility score. Our intention was to compare the baseline approach with Fuzzy Utility AI using a rudimentary example (a testbed) that is simple to follow and also isolates all external factors that could influence the performance. The empirical results - with a dataset included - show that Fuzzy Utility AI is a more effective approach in environments with incomplete information that needs to be predicted with uncertainty. In the paper, we further confirm the empirical findings with a theoretical analysis.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection (FS), which aims to minimize the classification error and the number of selected features, can essentially be modeled as a multiobjective optimization problem. To deal with such multiobjective FS (MOFS) problems, many multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed. These MOEAs can find multiple optimal solutions, whereas substantial computational resources are required for fitness evaluations (FEs). More seriously, due to the high dimensionality and sparsity of FS problems, many FEs will be spent on unpromising solutions, resulting in a meaningless loss of computational resources. In this paper, two innovations are made so as to improve the performance of MOEAs for MOFS. First, we propose a surrogate-assisted flip (SF) strategy for MOEAs to reduce the FE waste on potentially unpromising solutions and improve search efficiency. This SF strategy is free of FE consumption and theoretically can be embedded in any MOEA to deal with MOFS problems. The experimental results show that this SF can improve the performance of different MOEAs, especially in reducing the number of selected features. Second, based on SF, we propose a more efficient SF -assisted MOEA for dealing with high-dimensional MOFS problems. The proposed algorithm divides the whole search space into different subspaces based on redundant feature subsets clustering to achieve parallel search, so as to reduce the search difficulty. The experimental results show that this algorithm is even more competitive than other SF -assisted MOEAs.},

However, when facing challenging constrained multi-objective optimization problem, some algorithms struggle to explore all feasible regions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a feasibility tracking strategy. By setting an expansion value and controlling constraint relaxation, adaptive adjustment of the reference vectors simulates an ex-panded narrow feasible region. After the preliminary exploration of the feasible region, a new set of reference vectors is generated to ensure the existence of feasible regions in the direction of the new reference vectors, thereby increasing the density of individuals within the feasible region. Experimental results on a series of benchmark problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is quite effective compared to other state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

Monitoring the errors of ITs and promptly replacing faulty ones is important for ensuring the secure operation of power systems. Existing online calibration methods exhibit specific problem formulation and optimization algorithm selection issues, rendering them inadequate to meet practical engineering requirements. To address the above deficiencies, we first formulate an optimization problem that aligns with the practical considerations of engineering. Notably, parameter normalization and objective integration are incorporated for engineering considerations. Next, we propose a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm that balances convergence and diversity for handling variables in the complex number field and the nonlin-earity of the formulated optimization problem. This algorithm is expected to fill the gap between mathematical local search and the meta-heuristic global search for real-world applications, considering the accuracy and reliability of the optimization results simultaneously. Numerical validation results indicate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of convergence rate and assessment precision over existing algorithms.},

However, the intractable training and inference complexity hinders its scalability in high-throughput scenarios with large batch sizes and increasing data volume. To address this issue, we develop an efficient high-throughput MOBO algorithm using gradient information named MOEAID-DSVGP, which integrates stochastic variational GP models using directional derivatives (DSVGP) within the decomposition-based MOBO framework. In this algorithm, DSVGP model is trained for each objective function by optimizing a small set of inducing inputs and inducing directions as variational parameters, the complexity is independent of sample size and input dimension. MOEAID is employed as the inner optimizer for high-throughput solution generation. Experimental studies with varying batch sizes and input dimensions show that compared to GradGP-based MOBO method, the proposed algorithm exhibits superior scalability and allows more optimization iterations to yield better outcome in most cases. We further investigate and analyze the influence of increasing the number of inducing directions on the performance improvement in problems with different features.},

  abstract  = {Oyster farms provide a sustainable and profitable export for New Zealand. Oyster farms are sensitive to changes in salinity that can cause significant crop loss if they persist too long. Recent extreme weather events have been leading to increased periods of low salinity, putting the farms at risk. Machine learning based methods provide a way to predict these low salinity events and provide an early warning system, but this has not been investigated in aquaculture. In this paper, we investigate three different methods to assess the viability of salinity prediction systems. A simple statistical model, a genetic programming (GP) based symbolic regression model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) were compared as ways of solving this problem. The results show that GP based symbolic regression and CNNs are fairly good approaches to predicting salinity. However, as weather events get more extreme, the CNN approach tends to hold up better and can be generalised better, while the G P based symbolic regression models show better potential explainability with the tree based model structure. These results show promise and provide a good stepping off point at creating a generalised approach to predicting salinity in estuaries.},

  abstract  = {Rule-based machine learning (RBML) models are often presumed to be very beneficial for tasks where explainabil-ity of machine learning models is considered essential. However, their models are only really explainable as long as their rule sets are compact. This leads to the need for an optimizer to take prediction error and rule count as objectives. Given the highly complex fitness landscape of rule set learning tasks, good hyperparameters of the optimizer as well as their robustness against local minima is detrimental. In this paper, we explore the use of four self-adaptive genetic algorithms (SAGAs) for the optimization of a recent evolutionary RBML system to reduce the number of hyperparameters to tune and hopefully find better minima. To evaluate the advantages, we benchmark against a non-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) on five real-world data sets. We find-with the support of a rigorous statistical analysis-that some of the SAGAs deliver a suitable alternative, which is easier to handle for non-experts in GA configurations. This is crucial for a wider application of this RBML method.},

Each particle selects its local and global learning targets based on the hidden nodes of SGNN. Besides, in the output layer, SGNN adjusts the local acceleration coefficient of each particle and hence the global one considering the relation between the two coefficients. A reinforcement learning manner is employed to obtain the desired output of SGNN. We define the significance and crowding degree metrics of hidden nodes, which aims to obtain a compact structure of SGNN. Incremental learning is leveraged to ensure the network approximation ability. In our experiments, we compare the proposed NN-PSO with five state-of-the-art dynamic optimization algorithms on moving peaks benchmark (MPB) benchmark test suite.

In the proposed method, radial basis functions are constructed to approximate each task&#39;s real function to guide the selection of new samples. Furthermore, an adaptive sampling strategy considering intertask similarities is applied to facilitate the convergence of multiple tasks and curb negative transfer.

Lévy ACO, which incorporates Lévy Flight (LF) into ACO, has been proposed as a more efficient method for solving CSPs. However, Lévy ACO has a fixed parameter that determines the frequency of LF use (LF parameter), throughout the search process, leading to reduce the efficiency of the search. In this paper, we propose a method to dynamically adjust the LF parameter according to the search progresses. We demonstrate that our method can solve large-scale and hard graph coloring problems, which is one of CSPs, more efficiently than the previous methods.},

  abstract  = {Automated design of heuristics with genetic programming (G P) has, in recent years, become an intensively researched research area. One of the most recent applications of this methodology is to generate relocation rules (RRs) for the container relocation problem (CRP). CRP is an important combinatorial optimisation problem that is found in ship ter-minals and warehouses. RRs are simple constructive heuristic methods that provide a good solution quickly, thus representing an alternative to computationally expensive exact or metaheuris-tic methods. Even though the RRs designed by GP provide an improvement over existing manually designed rules, they have limited performance. An efficient way to improve the performance of RRs generated by GP is to use ensemble learning. In this study, we apply ensemble learning on RRs generated by GP for CRP to improve the performance of individual rules. We investigate how different ensemble sizes and combination methods affect the quality of the results, as well as which rules are selected to form ensembles. The experimental study shows that ensembles constructed out of automatically designed RRs significantly improve performance compared to the individual rules.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection is a crucial step in the model-building pipeline in machine learning (ML) applications such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing, providing benefits on model performance and computational efficiency. EEG signals play a pivotal role in elucidating human nature through promising ML mechanisms. However, extracting a large number of features from the EEG signals can be a challenge of efficient EEG processing. A multi-objective feature selection strategy applied to the extracted features from EEG signals can simultaneously improve the accuracy of the process and reduce the number of features. However, the high dimensionality of the EEG feature vectors actually diminishes the exploration capabilities of multi-objective algorithms, impeding their real-world applicability. Hence, we propose a novel correlation-based multi-objective feature selection (COR-MFS) method, that aims to reduce dimensionality before applying the multi-objective algorithm. In the initial phase, a correlation-based dimension re-duction method is applied to filter the most relevant features with highest correlation with the class label. Subsequently, a multi-objective feature selection algorithm is applied to the shrunk search space enhancing optimization efficiency and facilitating the search process. We evaluated the proposed COR-MFS method using six large-scale EEG datasets and observed significant improvements compared to the stand-alone multi-objective feature selection. This underscores the effectiveness of our innovative framework in providing more accurate solutions with fewer number of features for extensive EEG-based classification tasks.},

Software (SW) is highly exposed, and SW companies are forced to protect their products from attacks to prevent plagiarism and the detection of security flaws. Obfuscation is a widespread technique to protect SW. It consists in making the code unintelligible, so that it is very hard to learn how it works. There are numerous obfuscation techniques, but they often require expert hands. Therefore, there is a clear need for fully automatic obfuscation tools that can offer high quality outputs independently of the specific features of the considered SW. In this work, we define a novel combinatorial optimization problem for a two-level obfuscation method that makes use of typical obfuscation transformations, those provided by Tigress framework, as well as classical optimization ones, those from LLVM compilation framework. The problem is solved with a cooperative co-evolutionary cellular genetic algorithm, providing a tool for automatic SW obfuscation. Three different obfuscation metrics are considered as fitness function. The results show that the proposed methodology offers outstanding obfuscation results, outperforming the original programs by up to 6,152,547%. Moreover, compared to approaches from the literature, these results are as much as 405 times better.},

  abstract  = {Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is paragon to maximize performance when designing machine learning models. Among different HPO methods, Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization is considered effective because it allows a wide and diverse range of solutions to be explored. However, GA&#39;s exploratory nature makes this type of algorithm to evaluate many solutions that do not improve the overall performance. This is specially costly when the objective function to be evaluated is time-consuming, like in the HPO field. In this paper, we propose an efficient hybrid algorithm that is able to reduce computational cost by combining deep reinforcement learning with the Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA), a variant of genetic algorithms. Our reinforcement learning agent has a decision-making role during the population&#39;s fitness calculation, in which it filters out chromosomes that would not improve the overall fitness of the population. The agent uses small amounts of pre-trained data to identify trends in potentially good solutions, and carry out its decision process. We conduct experiments on eight different datasets to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the computation time of hyperparameter search using BRKGA (up to 44% reduction in computational time) without compromising the quality of the solution (no statistically difference in results).},

  abstract  = {The application of deep learning techniques to medical problems has garnered widespread research interest in recent years, such as applying convolutional neural networks to medical image classification tasks. However, data in the medical field is often highly private, preventing different hospitals from sharing data to train an accurate model. Federated learning, as a privacy-preserving machine learning architecture, has shown promising performance in balancing data privacy and model utility by keeping private data on the client&#39;s side and using a central server to coordinate a set of clients for model training through aggregating their uploaded model parameters. Yet, this architecture heavily relies on a trusted third-party server, which is challenging to achieve in real life. Swarm learning, as a specialized decentralized federated learning architecture that does not require a central server, utilizes blockchain technology to enable direct parameter exchanges between clients. However, the mining of blocks requires significant computational resources, limiting its scalability. To address this issue, this paper integrates the brain storm optimization algorithm into the swarm learning framework, named BSO-SL. This approach clusters similar clients into different groups based on their model distributions. Additionally, leveraging the architecture of BSO, clients are given the probability to engage in collaborative learning both within their cluster and with clients outside their cluster, preventing the model from converging to local optima. The proposed method has been validated on a real-world diabetic retinopathy image classification dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Removing these nodes can potentially decrease computation time while maintaining the prediction accuracy. We employ the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) to identify a good set of nodes for removal, based on a predefined percentage reduction of the original graph size (e.g., retaining 95 % of the original graph). We evaluate different graph size configurations, ranging from 95 % to 70 % node retention, to determine the least impactful node set performance. Our experiments on three real-world datasets reveal that reducing nodes can decrease computation time by up to 29%, and as a byproduct of removing noise, even improve the prediction accuracy.},

MMOPs pose greater challenges for multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) as they require balancing the convergence and diversity of the population in both the decision space and the objective space. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel coevolutionary multiobjective optimization differential evolution algorithm with a niching-based reproduction and a preselection-based environmental selection mechanism, called NPCMODE. The algorithm introduces a niching-based reproduction, evolving solutions independently within multiple niches to generate more dispersed solutions in the decision space. Additionally, a preselection-based environmental selection mechanism priori-tizes solutions with low density in both decision and objective spaces through a dual-population coevolutionary framework. The efficiency of NPCMODE is validated through comparative experiments with six representative multimodal multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) on the CEC 2019 benchmark suite, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving a balance between convergence and diversity performance.},

However, this interaction requires the collection, integration, and communication of sensitive data, raising significant concerns about data vulnerability. Users are often concerned about the safety and management of their private information, which makes this crucial issue particularly relevant to the design of automatic services. To address this issue, we propose a novel trustful automatic sensitive service composition approach that leverages machine learning, including the Bayesian average, for accurate trust prediction. The proposed Majority Voting and Bayesian Average-based Trustful Service Composition (MVBA_ TSC) heuristic aims to generate a feasible and efficient service composition by dynamically managing a Trust Service Provider Network (TSPN). Our approach focuses on preserving user privacy by exclusively involving trustworthy service providers in the composition process. This heuristic is geared towards selecting the feasible composition by identifying the most reliable path within the trusted network, considering the Quality of Service (QoS) and trust dimensions among service providers. Experimental results confirmed that MVBA_TSC can improve the trustworthiness of sensitive service composition efficiency by 17 % compared to competitive solutions.},

This paper introduces a hybrid approach that combines the global exploration capabilities of the Covariance Matrix Adaption Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm with the localized search strategy of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, incorporating a new non-parametric surrogate model derived from the computational geometry structure of a convex hull in multiple dimensions. After running CMA-ES for some time, the populations of the two most recent iterations are collected to construct the convex approximation of the actual problem landscape. Since the population tends to converge in a landscape basin, the local landscape can be simulated using the constructed convex surrogate model. The accuracy of the convex surrogate model is subsequently validated by the historical solutions and used to determine the probability of switching to a local search. Given BFGS&#39;s superior performance in handling unimodal optimization problems, this hybrid approach demonstrates its potential to accelerate the convergence process in finding the global optimum. The experiment is conducted on test functions of the BBOB benchmark with a small evaluation budget, and the results after applying Mann-Whitney U tests confirm the superiority of this method compared to CMA-ES and another global-local framework APrMF.},

However, one drawback of many current GP-based DR methods is the high computational demands, potentially limiting their utility in high-dimensional scenarios. To tackle this issue, this work develops a new GP algorithm to achieve DR for classification. A divide-and-conquer strategy based on feature clustering is proposed to split the original feature set into multiple small feature groups. Each tree in the multi-tree GP is used to learn one high-level feature from each feature group. The performance of the proposed method is examined on 10 classification datasets with varying difficulty. The results indicate that the new GP method achieves significantly better classification performance than commonly used feature construction and feature selection methods. More importantly, the proposed GP method uses fewer nodes but achieves better or comparable classification accuracy than the baseline multi-tree GP method.},

This paper focuses on the multi-objectivization strategy of adding a helper objective. Depending on its definition, the helper objective might have a positive or negative impact on optimization. For multi-objectivization to work well, it is essential to select the helper objective with care, according to the nature of the target objective. However, the design of this helper objective remains unclear: should it be completely independent of the target objective or, by contrast, correlated in some respects? We propose and analyze different methods for generating helper objectives with varying degrees of correlation to the target objective, with the aim of guiding the setting of multi-objectivization. Inspired by existing works on multi-objective NK landscapes, we are particularly interested in the joint setting of the correlation between objective-values and the similarity of variable interactions on both objectives. We approximately decompose the target function into several sub-functions based on the Walsh transform. The proposed method combines these sub-functions to create helper objectives with different levels of correlation and heterogeneity. By analyzing bi-objective instances made of a target and of a helper objective under different definitions, we gain insights into the selection of helper objectives depending on the target objective. Our experimental findings suggest that a helper objective with a positive correlation and a smoother landscape is beneficial for multi-objectivization.},

An integrated ensemble genetic algorithm further evolves the best-performing ensembles from the LSTMs created in each generation of NSGA-II in an efficient manner, allowing all LSTMs evolved by NSGA-II to be explicitly considered for building ensembles.

  abstract  = {Many-objective optimizers based on Pareto domi-nance and its extensions rely on the effectiveness of the diversity preservation mechanism embedded in survival selection to achieve good performance. This work proposes Repeated $\varepsilon$ -Sampling, a survival selection method designed for elitist multi-objective algorithms to select a sample of well-distributed solutions in objective space from the non-dominated solutions set. The proposed method iteratively applies $\varepsilon$ -Sampling, a procedure that uses $\varepsilon$ -dominance to determine near solutions, increasing at each iteration the expansion rate used to compute $\varepsilon$ -dominance, gradually eliminating near solutions in objective space, starting with the closest ones. Compared to an adaptive $\varepsilon$ -Sampling method, we show that the proposed method improves the unifor-mity of the sample, leading to substantially better performance in many-objective epistatic problems in terms of convergence and diversity. We also show that a Pareto dominance-based many-objective optimizer with the proposed method finds Pareto sets with significantly better hypervolume than MOEA/D, a well-known decomposition-based algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Program synthesis (PS) is a field devoted to auto-matically generating computer programs from high-level specifications, and genetic programming (GP) is one commonly-used way to achieve PS. PushGP, operating on a stack-based language, is considered as a state-of-the-art program synthesizer among GPs, while another research trend foucus on the grammar-based languages due to the readability and the ease of maintenance. In this paper, we propose the repetitive structure genetic programming (RSGP), a new grammar-based program synthesizer under the pure functional programming paradigm. RSGP defines a recursive function to simulate the single-layer loop behavior and leverages the minimum redundancy maximum relevance $(\text{mRMR})$ feature selection with the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to select the capable and diverse programs for the next generation. The experiment results show that RSGP outperforms PushGP, CBGP, and HOTGP in terms of the number of successful programs on CountOdds and LastIndexofZero from PSBl, Luhn from PSB2, and 3 out of 4 designed problems. Additionally, the ablation study indicates that using $\text{mRMR}$ with PCC does encourage proper problem decomposition with the trade-off of diminishing the search ability within a similar neighborhood. RSGP utilizes an adaptation mechanism to balance the trade-off to automatically fit the needs of different problems.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a novel architecture for robotic control, called a Virtual Programmable Logic Device (VPLD) where the operation of the device can be dynamically configured using machine learning methods. The VPLD is based on the structure of a Programable Logic Device (PLD) comprising of a two-dimensional feed-forward array of function blocks, with each block containing multiplexers and function elements. However, the VPLD is implemented in software rather than hardware allowing the VPLD to be run on a CPU based system, such as PC&#39;s and ARM based embedded systems. The operation of the VPLD is determined by a configuration bitstream which configures the multiplexers (routing) and function elements of each block. A genetic algorithm is used to evolve the configuration bitstream to produce the walking gait of a hexapod robot. The controller performance and the evolutionary efficiency of the VPLD are compared with an evolved artificial neural network (ANN), and an evolvable hardware (EHW) device. It was found the VPLD and ANN had similar controller performance and evolutionary efficiency, while the EHW had a comparable controller performance however its evolutionary efficiency was poor. It is shown that the VPLD is a viable alternative to an ANN for evolutionary robotic control.},

  abstract  = {How to keep the information of most, if not all, of the searched solutions of a metaheuristic algorithm has been an important research issue in recent years. The main reason is because the information is very helpful in determining precisely the search directions during the convergence process. Recently, the space net optimization (SNO) was presented that attempts to use the information from most of the searched solutions to understand the solution (or objective) space landscape of the single objective bound constrained problem. In this study, a simplified version of SNO, called multi-objective simple space net optimization (MOSSNO), is presented to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. This algorithm adopts some essential mechanisms and operators of SNO; namely, (1) elastic points and space net to make it possible for a metaheuristic algorithm to depict the landscape of the objective space of an optimization problem and (2) expected values of different regions in the objective space to guide searches during the convergence process. Moreover, the proposed algorithm uses an external archive mechanism to save the nondominated solutions so that it is able to avoid searching the areas that have been searched before repeatedly. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide better results than the other multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) evaluated in this study in terms of the inverted generational distance (IGD) in most cases.},

  abstract  = {The agent-based financial market simulators serve as an important validation tool for trading strategies. For high-fidelity simulation, it is pivotal to calibrate the parameters of a simulator so that the generated simulation data resembles the observed real market data of interest. In traditional calibration methods, it is typical that the parameters of the simulator are set to be time-invariant. However, the dynamic nature of the real financial market introduces various variability into the behaviors of the market participants over different time intervals, posing in-herent limitations to the traditional methods. A more reasonable approach might involve employing a simulator with time-variant parameters. This suggests that the model parameters can be dynamically adjusted at different stages of the simulation to adapt to the evolving market. Consequently, the calibration problem of the financial market simulators can be treated as a dynamic optimization problem. To dynamically calibrate the simulators, we introduce an Evolutionary Dynamic Optimization (EDO) framework. By monitoring the changes of the best fitness, the whole simulation time interval is adaptively divided into multiple stages. Then the Negatively Correlated Search (NCS) algorithm is employed to effectively adjust the parameters at different simulation stages to better simulate the real financial market. Empirical results on both synthetic and real data verify that our dynamic calibration framework significantly outperforms traditional calibration methods that fixing a parameter for the whole simulation interval. The proposed strategy of detecting dynamic changes is also shown to be more reliable than the naive method of manually segmenting stages. In terms of calibration time, our proposed method significantly improves by nearly 93% compared to the fixed parameter setting, and approximately 61% compared to manual segmentation calibration.},

  abstract  = {The joint order batching and picker routing problem is an important problem for improving warehouse efficiency. The goal is to minimize the total distance travel of picking customer orders. It is NP-hard, indicating that exact solutions are intractable for large instances. Many solution methods provided in the current literature use local search to solve the problem sequentially, often including a complex searching procedure for the order batching problem (OBP) followed by a simple heuristic for the picker routing problem (PRP). In this paper, we propose three heuristics that jointly solves the OBP and the PRP: two of these are combinations of variable neighborhood search, simulated annealing, and tabu search, while the third one uses guided local search. We discuss how the search procedure of the proposed algorithms can be parallelized, and benchmark them against state-of-the-art heuristics using well-studied instances. The results show a reduction of 3.06% to 7.63% in the geometric mean of the total travel distance across 64 instances. Increasing the number of threads in parallelization leads to diminishing returns in reducing running time and has no statistical effect on travel distance. In contrast, increasing the chunk size results in a linear increase in running time for all proposed algorithms, and improves the travel distance obtained when the batch size is 75 items.},

  abstract  = {Assessing biochemical compositions of biomass from the fishing industry is challenging due to the complexity and seasonal variability of biological samples. Raman spectroscopy is often applied to measure complex biological samples, thereby enabling rapid quality control by associating the spectra with biochemical reference data using methods such as partial least squares regression. However, a small number of samples, noisy or misleading signals, and collinearity, often seen in real-world spectroscopic data, can negatively impact the fitting quality and inference capability of partial least squares regression. Feature selection is widely used to select a small and informative subset of the original features that can improve modeling performance, however, this is not always easy to achieve especially due to the aforementioned issues inherent to spectroscopic data. We address these issues by proposing a Genetic Algorithm-based feature selection approach for spectroscopic data acquired from New Zealand hoki and mackerel species. First, we apply a mathematical correction to the Raman signal most suited for each target composition, thereby reducing the effect of noise, irrelevant optical artifacts, and misleading signals. Next, we carefully curate a cross-validated feature selection process to circumvent the low number of samples using a new representation and fitness function to reduce regression error and balance model complexity. Our findings indicate that the proposed method can improve the fitting quality and inference capability of partial least squares regression over using the full set spectroscopic data. Lastly, we analyse the density of selected features to highlight the most salient signals.},

Installing hardware devices in the network&#39;s server center faces many limitations, such as difficulties in device replacement, high investment costs, and operating expenses. The emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology has addressed these drawbacks. This technology replaces dedicated hardware with software running in a virtualized environment, offering a more flexible and scalable solution. However, resource allocation is a critical concern in NFV networks. Proper resource allocation can enhance service quality and reduce network deployment costs. This paper investigates the network resource allocation problem to achieve two objectives: i) reduce network deployment costs and ii) decrease the latency of service chains in the network. We propose the modification of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm 2, called NSGA2-H, to solve the multi-objective problem. The distinctive feature of the proposed algorithm, compared to the traditional NSGA2, is the use of a selective mutation operator. This mutation occurs on individuals at the first front, resembling a shift operation to enhance the algorithm&#39;s exploration capability. Experimental results on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {The Knapsack Problem (KP) is a renowned combinatorial optimization challenge, recognized for its NP-hard complexity. This characteristic renders large-scale KP instances resistant to resolution through exact algorithms. In our research, we introduce an enhanced version of the discrete fireworks algorithm, specifically tailored to address various large-scale KP instances. This advancement involves a re-encoding of the original fireworks algorithm and its adaptation into a discrete format, thereby equipping it to effectively tackle discrete KP challenges. Furthermore, we have integrated a probability mechanism and a historical information learning mechanism into the algorithm. These innovations enable the algorithm to assimilate and utilize historical data, significantly augmenting its capability to explore solutions. This enhancement not only accelerates the algorithm&#39;s convergence but also improves its proficiency in identifying optimal solutions. Additionally, we have developed a dual-population strategy to optimize the balance between exploration and exploitation performances of the algorithm. Comparative experimental analyses demonstrate that our modified algorithm exhibits rapid convergence, successfully avoids entrapment in local optima, and efficiently resolves large-scale KPs within a reasonable time, outperforming other evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract  = {3D point cloud registration is a fundamental task in computer vision, aimed at estimating a transformation to align a pair of point clouds. For point cloud registration, where the popular methods are used to build a compatibility graph. Different methods of constructing compatibility graphs can result in different information regions to be searched in the graph, due to varying constraints. Evolutionary multitask optimization has gained attention in the field of evolutionary computation, as it enables knowledge transfer among multitasks to enhance the exploration of information. Inspired by this theory, this paper proposes a method to utilize compatibility graphs as tasks through evolutionary multitasking for solving the problem of point cloud registration. We first construct two compatibility graph tasks with different tightness constraints for point cloud registration. Due to the different constraints of the two proposed tasks, the local information of the graph of interest might be biased. This bias can be effectively utilized in the evolutionary multitasking framework to enhance the ability to discover meaningful consensus relationships in the search space of the graph. Then we map the two tasks to a unified search space by designing clique selection strategies, and carrying out knowledge transfer between the two tasks, aiming to emphasize more on the local consensus information in the graphs. Lastly, the efficacy of our proposed method is further validated on multiple registration datasets.},

For this purpose, this paper proposes Novelty-based Multi-objectivization with Local and Rough Search based on dynamic area exploration (NM-LRS), which adds the novelty criterion in the given optimization criteria to roughly search the unbounded search space for obtaining the “potential area” where the optimal solution is most likely located and then searches the “potential area” to find the optimal solution by a local search. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, NM-LRS is compared with the other optimization methods for the unbounded search space, and the following implications have been revealed: the proposed method has a higher solution-finding rate than all existing methods for functions with complex landscapes, and it also finds the optimal solution far from the initial search area, which confirms the effectiveness of a rough search.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary knowledge transfer (EKT) has emerged in the past few years as a new genre of strategy for equipping search and optimization algorithms with prior knowledge. Most EKT research, however, has been dominated by a small number of narrow benchmark functions that do not reflect the diversity of ways problems may be related in different domains. In this paper, we present a preliminary step toward good benchmark design for evolutionary knowledge transfer, by examining four simple benchmark task sets. These cover real-valued, modularly varying goals, and Boolean circuit synthesis domains (where we use Cartesian genetic programming for the latter). We perform experiments with different source-task target pairs drawn from these domains, where we measure the degree to which transfer is successful. Results with a basic population-seeding transfer strategy show that these domain benchmarks illustrate a continuum of difficulty for knowledge reuse, and that a many-source transfer approach that uses population seeding as a form of source selection can dramatically reduce the cost of finding the best knowledge source for a given target task. We anticipate that benchmarks such as these can help the community get a stronger understanding of when and why knowledge transfer is useful, and how problem similarities can best be exnloited.},

First we consider the number of occurrences of each protein in each tuberculosis genome, then we only consider the presence or absence of proteins in a genome and generate binary sequences. Depending on their frequency of apparition, some proteins are discarded in order to reduce the number of predictive attributes. Classifiers composed of multiple binary masks are evolved through a dedicated evolutionary algorithm in order to reach optimal classification performances. We show that the performances obtained by such classifiers on binary presence sequences are quite good in comparison to the performances of classical machine learning techniques such as decision trees on protein occurrence data. All models investigated in this work are easily interpretable as it is important to get some insight about which proteins are important for prediction.},

  abstract  = {Path planning is the core of autonomous robot navigation, which helps the robot to find a collision-free path to the destination based on the environment information. Most current path planning methods only consider the path length, but the optimal path may deviate from the shortest when considering other environmental factors such as uneven terrain or regions with varying traversal costs. Similarly, in scenarios prioritizing energy efficiency, a sole focus on path length may lead to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, an improved Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) with adaptive weight vector, external archive, and constrained update strategy namely the MOEA/D-EAWA is proposed. This algorithm not only considers the path length but also four additional objectives such as smoothness, traveling time, terrain (elevation), and speed limit (expected delay). In addition, MOEA/D-EAWA is better suited for such many-objective path planning problem which has an irregular, discrete, and sparse Pareto front. The simulation results from 90 map instances demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches.},

In contrast to this, Laplacian dynamics (LD) is an approach to consider the information flow across a network as a dynamical process. We adapt and apply LD to the context of LONs. As a testbed, we consider instances from the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) library. Metrics related to LD are proposed and these are compared with existing LON metrics. The results show that certain LD metrics are strong predictors of metaheuristic performance for iterated local search and tabu search.},

  abstract  = {The job shop scheduling problem is an important combinatorial optimisation problem in the real world. Genetic programming hyper-heuristic has been successfully applied to automatically evolve effective dispatching rules to make a schedule in real time without much domain knowledge. However, the interpretability of GP-evolved rules has been largely neglected, which could lead to the lack of reliability and trustworthiness of the evolved rules in practice. Current work related to interpretable genetic programming algorithms primarily uses the model size as the interpretability metric. This could not fully reflect the interpretability of evolved rules. To overcome the limitation, we employ structural complexity and dimension gap as more comprehensive interpretability measures. In addition, a new multi-objective genetic programming algorithm, which applies the a non-dominated sorting method to solve the objective selection bias issue, is proposed to optimise the makespan (scheduling objective), structural complexity and dimension gap simultaneously. A variety of experiments demonstrates the competitive performance of our proposed algorithm based on effectiveness, convergence and diversity. Furthermore, the semantics of evolved dispatching rules are analysed to show their better interpretability.},

FlexKalmanNet&#39;s core innovation is its ability to learn any Kalman filter parameter directly from measurement data, coupled with the flexibility to utilize various Kalman filter variants. This is achieved through a notable design decision to outsource the sequential computation from the neural network to the Kalman filter variant, enabling a purely feedforward neural network architecture. This architecture, proficient at handling complex, nonlinear features without the dependency on recurrent network modules, captures global data patterns more effectively. Empirical evaluation using data from NASA&#39;s Astrobee simulation environment focuses on learning unknown parameters of an Extended Kalman filter for spacecraft pose and twist estimation. The results demonstrate FlexKalmanNet&#39;s rapid training convergence, high accuracy, and superior performance against manually tuned Extended Kalman filters.},

  abstract  = {One important application of machine learning is the analysis of electroencephalographic recordings (EEG). Such oscillatory signals are noisy, non-stationary, full of artifacts, contain transients, and chaotic transitions between meta-stable states. EEG data rarely consists of recordings obtained for more than 100 patients with some brain disorder. This makes objective, reliable clinical diagnosis of many mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, very difficult. The standard approach splits the frequency of EEG oscillations focusing on five classical bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. In this paper, we investigate three main questions: (i) Are there certain frequencies that will allow for a reliable diagnosis of schizophrenia, and (ii) if they are, is there a connection to what is known about their neural basis? (iii) How long segments of EEG recordings are sufficient for reliable classification? We filter EEG signals, obtaining a set of 64 very narrow 1Hz frequency bands. A genetic algorithm, with a simple k-NN classifier, finds an optimal combination of these bands. The method is sufficiently simple to be used in clinical settings. A public schizophrenia EEG data set, containing 60 seconds of EEG recordings in the resting state, with only 16 electrodes, for 45 adolescent patients and 39 healthy controls, was used for testing. Signal duration of about 30 seconds enables to reach an accuracy of over 96% in 5-fold cross-validation tests. We compare our results to much more sophisticated state-of-the- art methods and discuss insights gained by our analysis into the brain basis of schizophrenia.},

  abstract  = {The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP, including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}^{1}$ (construct by “ $+/-1$ ‘), a toy UBQP with matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}^{2}$ (construct by “ $+/-\mathrm{i}$ ’) and a toy UBQP with matrix $\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}^{3}$ (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with $\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}^{1}$ (construct by “ $+/-1$ ”) exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with $\hat{Q}^{3}$ (construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using the toy UBQP with $\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}^{2}$ (construct by “ $+/\cdot \mathbf{i})$ emerges as the most effective, while $\hat{\boldsymbol{Q}}^{3}$ (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in optimizing UBQP.},

  abstract  = {Recent improvements in pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated increasing capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, such as instruction following. However, effectively utilizing LLMs in interactive environments that require advanced reasoning, planning, and decision-making skills remains a challenge. In this study, we integrate Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) with LLMs, thereby extending their capabilities to interact in natural language domains. To accommodate the integration, especially the rule represented in natural language, we propose a novel Rule Optimization method using LLMs for Imitation Learning (ROIL) in text-based interactive environments. ROIL addresses rule learning by lever-aging LLMs to optimize rules based on human demonstrations, thus eliminating the need for trial-and-error learning processes and ensuring both interpretability and safety. It also tackles the challenge of learning transferable skills in these environments. We evaluate the efficacy of ROIL in the WebShop environment, a text-based e-commerce website navigation problem. The method achieved a significant performance and efficiency improvement over a strong baseline, while demonstrating performance close to a gradient-based imitation learning approach.

  abstract  = {Conceptual architecture involves a highly creative exploration of novel ideas, often taken from other disciplines as architects consider radical new forms, materials, textures and colors for buildings. While today&#39;s generative AI systems can produce remarkable results, they lack the creativity demonstrated for decades by evolutionary algorithms. SCAPE, our proposed tool, combines evolutionary search with generative AI, enabling users to explore creative and good quality designs inspired by their initial input through a simple point and click interface. SCAPE injects randomness into generative AI, and enables memory, making use of the built-in language skills of GPT -4 to vary prompts via text-based mutation and crossover. We demonstrate that compared to DALL. E 3, SCAPE enables a 67% improvement in image novelty, plus improvements in quality and effectiveness of use; we show that in just three iterations SCAPE has a 24% image novelty increase enabling effective exploration, plus optimization of images by users. We use more than 20 independent architects to assess SCAPE, who provide markedly positive feedback.},

Recent studies showed that a solution set selected from an external archive is usually superior to the final population. That is, the incorporation of an external archive improves the performance of EMOAs. However, the computation time for maintaining an external archive is long, especially when the archive size is large. To solve this issue, a simple archiving strategy is to save all solutions generated in the last several generations. In this paper, we examine this archiving strategy for three representative EMOAs on artificial test problems (Minus-DTLZ and WFG) and real-world problems (RE). Our results show that archiving the last several generations clearly improves the performance of EMOAs without severely increasing the computation time.},

  abstract  = {The multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) is a challenging problem for researchers and practitioners in operations research and project management. MRCPSP involves both selecting the execution mode for each activity and sequencing the activities in the schedule. Thus, activity prioritisation and mode selection are the two main decisions in building a project schedule. A rule-based heuristic approach is commonly used for solving this problem in practical complex scenarios. However, designing effective project scheduling rules highly relies on the expertise of professionals and domain knowledge. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic (GPHH) to design heuristic rules automatically. Various decision strategies based on decision orders are proposed and their impact on the capacity of GPHH to learn effective scheduling rules is investigated. The experiment results demonstrate the evolved rules generated by GPHH outperform the existing manual heuristic rules and making two decisions simultaneously is identified as the most effective strategy.},

  abstract  = {In the community of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), one important issue is the choice of test problems for performance evaluations of EMO algorithms. This is because performance evaluation results of EMO algorithms totally depend on the choice of test problems. This means that the research on new EMO algorithm design is also influenced by the choice of test problems. Recently, researchers have started to use real-world problems for performance evaluation of EMO algorithms. Among them, a real-world problem suite RE has attracted much attention and has been used in many studies. However, most RE problems have been created from real-world constrained problems by using the total constraint violation as an additional objective. That is, the original versions of most RE problems are not unconstrained multi-objective problems. Thus, even when a good solution set is obtained by an EMO algorithm for an RE problem, it can be a poor solution set for its original constrained problem. This is because many well-distributed solutions over the entire Pareto front of the transformed unconstrained problem are usually infeasible solutions of the original constrained problem with some positive total constraint violation values. In this paper, we examine whether good solution sets obtained by EMO algorithms for RE problems are also good solution sets for their original constrained problems. Our experimental results show that good solutions sets for most RE problems include good feasible solution sets for their original constrained problems. However, for a few RE problems, good solution sets obtained by some high performance EMO algorithms do not include good feasible solution sets. Our results show that high-performance EMO algorithms on most RE problems generate good feasible solution sets for their original constrained versions. This observation supports the usefulness of those RE problems as test problems for performance evaluation of EMO algorithms.},

For a team to be considered as effective, it requires to comply with a task-specific skills set while also showing a high degree of cohesiveness. Although team effectiveness is subject to multiple criteria, the study of the problem from a multi-objective (MO) perspective is still scarce. In this paper, we focus on an MO TFP-SN whose objective is to maximize the team&#39;s level of expertise and the team&#39;s density, simultaneously. To solve this problem, we introduce two novel recombination operators to be used within the framework of the well-known NSGA-II. Our proposed crossover operators act as heuristics that compute the parents&#39; unique and shared information, which is then combined for generating potentially improved offspring. Our experiments show that each of the two proposed crossover operators lead to significantly better results when compared to a naive crossover operator taken from the specialized literature. Particularly, the results consistently show higher hypervolume values when compared to the use of an adaptation of a simple recombination operator commonly used for this problem. The good performance of our proposed operators may be attributed to the incorporation of knowledge that exploits the structure of the problem.},

However, generalization-the ability to perform well in related but unseen scenarios-is an essential requirement that remains an unsolved challenge for game AI. Generalization is difficult for imitation learning agents because it requires the algorithm to take meaningful actions outside of the training distribution. In this paper we propose a solution to this challenge. Inspired by the success of data augmentation in supervised learning, we augment the training data so the distribution of states and actions in the dataset better represents the real state-action distribution. This study evaluates methods for combining and applying data augmentations to observations, to improve generalization of imitation learning agents. It also provides a performance benchmark of these augmentations across several 3D environments. These results demonstrate that data augmentation is a promising framework for improving generalization in imitation learning agents.},

EGT-DE promotes the competition among agents through the exchange of information about the search space, the modification of strategies, and the regulation of exploration and exploitation behaviors. The proposed EGT-DE algorithm was tested against nine well-known algorithms on a set of 30 benchmark functions in 50 dimensions. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Friedman test were used to determine the significance of the EGT -DE approach.

While traditional methods have predominantly focused on minimizing travel distances and vehicle numbers, recent innovations acknowledge the need for a more refined balance across various objectives. These advancements incorporate a range of heuristic algorithms, blending hybrid techniques that merge genetic algorithms with local search strategies, and employing advanced methodologies such as particle swarm optimization and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Such developments signify a shift towards more effective solutions for VRPTW. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that integrates MOEA/D with K-means clustering for generating efficient solutions. In our approach, we refine the tri-objective VRPTW efficiency by establishing a criterion that prioritizes customer sequences based on their spatial proximity and angular alignment relative to cluster centers and depot, utilizing an integrated metric of distance and cosine angles, which can enhance the local search process and effectively balance the three objectives in VRPTW. Experimental results on Solomon&#39;s 56 VRPTW 100-customer dataset instances demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

This study proposes a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm for distributed simulation-based inventory optimization in serial supply chains. We propose a surrogate-assisted multi-strategy differential evolution algorithm. Two search strategies are used to generate candidate solutions, and two surrogate models filter the candidate solutions. A regression model is used to estimate the total cost, and a classification model is trained to estimate the feasibility of the solutions. Then, we develop a distributed simulation method for estimating each stage&#39;s performance for a given inventory policy while allowing the simulation models to be located in different locations. Our proposed approach is evaluated using 10-stage serial supply chain problems. The results show that the proposed surrogate-assisted distributed simulation-based optimization method can obtain significantly better solutions than the baseline algorithms. In addition, the distributed simulation method can accurately estimate the supply chain&#39;s total cost and service level.},

When addressing this complex problem, conventional heuristic algorithms have exhibited limitations in effectiveness, primarily due to the need for expert knowledge in heuristic design, which often prioritizes immediate improvements and leads to convergence towards local optima. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep Q-network-based iterated local search algorithm (DQN-ILS). This algorithm employs a deep Q-learning network to automatically learn a policy for selecting heuristics to improve the current solution. Simultaneously, an adaptive perturbation strategy is designed to avoid becoming trapped in local optima. In this way, our algorithm can better balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation when solving VRPPDTW.

  abstract  = {Hyperparameter optimization in machine learning involves finding the best values for hyperparameters that control a learning algorithm&#39;s predicting abilities. Exhaustively exploring all possible combinations is infeasible due to the wide range of potential hyperparameter values. Moreover, the number of predicting features in a dataset is often vast, which is common in practical applications like diagnosing or classification in the medical domain. Traditional optimization methods focus on maximizing a single metric, often neglecting trade-offs between multiple performance measures like accuracy and recall. Balancing these metrics is especially crucial in healthcare, where decisions directly impact patients. This work introduces a multi-objective evolutionary approach for simultaneously tuning hyperparameters for the applied machine learning models and reducing feature space to predict Deep Vein Thrombosis, an area with limited exploration. By optimizing accuracy and recall jointly, the proposed approach generates a set of Pareto-optimal solutions from which decision-makers can choose based on preferences or requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach offers Pareto-optimal solutions that outperform those obtained using a complete set of features. Overall, the study showcases the effectiveness of the proposed technique in enhancing predictive modeling for healthcare applications.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can not handle expensive optimization problems (EOPs) well due to the limited function evaluations in EOPs. To address this challenge, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been widely used and obtained good performance. With the problem dimension increases, SAEAs encounter some challenges in relatively high complexity on the training time and prediction time. To address this, this article proposes a novel expensive optimization algorithm with evolutionary multi-tasking and hybrid restart strategy (HRS-EMT). In the surrogate model construct, two radial basis function (RBF) models with different kernel functions are trained on all evaluated data to provide diversity and then are solved by a multi-tasking optimizer to a better optimization performance. In the surrogate model management, HRS-EMT combines multiple RBF models into an ensemble RBF (ERBF) model, strategically applied in the initial population pre-selection of surrogate model. Based on the prediction of ERBF surrogate model, HRS-EMT can obtain a better initial population in high dimensions. HRS-EMT is validated on twelve benchmark functions and compared with other state-of-the-art SAEAs. Experimental studies have shown the superior or comparable performance to other popular SAEAs in addressing EOPs.},

  abstract  = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have emerged as a promising approach to addressing expensive and black-box problems. Most existing SAEAs leverage regression models to predict the objective values, reducing the use of true objective functions. However, these methods focus on learning the mapping from the decision space to the objective space and may fail to reveal the relationship between solutions in the decision space. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted increased attention due to their powerful ability to expose sample interaction. In this paper, we propose employing a graph neural network for learning embeddings of solutions in the decision space, followed by a classification task aimed at predicting dominance relationships between solutions in the objective space and a regression task for obtaining the estimated fitness values. To this end, we generate a graph at each generation to represent the topology relationship between solutions in the decision space, where nodes represent solutions, and edges are added depending on the Euclidean distances between nodes. In addition, a new acquisition function that adaptively weights the predictions on objective values and dominance relationships is proposed to effectively identify new samples. The performance of the proposed method is examined by extensive empirical studies on a widely used test suite in comparison to its peer algorithms, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {In the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks became an industry standard achieving state-of-the-art results for many computer vision tasks. This unprecedented success has been possible due to the use of massive amounts of visual and multimodal data. However, management of these data must comply with the regulations on privacy protection, i.e. personal data should be anonymized. Traditional image anonymization methods such as blurring, masking, pixelating are efficient in the obfuscation of the sensitive data. Still, recent research has indicated that these methods impact in the negative way the performance of computer vision models. Numerous deep learning anonymization methods have been proposed as an alternative, in particular for human face and body anonymization. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these approaches are task-specific and require training. Other methods, although general, rely on full access to the computer vision model (the so-called white-box methods). Here, we propose a novel adaptive image anonymization method that allows one to achieve high concordance of the classification model predictions on the original and anonymized image. It is gradient-free, agnostic to anonymized objects, and to the particular architecture and weights of the computer vision model used. Finally, the proposed method does not require modifications to the computer vision model. The main idea of the approach introduced in this paper is to consider image anonymization as an optimization problem and to solve it using the iFDA metaheuristics algorithm. Experiments conducted on the large-scale benchmark image dataset ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. When applying the proposed adaptive image anonymization method, the class concordance rate obtained was 98.11%, as opposed to 74.47% obtained by traditional anonymization.},

To address this issue, this paper formulates DTPPs into a large-scale multi-objective optimization problem and solves it using an evolutionary algorithm embedded with heuristic strategies. The proposed algorithm can quickly approach the optimal solution of DTPPs and can be seamlessly embedded into various evolutionary algorithms. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, statistical experiments are carried out on the DTPP with nine real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has significant advantages over several representative evolutionary algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential tool for medical diagnosis. At the same time, its usage requires profound expert knowledge to determine the ideal MR sequence and protocol to be run. Until now, the contrast and quality of the resulting image have relied mainly on the radiologist&#39;s expertise. When confronted with clinical requirements and patient information, the radiologist chooses suitable sequence protocols for the examination. We propose a workflow that supports medical personnel in finding the optimal sequence for a given diagnostic task. To that end, we combine evolutionary algorithms for the optimisation, machine learning techniques for training a surrogate optimisation function from simulated MRI data, and domain-specific languages to allow non-programmers to formulate their requirements and constraints semi-formally. In this paper, we focus on the efficient usage of real-world application-motivated adaptions of the used evolutionary algorithm and evaluate their effects on four real-life sequence examples. We show that it is essential to use an adaption for the surrogate model to obtain realistic solutions and use correlation information about the search space to stay in feasible areas of the search space and thus improve optimisation quality. These findings are a first step in automating the entire MRI-sequence optimisation flow, which is necessary to allow a more widespread usage of this essential medical diagnostic technique.},

The experimental outcomes reveal that, contrary to traditional beliefs, voice-leading alone can yield intriguing harmonic progressions. The results challenge the boundaries of functional harmony, showcasing the adaptability and creative potential of the proposed computational framework. Notably, the exploration of six-four chord applications deviates from traditional pedagogical norms, demonstrating the rich possibilities unlocked by delving into the foundational forces shaping harmonic progressions. Audible sound files for the six-voice outcomes along with further realizations by a human composer of the obtained harmonic progressions are provided to offer a direct experience of this computational approach. Through these endeavors, this work not only contributes to setting the groundwork for a comprehensive compositional algorithm but also underscores the significance of voice-leading as a foun-dational force in shaping musical expression.

We aim to develop automated decision-support tools that can help government agencies detect and mitigate tax loopholes earlier than is possible with the current manual approaches. Here we introduce a benchmark of realistic tax avoidance scenarios based on simulations of corporations and partnerships and the financial actions that they can take. To establish baselines on this benchmark, we implement two evolutionary representations for taxpayer decisions with two different approaches to representing a business&#39;s tax-planning policies.

  abstract  = {Approximate computing, leveraging the inherent resilience to errors, emerges as a promising strategy for reducing power consumption in digital systems. The primary objective of this paper is to introduce an efficient method based on Cartesian Genetic Programming for designing approximate arithmetic circuits with commutative property. Specifically, this work focuses on the design of 8-bit approximate multipliers and 32-bit approximate adders, both serving as foundational components for hardware accelerators in neural networks. We have identified that while the design of commutative approximate adders poses no issues for evolution, the design of commutative approximate multipliers represents a challenging problem causing the commonly used CGP stuck at highly sub-optimal solutions. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel application-specific mutation operator. This operator significantly enhances the efficiency of the search process, enabling the discovery of solutions that were previously unreachable. The achieved results revealed that imposing the requirement for a commutative property does not substantially compromise the quality-error trade-offs of the obtained approximate circuits, making the resulting Pareto front comparable to that of unconstrained designs.},

However, this algorithm has two important limitations: The two kinds of heuristics are performed evenly on each individuals which may weaken the algorithm efficiency; The Pareto Front in objective space may be uneven but the initial weight vectors of MACSoc is even. This may lead to diversity losing. We proposed a new algorithm MACSoc with adaptive heuristics and weight vectors (MACSoc-AH) which contains the following improvements: The two kinds of heuristics are executed on individuals based on the their characteristics; A weight vector adjusting process with a original trigger is added to improve diversity.

To address this, this paper develops a two-stage approach using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automatically learn a feature set that can effectively classify crops using remote sensing images. In the first stage of the new approach, a GP method is applied to automatically construct a set of high-level features by evolving tree-based solutions. In the second stage, a GA method is employed to select a small subset of features from the constructed features and the original features by removing redundant ones. The performance of the new approach is evaluated on three datasets in two scenarios, i.e., classifying four main crop types and all crop types, respectively. The results demonstrate that the new approach achieves more accurate crop classification compared with eight competitive methods.},

A common approach is to combine balancing strategies with feature selection algorithms to address this problem. However, this may result in feature subsets that cannot accurately represent the true data distribution. This paper proposes an imbalanced fault diagnosis method called RPLFS-MOBPSO, which combines region purity (RP) with local feature selection to achieve class balance implicitly by partitioning local regions. RP is used as a new objective in the optimization process to achieve accurate fault detection. The adaptive reference point method from Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III is employed to maintain a diverse and evenly distributed external archive. On both the simulated Tennessee Eastma (TE) benchmark datasets and the real bearing experimental bench datasets, the proposed method achieves the best results compared to two LFS methods and four imbalanced ensemble algorithms based on different balancing strategies.

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) is an important combinatorial optimisation problem that aims to optimise machine resources to improve production efficiency. Multi-tree genetic programming (MTGP) has been widely used to learn the routing rule and the sequencing rule for DFJSS simultaneously. Unlike traditional genetic programming that only operates crossover on a single tree, MTGP has various cases to conduct crossover since a genetic programming individual consists of more than one tree. Different crossover operators may affect the performance of MTGP for DFJSS. However, the investigation into different crossover operators in MTGP for DFJSS is rare. Specifically, it is not clear what influence will have on MTGP if involving both the routing rule and the sequencing rule for crossover. To this end, this paper provides a comprehensive investigation of four possible crossover cases between multiple scheduling heuristics with MTGP for DFJSS. The four operators are designed according to the number of trees/rules that crossover operator works on, and whether swapping full trees between parents. The results show that although the compared algorithms have comparable results in most scenarios, MTGP with both rules for crossover and the swapping strategy is ranked as the best one. Further analyses show that the sizes of learned rules are highly related to the crossover operators, and crossover involving more rules can increase the rule sizes, and vice versa. In addition, the population diversity and the number of unique features in the learned rules of MTGP with both rules for crossover are increased to learn effective rules.},
