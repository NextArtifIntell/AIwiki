  abstract  = {A compact broadband dual-polarized antenna is proposed for 3G/4G/5G base station applications. The main radiator is composed of two crossed dipoles contoured by cubic Hermite spline interpolation method to obtain compact size. In order to shorten design period, a multiobjective optimization technique is adopted through synthesizing multiple performance characteristics simultaneously and thus avoiding extensive structural parameter analysis. For antenna designers, this paper provides a novel design method for broadband dual-polarized base station antennas with stable radiation patterns and small gain variations from the perspective of optimization. The proposed dual-polarized antenna achieves a bandwidth of 66.4\% (1.83–3.65 GHz). The measured port isolation is higher than 28 dB. Within the working band, the realized gain is more than 8.1 dBi, and gain variations are smaller than 0.5 dB. The half-power beamwidth (HPBW) is within 65˚ ± 3˚. The cross polarization discrimination (XPD) level is better than 20 dB at boresight and better than 13 dB within a sector of ±60˚.},

  abstract  = {Emergency resource dispatch plays a significant role in the occurrence of emergency events. An efficient schedule solution not only can deliver the required resources in time, but also can reduce the loss in the disaster area. Recently, many scholars are dedicated to dealing with emergency resource dispatch problem (ERDP) by constructing a model with one objective (e.g., the cost to transport resources or the satisfaction degree of people in the disaster area) and solving the model with single objective optimization algorithms. In this paper, we build a multi-objective model that considers both the cost objective and the satisfaction objective, which takes into account multiple retrieval depots and multiple kinds of resources. We propose to solve this multi-objective ERDP optimization model via the recently famous coevolutionary multiswarm particle swarm optimization (CMPSO) algorithm. Based on multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework, the CMPSO algorithm uses two populations to optimize the above two objectives respectively, and leads particles to find Pareto optimal solutions by storing information of different populations in a shared archive. We construct ERDP with various scales to validate the feasibility of the applied CMPSO algorithm. Moreover, by setting the satisfaction objective as the constraint, we also compare the results obtained by CMPSO with those obtained by constrained single objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Experimental results show that: 1) the nondominated solutions obtained by CMPSO perform well in both convergence and diversity on two objectives; 2) the results on the cost objective obtained by CMPSO are generally superior to those of PSO under same degree of satisfaction.},

  abstract  = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been widely used in the field of remote sensing image change detection. However, its disadvantage of strong coherent multiplicative noise reduces the accuracy of change detection results. This paper proposes a novel SAR image change detection method, which is mainly comprised of three steps. Firstly, the difference image (DI) which is generated by log-ratio operator is segmented into superpixels by Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) Algorithm. Secondly, superpixels are encoded uniformly in order to be utilized as the training samples, and deep neural network is used to extract deep features of DI. Finally, this paper designs an improved clustering algorithm which is optimized by Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). When the deep features of DI are used to cluster, Bhattacharyya distance between two categories of samples is selected as the similarity measurement. Taking the logarithmic likelihood function of clustering algorithm and the Bhattacharyya distance between the two categories as two optimization objectives, NSGA-II algorithm is used to optimize the model, and a set of pareto optimal solutions are thus generated. Compared with various indexes for accuracy evaluation, the map which has the highest accuracy is the final change detection map. Experimental results on real synthetic aperture radar datasets show that the proposed method is superior to other classical change detection methods, which demonstrates its effectiveness, feasibility, and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Different theoretical mechanisms have been proposed for explaining complex social phenomena. For example, explanations for observed trends in population alcohol use have been postulated based on norm theory, role theory, and others. Many mechanism-based models of phenomena attempt to translate a single theory into a simulation model. However, single theories often only represent a partial explanation for the phenomenon. The potential of integrating theories together, computationally, represents a promising way of improving the explanatory capability of generative social science. This paper presents a framework for such integrative model discovery, based on multi-objective grammar-based genetic programming (MOGGP). The framework is demonstrated using two separate theory-driven models of alcohol use dynamics based on norm theory and role theory. The proposed integration considers how the sequence of decisions to consume the next drink in a drinking occasion may be influenced by factors from the different theories. A new grammar is constructed based on this integration. Results of the MOGGP model discovery process find new hybrid models that outperform the existing single-theory models and the baseline hybrid model. Future work should consider and further refine the role of domain experts in defining the meaningfulness of models identified by MOGGP.},

  abstract  = {Datacenters are critical to the commercial and social activities of modern society but are also major electricity consumers. To minimize their environmental impact, we must make datacentres more efficient whilst keeping the quality of service high. In this work we consider how a key datacenter component, Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), can be placed in the datacenter to optimise the conflicting objectives of minimizing service latency, packet loss and energy consumption. Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed to solve the Virtual Network Function Placement Problem (VNFPP), but state of the art algorithms are too slow to solve the large problems found in industry. Parallel Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (PMOEAs) can reduce execution time by distributing the optimization process over many processes. However, this can hamper the search process as it is inefficient to share information between processes. This paper aims to determine whether PMOEAs can efficiently discover good solutions to the VNFPP. We found that PMOEAs can solve the VNFPP 5–10 $$\times $$ faster than a sequential MOEA without harming solution quality. Additionally, we found that one parallel algorithm, PPLS/D, found better solutions than other MOEAs and PMOEAs in most test instances. These results demonstrate that PMOEAs can solve the VNFPP faster, and in some instances better, than sequential MOEAs.},

It has been demonstrated is Pareto optimization is quite effective in coping with NP-hard problems. We theoretically compare POIM with a greedy algorithm, which is a widely used algorithm for mining influential seed nodes. We prove that POIM can obtain the best-so-far theoretically guaranteed approximation performance. Empirical studies verify the theoretical results and show the effectiveness of POIM.},

To achieve these objectives, an intelligent multi-microgrid energy management method is proposed based on the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) techniques, leading to a Pareto optimal set.

  abstract  = {Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) exist widely in real-world applications, and they are challenging for existing evolutionary algorithms due to their massive volume of search space. Despite that a number of large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (LSMOEAs) have been proposed in recent years, their effectiveness in solving LSMOPs remains unsatisfactory. One main reason is that most existing LSMOEAs may fail to balance convergence enhancement and diversity maintenance, especially for solving real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose to use a hybridized LSMOEA with adaptive operator selection (AOS) to handle real-world LSMOPs. Specifically, the proposed hybridized LSMOEA with AOS (AOS-LSMOEA) includes multiple different offspring generation and environmental selection strategies extracted from some existing LSMOEAs. Then it uses the AOS to adaptively determine the application rates of different offspring generation and environmental selection operators in an online manner. The proposed approach is capable of taking advantage of existing LSMOEAs, and the AOS enables the algorithm to choose suitable operators for solving different LSMOPs. In this study, the proposed algorithm is expected to solve the voltage transformer ratio error estimation (TREE) problems effectively. Experimental results show that AOS-LSMOEA achieves significant performance improvement due to the hybridization of different operators and the adoption of AOS method.},

  abstract  = {The multi-objective feature selection from software product lines is a problem that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, current studies on this problem suffer from two main limitations: (1) resource constraints are naturally adhered to the feature selection process, but they are completely ignored or inadequately handled, and (2) there is a strong preference to the use of evolutionary algorithms for the feature selection problem, and the suitability of other multi-objective metaheuristics remains to be fully explored. To address the above two limitations, this paper proposes the multi-objective feature selection with multiple linear and non-linear resource constraints, and investigates the performance of decomposition-based metaheuristics on the proposed problem. We construct a number of problem instances using both artificial and real-world software product lines, considering 2, 3 and 4 objectives. Experimental results show that, within the decomposition-based framework, reproduction operators that are based on probabilistic models (PM) perform better than genetic operators. Moreover, we demonstrate that adaptation of weight vectors can further improve the performance. Finally, we show that PMAD (the combination of PM-based reproduction operators, adaptation of weight vectors and decomposition-based framework) is better than several state-of-the-art algorithms when handling this problem.},

In the learning phase, the ADM explores different parts of the objective space to gain insight about the problem and to identify a region of interest, which is studied more closely in the decision phase. We demonstrate the ADM by comparing interactive versions of RVEA and NSGA-III on benchmark problems with up to 9 objectives.

Since the purpose of effective LSMOP algorithm is escaping from local optimum in large search space, the current research is focused on decision variable analysis or grouping, which easily leads to excessive computational complexity due to the large-scale decision variables. In order to maintain the diversity of the population while avoiding the computational complexity caused by large-scale decision variables, we propose a Probabilistic Prediction Model based on trend prediction model (TPM) and Generating-Filtering strategy to tackle LSMOP. Since TPM has an individual-based evolution mechanism, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of decision variables, which maintains low complexity of the evolutionary algorithm while ensuring that the algorithm can converge to the Pareto optimal Front(POF). We compared the proposed algorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms for different benchmark functions.

However, existing algorithms generally need high computation cost because they need to evaluate individuals/solutions by a time-consuming energy consumption software. In view of this, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for building energy efficiency design. Firstly, a management strategy of surrogate model is developed to effectively update the surrogate model; then, a multi-objective evolutionary simulation platform for the energy saving design of buildings is established by integrating the proposed multi-objective PSO algorithm with the building energy simulation software, EnergyPlus. The proposed algorithm is applied in an office building at Beijing of China. Experimental results show that it can obtain highly competitive solutions on the basis of significantly reducing the running cost.},

  abstract  = {Most environmental selection strategies in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) select solutions based on their objective function values. However, the objective evaluations of many real-world problems are very time-consuming. The use of a large number of objective evaluations will inevitably reduce the efficiency of MOEAs. This paper proposes a fuzzy classification-assisted environmental selection (FAES) scheme to reduce the number of objective evaluations of MOEAs. The proposed method uses a fuzzy classifier to choose promising solutions in environmental selection. In the proposed method, first, solutions in the previous generations are classified into two classes using the Pareto dominance relation. The non-dominated solutions are positive class, and the dominated solutions are negative class. Next, the classified solutions are used to build a fuzzy classifier. Then, the built classifier is used to predict the membership degree of each of the current and offspring solutions. Only the offspring solutions, whose membership degrees to the positive class are larger than their parents’, are evaluated. The offspring solutions with smaller membership degrees are discarded with no objective evaluations. Therefore, the number of objective evaluations can be reduced. Finally, the evaluated offspring solutions are used in the environmental selection together with the current solutions. The proposed FAES strategy is integrated into an MOEA in computational experiments. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed FAES on reducing the number of objective evaluations.},

  abstract  = {In the past decades, a number of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been developed to solve expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs). However, most existing SAEAs focus on low-dimensional optimization problems, since a large number of training samples are required (which is unrealistic for EMOPs) to build an accurate surrogate model for high-dimensional problems. In this paper, an SAEA with Dimension Dropout is proposed to solve high-dimensional EMOPs. At each iteration of the proposed algorithm, it randomly selects a part of the decision variables by Dimension Dropout, and then optimizes the selected decision variables with the assistance of surrogate models. To balance the convergence and diversity, those candidate solutions with good diversity are modified by replacing the selected decision variables with those optimized ones (i.e., decision variables from some better-converged candidate solutions). Eventually, the new candidate solutions are evaluated using expensive functions to update the archive. Empirical studies on ten benchmark problems with up to 200 decision variables demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Here, we focus on exploring the effects of different Constraint Handling Techniques (CHTs) on MOEA/D, a commonly used MOP solver when solving complex real-world MOPs. Moreover, we introduce a simple and effective CHT focusing on the exploration of the decision space, the Three Stage Penalty. We explore each of these CHTs in MOEA/D on two simulated MOPs and six analytic MOPs (eight in total). The results of this work indicate that while the best CHT is problem-dependent, our new proposed Three Stage Penalty achieves competitive results and remarkable performance in terms of hypervolume values in the hard simulated car design MOP.},

Promoting convergence and maintaining diversity in the population are the two main goals of designing a new infilling sampling criterion, which is naturally a bi-objective optimization problem. In this paper, a Pareto-based bi-indicator infill sampling criterion is proposed to select candidate solutions which will be re-evaluated using expensive objective functions. The proposed criterion is embedded into a Gaussian process assisted evolutionary algorithm to solve expensive multiobjective optimization problems. In the proposed criterion, we introduce two indicators measuring the convergence and diversity as two optimization objectives.

Surrogate models are commonly used for such problems where calls to surrogates are made in lieu of calls to the true objective functions. The surrogates can also be used to identify infill points for evaluation, i.e., solutions that maximize certain performance criteria. One such infill criteria is the maximization of predicted hypervolume, which is the focus of this study. In particular, we are interested in investigating if better estimate of the normalization bounds could help in improving the performance of the surrogate assisted optimization algorithm. Towards this end, we propose a strategy to identify a better ideal point than the one that exists in the current archive. Numerical experiments are conducted on a range of problems to test the efficacy of the proposed method. The approach outperforms conventional forms of normalization in some cases, while providing comparable results for others.

We do so by contrasting the multi-criterion evolutionary algorithm $$\varDelta $$ -MOCK with a bi-objective version of the evolutionary multi-view clustering approach MVMC, which uses a single clustering criterion but can incorporate multiple dissimilarity matrices. Using a benchmark suite representing a diverse range of cluster properties, we illustrate that comparable results to $$\varDelta $$ -MOCK can be achieved using MVMC with two complementary distance functions. We then establish the mathematical equivalence of $$\varDelta $$ -MOCK’s connectivity objective to a compactness criterion operating on a redefined distance function. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future work on the representation of clusters in multi-objective evolutionary clustering.},

In this work, we propose an effective alternative, dubbed Random-Weight Evaluation (RWE), to rapidly estimate the performance of network architectures. By just training the last linear classification layer, RWE reduces the computational cost of evaluating an architecture from hours to seconds. When integrated within an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm, RWE obtains a set of efficient architectures with state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 with less than two hours’ searching on a single GPU card. Ablation studies on rank-order correlations and transfer learning experiments to ImageNet have further validated the effectiveness of RWE.},

  abstract  = {Recently, evolutionary multi-tasking (EMT) has been proposed as a new search paradigm for optimizing multiple problems simultaneously. Since the beneficial knowledge can be transferred among tasks to speed up the optimization process, EMT shows better performance in many problems compared with single-task evolutionary search algorithms. Notably, existing works on EMT have been devoted to the evolutionary search with two tasks. However, when multiple tasks (i.e., number of tasks &gt;2) are involved, the existing methods might fail as it is necessary to decide which is the most suitable task to be selected for performing the knowledge transfer. To address this issue, we propose an online credit information based task selection algorithm to enhance the performance of EMT. Specifically, a credit matrix is introduced to express the transfer qualities among tasks. Then, we design two kinds of credit information and propose an updating mechanism to adjust the credit matrix online. After that, a greedy task selection mechanism is proposed for balancing the exploration and exploitation of the task selection process. Besides, we also propose an adaptive transfer rate to enhance positive transfer while reduce the impact of negative transfer. In the experiment, we compare our method with the existing works. The results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Yet, solid comparisons with simple baselines are often missing. At the same time, recent retrospective studies have found many new algorithms to be no better than random search (RS). In this work we consider the use of a simple Local Search (LS) algorithm for NAS. We particularly consider a multi-objective NAS formulation, with network accuracy and network complexity as two objectives, as understanding the trade-off between these two objectives is arguably among the most interesting aspects of NAS. The proposed LS algorithm is compared with RS and two evolutionary algorithms (EAs), as these are often heralded as being ideal for multi-objective optimization. To promote reproducibility, we create and release two benchmark datasets, named MacroNAS-C10 and -C100, containing 200K saved network evaluations for two established image classification tasks, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our benchmarks are designed to be complementary to existing benchmarks, especially in that they are better suited for multi-objective search. We additionally consider a version of the problem with a much larger architecture space. While we find and show that the considered algorithms explore the search space in fundamentally different ways, we also find that LS substantially outperforms RS and even performs nearly as good as state-of-the-art EAs. We believe that this provides strong evidence that LS is truly a competitive baseline for NAS against which new NAS algorithms should be benchmarked.},

Recently, a method based on the exploitation of the ordinal properties of a valued preference relation has been developed in order to obtain a totally ordered clustering. The underlying idea is to find a partition that minimizes the inconsistencies between the obtained ordered clusters and the input preference matrix. The exact algorithm gives the guarantee to achieve this goal based on a lexicographic order. In this contribution, we propose to further extend their approach to the case where minimum and maximum capacities are imposed on the cluster sizes. This leads to add a constraint satisfaction test (that is based on the levels and the ranks of the graph built during the procedure).

In our proposed visual control framework, a DSPG learning agent is employed to learn a policy estimating continuous kinematics for VBC. The deep policy maps the visual observation to a specific action in an end-to-end manner. The DSPG agent finally can update the policy to obtain the optimal or near-optimal solution using shaped rewards from the environment. The proposed VBC-DSPG model is optimized using a heuristic method.

In this paper, we first have a brief review of existing MOEAs for LSMOPs, and then elaborate two customized MOEAs for solving sparse LSMOPs. Next, we select six state-of-the-art MOEAs with different search strategies to conduct an experimental study on eight sparse benchmark problems and four real-world applications.

  abstract  = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a bio-inspired metaheuristic that has been successfully adopted for single- and multi-objective optimization. Several studies show that the way in which particles are connected with each other (the swarm topology) influences PSO’s behavior. A few of these studies have focused on analyzing the influence of swarm topologies on the performance of Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimizers (MOPSOs) using problems with two or three objectives. However, to the authors’ best knowledge such studies have not been done so far for many-objective optimization problems. This paper provides an analysis of the influence of the ring, star, lattice, wheel, and tree topologies on the performance of SMPSO (a well-known Pareto-based MOPSO) using many-objective problems. Based on these results, we also propose two MOPSOs that use a combination of topologies: SMPSO-SW and SMPSO-WS. Our experimental results show that SMPSO-SW is able to outperform SMPSO in most of the test problems adopted.},

  abstract  = {Route planning, also known as pathfinding is one of the essential elements in logistics, mobile robotics and other applications, where engineers face many conflicting objectives. One major challenge in dealing with multi-objective pathfinding problems is that several different paths can map to the same objective values. Since typical multi-objective optimization algorithms focus on the selection mechanism in the objective space, such multi-modal solutions cannot be easily found. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for preserving a good diversity of solutions in the decision space, which is tailored for pathfinding problems. We measure the similarity between the solutions in the decision space using the discrete Fréchet distance measurement, which is meant as a replacement for the well-known crowding distance measurement. We examine the proposed approach in three different variations on a variety of benchmark instances.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies a class of mixed Pareto-Lexicographic multi-objective optimization problems where the preference among the objectives is available in different priority levels (PLs) before the start of the optimization process – akin to many practical problems involving domain experts. Each priority level (PL) is a group of objectives having an identical importance in terms of optimization, so that they must be optimized in the standard Pareto sense. However, between two PLs, a lexicographic preference structure exists. Clearly, finding the entire set of Pareto optimal solutions first and then choosing the lexicographic solutions using the given PL structure is not computationally efficient. A new efficient algorithm is presented here using a recent mathematical breakthrough in handling infinite and infinitesimal quantities: the Grossone methodology. The proposal has been implemented within a popular multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II), thereby obtaining its generalized version named PL-NSGA-II, although other EMO or EMaO algorithms could have also been used instead. A quantitative comparison of PL-NSGA-II performance against existing algorithms is made. Results clearly show the advantage of the proposed Grossone-based methodology in solving such priority-level many-objective problems.},

  abstract  = {In the past several years, it has become apparent that the effectiveness of Pareto dominance-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms degrades dramatically when solving many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). Instead, research efforts have been driven toward developing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that do not rely on Pareto dominance (e.g., decomposition-based techniques) to solve MaOPs. However, it is still a non-trivial issue for many existing non-Pareto-dominance-based EAs to deal with unknown irregular Pareto front shapes. In this paper, we develop the novel “(M-1)+1&quot; framework of relaxed Pareto dominance to address MaOPs, which can simultaneously promote both convergence and diversity. To be specific, we apply M symmetrical cases of relaxed Pareto dominance during the environmental selection step, where each enhances the selection pressure of M-1 objectives by expanding the dominance area of solutions, while remaining unchanged for the one objective left out of that process. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is very competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a variety of scalable test problems.},

  abstract  = {Niching is an important and widely used technique in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Its applications mainly focus on maintaining diversity and avoiding early convergence to local optimum. Recently, a special class of multi-objective optimization problems, namely, multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), started to receive increasing attention. In MMOPs, a solution in the objective space may have multiple inverse images in the decision space, which are termed as equivalent solutions. Since equivalent solutions are overlapping (i.e., occupying the same position) in the objective space, standard diversity estimators such as crowding distance are likely to select one of them and discard the others, which may cause diversity loss in the decision space. In this study, a general niching mechanism is proposed to make standard diversity estimators more efficient when handling MMOPs. In our experiments, we integrate our proposed niching diversity estimation method into SPEA2 and NSGA-II and evaluate their performance on several MMOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed niching mechanism notably enhances the performance of SPEA2 and NSGA-II on various MMOPs.},

  abstract  = {Portfolio optimization is a well-known problem in the domain of finance with reports dating as far back as 1952. It aims to find a trade-off between risk and expected return for the investors, who want to invest finite capital in a set of available assets. Furthermore, constrained portfolio optimization problems are of particular interest in real-world scenarios where practical aspects such as cardinality (among others) are considered. Both mathematical programming and meta-heuristic approaches have been employed for handling this problem. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are often preferred for constrained portfolio optimization problems involving non-convex models. In this paper, we propose an EA with a tailored variable representation and initialization scheme to solve the problem. The proposed approach uses a short variable vector, regardless of the size of the assets available to choose from, making it more scalable. The solutions generated do not need to be repaired and satisfy some of the constraints implicitly rather than requiring a dedicated technique. Empirical experiments on 20 instances with the numbers of assets, ranging from 31 to 2235, indicate that the proposed components can significantly expedite the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front.},

This scenario probably makes the simplest case of handling heterogeneous and multi-scale surrogate modeling in the presence of constraints. In this paper, we propose a method which makes use of the inexpensiveness of constraints to ensure all time-consuming objective evaluations are only executed for feasible solutions.

  abstract  = {When tackling imbalanced constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) with simultaneous convergence-hard and diversity-hard constraints, a critical issue is to balance the diversity and convergence of populations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm which combines an improved epsilon constraint-handling method (IEpsilon) with a multi-objective to multi-objective (M2M) decomposition approach, namely M2M-IEpsilon. The M2M decomposition mechanism in M2M-IEpislon has the capability to deal with imbalanced objectives. The IEpsilon constraint-handling method can prevent populations falling into large infeasible regions, thus improves the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm. To verify the performance of the proposed M2M-IEpsilon, a series of imbalanced CMOPs with simultaneous convergence-hard and diversity-hard constraints, namely ICD-CMOPs, is designed by using the DAS-CMOPs framework. Six state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs), including CM2M, CM2M2, NSGA-II-CDP, MOEA/D-CDP, MOEA/D-IEpsilon and PPS-MOEA/D, are employed to compare with M2M-IEpsilon on the ICD-CMOPs. Through the analysis of experimental results, the proposed M2M-IEpsilon is superior to the other six algorithms in solving ICD-CMOPs, which illustrates the superiority of the proposed M2M-IEpsilon in dealing with ICD-CMOPs with simultaneous convergence-hard and diversity-hard constraints.},

A key issue in constrained multi-objective optimization is to strike a balance among convergence, diversity and feasibility. A recently proposed two-archive evolutionary algorithm for constrained multi-objective optimization (C-TAEA) has be shown as a latest algorithm. However, due to its simple implementation of the collaboration mechanism between its two co-evolving archives, C-TAEA is struggling when solving problems whose pseudo Pareto-optimal front, which does not take constraints into consideration, dominates the feasible Pareto-optimal front. In this paper, we propose an improved version C-TAEA, dubbed C-TAEA-II, featuring an improved update mechanism of two co-evolving archives and an adaptive mating selection mechanism to promote a better collaboration between co-evolving archives. Empirical results demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed C-TAEA-II in comparison with five representative constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

However, most of the existing DMO benchmarks mainly focus on Pareto-optimal solutions (PS) varying on the hyperplane, which may produce some unexpected bias for algorithmic analysis. Furthermore, they do not comprehensively consider the general time-linkage property, yet which is commonly observed in real-world applications. To alleviate these two issues, we designed a generalized test suite (GTS) for DMO with the following two advantages over previous existing benchmarks: 1) the PS can change on the hypersurface over time, to better compare the tracking ability of different DMO solvers; 2) the general time-linkage feature is included to systemically investigate the algorithmic robustness in the dynamic environment. Experimental results on five representative DMO algorithms demonstrated the proposed GTS can efficiently discriminate the performance of DMO algorithms and is more general than existing benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {Due to the impact of environmental changes, dynamic evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms need to track the time-varying Pareto optimal solution set of dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) as soon as possible by effectively mining historical data. Since online machine learning can help algorithms dynamically adapt to new patterns in the data in machine learning community, this paper introduces Passive-Aggressive Regression (PAR, a common online learning technology) into dynamic evolutionary multi-objective optimization research area. Specifically, a PAR-based prediction strategy is proposed to predict the new Pareto optimal solution set of the next environment. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed prediction strategy into the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with a differential evolution operator (MOEA/D-DE) to handle DMOPs. Finally, the proposed prediction strategy is compared with three state-of-the-art prediction strategies under the same dynamic MOEA/D-DE framework on CEC2018 dynamic optimization competition problems. The experimental results indicate that the PAR-based prediction strategy is promising for dealing with DMOPs.},

Numerical experiments were performed considering four different algorithms in 24 instances of seven combinatorial optimization problems, showing that it outperforms five classical selection schemes with regard to solution quality and convergence speed. Besides, the Diversity Driven selection operator delivers good and considerably different solutions in the final population, which can be useful as design alternatives.},

  abstract  = {The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is one of the most popular algorithms in the EMO community. In the last decade, the high performance of MOEA/D has been reported in many studies. In general, MOEA/D needs a different implementation for a different type of problems with respect to its components such as a scalarizing function, a neighborhood structure, a normalization mechanism and genetic operators. For MOEA/D users who do not have the in-depth knowledge about the algorithm, it is not easy to implement an appropriate algorithm that is suitable for their problems at hand. In our previous studies, we have suggested an offline genetic algorithm-based hyper-heuristic method to tune MOEA/D for a single problem. However, in real-world situations, users may want to use an algorithm with robust performance over many problems. In this paper, we improve the offline genetic algorithm-based hyper-heuristic method for tuning a set of problems. The offline hyper-heuristic procedure is applied to 26 benchmark test problems. The obtained MOEA/D implementations are compared with six decomposition-based EMO algorithms. The experimental results show that the tuned MOEA/D outperformed the compared algorithms on many test problems. The tuned MOEA/D also shows good (and stable) performance over a set of test problems.},

The linking of the two populations comes from the fact that the evaluation of the objective of a member of the first population requires a companion member from the second population, and vice versa. These algorithms are of great interest in cooperative and competing games and search tasks in which multiple agents having different interests are in play. While there have been significant studies devoted to single-objective co-evolutionary optimization algorithms and applications, they have not been paid much attention when each population must be evolved for more than one conflicting objectives. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective co-evolutionary (MOCoEv) algorithm and present its working on two interesting problems. This proof-of-principle study suggests that the presence of multiple Pareto solutions for each population and the ensuing multi-criterion decision-making complexities make the MOCoEv research and application be challenging.

It uses an R2 indicator variant to approximate the hypervolume contribution of each solution. Meanwhile, it uses a utility tensor structure to facilitate the calculation of the R2 indicator variant. This makes it very efficient for solving many-objective optimization problems. Compared with HypE, another hypervolume-based EMO algorithm designed for many-objective problems, R2HCA-EMOA runs faster and at the same time achieves better performance. Thus, R2HCA-EMOA is more attractive for practical use. In this paper, we further improve the efficiency of R2HCA-EMOA without sacrificing its performance. We propose two strategies for the efficiency improvement. One is to simplify the environmental selection, and the other is to change the number of direction vectors depending on the state of evolution. Numerical experiments clearly show that the efficiency of R2HCA-EMOA is significantly improved without deteriorating its performance.},

An attempt to improve an EA’s performance by simply adding a new and apparently promising operator may turn counter-productive, as it may trigger an imbalance between the exploitation-exploration trade-off. This necessitates a proper understanding of mechanisms to restore the balance while accommodating a new operator. In this paper, we introduce a new repair operator based on an AI-based mapping between past and current good population members to improve an EA’s convergence properties. This operator is applied to problems with different characteristics, including single-objective (with single and multiple global optima) and multi-objective problems. The focus in this paper is to highlight the importance of restoring the exploitation-exploration balance, when a new operator is introduced. We show how different combinations of problems and EA characteristics pose different opportunities for restoration of this balance, enabling the repair-based EAs/EMOs to outperform the original EAs/EMOs in most cases.},

  abstract  = {Approximating the Pareto fronts (PFs) of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with a population of nondominated solutions is a common strategy in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO). In the case of two or three objectives, the PFs of MOPs can be well approximated by the populations including several dozens or hundreds of nondominated solutions. However, this is not the case when approximating the PFs of many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). Due to the high dimensionality in the objective space, almost all EMO algorithms with Pareto dominance encounter the difficulty in converging towards the PFs of MaOPs. In contrast, most of efficient EMO algorithms for many-objective optimization use the idea of decomposition in fitness assignment. It should be pointed out that small population size is often used in these many-objective optimization algorithms, which focus on the approximation of PFs along some specific search directions. In this paper, we studied the extensions of two well-known algorithms (i.e., NSGA-II and MOEA/D) with the ability to find a large population of nondominated solutions with good spread. A region-based archiving method is also suggested to reduce the computational complexity of updating external population. Our experimental results showed that these two extensions have good potential to find the PFs of MaOPs.},

Nevertheless, LSMOPs are challenging for conventional EAs, mainly due to the huge volume of search space in LSMOPs. Thus, it is important to explore the impact of the population sizing on the performance of conventional multiobjective EAs (MOEAs) in solving LSMOPs. In this work, we compare several representative MOEAs with different settings of population sizes on some transformer ratio error estimation (TREE) problems in the power system. These test cases are defined on combinations of three population sizes, three TREE problems, and five MOEAs. Our results indicate that the performances of conventional MOEAs with different population sizes in solving LSMOPs are different.

Such a treatment brings conceptual difficulties in aggregating the result on all performance indicators, and it might fail to discover significant differences among algorithms if the marginal distributions of the performance indicator overlap. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to conduct a multivariate $$\mathcal {E}$$ -test on the joint empirical distribution of performance indicators to detect the potential difference in the data, followed by a post-hoc procedure that utilizes the linear discriminative analysis to determine the superiority between algorithms. This performance analysis’s effectiveness is supported by an experimentation conducted on four algorithms, 16 problems, and 6 different numbers of objectives.},

  abstract  = {It has been acknowledged that dominance resistant solutions (DRSs) often exist in the feasible region of multi-objective optimization problems. DRSs can severely degrade the performance of many multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). In previous work, some coping strategies (e.g., the $$\epsilon $$ -dominance and the modified objective calculation) have been demonstrated to be effective in eliminating DRSs. However, these strategies may in turn cause algorithm inefficiency in other aspects. We argue that these coping strategies prevent the algorithm from obtaining extremely convex Pareto optimal solutions (ECPOSs), which are located around the boundary of the convex Pareto front (PF). That is, there is a dilemma between eliminating DRSs and preserving ECPOSs. To illustrate such a dilemma, we propose a new multi-objective optimization test problem with the extremely convex PF as well as the hardly dominated boundaries. Using this test problem, we investigate the performance of six representative MOEAs in terms of ECPOS preservation and DRS elimination. The results indicate that it is indeed challenging to distinguish between ECPOSs and DRSs.},
