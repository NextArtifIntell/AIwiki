  abstract  = {A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search method that optimises a population of solutions by simulating natural evolution. Good solutions reproduce together to create better candidates. The standard GA assumes that any two solutions can mate. However, in nature and social contexts, social networks can condition the likelihood that two individuals mate. This impact of population network structure over GAs performance is unknown. Here we introduce the Networked Genetic Algorithm (NGA) to evaluate how various random and scale-free population networks influence the optimisation performance of GAs on benchmark functions. We show evidence of significant variations in performance of the NGA as the network varies. In addition, we find that the best-performing population networks, characterised by intermediate density and low average shortest path length, significantly outperform the standard complete network GA. These results may constitute a starting point for network tuning and network control: seeing the network structure of the population as a parameter that can be tuned to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms, and offer more realistic modelling of social learning. 1},

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Networks (DNN&#39;s) are a widely-used solution for a variety of machine learning problems. However, it is often necessary to invest a significant amount of a data scientist&#39;s time to pre-process input data, test different neural network architectures, and tune hyper-parameters for optimal performance. Automated machine learning (autoML) methods automatically search the architecture and hyper-parameter space for optimal neural networks. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods do not include traditional methods for manipulating input data as part of the algorithmic search space. We adapt the Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithm Design Engine (EMADE), a multi-objective evolutionary search framework for traditional machine learning methods, to perform neural architecture search. We also integrate EMADE&#39;s signal processing and image processing primitives. These primitives allow EMADE to manipulate input data before ingestion into the simultaneously evolved DNN. We show that including these methods as part of the search space shows potential to provide benefits to performance on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark dataset.},

  abstract  = {Deciding which optimisation technique to use for solving a particular optimisation problem is an arduous task that has been faced in the field of optimisation for decades. The above problem is known as the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP). The optimisation techniques considered in previous works have been, mainly, approaches that can be executed rapidly. However, considering more sophisticated optimisation approaches for solving the ASP, such as Evolutionary Algorithms, drastically increases the computational cost. We are interested in solving the ASP by considering different configurations of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied to the well-known 0/1 Knapsack Problem (KNP). This involves the execution of a significant number of configurations of the GA, in order to evaluate their performance, when applied to a wide range of instances with different features of the KNP, which is a computationally expensive task. Therefore, the main aim of the current work is to provide, as first step for solving the ASP, an efficient parallel GA, which is able to attain competitive results, in terms of the optimal objective value, in a short amount of time. Computational results show that our approach is able to scale efficiently and considerably reduces the average elapsed time for solving KNP instances.},

The proposed method is superior to the two-dimensional RadViz visualization in that it shows degasement of the fitness and constraint violations over time in the benchmark problem and can display them separately. Similarly, for the hybrid function, which is a benchmark problem consisting of multiple terms with different objective subfunctions, the difference in the timing of the decrease in fitness for each term is visualized by RadViz.},

Conventional algorithms work efficiently for bi-level thresholding where an image is divided into fore- and background, but their efficiency drastically declines for the more complex case of multi-level thresholding due to the exhaustive search that is employed. To address this problem, in this paper we consider multi-level thresholding as an optimisation problem and propose a novel population-based algorithm, HCS-BBD, which is based on cuckoo search (CS) and biogeography-based optimisation (BBO). To this end, HCS-BBD integrates a heterogeneous cuckoo search strategy with a biogeography-based discovery operator. Our findings in comparison to state-of-the-art and recent population-based algorithms on different images convincingly demonstrate HCS-BBD&#39;s excellent capability in finding optimal threshold values.},

Our CoEvSoarRL learns a model of a logistic enterprise environment from historical data with Soar reinforcement learning. Then the Soar model is used to evaluate new decisions and operating conditions. We simulate the logistics enterprise vulnerability (risk) and evolve new and more difficult operating conditions (tests); meanwhile we also coevolve better logistics enterprise decision (solutions) to counter the tests.

  abstract  = {Competitive coevolution is an important technique for fields such as defense and security which inherently involve adversarial games. One advantage that the field of computer security has in particular is that games in this space are often naturally able to be simulated at a high fidelity by interacting with the involved software or hardware directly. However, such high-fidelity evaluations are typically slow, so it is especially important in these cases to get as much useful information out of as few evaluations as possible. This paper proposes a new competitive coevolutionary evaluation method of Similar-Strength Opponent Sampling, which selects opponent pairings of similar skill levels so that evaluations can more efficiently distinguish the performances of similar individuals. This is enabled through the use of Elo ratings as a surrogate fitness function that prevents bias against individuals assigned stronger opponents. Care is taken to ensure that this technique is applicable to complex games where there is no explicit winner or loser, allowing ratings to be based on relative fitness. Mixed results are presented, showing that significant benefits are gained from pairing similar-strength opponents, but finding that the use of Elo rating instead of raw fitness harms evolution for intransitive games.},

  abstract  = {This work presents an evolutionary approach for assessing the robustness of a system trained in the detection of software vulnerabilities. By applying a Grammatical Evolution genetic algorithm, and using the output of the system being assessed as the fitness function, we show how we can easily change the classification decision (i.e. vulnerable or not vulnerable) for a given instance by simply injecting evolved features that in no wise affect the functionality of the program. Additionally, by means of the same technique, that is by simply modifying the program instances, we show how we can significantly decrease the accuracy measure of the whole system on the dataset used for the test phase.Finally we remark that these methods can be easily customized for applications in different domains and also how the underlying ideas can be exploited for different purposes, such as the exploration of the behaviour of a generic neural system.},

  abstract  = {Controlling large numbers of heterogeneous agents in dynamic environments has a number of civilian and defense applications, but presents challenges in cooperation among agents and decision making in uncertain environments. This paper investigates a new problem representation using genetic algorithm tuned potential fields and a new multi-objective problem formulation that evolves distributed control for large numbers of cooperating and competing heterogeneous agents in dynamic environments. Using real-time strategy game-like simulation as a test-bed, results show that the proposed approach scales to controlling a number of and different types of agents. Our representation uses influence maps to choose a target and a set of potential fields to control the maneuverability of agents in real-time. We formulated this problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and used an evolutionary multi objective optimization technique to maximize two conflicting objectives in simulation skirmishes. Results indicate that our evolutionary algorithm based representation produces good cooperative behavior and generalized well across groups composed from several different types of agents.},

  abstract  = {Many mathematical optimization algorithms fail to sufficiently explore the solution space of high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problems due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes generative models as a complement to optimization algorithms to improve performance in problems with high dimensionality. To demonstrate this method, a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) is used to augment the solutions produced by a genetic algorithm (GA) for a 311-dimensional nonconvex multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear optimization. The C-GAN, composed of two networks with three fully connected hidden layers, is trained on solutions generated by GA, and then given sets of desired labels (i.e., objective function values), generates complementary solutions corresponding to those labels. Six experiments are conducted to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed method. The generated complementary solutions are compared to the original solutions in terms of optimality and diversity. The generative model generates solutions with objective functions up to 79\% better, and with hypervolumes up to 58\% higher, than the original solutions. These findings show that a C-GAN with even a simple training approach and architecture can, with a much shorter runtime, highly improve the diversity and optimality of solutions found by an optimization algorithm for a high-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem.

In Phase I, the algorithm searches for a feasible point using surrogates for the constraints and objectives. In Phase I iterations, the algorithm identifies the infeasible points that are nondominated according to three criteria: number of constraint violations, maximum constraint violation, and sum of squares of constraint violations. Moreover, the function evaluation point is chosen from a large number of trial points in the neighborhood of a current nondominated point according to the predicted values of the above criteria. In Phase II, the algorithm searches for Pareto optimal solutions using surrogates for the objectives and constraints. In Phase II iterations, the function evaluation point is chosen from trial points that are predicted to be feasible and nondominated in the neighborhood of a current nondominated point using distance criteria in the objective and decision spaces. The algorithm is implemented using RBF surrogates and tested on the Mazda benchmark problem that has 222 discrete variables, 54 constraints and 2 objectives. The proposed method found feasible points much more quickly and obtained much better sets of nondominated objective vectors than an NSGA-II implementation given a budget of only 3330 simulations.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian optimisation (BO) uses probabilistic surrogate models - usually Gaussian processes (GPs) - for the optimisation of expensive black-box functions. At each BO iteration, the GP hyperparameters are fit to previously-evaluated data by maximising the marginal likelihood. However, this fails to account for uncertainty in the hyperparameters themselves, leading to overconfident model predictions. This uncertainty can be accounted for by taking the Bayesian approach of marginalising out the model hyperparameters. We investigate whether a fully-Bayesian treatment of the Gaussian process hyperparameters in BO (FBBO) leads to improved optimisation performance. Since an analytic approach is intractable, we compare FBBO using three approximate inference schemes to the maximum likelihood approach, using the Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition functions paired with ARD and isotropic Mat\&#39;{e}rn kernels, across 15 well-known benchmark problems for 4 observational noise settings. FBBO using EI with an ARD kernel leads to the best performance in the noise-free setting, with much less difference between combinations of BO components when the noise is increased. FBBO leads to over-exploration with UCB, but is not detrimental with EI. Therefore, we recommend that FBBO using EI with an ARD kernel as the default choice for BO.},

Surrogate-based algorithms are very suitable for this type of problem, but most existing techniques are designed with only continuous or only discrete variables in mind. Mixed-Variable ReLU-based Surrogate Modelling (MVRSM) is a surrogate-based algorithm that uses a linear combination of rectified linear units, defined in such a way that (local) optima satisfy the integer constraints. Unlike other methods, it also has a constant run-time per iteration. This method outperforms the state of the art on several synthetic benchmarks with up to 238 continuous and integer variables, and achieves competitive performance on two real-life benchmarks: XG-Boost hyperparameter tuning and Electrostatic Precipitator optimisation.},

The state-of-the-art approach to PBO uses a Gaussian process to model the preference function and a Bernoulli likelihood to model the observed pair-wise comparisons. Laplace&#39;s method is then employed to compute posterior inferences and, in particular, to build an appropriate acquisition function. In this paper, we prove that the true posterior distribution of the preference function is a Skew Gaussian Process (SkewGP), with highly skewed pairwise marginals and, thus, show that Laplace&#39;s method usually provides a very poor approximation. We then derive an efficient method to compute the exact SkewGP posterior and use it as surrogate model for PBO employing standard acquisition functions (Upper-Credible-Bound, etc.). We illustrate the benefits of our exact PBO-SkewGP in a variety of experiments, by showing that it consistently outperforms PBO based on Laplace&#39;s approximation both in terms of convergence speed and computational time. We also show that our framework can be extended to deal with mixed preferential-categorical BO, where binary judgments (valid or non-valid) together with preference judgments are available.},

  abstract  = {In the last decade, deep neural networks have proven to be very powerful in computer vision tasks, starting a revolution in the computer vision and machine learning fields. However, deep neural networks, usually, are not robust to perturbations of the input data. In fact, several studies showed that slightly changing the content of the images can cause a dramatic decrease in the accuracy of the attacked neural network. Several methods able to generate adversarial samples make use of gradients, which usually are not available to an attacker in real-world scenarios. As opposed to this class of attacks, another class of adversarial attacks, called black-box adversarial attacks, emerged, which does not make use of information on the gradients, being more suitable for real-world attack scenarios. In this work, we compare three well-known evolution strategies on the generation of black-box adversarial attacks for image classification tasks. While our results show that the attacked neural networks can be, in most cases, easily fooled by all the algorithms under comparison, they also show that some black-box optimization algorithms may be better in &quot;harder&quot; setups, both in terms of attack success rate and efficiency (i.e., number of queries).},

Data scientists use different regression methods to find the most appropriate and accurate model for each type of datasets. This study proposes a method to improve accuracy in regression and prediction. In common methods, different models are applied to the whole data to find the best model with higher accuracy. In our proposed approach, first, we cluster data using different methods such as K-means, DBSCAN, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms. Then, for each clustering method and for each generated cluster we apply various regression models including linear and polynomial regressions, SVR, neural network, and symbolic regression in order to find the most accurate model and study the genetic programming potential in improving the prediction accuracy. This model is a combination of clustering and regression. After clustering, the number of samples in each created cluster, compared to the number of samples in the whole dataset is reduced, and consequently by decreasing the number of samples in each group, we lose accuracy. On the other hand, specifying data and setting similar samples in one group enhances the accuracy and decreases the computational cost. As a case study, we used real estate data with 20 features to improve house price estimation; however, this approach is applicable to other large datasets.},

However, maintaining this consistency becomes increasingly costly at scale. One proposed strategy is &quot;best-effort computing&quot;, which relaxes synchronization and hardware reliability requirements, accepting nondeterminism in exchange for efficiency. Although many programming languages and frameworks aim to facilitate software development for high performance applications, existing tools do not directly provide a prepackaged best-effort interface. The Conduit C++ Library aims to provide such an interface for convenient implementation of software that uses best-effort inter-thread and inter-process communication. Here, we describe the motivation, objectives, design, and implementation of the library.

  abstract  = {Currently, there is a considerable variety of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and due to their performances some of them become more popular. EAs can be implemented in different ways, such as the Island Model (IM). However, despite the good performance of some EAs and the possibilities of varying their implementations, they can converge to a local optimum mainly because of the loss of diversity in the population. This work proposes an operation for a dynamic hybrid IM (D-IM), aiming to promote diversity to the population if it is converging to a certain portion of the search space. Thus, the D-IM reacts to the possible local convergence of its population, in addition to adjust the topology according to the EAs in the islands. The results demonstrated that the proposed operation can improve the efficiency of the D-IM search process and be competitive for solving bounded constrained optimization problems.},

With parallel architectures now standard computationally intensive methods need to harness them to best effect. A synchronous globally parallel GA creates and evaluates population members in parallel at each generation resulting in considerable processor time spent waiting for threads. An asynchronous approach whereby parallel threads continue evolution without waiting addresses this issue but can result in memory conflicts. This paper introduces an asynchronous global GA model for shared memory CPUs without memory conflicts. Experiments demonstrate performance gains of 1.35 to 12 fold dependant on problem and population sizes. However, an asynchronous model leads to non-uniform evolution reducing accuracy. Consequently, this paper demonstrates that combining synchronous and asynchronous methods into a partially asynchronous model retains a speed advantage whilst improving solution accuracy.},

Some of the most recent advances in this field have been related to the design of neural encodings to represent these highly complex Deep Learning structures. Hybrid encodings have shown potential at distributing the representation of these networks into different sub-structures and thus improving the search. In this paper, we propose a compact hybrid encoding, which is used in an evolutionary framework called Deep Genetic Algorithm (DeepGA). We assess the performance of our simple representation against a hybrid encoding based on DenseBlocks, to evaluate how certain encodings might bias the search towards larger CNNs, in both single- and multi-objective scenarios.

  abstract  = {In addition to their undisputed success in solving classical optimization problems, neuroevolutionary and population-based algorithms have become an alternative to standard reinforcement learning methods. However, evolutionary methods often lack the sample efficiency of standard value-based methods that leverage gathered state and value experience. If reinforcement learning for real-world problems with significant resource cost is considered, sample efficiency is essential. The enhancement of evolutionary algorithms with experience exploiting methods is thus desired and promises valuable insights. This work presents a hybrid algorithm that combines topology-changing neuroevolutionary optimization with value-based reinforcement learning. We illustrate how the behavior of policies can be used to create distance and loss functions, which benefit from stored experiences and calculated state values. They allow us to model behavior and perform a directed search in the behavior space by gradient-free evolutionary algorithms and surrogate-based optimization. For this purpose, we consolidate different methods to generate and optimize agent policies, creating a diverse population. We exemplify the performance of our algorithm on standard benchmarks and a purpose-built real-world problem. Our results indicate that combining methods can enhance the sample efficiency and learning speed for evolutionary approaches.},

  abstract  = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used for controlling robotic agents. For robots with many sensors and actuators, ANNs can be very complex, with many neurons and connections. Removal of neurons or connections, i.e., pruning, may be desirable because (a) it reduces the complexity of the ANN, making its operation more energy efficient, and (b) it might improve the generalization ability of the ANN. Whether these goals can actually be achieved in practice is however still not well known. On the other hand, it is widely recognized that pruning in biological neural networks plays a fundamental role in the development of brains and their ability to learn. In this work, we consider the case of Voxel-based Soft Robots, a kind of robots where sensors and actuators are distributed over the body and that can be controlled with ANNs optimized by means of neuroevolution. We experimentally characterize the effect of different forms of pruning on the effectiveness of neuroevolution, also in terms of generalization ability of the evolved ANNs. We find that, with some forms of pruning, a large portion of the connections can be pruned without strongly affecting robot capabilities. We also observe sporadic improvements in generalization ability.},

To the authors&#39; knowledge, it is the first use of a neuroevolution strategy to evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for forecasting of power plant parameters where the evolved networks have been incorporated into production software used at a coal-fired power plant. A preliminary exploration of the plant&#39;s performance shows that after incorporating this software, the amount of revenue lost due to power plant derates and outages decreased by $7.3 million, a savings of 42\%, and increased efficiency under medium and low load conditions. A further investigation of the effect of training sequence length and time series data normalization methods on evolving and training RNNs for this system is given, providing practical results useful for real world time series forecasting. It is shown that dividing long time series sequences up into shortened training sequences can dramatically speed up training, and that using different normalization methods (min-max vs. z-score) can provide statistically significant results, dependent on the data sets.},

One of the main NAS approaches proposed in the literature, Progressive Neural Architecture Search (PNAS), seeks for the architectures with a sequential model-based optimization strategy: it defines a common recursive structure to generate the networks, whose number of building blocks rises through iterations. However, NAS algorithms are generally designed for an ideal setting without considering the needs and the technical constraints imposed by practical applications. In this paper, we propose a new architecture search named Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search (POPNAS) that combines the benefits of PNAS to a time-accuracy Pareto optimization problem. POPNAS adds a new time predictor to the existing approach to carry out a joint prediction of time and accuracy for each candidate neural network, searching through the Pareto front. This allows us to reach a trade-off between accuracy and training time, identifying neural network architectures with competitive accuracy in the face of a drastically reduced training time.},

Usually, these methods are applied globally and all the input cases are treated equally. However, given the natural variation of the input space for real-world tasks such as image recognition and natural language understanding, it is unlikely that a fixed regularization pattern will have the same effectiveness for all the input cases. In this work, we demonstrate a method in which the selection of neurons in deep neural networks evolves, adapting to the difficulty of prediction. We propose the Adaptive Neural Selection (ANS) framework, which evolves to weigh neurons in a layer to form network variants that are suitable to handle different input cases. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of commonly-used neural network architectures on standard image recognition benchmarks. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness and contribution of each component in the proposed framework.},

A way to tackle this malfunctioning is to devise an artificial pancreas endowed with a personalized control algorithm able to regulate the insulin dosage. A crucial step in realizing such a device is to effectively forecast future glucose levels starting from past glucose values, the knowledge of the food intake, and of the basal and the injected insulin. The increasing availability of medical diabetes data sets is providing unprecedented opportunities to identify correlations inside these data even harnessing innovative investigation methods, such as deep learning.As an alternative to the deep learning methods successfully used as forecasting models, we exploit a neuroevolution algorithm to model and predict future personalized blood glucose levels. The discovered subjective regression model can represent the control algorithm of an artificial pancreas. This model is assessed through experiments performed on a real-world database containing data of six patients suffering from Type 1 diabetes. To further evaluate the effectiveness of the predictions derived from the proposed approach, the results are also compared against those obtained by other state-of-the-art recently proposed methods.},

In this paper, a type of gray-box analysis of states of the open-ended stacking problem in two variations is presented. The current states obtained by monitoring the problem and algorithm during optimization are described via statistical measures similar to FLA measures. From this the distribution of possible states (the state landscape) and the transitions between problem states are analyzed.

GANs are, however, difficult to train in practice due to their inherent high dimensionality, and the complexity associated with the adversarial learning task. Loss landscape analysis can aid in unravelling reasons for difficulty in training GANs as the analysis creates a topology of the search space. The vanilla and deep convolutional GAN architectures are examined in this study to gain a deeper understanding of their loss landscapes during training. The GAN loss landscape features are visualised through the use of loss gradient clouds (LGCs). The LGC analysis showcases the importance of volatility in the training of GANs, as a range of gradient magnitudes allows more exploration in finding an appropriate middle ground in balancing the loss objectives of the GAN.},

Fitness landscapes can be represented in a compact form as Local Optima Networks (LONs). Although research has been conducted on LONs in continuous domains, the majority of work has focused on combinatorial landscapes. LONs are often used to understand the landscape encountered by population-based search heuristics, but are usually constructed via point-based search. This paper proposes the first construction of LONs by a population-based algorithm, applied to continuous optimisation problems. We construct LONs for three benchmark functions with well-known global structure using the widely used Nelder-Mead downhill simplex algorithm, and contrast these to the LONs from a point-based approach. We also investigate the sensitivity of the LON visualisation to the downhill simplex algorithm&#39;s hyperparameters, by varying the initial step size of the simplex and the step size for connectivity of optima. Our results suggest that large initial simplex sizes fragment the landscape structure, and exclude some local optima from the fitness landscape.},

It is well known that the best performing control parameters are often problem dependent, with poorly chosen parameters even leading to algorithm failure. What is not obvious is how strongly the complexity of the parameter landscape itself is coupled with the underlying objective function the metaheuristic is attempting to solve. In this paper local optima networks (LONs) are utilized to visualize and analyze the parameter landscapes of particle swarm optimization (PSO) over an array of objective functions. It was found that the structure of the parameter landscape is affected by the underlying objective function, and in some cases by a considerable degree across multiple metrics. Furthermore, despite PSO&#39;s parameter landscape having a relatively simple macro structure, the LONs demonstrate that there is actually a considerable amount of complexity at a micro level; making parameter tuning harder for PSO than would have been initially thought. Apart from the PSO specific findings this paper also provides a formalism of parameter landscapes and demonstrates that LONs can be used as an effective tool in the analysis and visualization of parameter landscapes of metaheuristics.},

  abstract  = {When determining the actions to execute, reinforcement learners are constantly faced with the decision of either exploiting existing knowledge or exploring new options, risking short-term costs but potentially improving performance in the long run. This paper describes and experimentally evaluates four existing explore/exploit strategies for the learning classifier system XCS. The evaluation takes place on three well-known learning problems - two multiplexers and one maze environment. An automized parameter optimization is conducted, showing that different environments require different parametrization of the strategies. Further, our results indicate that none of the strategies is superior to the others. It turns out that multi-step problems with scarce rewards are challenging for the selected strategies, highlighting the need to develop more reliable explore/exploit strategies to tackle such environments.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is experiencing a resurgence in research interest, where Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) have been applied for many years. However, traditional Michigan approaches tend to evolve large rule bases that are difficult to interpret or scale to domains beyond standard mazes. A Pittsburgh Genetic Fuzzy System (dubbed Fuzzy MoCoCo) is proposed that utilises both multiobjective and cooperative coevolutionary mechanisms to evolve fuzzy rule-based policies for RL environments. Multiobjectivity in the system is concerned with policy performance vs. complexity. The continuous state RL environment Mountain Car is used as a testing bed for the proposed system. Results show the system is able to effectively explore the trade-off between policy performance and complexity, and learn interpretable, high-performing policies that use as few rules as possible.},

Targeted sales can be in various forms, like increasing the likelihood of a purchase, promoting some products among a specific customer segment, or improving user experience. In this study, we propose an evolutionary product bundle generation strategy that is based on the NSGA-II algorithm. The proposed approach is designed as a multi-objective optimization procedure where the objectives are designed in terms of desired bundle feature distributions. The designed genetic algorithm is flexible and allows decision-makers to specify objectives such as price, season, item similarity and association with bundle size constraints. In the experiments, we show that the evolutionary approach enables us to generate Pareto solutions compared to the initial population.},

In particular, many works in the area of database optimization do not provide an adequate amount of information on the setup used in their experiments and analyses.

Potentially large number of optima, rich variety of critical points, as well as solid understanding of certain optimal designs per simple problem instances, provide altogether the motivation to address it as a niching challenge. This study applies established Niching-CMA-ES heuristic to tackle this design problem (6-dimensional Cooke triplet) in a simulation-based fashion. The outcome of employing Niching-CMA-ES &#39;out-of-the-box&#39; proves successful, and yet it performs best when assisted by a local searcher which accurately drives the search into optima. The obtained search-points are corroborated based upon concrete knowledge of this problem-instance, accompanied by gradient and Hessian calculations for validation. We extensively report on this computational campaign, which overall resulted in (i) the location of 19 out of 21 known minima within a single run, (ii) the discovery of 540 new optima. These are new minima similar in shape to 21 theoretical solutions, but some of them have better merit function value (unknown heretofore), (iii) the identification of numerous infeasibility pockets throughout the domain (also unknown heretofore). We conclude that niching mechanism is well-suited to address this problem domain, and hypothesize on the apparent multidimensional structures formed by the attained new solutions.},

But still, after decades of research in the field, scheduling is done (semi)-manually in industry in almost all cases. Main reasons for this besides the intrinsic combinatorial complexity are that model development and maintenance require expert knowledge. This work tackles these challenges by using a simulation-based optimization approach in which a Genetic Algorithm provides high-level encodings of schedules and an industrial-strength discrete-event simulator that provides a detailed model of the plant and is used as a fitness evaluator. To enable this approach to solve problems of industrial complexity, the scheduling heuristics are used to reduce the search space to a reasonable size that still contains the important degrees of freedom so that still optimal or at least high-quality solution are obtained. The case study that is considered here is an industrial two-stage formulation plant which is modeled in detail, down to the level of shiftmodels of the operators and mass-balances from source to sink, thus ensuring that the computed schedules are directly applicable at the real-world plant.},

So far, the focus was more on solution candidates that hold just one symbolic regression tree. For complex problems like controlling the energy flows of a building in order to minimize its energy costs, this is often not sufficient. This is why this work presents a solution candidate implementation in HeuristicLab where they hold multiple symbolic regression trees. Additionally, also new crossover and mutation operators were implemented as the existing ones cannot handle multiple trees in one solution candidate. The first type of operators applies them on all trees in the solution candidate, whereas the second one only applies them to one of the trees. It is found that applying the mutator to only one of the trees significantly reduces the training duration. Applying the crossover to one of the trees instead of all needs longer training times but can also achieve better results.},

Such continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) with jacket cooling are widely used in the chemical industry, in the production of fine chemicals, pigments, polymers, and medical products. Despite appearing rather simple, controlling CSTRs in real-world applications is quite a challenging problem to tackle. GPRL utilizes already existing data from the reactor and generates fully automatically a set of optimized simplistic control strategies, so-called policies, the domain expert can choose from. Note that these policies are white-box models of low complexity, which makes them easy to validate and implement in the target control system, e.g., SIMATIC PCS 7. However, despite its low complexity the automatically-generated policy yields a high performance in terms of reactor temperature control deviation, which we empirically evaluate on the original reactor template.},

The trucks with a non-convex loading surface are loaded with multiple machines of irregular shapes to be picked up or delivered to/from customer or depot locations. Within the algorithmic framework utilized by the company, for each route generated, one must verify whether or not it is possible to load the corresponding machines onto the truck without violating certain restrictions.The aim of this paper is to develop a competitive and automated algorithm capable of efficiently classifying load plans in a very restrictive scenario. For this purpose, we extend a well-known heuristic algorithm from the two-dimensional (2D) packing literature and compare its performance with two other methods: the original 2D packing method and the current method employed by the company in practice. The computational experiments are performed in a set of candidate load plans provided by the company. We observe that the newly introduced adaptation outperforms the other methods and correctly classifies 90\% of the given load plans provided.},

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, commonly used in the manufacturing of metal parts, are highly energy-demanding because of many required sub-systems, such as cooling, lubrication, logical interfaces and electric motors. For this reason, there is a large body of work focusing on modelling the energy needs of this class of machine.This paper applies Grammatical Evolution (GE) for developing auto-regressive models for the energy consumption of a CNC machine. Empirical data from three 24-hour work shifts comprising three different types of products are used as inputs. We also introduce an autocorrelation-informed approach for the grammar, which benefits from a prior analysis of the training data for better capturing periodic or close to periodic behaviour. Finally, we compare the outcomes from real and predicted energy profiles through the use of an existing analysis tool, which is capable of extracting production-related information such as total and average KW consumption, number of parts produced and breakdown of production and idle hours. Results show that GE yields accurate and explainable models for the analysed scenario.},

  abstract  = {Multi-objective optimization problems involve several conflicting objectives that have to be optimized simultaneously. Generating a complete Pareto-optimal front (POF) can be computationally expensive or even infeasible, and for that reason there has been an enormous interest in using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), which are known to generate a good approximation of the POF. MOEAs can be difficult to implement, and even for experienced optimization experts it can be a very time consuming task. For this reason several optimization libraries exist in the literature, providing off-the-shelf access to the most popular MOEAs. Some optimization libraries also provide a framework to design MOEAs. However, existing frameworks can be too stringent and do not provide sufficient flexibility for the design of more sophisticated MOEAs. To address this, a recently proposed optimization library, known as Tigon, features a component-based framework for the design of MOEAs with a focus on flexibility and re-usability. This paper demonstrates the generality of this new framework by showing how to implement different types of MOEAs, covering several paradigms in evolutionary computation. The work in this paper serves as a guide for researchers, and others alike, to build their own MOEAs by using the Tigon optimization library.},

  abstract  = {Temporal logic (TL) is an expressive way of specifying complex goals in reinforcement learning (RL), which facilitates the design of reward functions. However, the combination of these two techniques is prone to generate sparse rewards, which might hinder the learning process. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) hold promise in tackling this problem by encouraging the diversification of policies through exploration in the parameter space. In this paper, we present GEATL, the first hybrid on-policy evolutionary-based algorithm that combines the advantages of gradient learning in deep RL with the exploration ability of evolutionary algorithms, in order to solve the sparse reward problem pertaining to TL specifications. We test our approach in a delayed reward scenario. Differently from previous baselines combining RL and TL, we show that GEATL is able to tackle complex TL specifications even in sparse-reward settings.},

  abstract  = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a subclass of evolutionary algorithms often used to solve difficult combinatorial or non-linear problems. However, most GAs have to be configured for a particular problem type, and even then, the performance depends on many hyperparameters and reproduction operators. In this paper, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach is designed to adaptively set parameters for a GA used for solving a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). An RL agent interacts with the GA environment by taking actions that affect the parameters governing its evolution, starting from a given initial point. The results obtained by this RL-GA procedure are then compared with those obtained by alternate static parameter values. For a set of benchmark problems, the solutions obtained by the RL-GA are better (up to 11\% improvement) than those obtained for the set as compared to the alternate approach. Examination of the results shows that the RL-GA maintains great diversity in the population pool, especially as the iterations accrue. Computational runs are traced to show how the RL agent learns from population diversity and solution improvements over time, leading to near-optimal solutions.},

This is in contrast with existing population-based methods, that are often referred to as evolutionary strategies, such as CMA-ES. While these methods work very well in practice, the updates of the search distribution are often based on heuristics and they do not optimize the expected return of the population but instead implicitly optimize the return of elite samples, which may yield a poor expected return and unreliable or risky solutions. We show that the MORE algorithm can be improved with distinct updates based on coordinate ascent on the mean and covariance of the search distribution, which considerably improves the convergence speed while maintaining the exact closed form updates. In this way, we can match the performance of elite samples of CMA-ES while also showing a considerably improved performance of the sample average. We evaluate our new algorithm on simulated robotic tasks and compare to the state of the art CMA-ES.},

For instance, generic advertisements are way less powerful than suggestions from our contacts. However, this process hugely depends on the influence of people who disseminate these suggestions. Therefore modern marketing often involves paying some targeted users, or influencers, for advertising products or ideas. Finding the set of nodes in a social network that lead to the highest information spread -the so-called Influence Maximization (IM) problem- is therefore a pressing question and as such it has recently attracted a great research interest. In particular, several approaches based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proposed, although they are known to scale poorly with the graph size. In this paper, we tackle this limitation in two ways. Firstly, we use approximate fitness functions to speed up the EA. Secondly, we include into the EA various graph-aware mechanisms, such as smart initialization, custom mutations and node filtering, to facilitate the EA convergence. Our experiments show that the proposed modifications allow to obtain a relevant runtime gain and also improve, in some cases, the spread results.},

As representation, we use permutations with repetitions. Within the budget chosen in our experiments, the resulting (1+1)-FEA can obtain better solutions in average on the Fisher-Thompson, Lawrence, Applegate-Cook, Storer-Wu-Vaccari, and Yamada-Nakano benchmark sets, while performing worse on the larger Taillard and Demirkol-Mehta-Uzsoy benchmarks. We find that while the simple local search with FFA does not outperform the pure algorithm, it can deliver surprisingly good results, especially since it is not directly biased towards searching for them.},

In this paper, we focus on the Stochastic Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (SRCPSP) and propose several adaptive scheduling policies that use task priorities as input to a schedule generation scheme (SGS) at execution. In particular, we focus on the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to evolve robust heuristics that can assign priority levels to scheduling tasks online. The benefit of this approach is two-fold. First, it enables the adaptation of the SGS permutation input during the execution. Second, because the evolved heuristic uses task features rather than domain features, it offers the advantage to be applicable on completely unseen domains, potentially of higher dimension and complexity. Experiments on domains with stochastic durations show that using GP-evolved heuristics yield better makespan than using fixed permutations derived from optimal schedules. They also demonstrate that the update of the permutation is key to getting full benefit from SGS policies.},

This knowledge can then be leveraged in an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to improve the optimization process. Of particular interest is the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) family, which has been shown to exploit linkage effectively. Recently, Empirical Linkage Learning (ELL) techniques were proposed for binary-encoded problems. While these techniques are computationally expensive, they have the benefit of never reporting spurious dependencies (false linkages), i.e., marking two independent variables as being dependent. However, previous research shows that despite this property, for some problems, it is more suitable to employ more commonly-used Statistical-based Linkage Learning (SLL) techniques. Therefore, we propose to use both ELL and SLL in the form of Hybrid Linkage Learning (HLL). We also propose (for the first time) a variant of ELL for permutation problems. Using a wide range of problems and different GOMEA variants, we find that also for permutation problems, in some cases, ELL is more advantageous to use while SLL is more advantageous in other cases. However, we also find that employing the proposed HLL leads to results that are better or equal than the results obtained with SLL for all the considered problems.},

However, its efficiency for solving regular Combinatorial Problems has still to be studied.In this paper, we investigate the capability of the Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to optimize permutation-based problems, making use of problem-specific knowledge. Particularly, we focus on the well-known Linear Ordering Problem (LOP), taking advantage of the easy computation of the expected and upper bound fitness of partial permutations. Moreover, we introduce a Multi-Objective Optimization approach to deal with the exploration-exploitation dilemma during the tree search. Conducted experiments show that MCTS obtains better results than classical constructive algorithms, though its performance is not obviously comparable to state-of-the-art results. Based on its ability for guiding structured searches, its scalability, convergence and search space coverage, MCTS could open new research trends in the optimization area.},

One of the characteristics that has been pointed out as having the potential to affect the performance of optimization algorithms is the symmetry of the distance and flow matrices that form the QAP.In this paper, we further investigate the impact of the symmetry of the QAP on the performance of meta-heuristic algorithms, focusing on local search based methods. The analysis is carried out using the elementary landscape decomposition (ELD) of the problem under the swap neighborhood. First, we study the number of local optima and the relative contribution of the elementary components on a benchmark composed of different types of instances. Secondly, we propose a specific local search algorithm based on the ELD in order to experimentally validate the effects of the symmetry. The analysis carried out shows that the symmetry of the QAP is a relevant feature that influences both the characteristics of the elementary components and the performance of local search based algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Recent work in combinatorial optimisation have demonstrated that neighbouring solutions of a local optima may belong to more favourable attraction basins. In this sense, the perturbation strategy plays a critical role on local search based algorithms to kick the search of the algorithm into more prominent areas of the space. In this paper, we investigate the landscape rotation as a perturbation strategy to redirect the search of an stuck algorithm. This technique rearranges the mapping of solutions to different objective values without altering important properties of the problem&#39;s landscape such as the number and quality of optima, among others. Particularly, we investigate two rotation based perturbation strategies: (i) a profoundness rotation method and (ii) a broadness rotation method. These methods are applied into the stochastic hill-climbing heuristic and tested and compared on different instances of the quadratic assignment problem against other algorithm versions. Performed experiments reveal that the landscape rotation is an efficient perturbation strategy to shift the search in a controlled way. Nevertheless, an empirical investigation of the landscape rotation demonstrates that it needs to be cautiously manipulated in the permutation space since a small rotation does not necessarily mean a small disturbance in the fitness landscape.},

  abstract  = {Most GNNs for molecular property prediction are proposed based on the idea of learning the representations for the nodes by aggregating the information of their neighbour nodes in graph layers. Then, the representations can be passed to subsequent task-specific layers to deal with individual downstream tasks. Facing real-world molecular problems, the hyperparameter optimisation for those layers are vital. In this research, we focus on the impact of selecting two types of GNN hyperparameters, those belonging to graph layers and those of task-specific layers, on the performance of GNN for molecular property prediction. In our experiments, we employed a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm (i.e., CMA-ES) for HPO. The results reveal that optimising the two types of hyperparameters separately can improve GNNs&#39; performance, but optimising both types of hyperparameters simultaneously will lead to predominant improvements.},

  abstract  = {Selection hyper-heuristics have been increasingly and successfully applied to numerical and discrete optimization problems. This paper proposes HHTS, a hyper-heuristic (HH) based on the Thompson Sampling (TS) mechanism to select combinations of low-level heuristics aiming to provide solutions for various continuous single-objective optimization benchmarks. Thompson Sampling is modeled in the present paper as a Beta Bernoulli sampler considering the increase/decrease of diversity among population individuals to measure the success/failure during the search. In the experiments, HHTS (a generic evolutionary algorithm generated by TS) is compared with five well-known evolutionary algorithms. Results indicate that, despite requiring less computational effort, HHTS&#39;s performance is similar or better than the other algorithm for most instances and in 50\% of the cases it is capable of achieving the global optimum.},

  abstract  = {Foster the mechanical design of artificial vision requires a delicate balance between high-level analytical methods and the discovery through metaheuristics of near-optimal functions working towards complex visual problems. Evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence have developed strategies that automatically design meaningful deep convolutional neural network architectures to create better image classifiers. However, these architectures have not surpassed hand-craft models working with outdated problems with datasets of icon images. Nowadays, recent concerns about deep convolutional neural networks to adversarial attacks in the form of modifications to the input image can manipulate their output to make them untrustworthy. Brain programming is a hyper-heuristic whose aim is to work at a higher level of abstraction to develop automatically artificial visual cortex algorithms for a problem domain like image classification. This work&#39;s primary goal is to employ brain programming to design an artificial visual cortex to produce accurate and robust image classifiers in two problems. We analyze the final models designed by brain programming with the assumption of fooling the system using two adversarial attacks. In both experiments, brain programming constructed artificial brain models capable of competing with hand-crafted deep convolutional neural networks without any influence in the predictions when an adversarial attack is present.},

  abstract  = {Introducing new algorithmic ideas is a key part of the continuous improvement of existing optimization algorithms. However, when introducing a new component into an existing algorithm, assessing its potential benefits is a challenging task. Often, the component is added to a default implementation of the underlying algorithm and compared against a limited set of other variants. This assessment ignores any potential interplay with other algorithmic ideas that share the same base algorithm, which is critical in understanding the exact contributions being made. We explore a more extensive procedure, which uses hyperparameter tuning as a means of assessing the benefits of new algorithmic components. This allows for a more robust analysis by not only focusing on the impact on performance, but also by investigating how this performance is achieved. We implement our suggestion in the context of the Modular CMA-ES framework, which was redesigned and extended to include some new modules and several new options for existing modules, mostly focused on the step-size adaptation method. Our analysis highlights the differences between these new modules, and identifies the situations in which they have the largest contribution.},

Current algorithms for the synthesis of potentially interpretable models rely on objectives or regularization terms that represent interpretability only coarsely (e.g., model size) and are not designed for a specific user. Yet, interpretability is intrinsically subjective. In this paper, we propose an approach for the synthesis of models that are tailored to the user by enabling the user to steer the model synthesis process according to her or his preferences. We use a bi-objective evolutionary algorithm to synthesize models with trade-offs between accuracy and a user-specific notion of interpretability. The latter is estimated by a neural network that is trained concurrently to the evolution using the feedback of the user, which is collected using uncertainty-based active learning. To maximize usability, the user is only asked to tell, given two models at the time, which one is less complex. With experiments on two real-world datasets involving 61 participants, we find that our approach is capable of learning estimations of interpretability that can be very different for different users. Moreover, the users tend to prefer models found using the proposed approach over models found using non-personalized interpretability indices.},

We solve the location allocation problem for each web service independently and combine the resulting solutions using a novel merge algorithm. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and simulations that the proposed approach is not only computationally efficient but also produces good quality solutions. Further, the proposed merge algorithm is generic and could be easily adapted to tackle any bi-objective optimization problem that can be decomposed into non-overlapping sub-problems.},

We evaluate RARE&#39;s ability to correctly bin simulated rare-variant associations over a variety of algorithmic and dataset scenarios.

However, the hypervolume, and other unary quality indicators such as multiplicative ϵ-indicator, measure the quality of an approximation set and the overall goal is to find the set with the best indicator value. Unfortunately, the literature on Bayesian optimisation over sets is scarce. This work uses a recent set-based kernel in Gaussian processes and applies it to maximise hypervolume and minimise ϵ-indicators in Bayesian optimisation over sets. The results on benchmark problems show that maximising hypervolume using Bayesian optimisation over sets gives a similar performance than non-set based methods. The performance of using ϵ indicator in Bayesian optimisation over sets needs to be investigated further. The set-based method is computationally more expensive than the non-set-based ones, but the overall time may be still negligible in practice compared to the expensive objective functions.},

While easy to implement, it suffers from an unavoidable choke point: the master process, which must process all results and generate tasks for workers. This work investigates a method for improving the performance of distributed neuroevolution algorithms, which commonly use such a model, that involves offloading costly crossover and mutation operations to the worker processes. To accomplish this, a novel modular congruence class based strategy for generating unique innovation numbers was developed, which requires no additional communication overhead. Experimental results designed to stress test the master process were generated using the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) neuroevolution algorithm, after discovering in preliminary results that it suffered from a bottleneck preventing scalability past 432 cores in a high performance computing environment. The results show a statistically significant improvement in throughput (genome evaluations per second) and scalability past 864 cores using this offloading method. Further, this methodology is generic and could be applied to any neuroevolution algorithm which utilize NEAT-inspired innovation numbers.},

  abstract  = {Many real-world optimization problems belong to the class of expensive problems and the costly process of computing fitness value or gradient of the objective function may cause the failure of various optimization algorithms to solve them quickly. Because of the low computation and memory requirements of Coordinate Descent (CD) search methods they are suitable algorithms to optimize these problems. Despite the efficiency of CD methods, searching a large-scale search space just by using one candidate solution decreases the exploration capability of the algorithm. In this paper, a novel population-based version of the CD algorithm called Population-Based Coordinate Descent (PBCD) is proposed which is an efficacious method for tackling such problems using the collective intelligence and collaboration of the population. It takes advantage of three phases of locating the region of interest, folding the search space, and communication among the population members with majority voting to find more promising regions in the search space. As it shrinks the search space swiftly, it needs a low computational budget for finding the optimal value per coordinate and ultimately in overall. To investigate its performance, we benchmarked it on CEC-2017 test suite consisting of 29 low-scale problems with dimensions of 30, 50, and 100.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a novel hybrid optimisation algorithm that combines elements of both metaheuristic search and integer programming. This new matheuristic combines elements of Benders decomposition and the Bees Algorithm, to create the Bee-Benders Hybrid Algorithm (BBHA) which retains many of the advantages of both methods. Specifically, it is designed to be easily parallelisable, to produce good solutions quickly while still retaining a guarantee of optimality when run for a sufficiently long time. The algorithm is tested using a transmission network expansion and energy storage planning model, a challenging and very large scale mixed integer linear programming problem. The BBHA is shown to be a highly effective hybrid matheuristic algorithm for this challenging combinatorial optimisation problem that performs at least as well as either Benders decomposition or the Bees Algorithm on their own, and significantly improves upon the individual approaches in many instances. While the paper demonstrates the effectiveness on an electricity network planning problem, the algorithm could be readily applied to any mixed integer linear program, and is expected to work particularly well whenever this has a structure that is amenable to Benders decomposition.},

  abstract  = {Decomposition methods are valuable approaches to support the development of divide-and-conquer metaheuristics. When the problem structure is unknown, such as in black-box problems, this structure can be inferred through several decomposition mechanisms. In the context of continuous optimization, the most efficient meta-heuristics to deal with a large number of decision variables involve decomposition methods. However, choosing a suitable decomposition method is not a trivial task since each strategy requires an appropriate set of parameters. In this context, this paper proposes a C++ library called Continuous Optimization Problem Decomposition (COPD) that provides the most recent decomposition methods, interfaces for new methods, and integration with solvers. Furthermore, the proposed library can aid related studies since the decomposition for continuous optimization problems can be easily applied with different methods. The experimental results demonstrate a high grouping accuracy for most methods on large-scale problems.},

They both follow the search/poll step approach of direct search methods, employ Pareto dominance to avoid aggregating objectives, and have theoretical limit guarantees. Although the original publications already compare the two algorithms empirically with a variety of multiobjective solvers, an analysis on their scaling behavior with dimension was missing. Here, we run the publicly available implementations on the bbob-biobj test suite of the COCO platform and by investigating their performances in more detail, observe (i) a small defect in the default initialization of DMS, (ii) for both algorithms a decrease in relative performance to other algorithms of the original studies (even matching the performance of random search for MultiGLODS in higher dimension), and (iii) consequently, an under-performance to previously untested stochastic solvers from the evolutionary computation field, especially when the dimension is higher.},

  abstract  = {Structural Bias (SB) is an important type of algorithmic deficiency within iterative optimisation heuristics. However, methods for detecting structural bias have not yet fully matured, and recent studies have uncovered many interesting questions. One of these is the question of how structural bias can be related to anisotropy. Intuitively, an algorithm that is not isotropic would be considered structurally biased. However, there have been cases where algorithms appear to only show SB in some dimensions. As such, we investigate whether these algorithms actually exhibit anisotropy, and how this impacts the detection of SB. We find that anisotropy is very rare, and even in cases where it is present, there are clear tests for SB which do not rely on any assumptions of isotropy, so we can safely expand the suite of SB tests to encompass these kinds of deficiencies not found by the original tests.We propose several additional testing procedures for SB detection and aim to motivate further research into the creation of a robust portfolio of tests. This is crucial since no single test will be able to work effectively with all types of SB we identify.},

  abstract  = {Heuristic optimisation algorithms are in high demand due to the overwhelming amount of complex optimisation problems that need to be solved. The complexity of these problems is well beyond the boundaries of applicability of exact optimisation algorithms and therefore require modern heuristics to find feasible solutions quickly. These heuristics and their effects are almost always evaluated and explained by particular problem instances. In previous works, it has been shown that many such algorithms show structural bias, by either being attracted to a certain region of the search space or by consistently avoiding regions of the search space, on a special test function designed to ensure uniform &#39;exploration&#39; of the domain. In this paper, we analyse the emergence of such structural bias for Differential Evolution (DE) configurations and, specifically, the effect of different mutation, crossover and correction strategies. We also analyse the emergence of the structural bias during the run-time of each algorithm. We conclude with recommendations of which configurations should be avoided in order to run DE unbiased.},

This makes TD Mk Landscapes more lenient while still being as convenient as Adjacent NK Landscapes. Together, these properties make it very suitable for benchmarking blackbox algorithms. Whitley et al., however, introduced a construction algorithm that only constructs Adjacent NK Landscapes. Recently, Thierens et al. introduced an algorithm, CliqueTreeMk, to construct any TD Mk Landscape and find its optimum. In this work, we introduce CliqueTreeMk in more detail, implement it for public use, and show some results for LT-GOMEA on an example TD Mk Landscape problem. The results show that deceptive trap problems with higher overlap do not necessarily decrease performance and effectiveness for LT-GOMEA.},

This determines their intensification, diversification and all other behavioural features and is thus critical for success on different optimisation problems. Choosing the right components with the right operators remains a difficult task. In this paper we propose a design of experiments that should be used for extensive component studies. We demonstrate the applicability of this design by exploring the differences in operator specific performance in two closely related metaheuristic frameworks---the well-known (μ + λ)-Evolution Strategy and the strongly metaphor-focussed Invasive Weed Optimisation---where operators show varying degrees of similarity in different components. This experiment shows that similarity of operators does not comprehensively account for similarity in performance. Presumably small changes of an operator can influence the algorithmic behaviour more than the utilisation of a completely different operator in another component. Even when employed in different combinations, these influences remain strong. This emphasises the need for a more detailed analysis of the specific effects of components and their respective operators on the search process.},

We consider genotype compression (where genotype is smaller than phenotype) and expansion (genotype is larger than phenotype) and define different strategies to reconstruct the original variables of the phenotype from both the compressed and expanded genotypes. We test our approach with several evolutionary algorithms over three sets of optimization problems: COCO benchmark functions, modeling of Physical Unclonable Functions, and neural network weight optimization. Our results show that genotype expansion works significantly better than compression, and in many scenarios, outperforms the original genotype encoding. This could be attributed to the change in the genotype-phenotype mapping introduced with the expansion methods: this modification beneficially transforms the domain landscape and alleviates the search space traversal.},

  abstract  = {Constraint handling is one of the most influential aspects of applying metaheuristics to real-world applications, which can hamper the search progress if treated improperly. In this work, we focus on a particular case - the box constraints, for which many boundary constraint handling methods (BCHMs) have been proposed. We call for the necessity of studying the impact of BCHMs on metaheuristics&#39; performance and behavior, which receives seemingly little attention in the field. We target quantifying such impacts through systematic benchmarking by investigating 28 major variants of Differential Evolution (DE) taken from the modular DE framework (by combining different mutation and crossover operators) and 13 commonly applied BCHMs, resulting in 28 X 13 = 364 algorithm instances after pairing DE variants with BCHMs. After executing the algorithm instances on the well-known BBOB/COCO problem set, we analyze the best-reached objective function value (performance-wise) and the percentage of repaired solutions (behavioral) using statistical ranking methods for each combination of mutation, crossover, and BBOB function group. Our results clearly show that the choice of BCHMs substantially affects the empirical performance as well as the number of generated infeasible solutions, which allows us to provide general guidelines for selecting an appropriate BCHM for a given scenario.},

  abstract  = {Benchmarking is a compulsory task to assess the performance of a (new) optimization algorithm. While this appears as a mainly technical task, there are surprisingly many methodological problems that arise when benchmarking algorithms. Over the past decade, there was a great effort towards improving the benchmarking methodology for (gradient-free) optimization. It was started for continuous optimization problems and then extended to multi-objective and mix-integer problems.In this tutorial, we will present and discuss these key methodological ideas emphasizing the importance of quantitative measurement, the use of instances of problems as well as choosing well the testbed to not bias results towards too easy problems. We will particularly review the advantages of presenting data using the empirical cumulative distribution of runtimes, a tool that everyone assessing the performance of an algorithm should know.We will then review how this methodology is implemented within the COCO software and show how COCO can and should be used to benchmark an algorithm and write a scientific paper.This tutorial is intended for young researchers starting in the field who need benchmarking for their research as well as for researchers that wish to get up-to-date with the latest methodological developments in benchmarking methodology.},

  abstract  = {A new class of test functions for black box optimization is introduced. Affine OneMax (AOM) functions are defined as compositions of OneMax and invertible affine maps on bit vectors. The black box complexity of the class is upper bounded by a polynomial of large degree in the dimension. Tunable complexity is achieved by expressing invertible linear maps as finite products of transvections. Finally, experimental results are given to illustrate the performance of search algorithms on AOM functions.},

  abstract  = {Premature convergence can be detrimental to the performance of search methods, which is why many search algorithms include restart strategies to deal with it. While it is common to perturb the incumbent solution with diversification steps of various sizes with the hope that the search method will find a new basin of attraction leading to a better local optimum, it is usually unclear whether this strategy is effective. To establish a connection between restart effectiveness and properties of a problem, we introduce a new property of fitness landscapes termed Neighbours with Similar Fitness. We conjecture that this property is true for many PLS-complete problems, and we argue that the effectiveness of a restart strategy depends on this property.},

We propose a weighted combining method on the outputs of all constituent GED methods and then compare the combined result to a threshold to conclude about the presence of the gross error. We generate a set of measurements with or without gross error and then minimize the GED error rate of the proposed ensemble on this set with respect to the combining weights and threshold.

With the aim of alleviating traffic congestion, this paper analyses the possibility of installing a set of traffic lights in the roundabout. The duration of the phases of traffic lights are optimized through a genetic algorithm. SUMO, an open source traffic simulator, is used to evaluate the traffic of the area by considering real traffic data. Seven different scenarios are evaluated with respect to the roundabout, three of them without traffic lights and the other four with them. Simultaneously, the number of pedestrians, and the particular location of the traffic lights, are modified in each of the aforementioned scenarios, when applicable. To determine which parameters of the evolutionary algorithm provided the best results, a previous parameter setting study based on a statistical comparison procedure was performed. Particularly, the crossover operator and the population size, were analyzed. From the results obtained in the experimental assessment, we conclude that the use of an optimized traffic light system would not improve traffic flow in the roundabout. Another important conclusion is that the larger the number of pedestrians, the slower the traffic flow.},

Traditionally the parameters of dose-response models utilised in exercise physiology have been fit with non-linear least squares procedures in combination with local optimization algorithms. These algorithms have demonstrated limitations in their ability to converge on a globally optimal solution. This research purposes the use of an evolutionary computation based algorithm as an alternative method to fit a nonlinear dose-response model. The results of our comparison over 1000 experimental runs demonstrated the superior performance of the evolutionary computation based algorithm to consistently achieve a more consistent model fit and holdout evaluation performance in comparison to the local search algorithm. This initial research would suggest that global evolutionary computation based optimization algorithms are a fast and more robust alternative to local optimization algorithms when fitting the parameters of nonlinear dose-response models.},

In this study, optimization was performed to minimize the mobilization points of the arrangement in the existing study. For this purpose, a simulation was run to validate the solution produced by the genetic algorithm based on scenarios similar to the actual situation. The scenarios are based on 19 of the largest oil spills that have occurred in South Korea and are compared with the existing work time minimization strategy. By utilizing the mobilization point minimization strategy, the number of areas required for a given work time was reduced by approximately 12.38\% on average and approximately 7.08\% on average in terms of work time.},

Using HIFU treatment allows a noninvasive and non-ionising approach, in comparison to more conventional cancer treatments, that can result in a multitude of complications after treatment.In recent years, a realistic thermal model using patient-specific materials was introduced and an evolutionary strategy was employed to design a HIFU treatment plan. However, the execution times of such a model were too prohibitive to allow routine use. In this poster, we present the latest results of experiments carried on a further optimized fitness model using a distributed evolutionary algorithm.

After evolving weights from sensory inputs to the RNN, within the RNN, and from the RNN to the robot&#39;s motors, the robot successfully navigated the space to reach four reward arms with minimal repeats before the timeout. Our current findings suggest that it is the RNN dynamics that are key to performance, and that performance is not dependent on any one sensory type, which suggests that neurons in the RNN are performing mixed selectivity and conjunctive coding. The RNN activity resembles spatial information and trajectory-dependent coding observed in the hippocampus. The evolved RNN exhibits navigation skills, spatial memory, and working memory.},

In this paper, an evolutionary deep learning framework based on transfer learning is proposed to reduce the computational cost, while maintaining the classification at a competitive level. The main idea is to evolve a CNN block from smaller datasets, and then increasing the capacities of the evolved block to handle larger datasets. The proposed method obtains good CNNs with less than 40 GPU-hours. It also achieves a promising error rate of 3.46\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.},

Recent research shows that Deep Neuroevolution (DNE) is also capable of evolving multi-million-parameter DNN&#39;s, which proved to be particularly useful in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This is mainly due to its excellent scalability and simplicity compared to the traditional MDP-based RL methods. So far, DNE has only been applied to complex single-agent problems. As evolutionary methods are a natural choice for multi-agent problems, the question arises whether DNE can also be applied in a complex multi-agent setting. In this paper, we describe and validate a new approach based on coevolution. To validate our approach, we benchmark two Deep coevolutionary Algorithms on a range of multi-agent Atari games and compare our results against the results of Ape-X DQN. Our results show that these Deep coevolutionary algorithms (1) can be successfully trained to play various games, (2) outperform Ape-X DQN in some of them, and therefore (3) show that coevolution can be a viable approach to solving complex multi-agent decision-making problems.},

The genome behaves as an evolved program that grows multi-cellular organisms through a developmental process from an initial single cell. The cellular structure is an intermediate phenotype which is then mapped to its final form, a convolutional neural network in this case.

The reservoir is randomly connected with fixed weights during learning: only readout parameters (from reservoir to output neurons) are trained; the reservoir weights are frozen after initialized. Since the reservoir structure is fixed during learning, only its initialization process has an impact on the model&#39;s performance.In this work, we introduce an evolutionary method for adjusting the reservoir non-null weights. Moreover, the evolutionary process runs on the frequency space corresponding to a Fourier transformation of the weights. We combine an evolutionary search in the Fourier space with supervised learning for the readout weights.

To solve the premature convergence problem, we propose a novel algorithm based on an adversarial bandit technique, named AB-GEP. AB-GEP segments the mathematical space into many subspaces. It leverages a new selection method, AvgExp3, to enhance the population jump between segmented subspaces while maintaining the population diversity. AvgExp3 dynamically estimates a subspace by rewards generated from AB-GEP without any assumption about the distribution of subspace rewards, making AB-GEP choose the appropriate subspace that contains the correct results. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed AB-GEP method can maintain the population diversity and obtain better results than canonical GEPs.},

  abstract  = {In genetic programming (GP), controlling complexity often means reducing the size of evolved expressions. However, previous studies show that size reduction may not avoid model overfitting. Therefore, in this study, we use the evaluation time --- the computational time required to evaluate a GP model on data --- as the estimate of model complexity. The evaluation time depends not only on the size of evolved expressions but also their composition, thus acting as a more nuanced measure of model complexity than size alone. To constrain complexity using this measure of complexity, we employed an explicit control technique and a method that creates a race condition. We used a hybridisation of GP and multiple linear regression (MLRGP) that discovers useful features to boost training performance in our experiments. The improved training increases the chances of overfitting and facilitates a study of how managing complexity with evaluation time can address overfitting. Also, MLRGP allows us to observe the relationship between evaluation time and the number of features in a model. The results show that constraining evaluation time of MLRGP leads to better generalisation than both plain MLRGP and with an effective bloat-control.},

  abstract  = {Efforts to evolve modularity in genetic programming are as old as the field itself. While many techniques have been proposed to evolve programs that make use of simultaneously-evolved modules, the general problem of evolving large-scale, modular software still stands as a central challenge to the field. In this paper, we present GLEAM, a mechanism of achieving modularity, whereby an evolving program uses a local library of modules. The program can refer to the modules during execution and the ones not used by the program are eventually replaced by code segments extracted from the program itself. Modules can also be absorbed by the program when their references in the program get expanded to the full code segments. We show that this simple mechanism improves the success rate on a number of program synthesis problems.},

Unfortunately, many EDA-GP approaches suffer from a rapidly decreasing population diversity which often leads to premature convergence. However, novelty search, an approach that searches for novel solutions to cover sparse areas of the search space, can be used for generating diverse initial populations. In this work, we propose novelty initialization and test this new method on a generalization of the royal tree problem and compare its performance to ramped half-and-half (RHH) using a recent EDA-GP approach. We find that novelty initialization provides a higher diversity than RHH and the EDA-GP also achieves a better average fitness using novelty initialization.},

  abstract  = {Neuro-Encoded Expression Programming (NEEP) implements the continuous coding for the discrete solution through recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and smooths sharpness of the discrete coding. However, the insertion model generating linear coding in NEEP breaks the coherence of linear coding of RNNs, because the resulting symbols tend to be cluttered when RNNs learn the incoherent sequence relationships. Meanwhile, the redundancy phenomenon that different RNNs generate the same code results in that lots of solutions with the same performance exist in the search space, and causes the decrease for search efficiency. To address these problems, the linear-dependent multi-interpretation NEEP(LM-NEEP) is proposed in this research. LM-NEEP tackles the incoherence problem by employing a linear dependence strategy, and the multi-interpretation strategy is adopted to deal with the redundancy problem in search space. The capability of LM-NEEP is estimated on several symbolic regression problems. The experimental results display that the LM-NEEP significantly outperforms NEEP and some classical genetic programming methods.},

  abstract  = {Person re-identification (re-ID) is a fundamental link to ensure successful cross-camera tracking. Its overall process is divided into two stages, feature extraction and matching. In the matching stage, the simple Euclid measurement has limitations in score due to the lack of consideration of the vector directions. The majority of recent contributions focus on the use of neighborhood information of the query image, which makes the calculation process more complex. In addition, these similarity measurements are predefined and therefore evaluated. In this paper, we propose a re-ID similarity measurement based on Genetic Programming (GP). The similarity measurement formula is automatically evolved and constructed through the optimization using specific function set, terminal set and fitness function targeting re-ID. For the training process of GP, we propose the feature triplet-dataset like the triplet-loss based on the existing re-ID datasets. We conduct sufficient experiments on three benchmark datasets, comparing with features of different quality and various measurements. The proposed method has a better effect than the Euclid measurement and achieves a general improvement on the mAP and rank-1 of combination with other metrics. Therefore, our method can be used as a gain &quot;buff&quot; to enhance the score of other methods on the original basis.},

The subtree from the father is usually small and can be extracted from each dad and saved before crossover. This gives single parent crossover, which when combined with fitness first, further reduces the number of crossovers. Even in the worst case the reduction is exp(-1) = 37 percent.With large trees, even in populations of similar fitness, eliminating bachelors and spinsters is feasible and can reduce both runtime and memory consumption. Storage in a (N) multi-threaded implementation for a population M is about 0.63M + N, compared to the usual M+2N, in practice saving ≥ 17\%.

Thus if a solver works for one problem, it is anticipated that it will be effective for problems within the same category whose fitness landscapes essentially share structural similarity with each other. However, due to the black-box nature, it is far from trivial to infer such similarity in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes two alternative approaches to empirically investigate the potential existence of structural similarity among different fitness landscapes. Specifically, we pick up three classic combinatorial optimization problems to constitute the benchmark set. We apply a local optima network construction routine to build a coarse-grained model to represent the fitness landscapes of different problems at various dimensions. Thereafter, we apply a graph embedding method, to empirically investigate the potential existence of correlations with respect to different local optima networks. From our empirical results, we are exciting to find some evidence of the existence of similarity not only for a given problem with various dimensions but also across different problems.},

What complicates this decision further is that different algorithms may be best suited for different stages of the optimization process. Dynamic algorithm selection and configuration are therefore well-researched topics in evolutionary computation. Two different settings are classically considered: hyper-heuristics and parameter control studies typically assume a setting in which the algorithm needs to be chosen and adjusted during the run, without prior information, other approaches such as hyper-parameter tuning and automated algorithm configuration assume the possibility of evaluating different configurations before making a final recommendation. In practical applications of evolutionary algorithms we are often in a middle-ground between these two settings, where one needs to decide upon the algorithm instance before the run (&quot;oneshot&quot; setting), but where we have (possibly lots of) data available on which we can base an informed decision.We analyze in this work how such prior performance data can be used to infer informed dynamic algorithm selection schemes for the solution of pseudo-Boolean optimization problems.

A widely used approach to selecting a configuration is using default settings, often proposed along with the publication of a new algorithm. Those default values are usually chosen in an ad-hoc manner to work on a wide variety of datasets. Different automatic hyperparameter configuration algorithms which select an optimal configuration per dataset have been proposed, but despite its importance, tuning is often skipped in applications because of additional run time, complexity, and experimental design questions. Instead, the learner is often applied in its defaults. This principled approach usually improves performance but adds additional algorithmic complexity and computational costs to the training procedure. We propose and study using a set of complementary default values, learned from a large database of prior empirical results as an alternative. Selecting an appropriate configuration on a new dataset then requires only a simple, efficient, and embarrassingly parallel search over this set. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach, we compare learned sets of configurations to random search and Bayesian optimization. We show that sets of defaults can improve performance while being easy to deploy in comparison to more complex methods.},

  abstract  = {Multiobjective evolution and competitive coevolution are sub-fields of evolutionary computation which each significantly complicate the concept of fitness. Together, these make multiobjective competitive coevolution very difficult to work with by combining multiple objective values with non-absolute fitness, preventing the use of many established techniques for improving performance in multiobjective or competitive coevolutionary algorithms. Nonetheless, multiobjective scenarios arise frequently in competitive coevolution, such as whenever coevolving agents must consider costs for their actions. This paper proposes a new evaluation method of pairing opponents with similar skill levels in each objective, so that evaluations more efficiently distinguish the performance of similar individuals. This is enabled through the use of per-objective Elo ratings as a surrogate fitness function that prevents bias against individuals assigned stronger opponents. Ratings can further be assigned for asymmetric, non-zero-sum objectives such as cost, allowing individuals to be paired with opponents that incidentally challenge those asymmetric objectives. Mixed results are presented, showing significant benefits from pairing similar opponents, but finding that the use of Elo rating instead of raw fitness harms evolution. A novel statistical test for comparing multiobjective coevolutionary algorithms is also introduced.},

  abstract  = {Mixed-integer optimization, which focuses on problems where discrete and continuous variables exist simultaneously, is a well-known and challenging area for search algorithms. Mixed-integer optimization problems are especially difficult in a black-box setting where no structural problem information is available a-prior. In this paper we bring the strengths of the recently-proposed Genetic Algorithm for Model-Based mixed-Integer opTimization (GAMBIT) to the multi-objective (MO) domain, and determine whether the promising performance of GAMBIT is maintained. We introduce various mechanisms designed specifically for MO optimization resulting in MO-GAMBIT. We compare performance - in terms of the number of evaluations used - and runtime with alternative techniques, particularly linear scalarization and a selection of alternative MO algorithms. To this end, we introduce a set of objective functions which vary in composition in terms of discrete and continuous variables, as well as in the strength of dependencies between variables. Our results show that MO-GAMBIT can substantially outperform the alternative MO algorithms, thereby providing a promising new approach for multi-objective mixed-integer optimization in a black-box setting.},

Experiments on large-scale problems confirm that these approaches allow effective solving of these problems and lead to efficient evolved ANNs.},

This article focused on the use of a machine learning model to predict the maximum, average, and minimum fitness values during the evolutionary process of a GA, and this, only with the knowledge of its initialization parameters. In order to accomplish this goal, a Random Forest model was trained with data from different GA executions for a given problem. The prediction process was performed with a very promising performance, where the challenge of predicting the evolutionary process of a GA was fulfilled with low error rates. This approach opens up several opportunities for advances in the segment, and in a way, contributes to the investigation and improvement of GAs, as well as demonstrating the importance of monitoring and storing the information generated during their evolutionary process.},

The main peculiarity of this approach is related to the non-zero probability of selecting individuals do not belonging to the current population so as to create new genetic material and reduce the likelihood that genetic evolution will converge to local optima. The suitability of the proposed operator has been proved by an experimental session where a comparison with well-known selection methods has been carried out on a set of benchmark problems.},

Knowledge of such features per a given BBO problem-instance offers valuable information in light of the Algorithm Selection and/or Configuration problems. In practice, by solving this challenge, the query complexity of BBO may be reduced when capitalizing on algorithm portfolios. In this study we target the automated recognition of BBO benchmark functions. We propose an identification framework for d-dimensional continuous BBO test-suites, provided as input with a set of N search-points, sampled at random, together with their query values. We address it as a supervised multi-class image recognition problem, by introducing the concept of Landscape Images, and applying the basic LeNet5 Neural Network to classify them. The solution&#39;s core lies within the encapsulation of the BBO functions&#39; data as Landscape Images, and the application of neural image recognition to learn their features. The efficacy of our approach is numerically validated on the noiseless COCO/BBOB test-functions, which are demonstrated to be correctly classified at high precision rates (≈90\%) when N is in the order of d. This successful learning is another step toward automated feature detection of BBO problems.},

  abstract  = {For several real-world optimization problems, the evaluation of response functions may be expensive, computationally or otherwise. The number of design evaluations one can afford for such problems are therefore severely limited. Surrogate models are commonly used to guide the search for such computationally expensive optimization problems (CEOP). The surrogate models built using a limited number of true evaluations are used to identify the next infill/sampling location. Expected improvement (EI) is a well known infill criteria which balances exploration and exploitation by accounting for both mean and uncertainties in the current model. However, recent studies have shown that, somewhat counter-intuitively, a greedy (&quot;believer&quot;) strategy can compete well with EI in solving CEOPs. In this study, we are interested in examining the relative performance of the two infill methods across a range of problems, and identify the influencing factors affecting their performance. Based on the empirical analysis, we further propose an algorithm incorporating the strengths of the two strategies. The numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve a competitive performance across a range of problems with diverse characteristics; making it a strong candidate for solving black-box CEOPs.},

  abstract  = {Algorithms for black-box optimization need considering numerous properties of objective functions in advance. The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is known as one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for black-box optimization. Despite its achievement, the CMA-ES fails to minimize the objective function which is high-dimensional and ill-conditioned such as 100,000-dimensional Ellipsoid function. This fact is a serious problem to apply the CMA-ES to recent high-dimensional machine learning models. We confirm that the &quot;single&quot; step-size for all coordinates is one of the hindrances to the adaptation of the variance-covariance matrix. To solve this, we propose a CMA-ES with coordinate selection. Coordinate selection enables us to vectorize the step-size and adapt each component of the vector to the scale of selected coordinates. Furthermore, coordinate selection based on estimated curvature reduces the condition number during updating variables in selected coordinate space. Our method is enough simple to easily apply to most of variations of CMA-ES: only execute conventional algorithms in the selected coordinate space. The experimental results show that our method applied to the CMA-ES, the sep-CMA-ES and the VD-CMA outperforms the conventional variations of CMA-ES in terms of function evaluations and an objective value in the optimization of high-dimensional and ill-conditioned functions.},

The simplest being the death penalty, which rejects solutions that violate constraints. However, its inefficiency in search spaces possessing small feasible regions spurred research into adaptive penalties and other competitive methods. A major criticism of these approaches is that they require the user to fine-tune parameters or design problem-dependent operators. We propose to do away with penalty functions for problems over the Euclidean space when the constraint is an equality concerning the Euclidean distance. This paper describes an evolutionary algorithm on the unit hypersphere based on representing the population with the von Mises-Fisher probability distribution from the field of Directional statistics.

  abstract  = {We consider a multi-objective optimization problem with objective functions that are expensive to evaluate. The decision maker (DM) has unknown preferences, and so the standard approach is to generate an approximation of the Pareto front and let the DM choose from the generated non-dominated designs. However, especially for expensive to evaluate problems where the number of designs that can be evaluated is very limited, the true best solution according to the DM&#39;s unknown preferences is unlikely to be among the small set of non-dominated solutions found, even if these solutions are truly Pareto optimal. We address this issue by using a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm (see, e.g., [5]) and allowing the DM to select a preferred solution from a predicted continuous Pareto front just once before the end of the algorithm rather than selecting a solution after the end. This allows the algorithm to understand the DM&#39;s preferences and make a final attempt to identify a more preferred solution. We demonstrate the idea using ParEGO [2], and show empirically that the found solutions are significantly better in terms of true DM preferences than if the DM would simply pick a solution at the end.},

In this paper we prove that a recent algorithm, called Labeling-Oriented Non-Dominated Sorting, or LONSA, has the worst-case running time of Θ(MN3), where N is the number of points and M is the number of objectives, which is much greater than the quadratic upper bound the authors claim. Our proof holds for all M ≥ 4 and essentially reduces LONSA to another algorithm, Deductive Sort, for which the hard test has been constructed before.},

However, most existing EMTOs still treat the internal tasks just as different related problems, rather than the component problems of the entire MTOP, which is inefficient. Therefore, this paper proposes to treat the entire MTOP as a multi-criteria optimization problem (MCOP), so as to solve the MTOP more efficiently. To be specific, the fitness function of each task in the MTOP is treated as an evaluation criterion in the corresponding MCOP. During the evolutionary process, a round-robin multi-criteria strategy is adopted to better utilize the multiple criteria. This way, we can use different evaluation criteria in different generations or stages to guide the environmental selection and population evolution in ECs, so as to find out the optimal solutions for the criteria of different tasks. Based on the above, a multi-criteria differential evolution algorithm is developed for solving MTOPs. Experiments on widely-used MTOP benchmarks and comparisons with some state-of-the-art algorithms have verified the great effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Therefore, treating MTOPs as MCOPs is a potential and promising direction for solving MTOPs.},

The main characteristic of MOEA/D is to use a set of weight vectors to break the MOP into a set of single-objective sub problems. It is well known that the performance of MOEA/D varies greatly depending on the number of weight vectors. However, the appropriate value for this hyper-parameter is likely to vary depending on the problem, as well as the stage of the search. In this study, we propose a robust MOEA/D variant that evaluates the progress of the search, and deletes or creates weight vectors as necessary to improve the optimization or to avoid search stagnation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the DTLZ and ZDT benchmark. We observed that the proposed method without needing to explicitly choose the number of weight vectors is equivalent to MOEA/D with fine tuned vectors and superior than MOEA/D with poorly tuned vectors.},

However, the tuning of the offspring population size, which guides the exploration-exploitation trade-off in NSGA-II, has been overlooked so far. Previous work has generally used the population size as the default offspring population size for NSGA-II.We therefore investigate the impact of offspring population size on the performance of NSGA-II. We carry out an empirical study by comparing the effectiveness of three configurations vs. the default NSGA-II configuration on six optimization problems based on four Pareto front quality indicators and statistical tests.Our findings show that the performance of NSGA-II can be improved by reducing the offspring population size and in turn increasing the number of generations. This leads to similar or statistically significant better results than those obtained by using the default NSGA-II configuration in 92\% of the experiments performed.},

Instead of seeking to open these &quot;black boxes&quot; to meet the increasing demand for explainability, another approach is to used rule-based machine learning models that are explainable by design, such as the Anticipatory Learning Classifier Systems (ALCS). ALCS are able to develop simultaneously a complete representation of their environment and a decision policy based on this representation to solve their learning tasks. This paper focuses on the ability of ALCS to deal with non-deterministic environments used in reinforcement learning problems, while discussing their explainability. Directions for future research are thus highlighted to improve both the performance and the explainability of the ALCS to meet the needs of critical real-world applications.},

However, the vulnerability of neural networks to imperceptible adversarial perturbations exposes ASR-based devices to potentially serious threats. So far, imperceptibility of audio adversarial examples has been associated with small, or inaudible perturbations. In this paper, we expand the domain of viable audio adversarial examples to include audible, but inconspicuous adversarial perturbations. We present EvolMusic, the first targeted adversarial attack based on musical note-sequences. Our musical perturbations are generated via an adaptive evolutionary approach in a black-box setting. We evaluate our attack against DeepSpeech v0.9.1 using the Fluent Speech Commands dataset.},

Generative adversarial Networks (GANs) are used in many fields as models that mimic the trained data distribution. However, dealing with permutation space in GANs has not been yet investigated in detail. To reach this objective, we propose using GANs to solve the permutation-based optimization problem using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm. We use a Random Key method to translate the generated data from continuous values to permutations. The Experiment aims to investigate the quality of solutions provided by the proposed method in two ways. Firstly, we evaluate the solutions obtained directly from the GANs, and in the second one, we use a local search method to improve the quality of the solution. In the end, We perform a set of experiments on instances of the known TSP problems. Also, we notice that the obtained results promise to extend the work on other classes of problems.},

All multi-trees are stored in an external repository that keeps the entire search history.

Our algorithm, dubbed as Evolutionary-Driven Reinforcement Learning (Evo-RL), embeds the reinforcement learning algorithm in an evolutionary cycle, where we distinctly differentiate between purely evolvable (instinctive) behaviour versus purely learnable behaviour. Furthermore, we propose that this distinction is decided by the evolutionary process, thus allowing Evo-RL to be adaptive to different environments. In addition, Evo-RL facilitates learning on environments with reward-less states, which makes it more suited for real-world problems with incomplete information. To show that Evo-RL leads to state-of-the-art performance, we present the performance of different state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms when operating within Evo-RL and compare it with the case when these same algorithms are executed independently. Results show that reinforcement learning algorithms embedded within our Evo-RL approach significantly outperform the stand-alone versions of the same RL algorithms on OpenAI Gym control problems with rewardless states constrained by the same computational budget.},

In this work, we propose a zero-shot method to meta-learn symbolic default hyperparameter configurations that are expressed in terms of the properties of the dataset. This enables a much faster, but still data-dependent, configuration of the ML algorithm, compared to standard hyperparameter optimization approaches. In the past, symbolic and static default values have usually been obtained as hand-crafted heuristics. We propose an approach of learning such symbolic configurations as formulas of dataset properties from a large set of prior evaluations on multiple datasets by optimizing over a grammar of expressions using an evolutionary algorithm. We evaluate our method on surrogate empirical performance models as well as on real data across 6 ML algorithms on more than 100 datasets and demonstrate that our method indeed finds viable symbolic defaults.},

In order to reduce the complexity of the space, feature grouping approach aims to generate subsets of correlated features. In this context, evolutionary algorithms have proven to achieve competitive solutions. In this work we propose a novel Scatter Search (SS) strategy that uses feature grouping to generate a population of diverse and high quality solutions. Solutions are evolved by applying random mechanisms in combination with the feature group structure to maintain the diversity and the quality of the solutions during the search. We test the proposed strategy on high dimensional data from biomedical domains and compare the performance against the first adaptation of the SS to the feature selection problem. Results show that our proposal is able to find smaller subsets of features while keeping a similar predictive power of the classifier models.

  abstract  = {Feature selection (FS) is typically an essential pre-processing step for many machine learning tasks. However, most existing FS approaches focus on single-label classification, whereas multi-label classification (MLC) is an emerging topic where each instance can be assigned to more than one class label. Sparsity-based FS is an efficient and effective method that can be applied to MLC. However, existing sparsity-based approaches based on gradient descent can get trapped at local optima, and cannot optimise the selected number of features and classification performance simultaneously that are often in conflict, thus making FS a multi-objective problem. Evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) can be applied to FS due to its potential global search ability. EMO-based algorithms have not been utilised in sparsity-based approaches for FS in MLC. This paper proposes a novel sparsity-based MLC FS method based on Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Decomposition (MOEA/D). The experimental results indicate improvement in the MLC performance in comparison to a existing multi-objective FS algorithms.},

  abstract  = {The static capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) is a challenging combinatorial problem, where vehicles need to be scheduled efficiently for serving a set of tasks with minimal travelling costs. Dynamic CARP (DCARP) considers the occurence of dynamic events during the service process, e.g. traffic congestion, which reduce the quality of the currently applied schedule. Existing research mainly focused on scenarios with large changes but neglected the time limitations of the rescheduling process. In this paper, we investigate DCARP scenarios with small dynamic changes in which events only affect the properties of a few edges. We propose an efficient hybrid local search framework (HyLS) to reschedule the service plan in a short time for a DCARP instance. HyLS maintains an archive that enables it to cover more search areas than single local search algorithms, while its local search mechanisms enable it to find better solutions than meta-heuristic re-optimisation from scratch when restricted to a tight time budget. Our experiments demonstrate HyLS&#39; effectiveness compared to existing local search strategies and meta-heuristic re-optimisation from scratch.},

  abstract  = {Solutions for NP-hard problems are often obtained using heuristics that yield results relatively quickly, at some cost to the objective. Many different heuristics are usually available for the same problem type, and the solution quality of a heuristic may depend on characteristics of the instance being solved. This paper explores the use of machine learning to predict the best heuristic for solving Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs). A set of 23 features related to the CVRP were identified from the literature. A large set of CVRP instances were generated across the feature space, and solved using four heuristics including a genetic algorithm and a novel self-organizing map. A neural network was trained to predict the best performing heuristic for a given problem instance. The model correctly selected the best heuristic for 79\% of the CVRP test instances, while the single best heuristic was dominant for only 50\% of the test instances.},

The GPU execution for a 200-node benchmark shows a speed by a factor of 1700 compared to that on an octa-core i7 CPU with 64 GB RAM. The tuned GA achieved a solution for a 400-node benchmark that is 72\% better than that of an arbitrarily tuned GA after only 263 generations.

  abstract  = {Negative selection algorithm(NSA), which is the most representative classification algorithm among immune heuristic algorithms, has been successfully applied to solve many classification problems. However, there are two obvious problems with NSA. First, NSA establishes specific antibodies for each antigen based on the mechanism of specific antigen matching antibody, which leads to too many and redundant detectors. Second, the detection stage needs to calculate the matching degree of the antigen with all the detectors, and the detection efficiency is low. This paper proposes a new non-specific natural killer cell algorithm (NKA) based on pathogen dose. NKA draws on the mechanism of NK cells constructing phenotype detectors based on pathogen dose. First, NKA defines dose and phenotype detector, and optimizes it based on the memory evolution mechanism of phenotype; then establishes k-d tree for the optimized phenotype, and pathogens only need to match the dose with the nearest phenotype detector. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper, NKA, can not only achieve a better performance through fewer detectors, but also has a higher efficiency in the training and detection phase, compared with three NSA-based algorithms.},

However, biological systems are able to adapt to new environments with ease; perhaps because they have the ability to react to environmental input during a growth phase with changes not only in behaviour, but also morphology. Yet within the field of robots, environmental based development of morphology is an under researched area. In this paper we use an evolutionary algorithm to evolve neural cellular automata capable of inducing environmental based developmental plasticity in robots. We use the kinetic energy of each cell and its neighbours as an input to our network, the output of which determines the position of new cell growth. We evolve our neural cellular automata first in three individual environments and then also for performance in multiple environments. We show that the networks that use environmental feedback outperform those that do not and that by introducing environmental feedback during development, more adaptive and better performing robots are potentially possible.},

This paper looks at six different GANs trained on different subsets of data from the game Lode Runner. The quality diversity algorithm MAP-Elites was used to explore the set of quality levels that could be produced by each GAN, where quality was defined as being beatable and having the longest solution path possible. Interestingly, a GAN trained on only 20 levels generated the largest set of diverse beatable levels while a GAN trained on 150 levels generated the smallest set of diverse beatable levels, thus challenging the notion that more data is always better when training GANs.},

  abstract  = {Cooperative Co-evolutionary Algorithms effectively train policies in multiagent systems with a single, statically defined team. However, many real-world problems, such as search and rescue, require agents to operate in multiple teams. When the structure of the team changes, these policies show reduced performance as they were trained to cooperate with only one team. In this work, we solve the cooperation problem by training agents to fill the needs of an arbitrary team, thereby gaining the ability to support a large variety of teams. We introduce Ad hoc Teaming Through Evolution (ATTE) which evolves a limited number of policy types using fitness aggregation across multiple teams. ATTE leverages agent types to reduce the dimensionality of the interaction search space, while fitness aggregation across teams selects for more adaptive policies. In a simulated multi-robot exploration task, ATTE is able to learn policies that are effective in a variety of teaming schemes, improving the performance of CCEA by a factor of up to five times.},

  abstract  = {What makes a quality-diversity (QD) algorithm effective? This question is increasingly studied as such algorithms gain in popularity. Recent work on Novelty Search linked its efficiency to the evolution of a population under a dynamic selection pressure defined by the novelty metric, which allows the population to converge to highly evolvable individuals, on which spending the evolutionary budget allows to navigate the behavior space. MAP-Elites, another popular QD algorithm, does not use an explicit population, instead sampling the parent population directly from the behavioral archive at each generation. This sampling can be uniform, or biased according to criteria such as curiosity, which favor individuals that previously generated successful offsprings. In this article, we show that such improved selection schemes are efficient because they create a dynamic pseudo-population that mimics the desirable qualities of a Novelty Search population. We do this by proposing another simpler selection scheme, youth, that simply focuses the evolutionary budget on such a dynamic pseudo-population, and by showing it exhibits similar behavior and performance as curiosity without explicitly selecting for previously successful parents. This has important implications for the design of future QD algorithms taking the best of both archive-based and population-based methods.},

The basic components comprising a complex system are defined as interacting nodes, and each node hosts multiple ants, which motions represent possible traces of the corresponding node. A representative group-state for the entire complex system is formed by randomly selecting one ant from all nodes. The methodology further proposes constructing a fitness function to guide the random ant-group moving with reduced entropy generation at the system level. Simultaneously, ants within a single node move by pheromone-based coordination. The proposed methodology is used to analyze Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM). Two types of coordinating algorithms, stochastic greedy and chaotic, are constructed to evaluate the methodologies&#39; robustness. The results demonstrate that both coordinating algorithms can successfully capture ASM&#39;s collective characteristics, such as average sandpile height and recursive rates for different heights, although these two algorithms represent different searching dynamics.},

Various heuristic or random ordering techniques have been proposed in the literature, but uncertainty remains regarding the best approach for this. We investigate the effect that permuting assignment order has on the quality of timetable produced. As part of this we develop a novel MAX-MIN Ant System including dynamic constraint handling and partial function evaluations. We also explore algorithm variants with and without Local Search and employ a form of transfer learning to identify appropriate permutations. We find that between smaller problems in the International Timetabling Competition 2007 benchmark, timetabling performance can be improved using such an approach. However we find that we lose this performance gain when attempting to transfer to considerably larger problems --- indicating that similar structures are required when using a &#39;learnt&#39; permutation approach in such a framework.},

Dealing with them requires solving the real-time Rail Traffic Management Problem (rtRTMP). A subproblem of the rtRTMP is the real-time Energy Consumption Minimization Problem (rtECMP). It defines the speed profiles along with the timing of multiple trains in a given network and time horizon. It takes as input the train routing and precedences computed by a rtRTMP solver and its objective is to minimize the weighted sum of train energy consumption and total delay. In this paper, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for the rtECMP and we test it on the French Pierrefitte-Gonesse control area with dense mixed traffic. The results show that, in 30 seconds, a remarkable exploration of the search space is performed before convergence.},

However, the service composition environment is highly dynamic, which poses unique challenges for algorithm selection. Chief amongst those is the availability of training data for all algorithms on unseen tasks, which is infeasible to obtain.

  abstract  = {In real-world applications, many optimization problems have the time-linkage property, that is, the objective function value relies on the current solution as well as the historical solutions. Although the rigorous theoretical analysis on evolutionary algorithms has rapidly developed in the last two decades, it remains an open problem to theoretically understand the behaviors of evolutionary algorithms on time-linkage problems. This paper takes the first step towards the rigorous analyses of evolutionary algorithms for time-linkage functions. Based on the basic OneMax function, we propose a time-linkage function where the first bit value of the last time step is integrated but has a different preference from the current first bit. We prove that with probability 1 - o(1), randomized local search and (1 + 1) EA cannot find the optimum, and with probability 1 - o(1), (μ + 1) EA is able to reach the optimum.This paper for the Hot-off-the-Press track at GECCO 2021 summarizes the work &quot;Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms on Fitness Function with Time-linkage Property&quot; by W.

A perfect assertion oracle passes (returns true) for all correct executions and fails (returns false) for all incorrect executions. Because designing perfect assertion oracles is difficult, assertions often fail to distinguish between correct and incorrect executions. In other words, they are prone to false positives and false negatives.GAssert is the first technique to automatically improve assertion oracles by reducing false positives and false negatives. Given an assertion oracle and a set of correct and incorrect program states, GAssert employs a novel co-evolutionary algorithm that explores the space of possible assertions to identify one with fewer false positives and false negatives. Our evaluation on 34 Java methods shows that GAssert effectively improves assertion oracles.},

A low sampling error at initialization is necessary (but not sufficient) for a reliable search since a low sampling error reduces the overall random variations in a random sample. For this reason, we have recently presented a model to determine a minimum initial population size so that the sampling error is lower than a threshold, given a confidence level. Our model allows practitioners of, for example, genetic programming (GP) and other EA variants to estimate a reasonable initial population size.},

P3 employs linkage learning to decompose the problem and uses this information during its run. P3 maintains many different linkage information sets, which is the key to effectively solve the problems of the overlapping nature, i.e., the problems whose variables form a large and complicated network of dependencies rather than additively separable blocks. MO-P3 inherits the features of its predecessor and employs both linkage learning and linkage diversity maintenance to effectively solve hard multi-objective problems, which includes both: well-known test problems and NP-hard real-world problems.},

The experiments show that evolutionary algorithms outperform vaccination strategies when provided information is accurate, that is, when most disease cases are known and the intensity of rewiring is low. With higher level of uncertainty the strategies produce better results. Results presented in the article motivate further work in several areas: modelling and prediction of changes in the contacts network, development of computational methods for estimating the number of initial disease cases, and hybridization of evolutionary optimizers with vaccination strategies and other knowledge-based approaches.},

Our proposal is based on visualizing the differences between the empirical attainment functions (EAFs) of the two alternative algorithmic configurations, and then ask the DM to choose their preferred side of the differences. Information about the regions preferred by the DM is translated into a weighted hypervolume indicator that will assign higher quality values to approximation fronts that result in EAF differences preferred by the DM. This indicator may be used to guide an automatic algorithm configuration method, such as irace, to search for parameter values that perform better in the objective space regions preferred by the DM. Experiments on the well-known bi-objective quadratic assignment problem and a real-world production planning problem arising in the manufacturing industry show the benefits of the proposal.This manuscript for the Hot-off-the-Press track at GECCO 2021 is based on the paper: &quot;Incorporating Decision-Maker&#39;s Preferences into the Automatic Configuration of Bi-Objective Optimisation Algorithms&quot; published by European Journal of Operational Research [6].},

These are a kind of mobile ad hoc networks made of e.g. (possibly, unmanned) vehicles and humans where, despite a lack of continuous connectivity, data must be transmitted while the network conditions change due to the nodes&#39; mobility. In these contexts, routing is NP-hard and is usually solved by heuristic &quot;store and forward&quot; replication-based approaches, which however produce relatively low delivery probabilities. Here, we genetically improve two routing protocols widely adopted in DTNs, namely Epidemic and PRoPHET, in the attempt to optimize their delivery probability. First, we dissect them into their fundamental components, i.e., functionalities such as checking if a node can transfer data, or sending messages to all connections. Then, we apply Genetic Improvement (GI) to manipulate these components as terminal nodes of evolving trees. We apply this methodology, in silico, to six test cases of urban networks made of hundreds of nodes, and find that GI produces consistent gains in delivery probability in four cases.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) are complex critical systems that must be thoroughly tested. Still, assessing the strength of tests for ADSs is an open and complex problem. Weight Coverage is a test criterion targeting ADSs which are based on a weighted cost function. It measures how much each weight, related to different aspects of the ADS&#39;s decision process, is involved in the decisions taken in a test scenario. All weights/aspects should be involved for a strong test suite. Although weight coverage can measure the quality of a test suite, it does not provide clear guidance for test generation. This work proposes weight coverage-driven search-based test generation for ADSs. It describes and compares three designs of the search process: a single-objective search aiming at generating a test covering a single weight; a multi-objective search where each objective targets a different weight; and a single-objective search where the fitness function is an aggregate function representing the coverage over multiple weights. Experiments using an ADS system provided by our industry partner show the validity of the method and provide insights into the benefits of each search design.

A single quality indicator maps the approximation set (i.e., high-dimensional data) into a real value (i.e, one-dimensional data). However, it is well known that the selection of the quality indicator can have a huge impact on the benchmarking conclusions. This invites researchers to present only results for quality indicators that are in favor of the desired algorithm, or performing bias performance assessment. To go beyond this, we proposed a novel ranking scheme that reduces the bias in the user-preference selection by comparing the high-dimensional data of approximations sets and consequently provides more robust statistical results. The selection of a quality indicator is only required in cases when high-dimensional distributions of the approximation sets differ. By performing such analyses, experimental results show that the cases affected by the user-preference selection are reduced.},

  abstract  = {Previous theory work on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms considers mostly easy problems that are composed of unimodal objectives. This paper takes a first step towards a deeper understanding of how evolutionary algorithms solve multi-modal multi-objective problems. We propose the OneJumpZeroJump problem, a bi-objective problem with single objectives isomorphic to the classic jump function benchmark. We prove that the simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer (SEMO) cannot compute the full Pareto front. In contrast, for all problem sizes n and all jump sizes [EQUATION], the global SEMO (GSEMO) covers the Pareto front in Θ((n-2k)nk) iterations in expectation. To improve the performance, we combine the GSEMO with two approaches, a heavy-tailed mutation operator and a stagnation detection strategy, that showed advantages in single-objective multi-modal problems. Runtime improvements of asymptotic order at least kΩ(k) are shown for both strategies. Our experiments verify the substantial runtime gains already for moderate problem sizes. Overall, these results show that the ideas recently developed for single-objective evolutionary algorithms can be effectively employed also in multi-objective optimization.This Hot-off-the-Press paper summarizes &quot;Theoretical Analyses of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms on Multi-Modal Objectives&quot; by B.

  abstract  = {In Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE), researchers and practitioners (SBSE users) using multi-objective search algorithms (MOSAs) often select commonly used MOSAs to solve their search problems. Such a selection is usually not justified, and the main selection criterion is the MOSA popularity. On the other hand, SBSE users are usually aware of the desired qualities of solutions of their search problem, captured by Quality Indicators (QIs). Consequently, to guide SBSE users in selecting MOSAs for their specific SBSE problems, we study preference relationships between QIs and MOSAs with an empirical evaluation. Given a QI or a quality aspect (e.g., convergence), we suggest a MOSA that is highly likely to produce solutions representing the QI or the quality aspect. Based on our experiments&#39; results, we provide insights and suggestions for SBSE users to choose a MOSA based on experimental evidence.This is an extended abstract of the paper [2]: S. Ali, P.

The algorithm must balance the need to explore the search space and to exploit promising regions of this space. In this work we describe an algorithm that combines previous ideas to tackle the GECCO 2021 industrial challenge using an exploration and an exploitation step. The first step consists in an evolutionary algorithm combined with an experimental design, while the second phase is a neighborhood search embedded within a multi-armed ∈-greedy approach. The resulting algorithm is not only applicable to the challenge but also to more general problems with varying conditions.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a surrogate-based approach that uses a relatively simple population-based optimisation algorithm, a basic Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), and experiments with two complementary approaches to construct a surrogate. This surrogate-based optimisation uses a predictive model in-line and decides whether to calculate a candidate individual (using the simulation model) or discard it as part of the optimisation process. The complementary approaches for the design of the surrogate are (1) a traditional regression-based surrogate that approximates the surface of the fitness landscape using a supervised continuous machine learning algorithm (XGBoost), and (2) a pairwise approach that models the surrogate as a binary classification problem for a machine learning algorithm (in this experiment we proposed a Decision Tree binary classifier). Although there is no statistical difference in the performance of both surrogate approaches, the surface/regression one obtains a slightly better performance when the execution is limited to 200 fitness evaluations. In contrast, the pairwise/classification approach obtains the lowest value and a lower mean in executions with 750 fitness evaluations.},

  abstract  = {The performance assessment of multi-objective optimization algorithms is a crucial task for investigating their behaviour. However, the selected quality indicators and statistical techniques used in comparison studies can have huge impact on the study results. A quality indicator transforms high-dimensional data (an approximation set) into one-dimensional data (a quality indicator), followed by a potential loss of high-dimensional information concerning the transformation. Comparison approaches typically involve a single quality indicator or an ensemble of quality indicators to address more quality criteria, which are predefined by the user. To provide more robust benchmarking for multi-objective optimization, we extended the DSCTool with three approaches that are ensembles of quality indicators and one novel approach that compare the high-dimensional distributions of the approximation sets and reduces the users&#39; preference in the selection of quality indicators. The approaches are provided as web services for robust ranking and hypothesis testing, including a proper selection of an omnibus statistical test and post-hoc tests if needed.},
