  abstract  = { We study the problem of online learning a hypothesis class and a given binary 0-1 loss function, using instances generated $i.i.d.$ by a given distribution. The goal of the online learner is to make only finitely many errors (loss 1) with probability $1$ in the infinite horizon. In the binary label case, we show that hypothesis classes are online learnable in the above sense if and only if the class is effectively countable. We extend the results to hypothesis classes where labels can be non-binary. Characterization of non-binary online learnable classes is more involved for general loss functions and is not captured fully by the countability condition even for the ternary label case. In the computational bounded setup, we compare our results with well known results in recursive function learning, showing that the class of all total computable functions is indeed learnable with computable online learners and randomized sampling. Finally, we also show that the finite error guarantee will not be affected even when independent noise is added to the label.},

Previous work has left open the question of whether there exist sound planners that need only $\mbox{poly}(H,d)$ queries regardless of the MDP, where $H$ is the horizon and $d$ is the dimensionality of the features. We answer this question in the negative: we show that any sound planner must query at least $\min(e^{\Omega(d)},\Omega(2^H))$ samples in the fized-horizon setting and $e^{\Omega(d)}$ samples in the discounted setting. We also show that for any $\delta&gt;0$, the least-squares value iteration algorithm with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5 d^{H+1}/\delta^2)$ queries can compute a $\delta$-optimal policy in the fixed-horizon setting.

We essentially prove this conjecture: We show that after receiving a random training set of size $k &lt; d$, the expected squared loss is still $1-\frac{k}{(d-1)}$. The only requirement needed is that the input layer is fully connected and the initial weight vectors of the input nodes are chosen from a rotation invariant distribution. Surprisingly the same type of problem can be solved drastically more efficient by a simple 2-layer linear neural network in which the $d$ inputs are connected to the output node by chains of length 2 (Now the input layer has only one edge per input). When such a network is trained by gradient descent, then it has been shown that its expected squared loss is $\frac{\log d}{k}$. Our lower bounds essentially show that a sparse input layer is needed to sample efficiently learn sparse targets with gradient descent.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear Models (GLM) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model. Different from its classical setting, our model allows the server to access some additional public but unlabeled data. By using Stein’s lemma and its variants, we first show that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm for GLM (under some mild assumptions), if each data record is i.i.d sampled from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\ell_1$-norm. Then with high probability, the sample complexity of the public and private data, for the algorithm to achieve an $\alpha$ estimation error (in $\ell_\infty$-norm), is $O(p^2\alpha^{-2})$ and ${O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$, respectively, if $\alpha$ is not too small ({\em i.e.,} $\alpha\geq \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$), where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data. This is a significant improvement over the previously known exponential or quasi-polynomial in $\alpha^{-1}$, or exponential in $p$ sample complexity of GLM with no public data. We then extend our idea to the non-linear regression problem and show a similar phenomenon for it. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper showing the existence of efficient and effective algorithms for GLM and non-linear regression in the NLDP model with public unlabeled data. },

We propose two algorithms for this setting and derive PAC bounds on their sample complexity: one for the case of positive costs and the other for the case of non-negative costs under a restricted optimality criterion. While tight sample complexity bounds have been derived for the finite-horizon and discounted MDPs, the SSP problem is a strict generalization of these settings and it poses additional technical challenges due to the fact that no specific time horizon is prescribed and policies may never terminate, i.e., we are possibly facing non-proper policies. As a consequence, we can neither directly apply existing techniques minimizing sample complexity nor rely on a regret-to-PAC conversion leveraging recent regret bounds for SSP. Our analysis instead combines SSP-specific tools and variance reduction techniques to obtain the first sample complexity bounds for this setting.},

While it is understood that the distribution of contexts might change over time, e.g., due to seasonalities, or deployment to new environments, the bulk of studies concern the most adversarial such changes, resulting in regret bounds that are often worst-case in nature. \emph{Covariate-shift} on the other hand has been considered in classification as a middle-ground formalism that can capture mild to relatively severe changes in distributions. We consider nonparametric bandits under such middle-ground scenarios, and derive new regret bounds that tightly capture a continuum of changes in context distribution. Furthermore, we show that these rates can be \emph{adaptively} attained without knowledge of the time of shift (change point) nor the amount of shift.},

  abstract  = {This paper is concerned with computationally efficient learning of homogeneous sparse halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under noise. Though recent works have established attribute-efficient learning algorithms under various types of label noise (e.g. bounded noise), it remains an open question of when and how $s$-sparse halfspaces can be efficiently learned under the challenging {\em malicious noise} model, where an adversary may corrupt both the unlabeled examples and the labels. We answer this question in the affirmative by designing a computationally efficient active learning algorithm with near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}(s \log^4\frac{d}{\epsilon})$ and noise tolerance $\eta = \Omega(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is the target error rate, under the assumption that the distribution over (uncorrupted) unlabeled examples is isotropic log-concave. Our algorithm can be straightforwardly tailored to the passive learning setting, and we show that the sample complexity is $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}s^2 \log^5 d)$ which also enjoys attribute efficiency. Our main techniques include attribute-efficient paradigms for soft outlier removal and for empirical risk minimization, and a new analysis of uniform concentration for unbounded instances – all of them crucially take the sparsity structure of the underlying halfspace into account.},

However, this convenience comes at the cost of robustness: a typical function encountered in practice is unlikely to have been drawn from the data scientist’s prior, in which case uncertainty estimates can be misleading, and the resulting exploration can be suboptimal. We present a frequentist approach to GP/BO uncertainty quantification. We utilize the GP framework as a working model, but do not assume correctness of the prior. We instead construct a \emph{confidence sequence} (CS) for the unknown function using martingale techniques. There is a necessary cost to achieving robustness: if the prior was correct, posterior GP bands are narrower than our CS. Nevertheless, when the prior is wrong, our CS is statistically valid and empirically outperforms standard GP methods, in terms of both coverage and utility for BO. Additionally, we demonstrate that powered likelihoods provide robustness against model misspecification.},

New factors come into play: the ordering of the dataset and whether the number of points, $n$, is known in advance or not. Their exact effects are unknown. In this paper we focus on the online setting where the decisions are irreversible: after a point arrives, the algorithm needs to decide whether to take the point as a center or not, and this decision is final. How many centers are needed and sufficient to achieve constant approximation in this setting? We show upper and lower bounds for all the different cases. These bounds are exactly the same up to a constant, thus achieving optimal bounds. For example, for $k$-means cost with constant $k&gt;1$ and random order, $\Theta(\log n)$ centers are enough to achieve a constant approximation, while the mere a priori knowledge of $n$ reduces the number of centers to a constant. These bounds hold for any distance function that obeys a triangle-type inequality.},

In our work, we instead propose a more natural adaptive approach for reward-free exploration which directly reduces upper bounds on the maximum MDP estimation error. We show that, interestingly, our reward-free UCRL algorithm can be seen as a variant of an algorithm by Fiechter from 1994, originally proposed for a different objective that we call best-policy identification. We prove that RF-UCRL needs of order (SAH^4/\epsilon^2)(log(1/\delta) + S) episodes to output, with probability 1-\delta, an \epsilon-approximation of the optimal policy for any reward function. This bound improves over existing sample complexity bounds in both the small \epsilon and the small \delta regimes. We further investigate the relative complexities of reward-free exploration and best policy identification. },

  abstract  = {We give an efficient algorithm for learning a binary function in a given class $C$ of bounded VC dimension, with training data distributed according to $P$ and test data according to $Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ may be arbitrary distributions over $X$. This is the generic form of what is called \textit{covariate shift}, which is impossible in general as arbitrary $P$ and $Q$ may not even overlap. However, recently guarantees were given in a model called PQ-learning (Goldwasser et al., 2020) where the learner has: (a) access to unlabeled test examples from $Q$ (in addition to labeled samples from $P$, i.e., semi-supervised learning); and (b) the option to \textit{reject} any example and abstain from classifying it (i.e., selective classification). The algorithm of Goldwasser et al. (2020) requires an (agnostic) noise-tolerant learner for $C$. The present work gives a polynomial-time PQ-learning algorithm, called \textit{Slice-and-Dice}, that uses an oracle to a “reliable” learner for $C$, where reliable learning (Kalai et al., 2012) is a model of learning with one-sided noise. Furthermore, this reduction is optimal in the sense that we show the equivalence of reliable and PQ learning.},

  abstract  = {Combinatorial bandits with semi-bandit feedback generalize multi-armed bandits, where the agent chooses sets of arms and observes a noisy reward for each arm contained in the chosen set. The action set satisfies a given structure such as forming a base of a matroid or a path in a graph. We focus on the pure-exploration problem of identifying the best arm with fixed confidence, as well as a more general setting, where the structure of the answer set differs from the one of the action set. Using the recently popularized game framework, we interpret this problem as a sequential zero-sum game and develop a CombGame meta-algorithm whose instances are asymptotically optimal algorithms with finite time guarantees. In addition to comparing two families of learners to instantiate our meta-algorithm, the main contribution of our work is a specific oracle efficient instance for best-arm identification with combinatorial actions. Based on a projection-free online learning algorithm for convex polytopes, it is the first computationally efficient algorithm which is asymptotically optimal and has competitive empirical performance.},

  abstract  = { This paper shows that the implicit bias of gradient descent on linearly separable data is exactly characterized by the optimal solution of a dual optimization problem given by a smoothed margin, even for general losses. This is in contrast to prior results, which are often tailored to exponentially-tailed losses. For the exponential loss specifically, with $n$ training examples and $t$ gradient descent steps, our dual analysis further allows us to prove an $O\del{\ln(n)/\ln(t)}$ convergence rate to the $\ell_2$ maximum margin direction, when a constant step size is used. This rate is tight in both $n$ and $t$, which has not been presented by prior work. On the other hand, with a properly chosen but aggressive step size schedule, we prove $O(1/t)$ rates for both $\ell_2$ margin maximization and implicit bias, whereas prior work (including all first-order methods for the general hard-margin linear SVM problem) proved $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ margin rates, or $O(1/t)$ margin rates to a suboptimal margin, with an implied (slower) bias rate. Our key observations include that gradient descent on the primal variable naturally induces a mirror descent update on the dual variable, and that the dual objective in this setting is smooth enough to give a faster rate. },

We express it as the so called Shtarkov sum known in information theory. To the best of our knowledge such a sum was never computed in the context of logistic regression. To be more precise, the pointwise regret of an online algorithm is defined as the (excess) loss it incurs over some value of a constant comparator (weight vector) that is used for prediction. It depends on the feature values, label sequence, and the learning algorithm. In the maximal minimax scenario we seek the best weights for the worst label sequence over all possible learning algorithms/ distributions, therefore it constitutes a lower bound for the pointwise regret. For finite dimension $d$ and $N$ distinct feature vectors we show that the maximal minimax regret grows as $$ \frac{d}{2} \log (T/2\pi)+C_d + O(N/\sqrt{T}) $$ where $T$ is the number of rounds of running a training algorithm and $C_d$ is explicitly computable constant that depends on the feature values and dimension $d$. We also extend these results to non-binary labels. The {\it precise} maximal minimax regret presented here is the first result of this kind. Our findings are obtained using tools of analytic combinatorics and information theory.},

  abstract  = {Information-theoretic quantities like entropy and mutual information have found numerous uses in machine learning. It is well known that there is a strong connection between these entropic quantities and submodularity since entropy over a set of random variables is submodular. In this paper, we study combinatorial information measures defined over sets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures strictly generalize the corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized via submodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically, we show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular mutual information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other fixed, for a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial derivatives satisfy a non-negativity property (also called second-order supermodular functions). We study specific instantiations of the submodular information measures, and see that they all have mathematically intuitive and practically useful expressions. Regarding applications, we connect the maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual information to problems such as mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy preserving summarization — and we connect optimizing the multi-set submodular mutual information to clustering and robust partitioning.},

Our algorithm gives exact samples, assuming exact computation of an inverse function of a polynomial.

When $f$ is the identity, and so $S$ is just a $k$-dimensional subspace, it is known that, with high probability, a random embedding into $O(k/\epsilon^2)$ dimensions preserves the norm of all $y \in S$ up to $(1\pm \epsilon)$ relative error. Such embeddings are known as \emph{subspace embeddings}, and have found widespread use in compressed sensing and approximation algorithms.% for regression, PCA, and many other problems. We give the first low-distortion embeddings for a wide class of nonlinear functions $f$. In particular, we give additive $\epsilon$ error embeddings into $O(\frac{k\log (n/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2})$ dimensions for a class of nonlinearities that includes the popular Sigmoid SoftPlus, and Gaussian functions. We strengthen this result to give relative error embeddings under some further restrictions, which are satisfied e.g., by the Tanh, SoftSign, Exponential Linear Unit, and many other ‘soft’ step functions and rectifying units. Understanding embeddings for subspaces under nonlinear transformations is a key step towards extending random sketching and compressing sensing techniques for linear problems to nonlinear ones. We discuss example applications of our results to improved bounds for compressed sensing via generative neural networks.},

More precisely, we study Generalized Linear Bandits (GLBs) in drifting environments, where the level of non-stationarity is characterized by a general metric known as the variation-budget. Existing methods to solve such problems typically involve forgetting mechanisms, which allow for a fine balance between the learning and tracking requirements of the problem. We uncover two significant mistakes in their theoretical analysis. The first arises when bounding the tracking error suffered by forgetting mechanisms. The second emerges when considering non-linear reward models, which requires extra care to balance the learning and tracking guarantees. We introduce a geometrical assumption on the arm set, sufficient to overcome the aforementioned technical gaps and recover minimax-optimality. We also share preliminary attempts at fixing those gaps under general configurations. Unfortunately, our solution yields degraded rates (w.r.t to the horizon), which raises new open questions regarding the optimality of forgetting mechanisms in non-stationary parametric bandits.},

The work of Kleinberg et al. (2010) showed that there exist no-regret algorithms which perform no worse than the best ranking of actions asymptotically. Unfortunately, achieving this regret bound appears computationally hard: Kanade and Steinke (2014) showed that achieving this no-regret performance is at least as hard as PAC-learning DNFs, a notoriously difficult problem. In the present work, we relax the original problem and study computationally efficient no-approximate-regret algorithms: such algorithms may exceed the optimal cost by a multiplicative constant in addition to the additive regret. We give an algorithm that provides a no-approximate-regret guarantee for the general sleeping expert/bandit problems. For several canonical special cases of the problem, we give algorithms with significantly better approximation ratios; these algorithms also illustrate different techniques for achieving no-approximate-regret guarantees. },

At each time step, some of the agents are stochastically activated, requested to make a prediction, and the system pays the corresponding loss. Then, neighbors of active agents receive semi-bandit feedback and exchange some succinct local information. The goal is to minimize the network regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative loss of the predictions of active agents and that of the best action in hindsight, selected from a combinatorial decision set. The main challenge in such a context is to control the computational complexity of the resulting algorithm while retaining minimax optimal regret guarantees. We introduce Coop-FTPL, a cooperative version of the well-known Follow The Perturbed Leader algorithm, that implements a new loss estimation procedure generalizing the Geometric Resampling of Neu and Bartók [2013] to our setting. Assuming that the elements of the decision set are $k$-dimensional binary vectors with at most $m$ non-zero entries and $\alpha_1$ is the independence number of the network, we show that the expected regret of our algorithm after $T$ time steps is of order $Q\sqrt{mkT\log(k) (k\alpha_1/Q+m)}$, where $Q$ is the total activation probability mass. Furthermore, we prove that this is only $\sqrt{k\log k}$-away from the best achievable rate and that Coop-FTPL has a state-of-the-art $T^{3/2}$ worst-case computational complexity.},

  abstract  = { We study the problem of learning a mixture of two subspaces over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. The goal is to recover the individual subspaces, given samples from a (weighted) mixture of samples drawn uniformly from the two subspaces A_0 and A_1. This problem is computationally challenging, as it captures the notorious problem of “learning parities with noise&quot; in the degenerate setting when $A_1 \subseteq A_0$. This is in contrast to the analogous problem over the reals that can be solved in polynomial time (Vidal’03). This leads to the following natural question: is Learning Parities with Noise the only computational barrier in obtaining efficient algorithms for learning mixtures of subspaces over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$? The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above question. Namely, we show the following results: 1. When the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$ are incomparable, i.e., $A_0$ and $A_1$ are not contained inside each other, then there is a polynomial time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$. 2. In the case when $A_1$ is a subspace of $A_0$ with a significant gap in the dimension i.e., $dim(A_1) \le \alpha dim(A_0)$ for $\alpha&lt;1$, there is a $n^{O(1/(1-\alpha))}$ time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$. Thus, our algorithms imply computational tractability of the problem of learning mixtures of two subspaces, except in the degenerate setting captured by learning parities with noise. },

  abstract  = {We give a unified way of testing and learning finite Markov chains from a single Markovian trajectory, using the idea of $k$-cover time introduced here. The $k$-cover time is the expected length of a random walk to cover every state at least $k$ times. This generalizes the notion of cover time in the literature. The error metric in the testing and learning problems is the infinity matrix norm between the transition matrices, as considered by Wolfer and Kontorovich. Specifically, we show that if we can learn or test discrete distributions using $k$ samples, then we can learn or test Markov chains using a number of samples equal to the $k$-cover time of the chain, up to constant factors. We then derive asymptotic bounds on the $k$-cover time in terms of the number of states, minimum stationary probability and the cover time of the chain. Our bounds are tight for reversible Markov chains and almost tight (up to logarithmic factors) for irreducible ones. Our results on $k$-cover time yield sample complexity bounds for a wider range of learning and testing tasks (including learning, uniformity testing, identity testing, closeness testing and their tolerant versions) over Markov chains, and can be applied to a broader family of Markov chains (irreducible and reversible ones) than previous results which only applies to ergodic ones.},

  abstract  = { We investigate $k$-means clustering in the online no-substitution setting when the input arrives in \emph{arbitrary} order. In this setting, points arrive one after another, and the algorithm is required to instantly decide whether to take the current point as a center before observing the next point. Decisions are irrevocable. The goal is to minimize both the number of centers and the $k$-means cost. Previous works in this setting assume that the input’s order is random, or that the input’s aspect ratio is bounded. It is known that if the order is arbitrary and there is no assumption on the input, then any algorithm must take all points as centers. Moreover, assuming a bounded aspect ratio is too restrictive — it does not include natural input generated from mixture models. We introduce a new complexity measure that quantifies the difficulty of clustering a dataset arriving in arbitrary order. We design a new random algorithm and prove that if applied on data with complexity $d$, the algorithm takes $O(d\log(n) k\log(k))$ centers and is an $O(k^3)$-approximation. We also prove that if the data is sampled from a “natural&quot; distribution, such as a mixture of $k$ Gaussians, then the new complexity measure is equal to $O(k^2\log(n))$. This implies that for data generated from those distributions, our new algorithm takes only $poly(k\log(n))$ centers and is a $poly(k)$-approximation. In terms of negative results, we prove that the number of centers needed to achieve an $\alpha$-approximation is at least $\Omega\left(\frac{d}{k\log(n\alpha)}\right)$.},

This setup can be modeled as a combinatorial bandit which chooses $K$ out of $N$ arms at each time, with an aim to achieve an efficient trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This is the first work for combinatorial bandits where the feedback received can be a non-linear function of the chosen $K$ arms. The direct use of multi-armed bandit requires choosing among $N$-choose-$K$ options making the state space large. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm which is computationally efficient and the storage is linear in $N$. The proposed algorithm is a divide-and-conquer based strategy, that we call CMAB-SM. Further, the proposed algorithm achieves a \textit{regret bound} of $\tilde O(K^{\frac{1}{2}}N^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for a time horizon $T$, which is \textit{sub-linear} in all parameters $T$, $N$, and $K$.},

However, due to the prevalence of malicious users in these systems, it is becoming increasingly important to design dueling bandit algorithms that are robust to corruptions introduced by these malicious users. In this paper we study dueling bandits in the presence of an adversary that can corrupt some of the feedback received by the learner. We propose an algorithm for this problem that is agnostic to the amount of corruption introduced by the adversary: its regret degrades gracefully with the amount of corruption, and in case of no corruption, it essentially matches the optimal regret bounds achievable in the purely stochastic dueling bandits setting.},

Our goal is to recover the directions of all causal or ancestral relations in $G$, via a minimum cost set of interventions. It is known that constructing an exact minimum cost intervention set for an arbitrary graph $G$ is NP-hard. We further argue that, conditioned on the hardness of approximate graph coloring, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than $\Theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of observed variables in $G$. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a bi-criteria approximation goal that lets us recover the directions of all but $\epsilon n^2$ edges in $G$, for some specified error parameter $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Under this relaxed goal, we give polynomial time algorithms that achieve intervention cost within a small constant factor of the optimal. Our algorithms combine work on efficient intervention design and the design of low-cost separating set systems, with ideas from the literature on graph property testing.},

In this setting, the bidding agent obtains information, on both the value of the item at sale and the behavior of the other bidders, only when she wins the auction. Standard bandit theory does not apply to this problem due to the presence of action-dependent censoring. In this work, we consider second-price auctions and propose novel, efficient UCB-like algorithms for this task. These algorithms are analyzed in the stochastic setting, assuming regularity of the distribution of the opponents’ bids. We provide regret upper bounds that quantify the improvement over the baseline algorithm proposed in the literature. The improvement is particularly significant in cases when the value of the auctioned item is low, yielding a spectacular reduction in the order of the worst-case regret. We further provide the first parametric lower bound for this problem that applies to generic UCB-like strategies. As an alternative, we propose more explainable strategies which are reminiscent of the Explore Then Commit bandit algorithm. We provide a critical analysis of this class of strategies, showing both important advantages and limitations. In particular, we provide a minimax lower bound and propose a nearly minimax-optimal instance of this class.},

  abstract  = {While classic work in convex-concave min-max optimization relies on average-iterate convergence results, the emergence of nonconvex applications such as training Generative Adversarial Networks has led to renewed interest in last-iterate convergence guarantees. Proving last-iterate convergence is challenging because many natural algorithms, such as Simultaneous Gradient Descent/Ascent, provably diverge or cycle even in simple convex-concave min-max settings, and there are relatively few papers that prove global last-iterate convergence rates beyond the bilinear and convex-strongly concave settings. In this work, we show that the Hamiltonian Gradient Descent (HGD) algorithm achieves linear convergence in a variety of more general settings, including convex-concave problems that satisfy a &quot;sufficiently bilinear&quot; condition. We also prove convergence rates for stochastic HGD and for some parameter settings of the Consensus Optimization algorithm of Mescheder et al. (2017).},
