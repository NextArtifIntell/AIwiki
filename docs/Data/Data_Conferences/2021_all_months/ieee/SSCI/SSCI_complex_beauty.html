  abstract  = {Meta-heuristics have demonstrated relative success when applied to permutation problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Two successful meta-heuristics are Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) but have widely differing methodologies, combining both could be beneficial. This paper achieves this using a mutation operator based on the novel ACO variant Partial-ACO. Applied to a range of TSP instances significant gains are achieved over standard mutation operators. Furthermore, to increase performance consideration is given to operating mutation in a greedy manner enabling constant use, a fully combined GA and ACO meta-heuristic solution. Experiments demonstrate that a greedy approach to ACO mutation improves results enabling solutions to TSP instances of several thousand cities within a few percent of optimal to be achieved without any local search methods.},

This presented research aims to try various implementations of Novelty Search that could remove this inability and enhance the PSO algorithm. In total, we present five different modifications. The CEC 2020 single objective bound-constrained optimization benchmark testbed was used to evaluate the different Novelty Search-based modifications of the algorithm. All results were compared and tested for statistical significance against the original variant of PSO using the Friedman rank test. This work aims to increase understanding of implementing new approaches for population dynamics control, which are not driven purely by a gradient, and inspire other researchers working with different evolutionary computation methods.},

  abstract  = {Achieving and maintaining high allocations to Private Equity and keeping allocations at the targeted level through recommitment strategies is a complex task which needs to be balanced against the risk of becoming a defaulting investor. When looking at recommitments we are quickly faced with a combinatorial explosion of the solution space, rendering explicit enumeration impossible. As a consequence, manual management if any is becoming time-consuming and error-prone. For this reason, investors need guidance and decision aid algorithms producing reliable, robust and trustworthy recommitment strategies. In this work, we propose to generate automatically recommitment strategies based on the evolution of symbolic expressions to provide clear and understandable decision rules to Private Equity experts and investors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a methodology to learn recommitment strategies using evolutionary learning is proposed. Experiments demonstrate the capacity of the proposed approach to generate efficient and robust strategies, keeping a high degree of investment while bounding the risk of being overinvested.},

However, far fewer studies focus on the multimodal representation of data, namely the information that consists of multiple channels. In this work, we focus on the classification problem of multimodal data. Memes comprise a visual image and a textual caption. This work is dedicated to classifying hateful memes and this work proposes two approaches to solve the multimodal classification problem. First, converting the visual channel into a textual one and feed it to textual classifiers. The other approach, which yielded superior results, converted both channels into a vector representation and then combined them to represent the visual-textual context. This work is a consequence of the Facebook Hateful Memes challenge. The model developed in this work managed to rank 32 among 3172 competitors in the challenge. The model is implemented with no domain knowledge or understanding of hate speech. This model performed well in the Facebook Hateful Memes challenge dataset and a novel dataset that we created to prove the consistency of generic models over other models that are structured according to domain knowledge. In contrast to the top solution in the Facebook Memes Challenge, this work provides a generic approach, without hard-coding rules ahead of training or validation, that is able to learn the hatefulness definition from any dataset. A novel dataset that comprises hateful memes retrieved randomly from the web is described in this work, which is used as another dataset to test approaches generality.},

  abstract  = {Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic (GPHH) is an effective technique to deal with the Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP). The GPHH can evolve a routing policy that can respond to the uncertain environment in real time. Previous studies have shown that the GPHH can evolve effective routing policies. However, the size (number of nodes) in the GP-evolved routing policy is still not taken into account. Smaller routing policies, in general, may have greater generalisation and interpretability. As a result, we should optimise the effectiveness and the size simultaneously. Evolutionary Multi-Objective (EMO) techniques can be applied to optimise the size along with the effectiveness. EMO can evolve a Pareto front of routing policies. TSNSGPII-a is the state-of-the-art EMO approach for UCARP. It keeps an archive to store potential individuals lost during the evolutionary process and select them to breed new offspring. In this paper, we further improve TSNSGPII-a in the way to select between the current population and the archive as parents. In addition, we propose a validation stage to increase the reliability of the final routing policy. The experimental results showed that the newly proposed algorithm, named TSNSGPII-arv, can achieve better HV and I G D on a set of instances. The controlled experimental results indicated both schemes are effective. The routing policies evolved by TSNSGPII-arv are smaller than the baseline single-objective GPHH approach without losing effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a new particle swarm optimisation variant: the altruistic heterogeneous particle swarm optimisation algorithm (AHPSO). The algorithm conceptualises particles as energy-driven agents with bio-inspired altruistic behaviour. In our approach, particles possess a current energy level and an activation threshold and are in one of two possible states (active or inactive) depending on their energy levels at time t. The idea of altruism is used to form lending-borrowing relationships among particles to change an agent&#39;s state from inactive to active, and the main search mechanism exploits this idea. Diversity in the swarm, which prevent premature convergence, is maintained via agent states and the level of altruistic behaviour particles exhibit. The performance of AHPSO was compared with 11 metaheuristics and 12 state-of-the-art PSO variants using the CEC&#39;17 and CEC&#39;05 test suites at 30 and 50 dimensions. The AHPSO algorithm outperformed all 23 comparison algorithms on both benchmark test suites at both 30 and 50 dimensions.},

  abstract  = {Multiobjetive optimization has gained a considerable momentum in the evolutionary computation scientific community. Methods coming from evolutionary computation have shown a remarkable performance for solving this kind of optimization problems thanks to their implicit parallelism and the simultaneous convergence towards the Pareto front. In any case, the resolution of multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) from the perspective of multitasking optimization remains almost unexplored. Multitasking is an incipient research stream which explores how multiple optimization problems can be simultaneously addressed by performing a single search process. The main motivation behind this solving paradigm is to exploit the synergies between the different problems (or tasks) being optimized. Going deeper, we resort in this paper to the also recent paradigm Evolutionary Multitasking (EM). We introduce the adaptation of the recently proposed Multifactorial Cellular Genetic Algorithm (MFCGA) for solving MOPs, giving rise to the Multiobjective MFCGA (MO-MFCGA). An extensive performance analysis is conducted using the Multiobjective Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm as comparison baseline. The experimentation is conducted over 10 multitasking setups, using the Multiobjective Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem as benchmarking problem. We also perform a deep analysis on the genetic transferability among the problem instances employed, using the synergies among tasks aroused along the MO-MFCGA search procedure.},

The space of the moose competition games is expanded and the hypothesis that changing the resource profiles of the game will lead to the evolution of different types of agents is tested. The fields that the moose forage in may have enhanced rate of plant growth or enhanced richness of plant biomass. Increasing these parameters is found to decrease conflict between moose, after a minimum level is passed, and enhancing richness is found to modify moose behavior in intuitive ways. In some parts of the resource model space, the agents exhibit negative density dependent selection that increases the rate of confrontation. This study demonstrates that the family of moose games provides a rich palette of different games for testing students and agent AIs.},

The MCTS’ popularity is based on its extraordinary results in the challenging two-player based game Go, a game considered much harder than Chess and that until very recently was considered infeasible for Artificial Intelligence methods. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is built and the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One particular selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees, commonly referred as UCT. The UCT attempts to nicely balance exploration and exploitation by considering the values stored in the statistical tree of the MCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is necessary for this to work well. In this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve mathematical expressions with the goal to substitute the UCT mathematical expression. We compare our proposed approach, called Evolution Strategy in MCTS (ES-MCTS) against five variants of the MCTS UCT, three variants of the *-minimax family of algorithms as well as a random controller in the Game of Carcassonne. We also use a variant of our proposed EA-based controller, dubbed ES partially integrated in MCTS. We show how the ES-MCTS controller, is able to outperform all these 10 intelligent controllers, including robust MCTS UCT controllers.},

We propose a shift in perspective of the ongoing re-identification studies, towards creating more explainable and coherent models that are applicable in real-world engineering problems, even if this comes with a slight decrease in performance. The proposed explainable model uses attribute classification to perform the task of re-identification. This method steps away from intrusive and controversial techniques such as facial recognition to improve public acceptance of re-identification models. Current methods of person re-identification do not explain the importance of each attribute in determining the results, and often use complicated and esoteric algorithms to improve the performance on closed-world datasets which may not represent more realistic open-world scenarios. We applied our approach to the Market-1501 dataset and examined the impact of careful selection of backbone outputs for each individual attribute in our experiment. Our simple model is capable of performing attribute classification for 0-shot re-identification that is explainable and less intrusive when compared to state-of-the-art models focused on re-identification.},

  abstract  = {The Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm is a supervised machine learning scheme utilizing natural computational ability of dynamical systems. Delayed chaotic systems provide rich dynamics for information processing by using the system&#39;s transient response to an external input, so have been identified as suitable systems for reservoir computing. In delay-feedback reservoir computing a virtual network is achieved through time-multiplexing, trading off input frequency and reservoir complexity. Here we investigate several features and tradeoffs that affect physical delay-dynamical reservoirs, based on the Mackey-Glass model, including the role of input mask, and a ‘devirtualisation’ of the output. We evaluate performance using the NARMA-10 benchmark. We find that random binary masks with no offset outperform other masking schemes, but require a careful choice of model parameters. We find that reading the output of a subset of ‘virtual’ nodes, the ‘devirtualised network’, does not affect computational power, which enables a tradeoff between output design complexity and readout frequency.},

  abstract  = {Life science data analysis frequently encounters particular challenges that cannot be solved with classical techniques from data analytics or machine learning domains. The complex inherent structure of the data and especially the encoding in non-standard ways, e.g., as genome- or protein-sequences, graph structure or histograms, often limit the development of appropriate classification models. To address these limitations, the application of domain-specific expert similarity measures has gained a lot of attention in the past. However, the use of such expert measures suffers from two major drawbacks: (a) there is not one outstanding similarity measure that guarantees success in all application scenarios, and (b) such similarity functions often lead to indefinite data that cannot be processed by classical machine learning methods. In order to tackle both of these limitations, this paper presents a method to embed indefinite life science data with various similarity measures at the same time into a complex-valued vector space. We test our approach on various life science data sets and evaluate the performance against other competitive methods to show its efficiency.},

The design of algorithms for pathfinding problems faces challenges due to multiple conflicting objectives. A variable and scalable benchmark suite was proposed in a recent study, which uses a variable-length encoding for the multi-objective pathfinding problem. However, since several existing multi-objective optimisation frameworks cannot cope with such a representation, we propose two fixed-length encodings to enable the most commonly available algorithms and operators to work on such pathfinding problems. We evaluate the representations on different aspects, such as the quality and feasibility of solutions. Furthermore, we conduct an experiment to assess the performance of large-scale algorithms.

It is important to be able to predict ahead of time these potential patient discharge outcomes and to know what factors influence the development of discharge planning for such adults receiving care for neurological conditions in an acute setting. The goal of this study is to develop predictive models exploring which patient characteristics and clinical variables significantly influence discharge planning with the hope that the models can be used in a suggestive context to help guide healthcare providers in efforts of planning effective, equitable discharge recommendations. Our methodology centers around building and training five different machine learning models followed by testing and tuning those models to find the best-suited predictor with a dataset of 5,245 adult patients with neurological conditions taken from the eICU-CRD database. The results of this study show XGBoost to be the most effective model for predicting between four common discharge outcomes of ‘home’, ‘nursing facility’, ‘rehab’, and ‘death’, with 71\% average c-statistic. This research also explores the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of the best performing model by identifying and analyzing the features that are most impactful to the predictions.},

  abstract  = {Language pre-training methods such as BERT have led to significant performance gains for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. This paper investigates the improvement in transformer model translation for low resource South African languages when pre-trained models are used in language translation. A South African low resource language multilingual BERT, dubbed SALR-mBERT is pre-trained from scratch using all nine of the low resource South African languages. SALR-mBERT performs better than mBERT and the transformer models for language corpora with approximately less than 600000 sentences. SALR-mBERT obtained the best results for Sesotho, Ndebele, Swati and Venda. SALR-mBERT outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on language corpora with less than 600000 sentences by about 29\% and also outperforms the transformer model by 50\%. The transformer model translation obtained the best results compared to mBERT and the SALR-mBERT models for language corpora with more than 600000 sentences. The transformer obtained the best results followed by SALR-mBERT for Northern Sotho, Tsonga, Xhosa, Tswana and Zulu to English translations. The transformer model outperforms SALR-mBERT by 15\% for Zulu which has the largest corpus size compared to other low resource South African languages. The main finding of this work is that the BERT type module is beneficial for machine translation if the corpus size is small and has less than approximately 600000 sentences, and further improvement can be gained when the BERT model is trained using languages of a similar nature like in the case of SALR-mBERT. However, transformer model translations outperform BERT model translations if the corpus size is greater than 600000 sentences.},

This paper presents an extended learning optimality theory on a multiple reward scheme, where XCS receives a reward sampled from a finite set of multiple rewards. Thus, the multiple reward scheme can be observed in various machine learning problem domains, e.g., prediction, regression, and classification. Our theory firstly proves that XCS can distinguish maximally accurate rules from any other ones with the minimum update times on the multiple-reward scheme. This proof returns theoretically optimal settings of XCS parameters, i.e., a learning rate, an error tolerance, and a subsumption threshold. In addition, suppose a continuous reward scheme as having an extremely large set of discrete rewards, our theory can be substantially satisfied on this scheme.},

There are quantum neurons that can carry an exponential amount of information to a linear number of quantum information units (qubits) using the quantum property of superposition. In this paper, we compare the performance of three of these quantum neuron models applied to the diabetes classification problem. We also propose the use of different data preprocessing strategies. Quantum neurons were simulated using the IBM Qiskit tool. We compare the preprocessing approaches applied to two toy problems (1) simulating the XOR operator and (2) solving a generic nonlinear problem. The results of the experiments shows that a single quantum neuron is capable of achieving an accuracy rate of 100\% in the XOR problem and an accuracy rate of 100\% in a non-linear dataset, demonstrating that the quantum neurons with real weights are capable of modeling non-linearly separable problems. In the problem of diagnosing diabetes, quantum neurons achieved an accuracy rate of 76\% and AUC-ROC of 88\%, while its classic version, the perceptron, reached only 63\% accuracy and the artificial neural network reached 80\% AUC-ROC. These results indicate that a single quantum neuron performs better than its classical version and even the artificial neural network for AUC-ROC, demonstrating potential for use in healthcare applications in the near future.},

With this goal in mind, we propose two new fuzzy topic models; FLSA-W and FLSA-V. Both models are derived from the topic model Fuzzy Latent Semantic Analysis (FLSA). After training each model ten times, we use the mean coherence score to compare the different models with the benchmark models Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and FLSA. Our proposed models generally lead to higher coherence scores and lower standard deviations than the benchmark models. These proposed models are specifically useful as topic embeddings in text classification, since the coherence scores do not drop for a high number of topics, as opposed to the decay that occurs with LDA and FLSA.},

The PML model is constructed using only the vertex values of piecewise hypercube regions. Input-output feedback linearization was used to transform each PML system into one linearized system represented by the Brunovsky canonical form. We showed that the proposed method was effective in some examples by computer simulations. The proposed design method can be applied to any nonlinear system whose relative degree is the same as the dimension of the state variable, and can control the wider regions of nonlinear control systems compared with conventional feedback linearization. Since the modeling is simple and independent of the characteristics of the system model, it may contribute to the realization of any nonlinear control system design.},

The calculation of various landscape features requires complete knowledge of the boundaries and constraints of the entire search space. Many real-world applications of distributed optimization exhibit an inherent domain decomposition, i.e., the decision variables for a cooperative search are in the hands of multiple actors. Thus, knowledge about the overall search space - likewise distributed - is not available at a central location. In this paper, we propose an approach for distributed computation and subsequent composition of fitness landscape features. We evaluate the approach with a set of well-known continuous benchmark functions and examine the features for correlation with algorithm performance and their suitability for feature-based algorithm parameterization. The results show that the distributedly computed features provide useful insights into the nature of the problems and that especially the heterogeneity of the sub-search spaces is a relevant factor in the optimized design of the exchange mechanisms of distributed heuristics.},

SC will only be accepted if a user&#39;s individual mobility requirements are fulfilled, i.e. their EV is charged when required and has enough charge to make the planned journey. To fulfill these requirements, the parking duration in a given location must be known; manually providing this information, however, is inconvenient for users and can thus not be expected. Therefore, the present paper focuses on benchmarking automated parking duration predictions in important locations for SC applications. We suggest a preprocessing pipeline including a two-stage spatial clustering algorithm to determine important locations and relevant features for parking duration prediction in SC applications. To provide further information for the SC algorithm, we develop two separate machine learning approaches to predict the parking duration; the time until the next departure and the absolute departure time. We evaluate our approaches on real and semisynthetic mobility data, using a custom metric to provide a realistic benchmark for parking duration prediction. We determine that a two-model approach may enhance prediction accuracy, given a suitable merging algorithm. Furthermore, we show that random forest ensemble models based on specific locations or points in time outperform standard random forest models.},

Determining this execution precision, or skill, for players is thus an important task. Knowledge of skill can be used for player feedback, computer-aided strategy decisions, game handicapping, and opponent modeling. Challenges to estimating player ability include getting precise feedback on executed actions as well as performing the estimation in a natural and user-friendly way. A previous method for estimating skill in darts overcomes the first challenge, but falls short on the second, requiring players to throw 50 darts at the center of the dartboard, which is not a common target in most darts games. In this paper we present an extension of this previous method that enables skill to be estimated when darts are aimed anywhere, not just the center of the dartboard. This method is then utilized to develop a much more efficient and adaptive skill estimation method which requires far fewer darts than the previous method. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach and additional possible applications are discussed.},

Typical multi-objective optimization algorithms prioritize the selection mechanism in the objective space, making such multi-modal solutions challenging to find. This paper introduces a new approach to preserve diversity in the decision space, which is particularly well suited to pathfinding problems. In the decision space, we impose a total order on a naturally unordered set of paths and measure the solutions&#39; isolation precisely, by utilizing discrete Fréchet distance. In this concept, diversification in the decision-space replaces the widely known concept of crowding distance. An examination of the proposed method is conducted using a variety of benchmarks and a real-world example.},

This problem has so far not been discussed in the corresponding literature. We discuss ideas how to select promising datasets and propose three very simple indicators: Estimated relative return improvement (ERI) and estimated action stochasticity (EAS), as well as a combination of the two (COI), and empirically show that despite their simplicity they can be very effectively used for dataset selection.},

It is, combinatorically, of similar complexity as chess or Go, yet the rules of the game are such that current methods can barely beat a randomly playing agent. A major bottleneck for progress is the high branching factor of the game. We apply state of the art methods for which we develop new heuristics that are based on human domain-knowledge, attempting to improve upon the current dire state of Hive agents. Our methods have improved playing strength compared to the state of the art, although our AI still fails against actual Humans. We also find that, while in most board games, brute force or deep learning approaches work best, in Hive, an approach based on mimicking human knowledge outperforms these other approaches, including Monte Carlo Tree Search or Deep Reinforcement Learning. Future work will show if this anomalous situation is inherent to the game.},

Previous work employed a custom Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) that adapted wing motion patterns, while in flight and in normal online service, to compensate for wing damage. Although generally successful in finding solutions to this challenging online non-stationary problem, the previous methods would very often require hours of flight time to reach full success and sometime failed altogether in cases of extreme wing damage. This paper details a new approach that reduces the required learning time by an order of magnitude and extends the range of damage over which one can expect suitable performance. A discussion of what changes were made and why they were made will be provided along with extensive simulation results demonstrating the claims of success. The paper will also provide discussion of what additional work is possible now that both speed and efficacy have been sufficiently improved to support practical in-flight learning in real vehicles.},

  abstract  = {Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a digital identity that is managed in a decentralized manner utilising an underlying blockchain. It allows identity owners to manage and store their digital identities without relying on centralised third-party providers. Providing full control of an identity to its owner seeks to enhance the security and privacy of the individual. The utilisation of the decentralised trust model provided by an underlying blockchain realises this user-centred control. However, this operational change towards greater control and responsibility placed upon identity owners poses new challenges and security threats to the SSI system. Heretofore, there have been no significant research studies performed to assess potential attacks on the SSI system. The SSI model is an emerging Identity Management model, and requires a meticulous study of its potential attack surfaces. Therefore, this paper proposes an attack tree based risk analysis method for investigating potential attacks on the SSI system and their associated risks in facilitating their mitigations. This proposed attack tree based risk analysis method presents a systematic and generalised model to generate attack trees that can be used to perform risk analysis. In this investigation, three potential attacks on the SSI system are focused: faking identity, identity theft and distributed denial of service attacks. For each attack, the attack tree based risk analysis is performed; and subsequently, their mitigations are proposed.},

Nonetheless, most Machine Learning algorithms are trained via derivative-based optimizers, such as the Stochastic Gradient Descent, leading to possible local optimum entrapments and inhibiting them from achieving proper performances. A bioinspired alternative to traditional optimization techniques, denoted as meta-heuristic, has received significant attention due to its simplicity and ability to avoid local optimums imprisonment. In this work, we propose to use meta-heuristic techniques to fine-tune pre-trained weights, exploring additional regions of the search space, and improving their effectiveness. The experimental evaluation comprises two classification tasks (image and text) and is assessed under four literature datasets. Experimental results show nature-inspired algorithms&#39; capacity in exploring the neighborhood of pre-trained weights, achieving superior results than their counterpart pre-trained architectures. Additionally, a thorough analysis of distinct architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptron and Recurrent Neural Networks, attempts to visualize and provide more precise insights into the most critical weights to be fine-tuned in the learning process.},

Our previous publication has exploited the behavioural patterns data of known activities captured from wearable devices for subject recognition. In this paper, the main objective is to investigate the recent idea of activity-independent subject identification.

  abstract  = {Microgrids provide power systems with an effective manner to integrate distributed energy resources, increase power supply reliability, and reduce operational cost. However, intermittent renewable energy resources (RESs) makes it challenging to operate a microgrid safely and economically based on forecasting. To overcome this issue, we develop an online energy management approach for efficient microgrid operation using safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL). By considering uncertainties and AC power flow, the proposed method formulates online microgrid energy management as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). The objective is to find a safety-guaranteed scheduling policy to minimize the total operational cost. To achieve this, we use a SDRL method to learn a neural network-based policy based on constrained policy optimization (CPO). Different from tradition DRL methods that allow an agent to freely explore any behavior during training, the proposed method limits the exploration to safe policies that satisfy AC power flow constraints during training. The proposed method is model-free and does not require predictive information or explicit model of the microgrid. The proposed method is trained and tested on a medium voltage distribution network with real-world power grid data from California Independent Operator (CAISO). Simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of proposed method over traditional DRL approaches.},

The output of the GAT based model is combined with the LSTM layer in order to exploit both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the multivariate multidimensional historical weather data. Real weather data collected from several cities in Denmark and Netherlands are used to conduct the experiments and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. We show that in comparison to previous architectures used for wind speed prediction, the proposed model is able to better learn the complex input-output relationships of the weather data.

  abstract  = {Human shape estimation has become increasingly important both theoretically and practically, for instance, in 3D mesh estimation, distance garment production and computational forensics, to mention just a few examples. As a further specialization, Human Body Dimensions Estimation (HBDE) focuses on estimating human body measurements like shoulder width or chest circumference from images or 3D meshes usually using supervised learning approaches. The main obstacle in this context is the data scarcity problem, as collecting this ground truth requires expensive and difficult procedures. This obstacle can be overcome by obtaining realistic human measurements from 3D human meshes. However, a) there are no well established methods to calculate HBDs from 3D meshes and b) there are no benchmarks to fairly compare results on the HBDE task. Our contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we present a method to calculate right and left arm length, shoulder width, and inseam (crotch height) from 3D meshes with focus on potential medical, virtual try-on and distance tailoring applications. On the other hand, we use four additional body dimensions calculated using recently published methods to assemble a set of eight body dimensions which we use as a supervision signal to our Neural Anthropometer: a convolutional neural network capable of estimating these dimensions. To assess the estimation, we train the Neural Anthropometer with synthetic images of 3D meshes, from which we calculated the HBDs and observed that the network&#39;s overall mean estimate error is 20.89 mm (relative error of 2.84\%). The results we present are fully reproducible and establish a fair baseline for research on the task of HBDE, therefore enabling the community with a valuable method.},

However, due to the stochastic nature of the results obtained using EAs, the design of benchmarks and competitions where such approaches can be evaluated and compared is attracting attention in the field. In the energy domain, the “2021 CEC-GECCO-PESGM Competition on Evolutionary Computation in the Energy Domain: Smart Grid Applications” provides a platform to test and compare new EAs to solve complex problems in the field. However, the metric used to rank the algorithms is based solely on the mean fitness value (related to the objective function value only), which does not give statistical significance to the performance of the algorithms. Thus, this paper presents a statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon pair-wise comparison to study the performance of algorithms with statistical grounds. Results suggest that, for track 1 of the competition, only the winner approach (first place) is significantly different and superior to the other algorithms; in contrast, the second place is already statistically comparable to some other contestants. For track 2, all the winner approaches (first, second, and third) are statistically different from each other and the rest of the contestants.

  abstract  = {The paper introduces an innovative methodology for the automatic discrimination of multiple choice answers chosen by merit and random guess by analyzing the confidence level of examinees using an Electroencephalographic system. The acquired brain signals of the subjects participating in the experiment are first examined using the eLORETA software which portrays the active participation of the middle frontal gyrus and precuneus when a subject is fully confident regarding the choice of the correct answer. In the next phase, the signals are pre-processed and converted to spectrogram plots using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) which reveal the enhanced activation of theta and lower alpha bands when a subject attempts an answer with his/her merit. On the other hand, the afore-said frequency bands portray reduced activation when a subject tries to choose an answer by a mere guess. The acquired spectrogram plots are transferred to a novel Capsule network model that aids in categorizing the two degrees of confidence level: High and Low. The novelty in the design of the Capsule based classifier lies in the introduction of a depthwise separable convolution layer, a squeeze and excitation attention mechanism and a Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Unit (SiLU) based dynamic routing algorithm. The proposed classifier demonstrates promising results in categorizing the two classes of confidence level and also outperforms its conventional counterparts. Thus, the proposed scheme can be utilized to improve the quality of assessment in multiple choice based examinations.},

  abstract  = {An explosive growth of misleading and untrustworthy news articles has been observed over the last years. These news articles are often referred to as fake news and have been found to severely impact fair elections and democratic values. Computational Intelligence models may be applied to the classification of news articles, assuming that an efficient feature set is available as input to the model. However, the selection of appropriate feature sets is an open question for such high-dimensional tasks. A further challenge is the general applicability of feature selection strategies, where testing on a single dataset may convey misleading results. The work herein evaluates a wide-range of potential news article features resulting in twenty-five potential features. Feature selection, based on a combination of feature scoring, feature ranking and mutual information is then applied, evaluated on multiple datasets: Kaggle, Liar and FakeNewsNet. An Artificial Immune System model is applied in the feature ranking and as the classification model. The accuracy obtained is compared to state of the art fake news classification models, highlighting that the approach shows promise in terms of accuracy despite the small feature sets provided for classification.},

  abstract  = {Virtual Reality (VR) games that feature physical activities have been shown to increase players&#39; motivation to do physical exercise. However, for such exercises to have a positive healthcare effect, they have to be repeated several times a week. To maintain player motivation over longer periods of time, games often employ Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) to adapt the game&#39;s challenge according to the player&#39;s capabilities. For exercise games, this is mostly done by tuning specific in-game parameters like the speed of objects. In this work, we propose to use experience-driven Procedural Content Generation for DDA in VR exercise games by procedurally generating levels that match the player&#39;s current capabilities. Not only finetuning specific parameters but creating completely new levels has the potential to decrease repetition over longer time periods and allows for the simultaneous adaptation of the cognitive and physical challenge of the exergame. As a proof-of-concept, we implement an initial prototype in which the player must traverse a maze that includes several exercise rooms, whereby the generation of the maze is realized by a neural network. Passing those exercise rooms requires the player to perform physical activities. To match the player&#39;s capabilities, we use Deep Reinforcement Learning to adjust the structure of the maze and to decide which exercise rooms to include in the maze. We evaluate our prototype in an exploratory user study utilizing both biodata and subjective questionnaires.},

  abstract  = {Time Delay Reservoir (TDR) can exhibit effects of high dimensionality and short-term memory based on delay differential equations (DDEs), as well as having hardware-friendly characteristics. However, the predictive performance and memory capacity of the standard TDRs are still limited, and dependent on the hyperparameter of the oscillation function. In this paper, we first analyze these limitations and their corresponding reasons. We find that the reasons for such limitations are fused by two aspects, which are the trade-off between the strength of self-feedback and neighboring-feedback caused by neuron separation, as well as the unsuitable order setting of the nonlinear function in DDE. Therefore, we propose a new form of TDR with second-order time delay to overcome such limitations, incurring a more flexible time-multiplexing. Moreover, a parameter-free nonlinear function is introduced to substitute the classic Mackey-Glass oscillator, which alleviates the problem of parameter dependency. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves better predictive performance and memory capacity compared with the standard TDR. Our proposed model also outperforms six other existing approaches on both time series prediction and recognition tasks.},

In contrast to existing methods, we use convolutional neural networks as the selection apparatus which bases its decision on a so-called ‘fitness map’. This fitness map is a 2D representation of a two dimensional search space where different gray scales indicate the quality of found solutions in certain areas. Our devised approach uses a modular CMA-ES framework which offers the option to create the conventional CMA-ES, CMA-ES with the alternate step-size adaptation and many other variants proposed over the years. In total, 4 608 different configurations are possible where most configurations are of complementary nature. In this proof-of-concept work, we consider a subset of 32 possible configurations. The developed method is evaluated against an excerpt of BBOB functions and its performance is compared against baselines that are commonly used in automated algorithm selection - the best standalone algorithm (configuration) and the best obtainable sequence of configurations. While the results indicate that the use of the fitness map is not superior on every benchmark problem, it indubitably shows its merit on more hard-to-solve problems. This offers a promising perspective for generalizing to other types of optimization problems and problem domains.},

However, 3D non-rigid methods for registration are still a research topic and present numerous particular challenges in plant phenotyping due to: overlaps and self-occlusions in dense phyllotaxies; deformations caused by plant growth over time; changes in outdoor environmental settings, etc. In this paper, we address the problem of registering spatio-temporal 3D models of plants by proposing a bundle registration approach that can handle transformations with up to three additional Degrees of Freedom (DoF) to capture the growth of the plant. Besides, we offer to the research community a new multi-view stereo dataset consisting of 2D images and 3D point clouds of an African violet plant observed over a period of ten days. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the new African violet dataset using the usual 6 DoF (three rotations and three translations) and compared it with 7 DoF (three rotations, three translations, and one scale) and 9 (three rotations, three translations, and three scales). We also performed the comparison between the proposed approach and two other registration approaches: pairwise and incremental. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average registration error of less than 2 mm on the African violet dataset. Also, we used VisND, an N-dimensional spatio-temporal visualization tool, to perform a visual assessment of the aligned time-varying 3D models of the plants.},

  abstract  = {The Constrained Accelerated Random Search (CARS) algorithm is a stochastic search method that converges with probability 1 to the global minimum of a constrained black-box optimization problem under certain conditions. CARS randomly selects its sample point from a box centered at the current best solution and adjusts the size of this box depending on whether the point yields an improvement in constraint violation or feasible objective function value. For computationally expensive problems, the CARS- RBF algorithm that uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) surrogates was proposed. Numerical experiments showed the effectiveness of CARS and CARS-RBF compared to alternatives on many test problems. However, both algorithms require a feasible starting point. This paper extends CARS and CARS-RBF to handle constrained black-box optimization problems when a feasible starting point is not available. The extended algorithms begin by minimizing a measure of constraint violation to find a feasible solution and then they search for the global minimum until the computational budget is reached. The algorithms were tested on 19 benchmark problems and on a 12-D engineering optimization problem with 68 black-box constraints where none of the initial points are guaranteed to be feasible. CARS outperformed Constrained Pure Random Search (CPRS) and the ISRES and jDE evolutionary algorithms on the test problems, and CARS-RBF is generally an improvement over CARS. Furthermore, CARS-RBF outperformed other methods including RBF -assisted CPRS and the COBYLA trust region method and it compared favorably with constrained EGO.},

The intelligent learning process is developed for both nominal and attack conditions without the requirement of system dynamics and attack information. Neural network techniques are applied to implement the proposed method with two critic networks and the control signals are calculated accordingly. Therefore, the designed intelligent control method can reduce the computation complexity.

The applicability of the web services and the Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) for the simulation of electrical networks is identified as an advantage of the proposed methodology. This allows to adopt an equivalent block to simplify the Microgrids model based in the existing conditions. In addition, the integration of ITC should consider topics as cybersecurity and interoperability, this paper presents concepts and standards associated to these topics. The present work presents a literature review about methods for distribution networks simulation in steady state, and the selection of strategies to simulate Microgrids.

In particular, we are interested in the evolved morphologies and compare the emerging &#39;life forms&#39; in a Moonlike environment to those evolved under Earth-like conditions. To model the Moon we change two environmental properties of our baseline environment that represents the Earth: gravity is set to a low value and the flat terrain is replaced by the NASA model of the Moon landing site of the Apollo 14. The results show that changing only one of these does not lead to different evolved robot morphologies, but changing both does. Our evolved Moonwalkers are usually bigger, have fewer limbs and a less space filling shape than the robots evolved on Earth.},

When comparing algorithmic performance it is recommended that the control parameters of each algorithm be tuned to the problem. However, control parameter tuning is often an expensive and time-consuming process. Recent work has derived the theoretical stability conditions on the MGPSO control parameters to guarantee order-1 and order-2 stability. This paper investigates an approach to randomly sample control parameter values for MGPSO that satisfy these stability conditions.

We consider the theoretical aspect to understand the efficiency and the computational complexity of the proposed method and prove that the number of iterations required here for a PDLP is at best the number of rules of the program.},

  abstract  = {There are severe computational restrictions that are seen in Online Learning events. Nowadays, many researchers have engaged in this learning mostly due to the significance of real-world applications that deal with context changes over time on data streams. The adaptation of the current model is a strategy to deal with concept drifts in data streams, so at every concept drift, the old model is replaced by a new one. In this article, an optimized training dynamic that can choose if it is better to use or ignore detectors&#39; Warning signals is presented to ensure a minimum amount of training or the traditional Warning instances to improve the manner of change&#39;s adaption. The strategy admits a fair evaluation connecting improvements in Prequential accuracy and concept drift signals, in addition, increases the concept drift detection methods&#39; performance rate. The proposal algorithm&#39;s results indicate an improvement contribution to the Prequential accuracy. As well, this paper allows us to notice a better performance with Warning signals application if compared to not Warning signals application, showing their critical role to these contexts. Here, it could be seen the evaluation with DDM, FHDDM, and RDDM methods, the evaluations frequently have statistical superiorities to the optimized dynamic and its choices power if compared to the traditional approach that only contemplates the Warning signals. Although, in some cases, RDDM did not have the same behavior.},

  abstract  = {A new recursive construction of $N$ -ary error-correcting output code (ECOC) matrices for ensemble classification methods is presented, generalizing the classic doubling construction for binary Hadamard matrices. Given any prime integer $N$ , this deterministic construction generates base- $N$ symmetric square matrices $M$ of prime-power dimension having optimal minimum Hamming distance between any two of its rows and columns. Experimental results for six datasets demonstrate that using these deterministic coding matrices for $N$ -ary ECOC classification yields comparable and in many cases higher accuracy compared to using randomly generated coding matrices. This is particular true when $N$ is adaptively chosen so that the dimension of $M$ matches closely with the number of classes in a dataset, which reduces the loss in minimum Hamming distance when $M$ is truncated to fit the dataset. This is verified through a distance formula for $M$ which shows that these adaptive matrices have significantly higher minimum Hamming distance in comparison to randomly generated ones.},

  abstract  = {A good initial population generation method is of necessity to improve the performance of evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms. However, until now only a few methods for generating an initial population have been proposed for EMO algorithms. In this paper, we propose a simple idea of generating an initial population for a popular decomposition-based algorithm, i.e., MOEA/D with the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) function, and demonstrate its effectiveness. The basic idea is to generate more initial solutions than the population size and to assign an appropriate solution to each weight vector. Firstly, we modify the initialization phase of MOEA/D through two different strategies based on this idea. Then, the modified MOEA/D algorithms are compared with the original MOEA/D on frequently-used many-objective test problems: DTLZ1, DTLZ3 and DTLZ4. Our experimental results clearly show that the proposed initial population generation method can significantly improve the performance of the original MOEA/D.},

A simple way to facilitate a personalization of an exoskeleton to the end user is to make use of incremental algorithms that keep learning throughout their deployment. However, it is not clear, if any standard algorithms are fast enough to keep pace with sudden change points in the data stream, like for example the change in movement pattern from a normal walk to going up the stairs. In this paper, we study how well common incremental regression algorithms are suited to predict such an ongoing data stream. We use both, theoretical benchmarks and real world human movement data, to evaluate how fast an algorithm reacts to change points in the data, and how well it is able to remember reoccurring patterns. The results show that a simple KNN algorithm outperforms all other more sophisticated models.},

Moreover, we compare our approach in a statistical analysis to state-of-the-art exact (Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm), gradient-based (L-BFGS-B), and evolutionary (NSGA-II) algorithms with respect to calculation time and quality features of the obtained Pareto fronts indicating convergence and diversity of the solutions. We evaluate the methods on a realistic 2D urban path planning scenario based on real-world data exported from OpenStreetMap. The examination&#39;s results indicate that our approach is able to find significantly better solutions for the formulated problem than standard Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). Moreover, the proposed method is able to obtain more diverse sets of trade-off solutions for different objectives than the standard exact approaches. Thus, the method combines the strengths of both approaches.},

The SPPBO framework is a general scheme to design population-based algorithms for combinatorial (and other) optimization problems. The proposed H-SPPBO algorithm uses a hierarchical tree structure to make it particularly suitable for dynamic (combinatorial) optimization problems. The hierarchy is used to detect dynamic changes. H-SPPBO adapts to changes by discarding low-quality solutions whenever a change is detected. The H-SPPBO is applied to the dynamic Traveling Salesperson Problem (DTSP). The experimental results show that the hierarchical tree structure and the number of swap operations within that tree can be used as an indicator for the occurrence of dynamic changes. It is discussed how the performance of the algorithm is influenced by the threshold for detecting changes and by the number of solutions that are reset when a change is detected. The best results are obtained with medium to high thresholds and when only a certain subset of the solutions is reset.},

In contrast to time-consuming simulations, the constraints of a feasible design can be based on relatively simple geometric expressions, resulting in a mixed computationally expensive, constrained multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed optimization method incorporates a customized repair operator into the well-known evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II. The repair operator exploits the low computational cost of constraints to ensure the feasibility of all solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing results from two different optimization approaches. Apart from the optimization method itself, a physical explanation of Pareto-optimal solutions and insights about electric machine design are also discussed.

In this case, knee points are considered as the naturally preferred trade-off solutions. Most research utilizes the trade-off information or certain properties to find knee points. However, little attention has been paid to combine them to further enhance the knee identification. This paper proposes a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using a hybrid identification method and a bi-population structure to find knee points. The hybrid identification method is based on the localized α-dominance and the distance to the hyperplane. Firstly, two populations are partitioned by a set of predefined reference vectors and apply the localized α-dominance to guide the search towards potential knee regions. Then knee solutions are detected based on the distance to hyperplane constructed by the extreme points. Finally in the environmental selection, a niche-preserving operation is applied to take the knee solutions of all sub-populations into account. The first population is the main part of the search, and affects the offspring generation and environmental selection of the second population. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and competitive in identifying knee solutions.},

The lane change model proposed is rule-based, where PSO learns the parameters of the rules. A study was conducted to compare the proposed lane change model to the existing lane change model in the microscopic simulator, SUMO. Experiments performed include simulating vehicles using the Krauss car-following model with the SUMO lane change model, with the proposed PSO lane change model, and with all lane changing decisions turned off. The latter case, where merges are replaced by vehicle reset, serves as a baseline for missed merge opportunities. The objective was to develop an adaptive approach to improve merge efficiency as an example of lane changing behavior. Varying vehicle densities and levels of congestion on the merge lane and through-lane were tested. Empirical results show the proposed lane change model is able to learn merging strategies with minimal collisions and is comparable to the SUMO lane change model in some scenarios. Further investigation is needed to improve performance and safety, but initial results show promise for the proposed PSO-based approach to autonomous lane changing.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a plane extraction method for embedded computers in mobile robots which typically have less power than general-desktop computers. The increasing demand on immersive technology, including VR, AR, MR, XR, has encouraged to perceive the real-world in 3D space, and so is robotics. However, a problem occurs when large amounts of data are generated, especially for the embedded computers that are usually installed in the mobile robots. Therefore, we propose the plane extraction method to compress the data into other forms suitable for the mobile robot applications. PSO-seeded region growing algorithm was applied to segment the data based on planar characteristics. The output is polygons of each detected plane that can be projected to represent the captured objects in 3D space. It is simple and easy to be applied to the embedded computers, hence less computational time. The algorithm was verified using a depth image dataset of our laboratory. Based on the experimental results, a maximum of 15.1 fps can be achieved.},

  abstract  = {The manufacturing landscape is experiencing a trend towards mass customization of products as customer demands continue to rise. Product life cycles are becoming shorter, while order fluctuations resulting from small lot-sizes increase. Traditional manufacturing lines, designed to produce high quantities of identical products, are ill-equipped to face the new challenges. While the paradigms are shifting, adoption of modern technologies for dynamic and flexible shop floor designs, such as cyber-physical systems and multi-agent systems, remains low. A clear pathway towards reconfiguring legacy systems stepwise is missing, and the new technologies are not yet established enough. We aim to alleviate these problems by introducing a novel, general simulation framework, developed with partners from the industry, for evaluation of manufacturing system designs. We highlight the usage of this framework by applying an online optimization model, utilizing techniques from organic computing, to optimize order and task prioritization in a hypothetical minimal modular smartphone production scenario. Our experiments show that the usage of an independent ob-server/controller structure is suited to solving these problems. The outlined scenario and optimization procedure can be extended to cover real-life manufacturing systems of much greater complexity within the provided framework.},

  abstract  = {Neural networks (NNs) are becoming an increasingly important part of mobile robot control systems. Compared with traditional methods, NNs (and other data-driven techniques) produce comparable-if not better-results while requiring less engineering knowhow. Training NNs, however, still requires exploration of a significant number of architectural, optimization, and evaluation options. In this study, we build a simulation environment, generate three image datasets using distinct techniques, train 652 models (including replicates) using a variety of architectures and paradigms (e.g., classification, regression, etc.), and evaluate the navigation ability of the model in simulation. Our goal is to explore a large number of model possibilities so that we can select the most promising for future study with a physical device. Training datasets leading to the best performing models were those that included a significant amount of noise from seemingly inefficient actions. The most promising models explicitly incorporated “memory” wherein previous actions were included as an input in the next step. Such models performed as good or better than conventional convolutional NNs, recurrent NNs, and custom architectures including two camera frames. Although trained models perform well in an environment matching the distribution of the training dataset, they fail when the simulation environment is altered in a seemingly insignificant manner. In robotics research it is often taken for granted that a model with good validation characteristics will perform well on the underlying task, but the results presented here show that there can often be a loose relationship between validation metrics and performance.},

  abstract  = {On-demand public transit systems require real-time computation of routes to ensure a user-friendly responsive service while also minimizing the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) of the fleet for increasing the profits of an operator. To ensure responsiveness, heuristic algorithms that rapidly generate near-optimal solutions are preferred over time-consuming exact computations. In order to further ensure the scalability of heuristic algorithms, especially to solve large problems, parallel computing techniques need to distribute the workload evenly across several partitions, while keeping passengers on similar routes with less detour in a single partition to reduce the VMT. However, existing works ignore these factors when partitioning the workload. This work proposes a road-network aware tree partitioning algorithm that not only considers the shortest path based routes but also the workloads to create balanced partitions in real-time. Experimental results on a real road-network show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a well-known unsupervised learning algorithm in terms of quality of results and runtime.},

Specifically, we propose a benchmark for training and testing RL-based autonomous driving agents in complex intersection scenarios, which is called RL-CIS. Then, a set of baselines consisting various algorithms are deployed.

The proposed variant improves the fixed topology of the unit structure introduced in the HIDMS-PSO variant. The new master and slave dominated topologies significantly change the dynamics of the unit structure by fluctuating the behavioural heterogeneity in individual units via the use of adaptive topologies. In addition, several existing components in the standard HIDMS-PSO were trimmed down to simplify the algorithm. The efficacy of the adaptive HIDMS-PSO variant was tested by conducting three experiments on the CEC&#39;05 and CEC&#39;17 benchmark test suites at 30 and 50 dimensions using 11 baseline metaheuristics and 15 state-of-the-art PSO variants. The proposed algorithm outperformed all comparison algorithms in all of the conducted experiments. Additionally, adaptive HIDMS-PSO&#39;s convergence rate and population diversity maintenance capability were compared with the inertia weight PSO and the standard HIDMS-PSO. The empirical evidence suggests that the proposed algorithm is capable of converging faster to a better solution while mostly maintaining a better population diversity during the search.},

Takagi-Sugeno (TS) Fuzzy models are systems-based approaches and a popular modeling choice for hydrologists in recent decades due to several advantages and improved accuracy in prediction over other existing models. In this paper, we propose a new rainfall-runoff model developed using Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering-based TS Fuzzy model. We present comparative performance measures of GK algorithms with two other clustering algorithms: (i) Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), and (ii) Subtractive Clustering (SC). Our proposed TS Fuzzy model predicts surface runoff using: (i) observed rainfall in a drainage basin and (ii) previously observed precipitation flow in the basin outlet. The proposed model is validated using the rainfall-runoff data collected from the sensors installed on the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The optimal number of rules of the proposed model is obtained by different validation indices. A comparative study of four performance criteria: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Efficiency (CE), Volumetric Error (VE), and Correlation Coefficient of Determination (R) have been quantitatively demonstrated for each clustering algorithm.},

Due to scarce resources, technology, especially augmented artificial intelligence (AI), has the potential to play a meaningful role by using information management for facilitating better crisis response. In part, this is both due to improvements in the underlying technology, as well as an increasing willingness by stakeholders to release data and systems as open-source. Yet, it is still not clear from published literature if such established systems are truly useful on real-world crisis datasets (such as acquired from Twitter) that often contain noise and inconsistencies. In this paper, we explore this agenda by conducting a set of case studies, using real social media data collected during six disasters (including Hurricane Sandy and the Boston Marathon Bombings) and made publicly available on a crisis informatics platform. We apply established, independently developed AI tools, including a resource specifically designed for the crisis domain, to explore whether they yield useful insights that could be helpful to first-responders. Our results reveal that, while such insights can be obtained with relatively low effort, some caveats and best practices do apply, and sentiment analysis results (in particular) are not always consistent.},

The original agent only communicates with the original neighbors and virtual agent.

In particular, our aim is to extract highly general features that could be successfully used for a large variety of real-world classification tasks. Accordingly, we trained several $\beta{-}$ , Variational Autoencoder $(\beta{-}$ VAE) models on CheXpert, a popular dataset consisting in a very broad and publicly available collection of labeled CXR images; through these models, high level features have been extracted and used to train Machine Learning (ML) classifier (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Extremely Randomised Trees, Gradient Boosting), to classify CXR images thanks to the information extracted from the $\beta{-}$ - VAEs; finally, trained classifiers have been combined in ensembles to improve the performances without the need of further training or models engineering. Despite, as expected, our approach does not achieve the same performance of the state-of-the-art models specifically devised for this classification task, our results are promising and show the viability of using the high level features extracted by the Autoencoders for classification tasks.},

However, most of these modeling approaches make use of the dependency parse tree of sentences for learning task-specific word representations rather than considering that for learning generic representations. In this paper, we propose a new model named DIBERT which stands for Dependency Injected Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. DIBERT is a variation of the BERT, that apart from Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) also incorporates an additional third objective called Parent Prediction (PP). PP injects the syntactic structure of a dependency tree while pre-training the DIBERT, which generates syntax-aware generic representations. We use the WikiText-103 benchmark dataset to pre-train both the original BERT (BERT-Base) and the proposed DIBERT models. After fine-tuning, we observe that DIBERT performs better than BERT-Base on various NLP downstream tasks including Semantic Similarity, Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis hinting at the fact that incorporating dependency information when learning textual representations can improve the quality of the learned representations.},

  abstract  = {The present study proposes a new bio-inspired heterogeneous PSO (particle swarm optimisation) algorithm called BEPSO (biased eavesdropping PSO). The primary search behaviour of the BEPSO algorithm is inspired by eavesdropping behaviour observed in nature, and incorporates a cognitive bias that enables particles to control decisions on cooperation. The algorithm divides the swarm into two distinct particle groups competing to search for a resource. Particles recognise their group members as conspecifics and the other group as heterospecific. When a particle discovers a better position, a contact signal is emitted to attract surrounding conspecifics to the newly discovered position. In nature, multiple species living in the same environment commonly eavesdrop on contact calls originally unintended for them. This can help them to use less energy in searching for resources and potentially increase their fitness. Similarly, in this study, surrounding heterospecifics also eavesdrop on, and exploit, the signal calls originally intended for different conspecific particles. This signaller-recipient interaction experience builds positive or negative bias among particles over time, and particles&#39; final cognitive bias is used as a decision mechanism to exploit signal information. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested by conducting three distinct experiments on the CEC&#39;17 and CEC&#39;05 benchmark test suites at 30 and 50 dimensions. The results were compared against the results of 12 baseline metaheuristics and 12 state-of-the-art PSO variants.

However, the constellation orbit&#39;s design method specialized for regional observation, which is the purpose of the small-scale project, has not been established. This study has designed a constellation orbit by optimizing three satellite orbits simultaneously via design informatics.

For the first time, we formulated the problem into a multi-objective optimisation problem, including the design of the decision variables, objective functions and constraints. We also developed a simulator for the fish breeding process to facilitate research and analysis. Then, we applied the well-known NSGA-II to solve the MO-FBPD problem, analysed the performance of NSGA-II, and the distributions of the solutions obtained by the algorithm. The results shown are promising. First, it is observed that the breeding program, represented as the top percentage of the fish selected for mating, can generalise to different fish population size. In other words, the trained breeding programs can be applied to future breeding processes with any fish population size. Second, it is observed that the long-term and short-term gains of the fish population are conflicting with each other, and they follow a linear relationship. Finally, if the selection strength is too greedy, it may negatively affect even the short-term gain. This work is a promising preliminary study in this problem domain, which can pave the way for further research in MO-FBPD.},

  abstract  = {The best-of-n problem has been a popular research topic for understanding collective decision-making in recent years. Researchers aim to enable a swarm of agents to collectively converge to a single opinion out of a series of potential options, using only local interactions. In this paper, we investigate the viability of decision-making via majority rule using ranked voting systems in multi-option scenarios where n&gt;2. We focus on two ranked voting systems, single transferable vote (STV) and Borda count (BC). The proposed algorithms are tested in a discrete collective estimation scenario, and compared against two benchmark algorithms, direct comparison (DC) and majority rule using first-past-the-post voting (FPTP). We have analyzed the experimental results, focusing on the trade-off between accuracy and speed in decision-making. We have concluded that ranked voting systems can significantly improve the performances of collective decision-making strategies in multi-option scenarios. Our experiments show that BC is the best performing algorithm in the studied scenario.},

This study introduces Population based reinforcement learning (PBRL), a method that hybridizes a GA with a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm. This combination not only enables more scalable policy optimization, but also helps mitigate some of the common weaknesses of policy gradient algorithms. Furthermore, PBRL is also extended to include automatic hyper-parameter tuning, which is used to evaluate the impact that such tuning can have on the performance of the policy gradient algorithm being used. Experiments comparing these methods are conducted on a number of continuous control problems simulated by MuJoCo. Results show that PBRL is capable of outperforming a commonly used policy gradient algorithm, while also producing results in nearly one fifth the time. It is also observed that the addition of automatic hyperparameter tuning can be greatly beneficial for environments where well tuned hyper-parameters are not known.},

However, the Gaussian distribution has an infinite support, whereas real world applications usually have a bounded action space. This dissonance causes an estimation bias that can be eliminated if the Beta distribution is used for the policy instead, as it presents a finite support. In this work, we investigate how this Beta policy performs when it is trained by the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm on two continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym. For both tasks, the Beta policy is superior to the Gaussian policy in terms of agent&#39;s final expected reward, also showing more stability and faster convergence of the training process. For the CarRacing environment with high-dimensional image input, the agent&#39;s success rate was improved by 63\% over the Gaussian policy.},

In this paper, we put forward a novel approach to graph-based item recommendation built on the foundational idea that relational knowledge is characterized by a dynamic nature of the user and its surroundings. We claim that being able to capture such dynamic knowledge allows to build richer contexts upon which more precise recommendations can be built, e.g., taking into account current location, weather conditions, and user mood. The paper provides recipes to build and integrate dynamic user and item contexts in existing item recommendation tasks. We also introduce a novel Dynamic Context-aware Graph Neural Network (DCGNN) that can effectively leverage the knowledge of surroundings to learn the context-aware recommendation behaviour of users. The empirical analysis shows how our model outperforms static state-of-the-art approaches on four movie and travel recommendation benchmarks.},

Sudden shocks in these processes caused by outlier events such as trade wars, pandemics, or weather can have complex effects on the global economy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely: DeepAg, that employs econometrics and measures the effects of outlier events detection using Deep Learning (DL) to determine relationships between commonplace financial indices (such as the DowJones), and the production values of agricultural commodities (such as Cheese and Milk). We employed a technique called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks successfully to predict commodity production with high accuracy and also present five popular models (regression and boosting) as baselines to measure the effects of outlier events. The results indicate that DeepAg with outliers&#39; considerations (using Isolation Forests) outperforms baseline models, as well as the same model without outliers detection. Outlier events make a considerable impact when predicting commodity production with respect to financial indices. Moreover, we present the implications of DeepAg on public policy, provide insights for policymakers and farmers, and for operational decisions in the agricultural ecosystem. Data are collected, models developed, and the results are recorded and presented.},

To this end, task allocations, which optimize multiple network metrics, are evaluated and preemptively redeployed to account for the movement of the mobile nodes. Using a simulation environment, the algorithm is evaluated in multiple scenarios including different network sizes and mobility models and predictions, while measuring Network Lifetime, Latency and successful task execution. Comparing with an existing Multi-Objective algorithm designed for static optimization, the approach shows improved performance in both Latency and task execution, in addition to stable Network Lifetime on the larger network size.},

  abstract  = {Swarm systems can cooperatively and efficiently accomplish specified complex tasks. Recent works have shown the potential of multi-agent reinforcement learning methods to study behavior policies of swarm systems. However, it is difficult for them to complete complex swarm tasks efficiently. In human society, role assignment can effectively help humans understand complex tasks and decompose them into simple certain subtasks. Inspired by this, we propose a two-level hierarchical cooperative swarm policy learning framework with role emergence based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning for distributed swarm systems. In this framework, roles are dynamic and emergent. Agents with the same role tend to collectively complete a certain subtask. Specifically, each agent uses a higher-level swarm policy to dynamically select a role for itself in a role space and at a higher temporal scale, while it uses a lower-level swarm policy to perform the responsibilities of the selected role in a primitive action space. Meanwhile, hierarchical swarm policies with partial observation are centrally trained and decentrally executed, where agents&#39; local interaction modules and extrinsic team rewards are designed to promote cooperation among agents. In addition, an intrinsic reward is defined to enable different roles to be identified by agents&#39; longer-term behaviors, which implicitly associates the roles with responsibilities. Simulation results show that our method can learn and generate emergent, dynamic and identifiable roles, which helps swarm systems to reliably and efficiently accomplish complex tasks in a shorter time.},

  abstract  = {With the proliferation of electric vehicles, the Electric Vehicle Charging Scheduling (EVCS) becomes a critical issue in the modern transportation systems. The EVCS problem in practice usually contains several important but conflicting objectives, such as minimizing the time cost, minimizing the charging expense, and maximizing the final state of charge. To solve the multiobjective EVCS (MOEVCS) problem, the weighted-sum approaches require expertise to predefine the weights, which is inconvenient. Meanwhile, traditional Pareto-based approaches require users to frequently select the result from a large set of trade-off solutions, which is sometimes difficult to make decisions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Multiobjective Differential Evolution (HMODE) with four heterogeneous sub-populations. Specially, one is for the multiobjective optimization and the other three are single-objective sub-populations that separately optimize three objectives. These four sub-populations are evolved cooperatively to find better trade-off solutions of MOEVCS. Besides, HMODE introduces an attention mechanism to the knee and bound solutions among non-dominated solutions of the first rank to provide more representative trade-off solutions, which facilitates decision makers to select their preferred results. Experimental results show our proposed HMODE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of selection flexibility and solution quality.},

This information can be utilized to increase road safety when used in an automated vehicle. We classify the cyclist motion state for every step in a discrete-time horizon using a single neural network in the first method. In our second approach, we consider a two-stage model, i.e., a neural network predicts the current and the next motion state, and a second quantile regression neural network (Q RNN) forecasts the time to transition between these two motion states. Our results show that both methods have advantages and disadvantages. The first method can forecast multiple changes in motion state while the second is restricted to a single transition. However, the first method is limited to a fixed forecast horizon. The two-stage approach, which forecasts motion and time separately, is more flexible regarding the forecast horizon, i.e., it can forecast very long as well as short time spans. Regarding the transition detection performance, both methods perform equally well. Our experiments show that the time to transition to the next motion state can be forecasted accurately, especially for short-time horizons.},

  abstract  = {The class-imbalance problem emerges when the class labels of a dataset have a skewed distribution. In this circumstance, the instances belonging to one class, which is exactly the principal purpose, are dominated thoroughly by the instances belonging to other classes. In recent years, feature selection for high-dimensional imbalanced data has become attraction research scope. This technique concerns selecting an informative feature set to improve the accuracy of the classification model. Moreover, as a subcategory of feature selection, the feature ranking technique has been deliberated to cope with high -dimensional datasets in the last decade. On the one hand, most traditional feature selection methods are not scalable, which is critical to cope with large-scale datasets. On the other hand, scalability is an intrinsic characteristic of the ensemble learning approach. This paper proposes a Distributed Ensemble Imbalanced feature selection framework, called DEIM, to deal with big imbalanced datasets. The DEIM, at first, transforms default data partitions to representative partitions in a single pass. Second, it applies a feature ranking method in a bagging approach upon each partition independently. Finally, It fuses intermediate feature rankings in a stacking strategy. In this paper, two traditional feature ranking algorithms, ReliefF and QPFS, are plugged into DEIM. Therefore, two methods DEIM-Relief and DEIM-QPFS, are produced. Experiments are accomplished on three big imbalanced datasets and upon a computer cluster. The empirical study depicts that the produced methods are scalable. Also, they have lower execution times, and their final results can induce better classification models than DiReliefF and DQPFS.},

  abstract  = {Mating restrictions are a mechanism adopted by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to improve the solution of multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) by establishing a strategy to mate individuals during the reproduction step of the algorithm. Several mating restrictions have been proposed for MOEAs to solve MOPs having two and three objective functions. However, in the case of many-objective optimization problems (four or more objectives), only a few mating restriction schemes have been proposed so far. The Riesz S-energy is a performance indicator which can be used to evaluate population&#39;s diversity, and it is able to provide useful neighborhood information from individuals in MOPs with any number of objectives. This feature has been used in some of our previous work to propose a few different mating restriction schemes based on the s-energy indicator. In this paper, we propose the use of an ensemble of four of these mating restriction mechanisms, which is implemented within the NSGA-III to assess its performance. The ensemble&#39;s behavior is guided by two measurements of each mating restriction performance throughout the algorithm&#39;s execution. We performed an experimental validation of this ensemble in MOPs with up to seven objective functions, and compared the results obtained using the hypervolume, the s-energy, and the inverted generational distance performance indicators. The results obtained show that the use of our mating restrictions ensemble outperforms the original NSGA-III in most of the test instances adopted.},

  abstract  = {A recent case of success, the Knowledge-Guided Local Search was able to efficiently and effectively solve several (Large-Scale) Vehicle Routing Problems. This method presents an interesting concept of route compactness in their search process and uses it to penalise the solutions instead of using the traditional distance measure. Although mostly being successful, this measure sometimes leads to underperforming solutions when compared to the distance aspect. Based on the assumption that the best Guide Local Search penalisation criterion depends on the VRP instance, we make an analysis on how the algorithm behaves across different instances and also propose a Machine Learning model to learn to predict the best penalty criterion for a given instance. Genetic Programming, Support-Vector Machines and Random Forests are used in this classification task. Additionally, we also consider a regression model in order to estimate the improvement given for each mode. Results show that it is possible to find the correct class using the selected features and, in fact, some models were able to classify the majority of instances correctly. However, this is not consistent across different instances.},

  abstract  = {Multiple heterogeneous robots can work together to execute complex tasks. Given multiple heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous robots, the allocation of tasks to robots is a challenging optimization problem. Lots of methods have been proposed for the multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem. However, most existing methods only consider small-scale tasks without precedence constraints. Hence, this paper tracks the time-extended MRTA problem with large-scale cooperative tasks and precedence constraints, and proposes an efficient ant colony system (ACS) to solve the problem. In the proposed algorithm, we adopt a permutation with task-robot alliance pairs as the encode scheme to represent a feasible solution. A pheromone matrix is initialized by a hierarchical greedy strategy and iteratively updated to record historical experience. Heuristic information related to the optimization objective is also designed to help algorithm find better solutions according to the current state. Through combining pheromone and heuristic information, the ACS is able to search high-quality solutions from a global perspective. Experimental results on multiple problem instances are reported to show the advantage of the proposed method. The proposed ACS method can well solve the MRTA problem with large-scale cooperative tasks and precedence constraints.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning (ML) has lately achieved impressive breakthroughs in several fields, enabling a plethora of exciting applications. However, mainstream ML techniques often have an undesirable property: they are not directly understandable by humans, thus humans cannot trust them in high-stakes or life-critical scenarios. A subfield of AI called interpretable AI (IAI) addresses this problem: generating models that are easy to understand for humans and, consequently, trustworthy. While several approaches apply IAI techniques to reinforcement learning problems, addressing the case in which an agent has to act in a continuous action space is still an open question. In this work, we propose a cooperative co-evolutionary approach based on grammatical evolution, Q-learning, and the univariate marginal distribution algorithm, specifically designed to train IAI agents (in the form of binary decision trees) capable of acting in environments with continuous action spaces. The experimental results show that our method is able to solve two well-known OpenAI Gym test cases reaching state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, a quantitative post hoc analysis reveals that the obtained solutions are more interpretable than those reported in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Automatic object detection is one of the most common and fundamental tasks in computational intelligence (CI). Neural networks (NNs) are now often the tool of choice for this task. Unlike more traditional approaches that have interpretable parameters, explaining what a NN has learned and characterizing under what conditions the model does and does not perform well is a challenging, yet important task. The most straightforward approach to evaluate performance is to run test imagery through a model. However, the gaining popularity of self-supervised methods among big players such as Tesla and Google serve as evidence that labeled data is scarce in real-world settings. On the other hand, modern high-fidelity graphics simulation is now accessible and programmable, allowing for generation of large amounts of accurately labeled training and testing data for CI. Herein, we describe a framework to assess the performance of a NN model for automatic explosive hazard detection (EHD) from an unmanned aerial vehicle using simulation. The data was generated by the Unreal Engine with Microsoft&#39;s AirSim plugin. A workflow for generating simulated data and using it to assess and understand strengths and weaknesses in a learned EHD model is demonstrated.},

We conduct a thorough empirical analysis on Sarsa, Expected Sarsa, and n-step Sarsa. We find that the on-policy Sarsa variants suffer from less maximization bias than off-policy Q-learning in several test environments. We show how the choice of hyper-parameters impacts the severity of the bias. A decaying learning rate schedule results in more maximization bias than a fixed learning rate. Larger learning rates lead to larger overestimation. A larger exploration parameter leads to worse bias in Q-learning but less bias in the on-policy algorithms. We also show that a larger variance in rewards leads to more bias in both Q-Learning and Sarsa., but Sarsa is less affected than Q-learning.},

Identification and detection of HVDC discharge are essential study subjects for pipeline safety and optimal operation of electrical power systems. This method overcomes the disadvantage that wavelet packet transform needs to determine the level in advance. The decomposition level of wavelet packet transform is controlled by calculating relatively wavelet energy change to decide its wavelet level. Our proposal extracts richer features of HVDC discharge by comparing other feature extraction algorithms. The second primary discovery is that a wavelet-based application framework is designed to detect the HVDC discharge and further protect the energy pipeline. These discoveries have application value in the protection of power systems and provide opportunities and brighter perspectives along with valuable studies in the detection and classification of time-series data.},

Our model relies on interactions between models of specific types of neurons identified in the mammals&#39; brain, namely place cells, grid cells, and head direction cells, which allow the construction of light, topological and decentralized models of the environment. This environment model can then be exploited for localization and navigation tasks while providing visual odometry. We propose to exploit the decentralized aspect of this navigation model to implement it in swarms of agents, which allows providing a robust navigation model able to guide such swarms and reducing individual required memory and computational resources of each agent. Additional mechanisms are proposed to distribute the environment model while constructing it, and the guiding roles when navigating, with a low amount of exchanged information. These mechanisms were tested in simulated environments, demonstrating the possibilities for a swarm of agents to construct and autonomously distribute a model of the environment during exploration, and to exploit such distributed model to make the swarm navigating toward a predefined position of the environment. These tests also showed that there is no difference in localization drift when compared to single-agent navigation, confirming the relevance of this model for swarm agent navigation.},

For this, the gene tracking approach of the traceable evolutionary algorithm (T-EA) is used with multi-objective problems (MOPs) as the traceable multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (T-MOEA). Through this approach, the influence of the individuals from the initial population on the final generation can be evaluated for MOEAs. Furthermore, the concept of contributing individuals is proposed as an additional metric for evaluation. To evaluate the influence of different population sizes, nine benchmarking problems are run using five different population sizes. Both the performance of the test problems and the convergence of the initial population are discussed in the evaluation.},

In this paper, we summarize a general framework of offline DDEAs using regression models or classification models as surrogate models for constraints, and conduct comparative experiments on these algorithms. The experiment results on the test problems show that the algorithms using regression models can obtain the solutions of better objective value than that of classification models, while that of using classification models can obtain feasible solutions on most of problems but the solutions have poor quality.},

  abstract  = {Real parameter estimation is typically performed by an algorithm that operates directly on vectors of real parameters. This study presents an extension of a representation for real parameter optimization that is discrete and based on the iterated partition of simplices, known as the Walking Triangle Representation (WTR), and pairs it with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms. The number of moves allowed to the WTR is reduced to only its centering move, where a vertex of the simplex is replaced by its center of mass. This representation converts a real parameter optimization to a discrete form, which can then be paired with MCTS-like algorithms. The tree structure of MCTS allows one to keep track of and exploit information from previous attempts (tree extensions) when choosing the next set of moves to try. Six real parameter optimization problems were used to test the algorithm. Four parameters in the algorithm were studied, including: minimum gene length, maximum gene length, number of tree extensions, and probability of exploration (chance). The algorithm regularly performed consistently well, even with a low number of fitness evaluations (typical number of fitness evaluations is up to 3750 per run). This paper focuses on the ability of the Non-Walking Triangle Representation to convert real parameter optimization problems into discrete representations. This concept is demonstrated through the evaluation of the Non-Walking Triangle Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCNon-Walk) algorithm&#39;s ability to find optima in a variety of real parameter optimization problems, using differential evolution as a baseline for comparison.},

  abstract  = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have gained major attention in recent years due to its numerous benefits. The navigation of UAVs is heavily reliant on sensors such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, sensor attacks that specifically target the GPS are a major concern. Equipment such as the software-defined radio can be used to launch GPS spoofing attacks. Existing techniques used to monitor the GPS and channel characteristics as a way to detect these attacks are insufficient due to the clear knowledge of the structure of GPS and channel characteristics which gives adversaries a blueprint to launch stealthy attacks. In this work, we developed various deep learning models that rely on UAV flight logs and telemetry data to detect GPS spoofing attacks in real time. We generate UAV data for different UAV models and use the data to train the models to detect the GPS spoofing attacks through classification. We developed two types of detectors: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) binary classifier and an LSTM autoencoder-based one-class classifier (OCC). For each type, we compared two variations namely a UAV-specific detector that is customized for different UAV types and a UAV-generalized detector that can work with any model of UAV. We test and compare the efficiency of detection models in simulation. Hardware validation experiments were also performed using Intel® NCS2. For the binary classifier, we get a detection accuracy of 97.79\% for the UAV-generalized detector and up to 99.56\% for the UAV-model-specific detector. While for the OCC, we get 94.98\% for the UAV-generalized detector and up to 99.24\% for the UAV-model-specific detector.},

  abstract  = {Uncertainty is pervasive in data and decision making, manifesting in various forms, from lack-of-information to vagueness. Interval-valued data provide an efficient and effective way to capture this uncertainty not afforded by using point-values such as numbers. Once interval-valued data have been captured, insights pertaining to their inherent range can be explored and communicated. Approaches to analysis span from exploring summary statistics, such as the average range/uncertainty, to inferential statistics such as regression and more complex machine learning techniques. In recent years, approaches in particular to regression for interval-valued data have attracted increasing interest, with advances affording improved regression model accuracy and increased resilience to parameter flipping, i.e. ‘loss of mathematical coherence’. This paper explores the application of a branch of statistics-compositional data analysis, for the computation of inferential statistics and specifically regression for interval-valued data. We articulate how, why and when a compositional representation of interval-valued data may be appropriate, and how intervals on a fixed domain can be easily converted to a compositional representation. Finally, we show how regression for compositional (interval) data can be conducted, and how this can provide an elegant means to mitigating some of the challenges faced by traditional approaches, including preserving mathematical coherence by virtue of the compositional representation.},

These problems require either a complete exploration of the search space, or the use of reward-independent approaches, which may not be feasible in some situations. The Novelty Producing Synaptic Plasticity (NPSP) algorithm was recently proposed as a means to obtain successful learning in such contexts, by evolving synaptic plasticity rules able to generate as many novel behaviors as possible. Here, we consider a deceptive maze navigation task and extend the NPSP paradigm to a multi-objective case, by applying NSGA2 to maximizing a goal-agnostic metric (novelty) while minimizing a goal-aware metric (distance), in order to find the possible trade-offs. We then introduce an additional goal-agnostic metric (exploration) and apply MAP-Elites to “illuminate” the feature space projected by novelty and exploration. Lastly, we consider modified settings where 1) sensors are affected by random noise, and 2) the sensor perception is augmented, in order to assess the generalizability of the evolved synaptic rules across settings. Overall, our results show that both multi-objective and MAP-Elites based NPSP can find successful solutions in the different settings of the task.},

  abstract  = {Uncertainty in supply chain leads to what is known as bullwhip effect (BE), which causes multiple inefficiencies such as higher costs of production (of more than what is needed), wastage and logistics. Though there are many studies reported in the literature, the impact of the quality of dynamic forecasts on the BE has not received sufficient coverage. In this paper, a fuzzy data-driven weighted moving average (DDWMA) forecasts of the future demand strategy is proposed for supply chain. Also, data-driven random weighted volatility forecasting model is used to study the fuzzy extended Bollinger bands forecasts of the demand. The main reason of using the fuzzy approach is to provide α-cuts for DDWMA demand forecasts as well as extended Bollinger bands forecasts. The proposed fuzzy extended Bollinger bands forecast is a two steps procedure as it uses optimal weights for both the demand forecasts as well as the volatility forecasts of the demand process. In particular, a novel dynamic fuzzy forecasting algorithm of the demand is proposed which bypasses complexities associated with traditional forecasting steps of fitting any time series model. The proposed data-driven fuzzy forecasting approach focuses on defining a dynamic fuzzy forecasting intervals of the demand as well as the volatility of the demand in supply chain. The performance of proposed approaches is evaluated through numerical experiments using simulated data and weekly demand data. The results show that the proposed methods perform well in terms of narrower fuzzy forecasting bands for demand as well as the volatility of the demand.},

In this problem, each city is restricted to be only accessible to certain salesmen. Since the genetic algorithm (GA) has been widely utilized to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP), this paper first adapts GA to solve VCMTSP. When solving TSP, local search (LS) methods are usually embedded into GA to refine the found solutions. Therefore, in this paper, we then embed five common LS operators, namely the single insertion method, the swap method, the two-optimization method (2-opt), the three-optimization method (3-opt), and the three-node permutation method (3-permute), into GA to investigate their influence on GA in solving VCMTSP. Extensive experiments on various VCMTSP instances show that LS operators can effectively help GA find more promising solutions. In particular, 2-opt brings the most benefit to GA to achieve promising performance in solving VCMTSP among the five LS operators. Except for 2-opt, the swap and 3-permute LS operators also bring considerable benefit to GA. With these investigations, it is expected that this paper could afford a basic guideline for new learners attempting to study VCMTSP.},

In this problem, some cities are restricted to be only accessed by certain salesmen, which is very common in real-world applications. In the literature, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been demonstrated to effectively solve MTSP. In this paper, we aim to adapt three widely used EAs in solving MTSP, namely the genetic algorithm (GA), the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO), and the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), to solve VCMTSP. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate the optimization performance of the three EAs in solving VCMTSP. Experimental results on various VCMTSP instances demonstrate that by means of its strong local exploitation ability, ABC shows much better performance than the other two algorithms, especially on large-scale VCMTSP. Though GA and ACO are effective to solve small-scale VCMTSP, their effectiveness degrades drastically on large-scale instances. Particularly, it is found that local exploitation is very vital for EAs to effectively solve VCMTSP. With the above observations, it is expected that this paper could afford a basic guideline for new researchers who want to take attempts in this area.},

In this paper, we present a mathematical framework to prove the convergence of the Gravity Based Clustering (GBC) algorithm, which is a recently introduced centroid-based clustering method. First, we provide an analysis of the convergence of cluster centers generated by GBC in the Euclidean norm. Following this convergence analysis, we introduce cluster sets as random variables and verify the convergence of cluster sets in probability. Then, in addition to GBC, we show that this framework can also be applied to model the convergence of the cluster sets generated by any centroid-based clustering algorithm with convergent cluster centers. To demonstrate the accuracy of our framework, we carry out extensive experiments with several benchmarking datasets. Moreover, the values of parameters $p$ and ∊, which play the key role in the convergence rate of GBC, are determined. We compare the convergence rate of the K-means and the C-means methods with GBC, where we use the best values of the parameters $p$ and ∊ to implement GBC. Our results point out that GBC is faster than the baseline methods in several datasets.},

  abstract  = {An increasing demand for mobility in urban areas leads to several issues such as traffic congestion. While many approaches exist to tackle this problem, a popular one is the adaptive control of traffic signals. This paper focuses on reinforcement learning based approaches for adaptive control. These use learning agents that act individually to adapt the signal timings to the current demand of vehicles crossing an intersection. However, in a network of intersections (thus constituting a multiagent reinforcement learning problem), as the actions of each agent have impact on the states, actions, and rewards of others, it is clear that there is a relevant non-local issue that is rarely dealt with. Thus, this paper proposes a joint learning approach in which agents learn in groups, besides also learning an individual policy. This means that we have two parallel learning processes. The group policy is implemented from time to time, thus helping agents to implicitly consider other agents&#39; policies. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that it is not based on fixed membership in such groups; rather, groups are formed and dissolved on demand, based on their performance. Results of applying this approach are compared to a baseline and to when agents learn individually only, showing that the joint learning leads to lesser waiting time.},

DRs are commonly used to solve scheduling problems in which scheduling decisions have to be performed in a small amount of time, and are often based on incomplete information. Although GP is the most commonly used method for evolving DRs, it suffers from a serious problem called bloat, which represents the uncontrolled growth of expression trees during evolution. Bloat usually has two important repercussions on the evolved DRs. First, DRs become hard to understand and it is unclear by which strategy they perform scheduling decisions. Secondly, some trees can also include parts that are a result of overfitting on the training set and which reduce their generalization ability. To deal with the problem of bloating DRs, we propose a simplification method consisted of two parts: algebraic reduction and pruning. The simplification method is applied after the normal evolution process with GP is done to reduce the complexity of the evolved DRs. The results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the number of nodes in an expression tree without significantly deteriorating its performance. This shows that the DRs evolved by GP are bloated and that substantial parts of them are redundant.},

Results show that the proposed model is effective for the multiple aggregators with variations from the day-ahead around the 6\% mark, except for the final aggregator.

  abstract  = {Increasing competition in today&#39;s telecommunication industry drives the need for more cost effective services. In order to reduce the cost of designing a fibre network with low capital expenditure, automation and optimisation of network design has become crucial. British Telecom&#39;s network design software, BT NetDesign, has been developed for the purpose of network design and optimisation using a rich set of network/graph-based heuristics and the simulated annealing (SA) search method. Although NetDesign provides several different ways of navigating the search space via different move heuristics, the existing search method (SA) does not consistently reach the near-global optimum as the size of network increases. To deal with larger networks, this study utilises an intelligent approach based on the well-known Luby sequence to combine move heuristics, using two separate learning schemes: frequency based and bigram statistics. These two strategies are rigorously evaluated on network instances of different sizes. Experimental results on real-world case studies indicate that a bigram scheme with a longer warm-up period to learn heuristic combinations can reach high quality solutions for large networks.},

Our main goal is to test different controllers and find the best performing controller for a motor operating in the field without knowing its mathematical model. By means of representation disentanglement, we present a new approach that splits the time series of each control system into two representation vectors: a first vector depicting the motor characteristics and its operating mode and a second vector describing the controller effect. We test our method on a scenario where we simulate the behavior of two different controlled DC motors. We map the behavior of a controller of a lab motor to a field motor. The experiments show that DR-TiST can recognize motor and controller characteristics and predict the right behavior.},

  abstract  = {Mussel farming is a major export for New Zealand that is growing fast. A number of tasks in mussel farming can be replaced by using intelligent and automatic approaches to reduce the operational cost and human effort. An important task on mussel farms is to track the position of buoys so that mussel farmers can adjust them on time. To make this process automatic, a number of problems need to be solved. Waterline detection is one necessary step towards effective and efficient buoy detection by separating the water and non-water regions from the large images. To address this, in this paper, we develop a waterline detection approach in which different convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used for image segmentation. Two different loss functions are used in the CNN-based methods and transfer learning is also investigated to further improve the model performance. These methods are applied to detect waterlines from the real-world mussel farm images obtained from the South Island of New Zealand. The results show that the CNN-based waterline detection methods are very effective at detecting waterlines on mussel farm images with a wide range of weather and lighting conditions. The results also show that the transferred CNN models with retraining on new images can also obtain high segmentation performance in terms of F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. These promising results will form a good starting point for the next step of buoy detection by removing a large amount of non-water pixels from the large images.},

  abstract  = {Set-based algorithms have been shown to successfully find optimal solutions to the portfolio optimization problem and to scale well to larger portfolio optimization problems. Set-based algorithms work by selecting a sub-set of assets from the set universe. These assets then form a new search space where the asset weights are optimized. Erwin and Engelbrecht purposed such an algorithm that was shown to perform similarly to a well known genetic algorithm for portfolio optimization. The proposed algorithm, set-based particle swarm optimization (SBPSO), used a meta-huerstic for the weight optimization process - unlike previous set-based approaches to portfolio optimization. Erwin and Engelbrecht also developed several modifications to SBPSO that improved its performance for portfolio optimization. This paper investgates an alternative weight optimizer for SBPSO for portfolio optimization, namely adaptive coordinate descent (ACD). ACD is a completely deterministic approach and thus ensures that, after a finite time, an approximation of a global optimum will be found. It is shown that SBPSO for portfolio optimization using ACD for weight optimization found higher quality solutions than the current SBPSO algorithm, albeit slightly slower.},

The time (processor) efficiency of the embedded software is directly related to the energy efficiency of the embedded system. Therefore, when considering some embedded software solutions, such as data-driven methods, time efficiency must be taken into account to improve energy efficiency. In this work, the energy efficiency of three data-driven methods: the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and the Random-Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network were assessed by using the creation of a real-time in-cylinder pressure sensor for diesel engines as a task. The three methods were kept with equivalent performances, whereas their relative execution time was tested and classified by their statistical rankings. Additionally, the space (memory) efficiency of the methods was assessed. The contribution of this work is to provide a guide to choose the best data-driven method to be used in an embedded system in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an Encoder-Decoder neural network architecture with Attention Mechanism for solving the DRC-FJSSP using Deep Q-Learning. In the DRC-FJSSP the number of operations to schedule is problem dependent. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods arbitrarily simplify the input information to a fixed-size feature input vector. This way, they end up losing relevant problem information for a large enough number of operations. Furthermore, on the one hand, human schedulers tend to optimize production schedules by moving operations individually into more adequate positions in the schedule. On the other hand, the aforementioned state-of-the-art methods apply heuristics recurrently as their optimization procedure. These limitations come as the cost of the neural network architecture, which is limited to fixed-size inputs and outputs. The architecture proposed in this paper is a Recurrent Neural Network, which enables it to work with inputs and outputs of variable sizes. This decisive feature makes it possible for the agent to move a specific operation to a more adequate position in the schedule and receive explicit problem information, such as the processing times of all operations. In the end, this approach proved to be competitive with a state-of-the-art metaheuristic method, the KGFOA. This promising results come even with a limitation in the available computational resources, which only allowed the development of scarcely trained agent.},

A successful serious game should organically combine the two aspects and balance the educational and entertaining nature of serious games. This paper mainly discusses the role of serious games in E-learning, various elements of game design, the classification of the educational goals of serious games and the relationship between educational goals and game design.

In this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with Chaos Logistic Map is applied to create an encryption algorithm. The proposed algorithm benefits from PSO&#39;s ability to be able to quickly search a large space, having a short computation time, and having a higher probability of finding the global optimum, and thus PSO produces a very good encryption image. Furthermore, the use of logistic map for confusion and diffusion operations is very beneficial. The algorithm starts by creating several encrypted images, which are the particles for PSO, and the logistics maps and the encryption key used is based on the plain image only. The optimization step is measuring the pixels correlation, where lower correlation values are better, and these serve as the fitness function. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm indicate an effective encryption process. In addition, the security analysis illustrates the ability of this algorithm to provide satisfying levels of security in comparison with other image encryption schemes.},

  abstract  = {In the last decade, exponential data growth supplied machine learning-based algorithms&#39; capacity and enabled their usage in daily-life activities. Additionally, such an improvement is partially explained due to the advent of deep learning techniques, i.e., stacks of simple architectures that end up in more complex models. Although both factors produce outstanding results, they also pose drawbacks regarding the learning process as training complex models over large datasets are expensive and time-consuming. Such a problem is even more evident when dealing with video analysis. Some works have considered transfer learning or domain adaptation, i.e., approaches that map the knowledge from one domain to another, to ease the training burden, yet most of them operate over individual or small blocks of frames. This paper proposes a novel approach to map the knowledge from action recognition to event recognition using an energy-based model, denoted as Spectral Deep Belief Network. Such a model can process all frames simultaneously, carrying spatial and temporal information through the learning process. The experimental results conducted over two public video dataset, the HMDB-51 and the UCF-101, depict the effectiveness of the proposed model and its reduced computational burden when compared to traditional energy-based models, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks.},

  abstract  = {Globally, abnormal highway traffic flow is one of the significant issues that directly or indirectly impact humans&#39; well-being. It affects the economy and the environment significantly. Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can improve the traffic flow of vehicles on highways by utilizing Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication technology that enables vehicles to share and update traffic information in real-time. This paper proposes a system for predicting traffic flow in a VANET environment where vehicles on a highway segment form a cluster with a lead vehicle serving as the cluster head. The cluster head uses beacon information received from the vehicles in its cluster to determine the occupancy and the average speed in the corresponding segment and send this information to the Roadside Unit (RSU) to be used in the prediction of abnormal traffic flow. In the absence of real-life VANET datasets, we have successfully created one for this system by utilizing real-life traffic data collected by the Florida Department of Transportation District 4 (FDOT-D4). The created VANET dataset is used in building, training, and validation of several machine learning models, and the models&#39; performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

In this paper, we present an improved continuous ant colony optimisation algorithm with differential evolution operator and local search, namely LIACODE R , to solve the path planning problem with improved accuracy. A transformed coordinate system is introduced, based on which a solution repair method is presented to accelerate the convergence speed and facilitate the search process for the most feasible and optimal path. Experiments are conducted in both abstract and physical environments to compare LIACODE R to classical path planning algorithms such as A*, D* and other state-of-the-art swarm optimisation algorithms. The superior performance of LIACODE R in terms of finding feasible path with lower cost are validated.},

  abstract  = {Through numerous works [9], [26], [32] attempts were made to obtain generative models for time series that correctly reproduce the underlying temporal characteristics of a given training data set. However, we prove in this work that the performance of these models is limited on datasets with high-variability for example containing different classes. In such setups, it is extremely difficult for a generative model to find the right trade-off between sample fidelity i.e. their similarity to the real time series and sample diversity. Furthermore, it is essential to preserve the original classes and the variation within each class. To tackle this issue, we propose a new generative class sensitive model, Class-specific Recurrent GAN (CLaRe-GAN), that conditions the generator on an auxiliary information containing the class-specific and class-independent attributes. Our model relies on class specific encoders: a unique encoder for two contradictory functionalities i.e. extracting the inter- and intra-class attributes. To extract the high-level representation of the time series, we make a shared-latent space assumption [19]. At the same time, we use a class discriminator that discriminates between the latent vectors to efficiently extract the class-specific attributes. We test our approach on a set of publicly available datasets where the number of classes, the length and the number of available times series for each class varies and evaluate our approach both visually and computationally. We prove that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art generative models and leads to a significant and consistent improvement in the quality of the generated time series while preserving the classes and variation of the original dataset.},

  abstract  = {An important issue during an engineering design process is to develop an understanding which design parameters have the most influence on the performance. Especially in the context of optimization approaches this knowledge is crucial in order to realize an efficient design process and achieve high-performing results. Information theory provides powerful tools to investigate these relationships because measures are model-free and thus also capture non-linear relationships, while requiring only minimal assumptions on the input data. We therefore propose to use recently introduced information-theoretic methods and estimation algorithms to find the most influential input parameters in optimization results. The proposed methods are in particular able to account for interactions between parameters, which are often neglected but may lead to redundant or synergistic contributions of multiple parameters. We demonstrate the application of these methods on optimization data from aerospace engineering, where we first identify the most relevant optimization parameters using a recently introduced information-theoretic feature-selection algorithm that accounts for interactions between parameters. Second, we use the novel partial information decomposition (PID) framework that allows to quantify redundant and synergistic contributions between selected parameters with respect to the optimization outcome to identify parameter interactions. We thus demonstrate the power of novel information-theoretic approaches in identifying relevant parameters in optimization runs and highlight how these methods avoid the selection of redundant parameters, while detecting interactions that result in synergistic contributions of multiple parameters.},

  abstract  = {Because of its considerable returns, the prediction of stock price rise and fall behavior is a task that researchers pay attention to. Due to the high degree of randomness of the stock market, this is a very difficult and challenging task. The general public&#39;s overall sentiment for a given company can be regarded as a windball that predicts the future ups and downs of the company&#39;s stock price. In recent years, the popularity of social networks has provided a large amount of available social sentiment data. Therefore, mining information from social networking sites and historical stock prices can improve the ability to predict the rise and fall of the stock market. In this paper, we extract hidden topic models and emotional information from the posts of social network. In addition, we developed a new deep fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) to integrate a large amount of emotional and topical information in online posts and tweets to predict the trend of stock prices. Fuzzy theory is very suitable for this research because the text message itself is fuzzy (for example, fast/slow and old/young), and there is a fuzzy boundary between ascending and descending categories. For instance, an increase of 10\% or 1\% is an increase category, but the degree of attribution is not the same. Compared with the traditional method, the fuzzy deep SVM proposed in this study can more robustly avoid the adverse effects of noise data},

As the popularity of PSO algorithms has increased and they have been applied to an ever-increasing number of applications, some key aspects appear to be less than fully explored. One of the questions is what the optimal size of a swarm is. This is expressed alternatively as a question of how small a swarm can be before it fails to properly search for a solution and conversely whether a very large swarm can better search for a solution and still make efficient use of the computing resources required. In the present manuscript a pilot study is presented, that investigates a standard PSO algorithm and attempts to address the issue of optimizing the swarm size.

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks are ubiquitous in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicles, face recognition, and medical imaging. However, deep neural networks may be subject to adversarial perturbations (also called adversarial attacks) which, when performed in high-stakes environments, may lead to severe consequences. A particular class of adversarial attacks, called universal adversarial attacks, consists of attacks that do not fool a single image. Instead, they aim to fool as many images as possible. Universal adversarial attacks may be either untargeted or targeted. While the goal of an untargeted attack is to deceive the neural network under attack without caring about its output, a targeted attack aims to “steer” the predictions of the neural network towards a specific target. In this work, we propose a method, based on the clonal selection algorithm, to generate targeted universal adversarial attacks for multiple target classes in a single run of the algorithm. Our results show that our approach is able to find multiple targeted universal adversarial attacks for the network under attack, with good success rates. Moreover, by visualizing the attacked images, we observe that our algorithm is able to produce adversarial attacks that fool the network by attacking a relatively small number of pixels. Finally, by analyzing how the attacks generalize on different architectures, we observe intriguing properties of the discovered universal adversarial attacks.},

However, that work has not yet taken the crowd worker&#39;s reliability into consideration. Crowd workers usually come with various social and economic backgrounds, and have different levels of reliability. To further improve the overall quality of crowdsourcing with IVLs, this work presents practical methods that quantitatively estimate worker&#39;s reliability in terms of his/her correctness, confidence, stability, and predictability from his/her IVLs. With worker&#39;s reliability, this paper proposes two learning schemes: weighted interval majority voting (WIMV) and weighted preferred matching probability (WPMP).

However, the LiDARs generate a massive volume of 3D data with a notable redundancy rate leads to inadequate object detection accuracy, and the high operational cost of RSU due to inadequate resource and time consumption. Estimating the computation capacity for RSU selection is an NP-hard problem. To address this issue, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) influenced 4-r computation model to measure RSU cost based on resource feasibility factor and object region detection rate based on novel region-of-interest (RoI) strategy. The resource feasibility factor appraises the residual capacity and cost of RSU based on a criterion of optimality. The RoI strategy eliminates irrelevant points, noise and ground points based on distance and shape measures of an object on RSU with feasible consumption of computation resources. The simulation results show that our mechanism achieves 83\% average object detection accuracy rate, 81\% average service rate and 17\% service offloading rate than state-of-art approaches.},

Therefore, a novel technique based on two novel concepts for improving the performance of the detection and classification of turn lane arrows is proposed in this paper. Firstly, pixel-wise segmentation of all turn lane arrows into one class instead of each turn lane arrow in a separate class is proposed. Secondly, a novel cascaded classifier that evolves its weights so that it can identify turn lane arrows is proposed. Three turn lane road markings named left turn lane, right turn lane and Continuous Central Turning Lane (CCTL) are evaluated using a real-world roadside image dataset created by video data including all state roads in Queensland provided by our industry partners.

We propose a framework for recognizing imagined words using brain signals captured through electroencephalograph (EEG) sensors. Our method consists of two main components: (i) an electrode selection method, and (ii) a convolutional attention network. The electrode selection method provides the electrodes containing the most discriminative time-frequency information for imagined speech recognition. Further, spectrograms from selected electrodes are used as input to the convolutional attention network, that extracts time-frequency features and performs classification by ascribing higher importance to the time points with higher discriminatory capacity. Experimental results using EEG dataset shows that the proposed method efficiently recognizes mentally spoken words and exhibits performance superior to that of state-of-the-art methods.},

Several control strategies-namely, on/off dissolved oxygen control, proportional (P) / integral (I) dissolved oxygen control, and cascade ammonia control-are performed in biological processes to confirm the effects of ammonia reduction and optimize energy cost. According to the results of cascade control, it is 23\% smaller than the original energy cost. Sensitivity analysis was further proceeded to confirm the influence of tuning parameters, namely, proportional and integral gains. Consequently, proportional gain improves response speed and controls system accuracy. Integral gain is effective in decreasing the steady-state error of the system.

  abstract  = {The recent years have witnessed a surge in application of deep neural networks (DNNs) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods to various autonomous control systems and game playing problems. While they are capable of learning from real-world data and produce adequate actions to various state conditions, their internal complexity does not allow an easy way to provide an explanation for their actions. In this paper, we generate state-action pair data from a trained DNN/RL system and employ a previously proposed nonlinear decision tree (NLDT) framework to decipher hidden simplistic rule sets that interpret the working of DNN/RL systems. The complexity of the rule sets are controllable by the user. In essence, the inherent bilevel optimization procedure that finds the NLDTs is capable of reducing the complexities of the state-action logic to a minimalist and intrepretable level. Demonstrating the working principle of the NLDT method to a revised mountain car control problem, this paper applies the methodology to the lane changing problem involving six critical cars in front and rear in left, middle, and right lanes of a pilot car. NLDTs are derived to have simplistic relationships of 12 decision variables involving relative distances and velocities of the six critical cars. The derived analytical decision rules are then simplified further by using a symbolic analysis tool to provide English-like interpretation of the lane change problem. This study makes a scratch to the issue of interpretability of modern machine learning based tools and it now deserves further attention and applications to make the overall approach more integrated and effective.},

  abstract  = {An autonomous learning approach is presented here for expansive problem domains that may undergo frequent changes. It is hard to train and adapt learning-models to changes when the problem domain is very large. With the autonomous learning approach, a system performs knowledge refinement automatically by determining what can be improved and trains itself without explicit guidance to do so. It uses novel techniques to automatically create the learning-models and select an optimal model for each prediction. It automatically builds dynamic ensembles of models that incorporate specific improvisations, such as improvements based on past knowledge or specific trends reflected in the results, and overshadows sub-optimal portions of existing model. A reinforcement learning based model selector identifies which model is optimal for handling a request using a novel approach with automatically created hierarchical states. As a result, smart adaptive solutions that go beyond initial training become possible. This also alleviates the need for big complex monolithic models that require extensive training, automatically adapts to changes in the domain and offers better control over its performance. Experimental results show this approach learns quickly, adapts to changes very rapidly and performs quite well against prevalent learning methods.},

  abstract  = {Generating various strategies for a given task is challenging. However, it has already proven to bring many assets to the main learning process, such as improved behavior exploration. With the growth in the interest of heterogeneity in solution in evolutionary computation and reinforcement learning, many promising approaches have emerged. To better understand how one guides multiple policies toward distinct strategies and benefit from diversity, we need to analyze further the influence of the reward signal modulation and other evolutionary mechanisms on the obtained behaviors. To that effect, this paper considers an existing evolutionary reinforcement learning framework which exploits multi-objective optimization as a way to obtain policies that succeed at behavior-related tasks as well as completing the main goal. Experiments on the Atari games stress that optimization formulations which do not consider objectives equally fail at generating diversity and even output agents that are worse at solving the problem at hand, regardless of the obtained behaviors.},

  abstract  = {Efficient solving of an unseen optimization problem is related to appropriate selection of an optimization algorithm and its hyper-parameters. For this purpose, automated algorithm performance prediction should be performed that in most commonly-applied practices involves training a supervised ML algorithm using a set of problem landscape features. However, the main issue of training such models is their limited explainability since they only provide information about the joint impact of the set of landscape features to the end prediction results. In this study, we are investigating explainable landscape-aware regression models where the contribution of each landscape feature to the prediction of the optimization algorithm performance is estimated on a global and local level. The global level provides information about the impact of the feature across all benchmark problems&#39; instances, while the local level provides information about the impact on a specific problem instance. The experimental results are obtained using the COCO benchmark problems and three differently configured modular CMA-ESs. The results show a proof of concept that different set of features are important for different problem instances, which indicates that further personalization of the landscape space is required when training an automated algorithm performance prediction model.},

  abstract  = {Handimages are of paramount importance within critical domains like security and criminal investigation. They can sometimes be the only available evidence of an offender&#39;s identity at a crime scene. Approaches to person identification that consider the human hand as a complex object composed of many components are rare. The approach proposed in this paper fills this gap, making use of knuckle creases and fingernail information. It introduces a framework for automatic person identification that includes localisation of the regions of interest within hand images, recognition of the detected components, segmentation of the region of interest using bounding boxes, and similarity matching between a query image and a library of available images. The following hand components are considered: i) the metacarpohalangeal, commonly known as base knuckle; ii) the proximal interphalangeal joint commonly known as major knuckle; iii) distal interphalangeal joint, commonly known as minor knuckle; iv) the interphalangeal joint, commonly known as thumb&#39;s knuckle, and v) the fingernails. A key element of the proposed framework is the similarity matching and an important role for it is played by the feature extraction. In this paper, we exploit end-to-end deep convolutional neural networks to extract discriminative high-level abstract features. We further use Bray-Curtis (BC) similarity for the matching process. We validated the proposed approach on well-known benchmarks, the ‘11k Hands&#39; dataset and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Contactless Hand Dorsal Images known as ‘PolyU HD’. We found that the results indicate that the knuckle patterns and fingernails play a significant role in the person identification. The results from the 11K dataset indicate that the results for the left hand are better than the results for the right hand. In both datasets, the fingernails produced consistently higher identification results than other hand components, with a rank-1 score of 93.65\% on the ring finger of the left hand for the ‘11k Hands&#39; dataset and rank-l score of 93.81\% for the thumb from the ‘PolyU HD’ dataset.},

While these modifications have a negative effect on the convergence properties of real-valued networks, the introduction of complex weights and training only their phases enables wave-interference mechanisms to take place that can guarantee convergence for gradient-descent training, which is shown both analytically and by computer simulations. It is further demonstrated that the framework can be extended and applied to other nonlinear classification and regression problems.

The analytics is embedded in a network security monitoring platform, named ararnis ® , which provides cybersecurity analysts with a comprehensive overview of the monitored network and its traffic to support them in the identification of potentially malicious activities taking place. The detection capabilities of the proposed analytics have been tested both on a benign and a malicious dataset. This latter has been assembled by our security analysts and includes packet captures of samples and tools, respectively, developed and used by worldwide leading threat actors.

  abstract  = {Conformal prediction can be applied on top of any machine learning predictive regression model, thus turning it into a conformal regressor. Given a significance level $\epsilon$ , conformal regressors output valid prediction intervals, i.e., the probability that the interval covers the true value is exactly $1-\epsilon$ . To obtain validity, a calibration set that is not used for training the model must be set aside. In standard inductive conformal regression, the size of the prediction intervals is then determined by the absolute error made by the predictive model on a specific instance in the calibration set, where different significance levels correspond to different instances. In this setting, all prediction intervals will have the same size, making the resulting models very unspecific. When adding a technique called normalization, however, the difficulty of each instance is estimated, and the interval sizes are adjusted accordingly. An integral part of normalized conformal regressors is a parameter called $\beta$ , which determines the relative importance of the difficulty estimation and the error of the model. In this study, the effects of different underlying models, difficulty estimation functions and $\beta$ -values are investigated. The results from a large empirical study, using twenty publicly available data sets, show that better difficulty estimation functions will lead to both tighter and more specific prediction intervals. Furthermore, it is found that the $\beta$ -values used strongly affect the conformal regressor. While there is no specific $\beta$ -value that will always minimize the interval sizes, lower $\beta$ -values lead to more variation in the interval sizes, i.e., more specific models. In addition, the analysis also identifies that the normalization procedure introduces a small but unfortunate bias in the models. More specifically, normalization using low $\beta$ -values means that smaller intervals are more likely to be erroneous, while the opposite is true for higher $\beta$ -values.},

Presently an experienced plant pathologist can diagnose the condition through visual inspection of disease-affected plants. However, manual visualization is time-consuming and depends on the plant pathologist&#39;s expertise in identifying plant disease. Hence this problem can be solved by a computer-aided diagnostic system with artificial intelligence (CADS-AI). This system will aid in improving and protecting the yield of the plant, but it lacks trust as the existing system is not flawless. Hence, in this research work, a plant disease classification with an explainable AI pipeline is developed which ensures trust in the CADS solution. Furthermore, an expert recommendation system will act as an alternative to expert plant pathologists. Tomato leaf diseases data from the PlantVillage dataset is used in the proposed solution. Transfer learning technique was adopted in training deep neural network models with original and augmented data of 16,684 and 53,476 images respectively. The best model for the dataset was efficientNet B5 with best F1 score accuracy of 0.9842 and 0.9930. The predicted output of B5 was interpreted with explainable AI techniques and validated using YOLOv4. Inference of the proposed solution was a client-server interface where end-users can upload infected leaf images via mobile phones or web browsers. This entire system was tested in real-time with 250 volunteers with 4G mobile network or 100 MBPS wifi. The average throughput time of the system is around 4.3 seconds.},

To make use of (training) words not included in the pre-trained fastText embeddings, we initialize them as the average embedding overall of the co-occurrent words. Then, we fine-tune these representations by allowing the network to back-propagate the error to the input. We assess the quality of our proposal on a real-world dataset provided by a Spanish company where keywords are categorized upon the Google Product Taxonomy (GPT).

  abstract  = {Detecting drifts in data is essential for machine learning applications, as changes in the statistics of processed data typically has a profound influence on the performance of trained models. Most of the available literature on drift detection employs either supervised methods, that requires true labels during inference time, or unsupervised, that aim for any changes in the data distribution. We propose a novel task-sensitive semi-supervised drift detection framework, which uses label information to train a model, but detects drifts during inference time only when they affect the model performance, without the ground truth label information. It utilizes a constrained low-dimensional embedding representation of the input data. This way, the dimensionality of the input data is reduced, and the learned representation is best suited for the classification task. We propose two change detectors, which are customized for our framework, but any method to detect a change in the statistic of a data stream can be chosen freely. Experimental evaluation on nine benchmarks datasets, with different types of artificially induced drift, demonstrates that the proposed framework can reliably detect drifts. Furthermore, in our studies we empirically demonstrated that the investigated drift detectors combined with the proposed framework, consistently outperform the other state-of-the-art unsupervised drift detection approaches.},

While existing models are sufficient to solve many real-world tasks, they are far from reaching the potential of biological neural networks. These models are oversimplifications of their biological counterparts, omitting key features such as the spiking nature of their units or the locality during learning, among others. In this work, we, first, provide a short review of the most recent theories on biologically plausible learning and learning in Spiking Neural Networks. Then, aiming to give a step towards brain-inspired deep learning, we introduce a novel biologically plausible learning method. This approach achieves learning using only local information to each synapse, spiking units and unidirectional synaptic connections. We also propose a local solution to address the credit assignment problem based on target propagation. Finally, we evaluate our approach over three different tasks, i.e. boolean problems, image autoencoding and handwritten digit recognition.},

  abstract  = {The first step toward Seed Certification, a mechanism to ensure high quality of the seed and propagate materials of superior adapted crop varieties is the identification of seed type. A plant researcher inspects the visual attributes and morphology of a seed to identify the seed type, a process that is tedious. Advances in deep learning have led to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that aid in classification using images. While they classify efficiently, a key bottleneck is the need for an extensive amount of labelled data to train the CNN before it can be put to the task of classification. The work strives to address the aforementioned challenges and leverages the concepts of Contrastive Learning and Domain Randomization in order to achieve the same. Synthetic image datasets of five different types of seed images namely, canola, rough rice, sorghum, soy and wheat are applied to three different self-supervised learning frameworks namely, SimCLR, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and Build Your Own Latent (BYOL) where ResNet-50 is used as the backbone in each of the networks. The performance of the self-supervised learning frameworks is compared against the performance of a supervised learning model built on ResNet-50. When the self-supervised models are fine-tuned with only 5\% of the labels from the synthetic dataset, results show that MoCo, the model that yields the best performance of the self-supervised learning frameworks in question, achieves an accuracy of 77\% on the test dataset which is only 13\% less than the accuracy of 90\% achieved by ResNet-50 trained on 100\% of the labels demonstrating the feasibility of domain randomization for classification of seeds using self-supervised learning frameworks.},

  abstract  = {Precision Agriculture (PA) and Forest Management (FM) applications require sensor-based environment monitoring to assess the vegetation status of monitored areas. Vegetation Indices (VIs), assessed from satellite-taken spectral images, depict some features (e.g., vegetation vigour, coverage, etc.) but they are not enough to describe vegetation status, hence they need to be contextualized according to the area phenology, latitude and weather for correct vegetation status interpretations. Moreover, heterogeneous data collection can cause data integration and interoperability issues. Additionally, human operators, who have to monitor multiple vast environments in time critical contexts, require brief meaningful reports about occurred situations. In this paper a knowledge-based multi-agent approach is presented to deal with environment monitoring of user-specified Regions of Interest (ROIs) and assess their vegetation status. The approach employs different types of agents to carry out various tasks, including data acquisition and knowledge storing, end-user interaction and vegetation analysis accomplishment. The end-user can request different types of analysis and pass data to the system through an agent-managed GUI, hence vegetation analysis is carried out by using a decision tree-based method to properly query the KB built on VIs and contextual data to consequently build a report about the vegetation status of the ROI. The built report includes a description of other features (soil, weather) that helps depicting the detected vegetation status. Several case studies demonstrate the functioning and efficacy of the approach.},

  abstract  = {Decomposition-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms are very popular. The basic idea of decomposition-based EMO algorithms is to decompose a multi/many-objective optimization problem into several single-objective subproblems using a set of weight vectors and a scalarizing function. The weight vector specification plays an important role in decomposition-based EMO algorithms for obtaining a set of well-distributed solutions. In this paper, we propose a new method to update weight vectors for decomposition-based EMO algorithms. The proposed method uses an unbounded external archive to store all the nondominated solutions among examined solutions during the execution of an EMO algorithm, and periodically select a set of uniformly distributed solutions from the archive. Then, the selected solutions are projected to the weight vector space and used as a set of weight vectors for decomposition-based algorithms. The usefulness of the proposed weight vector update method is demonstrated by integrating it into a most frequently used decomposition-based EMO algorithm, i.e., MOEA/D. Experimental results show that the proposed weight vector update method works well on MOEA/D. Our experimental results also show that MOEA/D with the proposed weight vector update method outperforms other weight vector adaptation-based algorithms on many-objective test problems.},

  abstract  = {In last decades the reinforcement learning method has attracted a great deal of attention and many studies have been done. However, this method is basically a trial-and-error scheme and it takes much computational time to acquire optimal strategies. Furthermore, optimal strategies may not be obtained for large and complicated problems with many states. To resolve these problems we have proposed the swarm reinforcement learning method, which is developed inspired by the multi-point search optimization methods. The Swarm reinforcement learning method has been extensively studied and its effectiveness has been confirmed for several problems, especially for Markov decision processes where the agents can fully observe the states of environments. In many real-world problems, however, the agents cannot fully observe the environments and they are usually partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). The purpose of this paper is to develop a swarm reinforcement learning method which can deal with POMDPs. We propose a swarm reinforcement learning method based on HQ-learning, which is a hierarchical extension of Q-learning. It is shown through experiments that the proposed method can handle POMDPs and possesses higher performance than that of the original HQ-learning.},

When such models operate in the open-world, they can encounter observations from previously unknown classes, and are prone to making erroneous high-confidence predictions. In this work, we define the problem of hierarchical Open-Set Recognition (OSR) which seeks classification models that are able to identify if an observation belongs to an unknown class, and to provide information about how the unknown class relates to the known classes. As part of this work we introduce three novel approaches to hierarchical OSR, and a novel evaluation metric that conveys the ability of hierarchical OSR models to provide partial information for predictions. Through empirical results we demonstrate that one of our novel hierarchical OSR approaches outperforms competing methods. Finally, we introduce a use case that shows the benefit of hierarchical OSR for Automatic Target Recognition applications.},

Using a public dataset with 164 subjects, we show that person identification can achieve higher than 90\% accuracy with a full gallery size of 164 using a single skeleton frame, which corresponds to 33ms identification time. This is achieved via a simple deep learning model constructed with the TensorFlow Keras application programming interface (API) using the 20-joint 60-dimension Kinect skeleton frame data as input. We also considered the configuration where the lower extremity joints are occluded, which could happen in the presence of furniture or other objects. We show that person identification can still be achieved with fairly high accuracy in this configuration. Furthermore, we compare with our previous work and show that relying on the deep learning model to extract features automatically could lead to higher person identification accuracy than using handcrafted features.},

Adversarial machine learning, unfortunately, has recently shown that deep learning models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial modifications on their input data. In this work, we explore the potential of adversarial entities to compromise such vulnerabilities to compromise deep learning-based NIDS systems. Specifically, we show that by modifying on average as little as 1.38 of an observed packet&#39;s input features, an adversary can generate malicious inputs that effectively fool a target deep learning-based NIDS. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the performance from the conventional network security perspective and the adversarial machine learning domain when designing such systems.},

Second, since the curse of dimensionality renders exact methods not applicable, we use an Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) approach to explore the efficacy of these methods to the problem. We generate three ADP policies, each using a value function approximation based on a unique post-decision state variable and a lookup table representation. We compare these ADP policies to a random policy, a myopic policy, and Policy Function Approximation (PFA) which evacuates survivors in order of triage category starting with the most critically ill. Our results show that an ADP-generated policy which prioritizes the evacuation of healthy individuals improved performance by 34 ± 5\% versus the random policy, 15 ± 3\% versus the myopic policy, and 42 ± 3\% versus the PFA policy.},

This reveals the need for efficient and effective techniques for doing so. In certain problem domains (e.g. marketing and education), detecting clusters of users with similar characteristics allows for services to be targeted to specific communities. While a number of approaches have been proposed in the literature to this end, they suffer from scalability issues when analysing larger or more densely connected social networks. To cope with this scalability problem, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach for social network analysis is proposed in this paper, supported by a graph database to store the static relationships between the nodes, thus eliminating the computational cost of repeatedly searching the network. Thus, the novelty of this work is in the combination of GA-based approach with a graph database, which store data more effectively, which allows for global optimisation to take place. Additionally, the main advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not require a priori knowledge regarding the social network when performing the analysis. The GA-based approach is shown to have the best performance regarding the identification of communities, though also requiring higher execution times.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been effective for mastering such games since Alp-haZero carefully integrates Monte-Carlo tree search and self-play. Maximum entropy RL is a promising enhancement that maximize the entropy of a policy (or strategy in games) in addition to cumulative rewards (or wins in games), yielding effective methods such as soft Q-learning or soft actor-critic. The entropy objective improves the robustness of learned strategies by keeping (reducing) alternative choices on our (the opponent&#39;s) side when applied to games. Moreover, we show that maximum entropy RL also improves the stability and efficiency of learning by reducing the variance in learning targets of neural networks, which are typically {1, 0, -1} for win, draw, or loss in AlphaZero. Being augmented with the entropy and integrated through a game tree, maximum entropy RL yields soft state values taking intermediate real values, especially near zero in positions near opening positions. We qualitatively show these benefits in terms of an analysis of converged values done by extended retrograde analysis for dobutsu shogi and empirical learning efficiency for RL agents in self-play.},

  abstract  = {Data quality is a global issue in our society that every company encounter. Data quality is a vast field of study, our work is focused on relational Data. A lot have been done in this field to identify duplicate lines, but here we will focus our work on columns. We define the new concept of near duplicate columns, that characterises two columns that are really similar to each other. We introduce a method to determine if two columns are near duplicate. We first describe a method that works for a specific column and then generalize this method to any couple of column. This method relies on the use of classifiers trained on artificial data-set to determine if two columns are near duplicate. In this study, we try multiple possible choices of classifiers to find the most appropriate one for this learning problem. We also explore the effect of modifying experimental parameters during the generation of the artificial training data.},

  abstract  = {Computational intelligence methods have been widely applied to model-based engine calibration. Engine calibration based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations is time-consuming and constrained. In this paper, we model a real-world aero-engine calibration problem with many parameters as an expensive optimisation problem with hidden constraints. Two surrogate-assisted meta-heuristic frameworks using offline and online strategies are proposed in this paper for efficient aero-engine calibration. A surrogate model is trained on engine parameter settings, that lead to valid and invalid CFD calculations, to predict the feasibility of new parameter settings. Parameter settings that are predicted as infeasible by the surrogate model will be eliminated for evaluation during search to reduce the time wasted on infeasible solutions. To validate our approaches, instantiation of the offline and online frameworks are implemented with a neural network model and a self-adaptive particle swarm optimisation and verified on calibrating a real aero-engine model. Both the proposed offline and online frameworks significantly speed up the calibration in terms of realtime performance compared with the approach without using a surrogate model. The surrogate model not only improves the calibration efficiency but also is capable of indicating the importance of parameters to guide the calibration order.},

The source hyper-heuristic solves easy and medium problem instances from the Scholl benchmark set and the target hyper-heuristic solves the hard problem instances in the same benchmark set. Performance is assessed in terms of objective value, i.e. the number of bins, computational effort and generality of the hyper-heuristic. This study firstly compares the performance of two transfer learning approaches previously shown to be effective for generation constructive hyper-heuristics, for the one dimensional bin packing problem. Both these approaches performed better than not using transfer learning, with the approach transferring the best elements from each generation of the source hyper-heuristic to the target hyper-heuristic (TL2) producing the best results. The study then investigated transferring knowledge on an area of the search space rather than a point in the search space. Three approaches were developed and evaluated for this purpose. Two of these approaches were able to improve the performance of TL2 on three of the ten problem instances with respect to objective value.},

In some cases, we only know the class of possible functions describing this dependence. In other cases, we also know the probabilities of different functions from this class - i.e., we know the corresponding random field or random process. To solve problems related to such a dependence, it is desirable to be able to simulate the corresponding functions, i.e., to have algorithms that transform simple intervals or simple random variables into functions from the desired class. Many of the real-life dependencies are very complex, requiring a large amount of computation time even if we ignore the uncertainty. So, to make simulation of uncertainty practically feasible, we need to make sure that the corresponding simulation algorithm is as fast as possible. In this paper, we show that for this objective, ideas behind neural networks lead to the known Karhunen-Loevc decomposition and interval field techniques - and also that these ideas help us go - when necessary - beyond these techniques.},

  abstract  = {Scheduling athletic matches is a challenging problem where the goal is to create robust timetables that not only are fair for all players, but also satisfy kaleidoscopic constraints. Although many advancements have been made that involve combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic techniques, they are limited to fixed scenarios and ideal conditions. Moreover, these methods do not consider the realistic and dynamic demands on teams during the scheduling process. Motivated by these limitations, this work explores emulating and integrating human corrective learning in reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically perform multi-team single round robin (SRR) scheduling while satisfying minimum breaks. Our schedule-then-break approach builds on first modeling the RL agent&#39;s actions as a Markov decision process (MDP) which consists of the agent&#39;s HAP assignments as well as its corrective actions to ensure that these constraints are made. Next, a SRR reinforcement learning environment is proposed where one-step temporal difference methods are employed to assess how well the agent schedules and corrects as it produces completed timetables. Our simulative results are promising which further illustrate that the agent is effectively able to perform scheduling assignments while also discerning when to make corrections. The benefit of this approach and analysis is that it can now serve as a foundational framework for realistic sports-type scheduling scenarios particularly for cases when additional constraints are incorporated while intermittent schedules are made.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles use cameras as one of the primary sources of information about the environment. Adverse weather conditions such as raindrops, snow, mud, and others, can lead to various image artifacts. These artifacts significantly degrade the quality and reliability of the obtained visual data and can lead to accidents if they are not detected in time. This paper presents ongoing work on a new dataset for training and assessing vision algorithms&#39; performance for different tasks of image artifacts detection on either camera lens or car windshield. At the moment, we present a publicly available set of images containing 8190 images, of which 3390 contain raindrops. Images are annotated with the binary mask representing areas with raindrops. We demonstrate the applicability of the dataset in the problems of raindrops presence detection and raindrop region segmentation. To augment the data, we also propose a data augmentation algorithm that allows the generation of synthetic raindrops on images. Apart from the dataset, we present a novel gradient-based algorithm for raindrop presence detection in a video sequence. The experimental evaluation proves that the algorithm reliably detects raindrops. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art cross-correlation-based algorithm, the proposed algorithm showed a higher quality of raindrop presence detection and image processing speed, making it applicable for the self-check procedure of real autonomous systems.

CSS has multiple collaborated secondary users (SUs) to detect the presence of primary users (PUs) by fusing the sensing information and then determining the PU signals. Most of the previous works train detectors with sufficient labeled sensing data. However, collecting labeled and accurate data is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a multiview semi-supervised learning framework for CSS (MSCSS). Specifically, MSCSS first combines the complementary sensing information from different SUs to explore a latent representation from both labeled and unlabeled sensing data. Based on the representation, it learns a robust fusion graph, performs the label propagation to unlabeled data, and trains a detector. MSCSS considers the information sensed by each SU as one view of the state of the concerned spectrum channel and fuses the multi-view information to make a decision. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Compared to special lab robotics systems, the proposed system is more attainable, while incorporating, alongside speech and facial expression, eye gaze as one of the major features to convey emotions as input channels. The system generates and emulates emotional output behaviors based on a user&#39;s affect using speech, gestures and emojis.

In this paper, we propose Non-generational GSGP (Ng-GSGP), which generates a linear combination of programs in a single step, instead of iterative operations as in GSGP. We compare Ng-GSGP with the conventional GSGP and its variant on 10 symbolic regression problems, and demonstrate that Ng-GSGP is able to generate better programs with much fewer fitness evaluations on most of the problems.},

To introduce AI in such domains, understandability of the prediction logic is required. However typical accurate models such as deep neural networks are too complicated to understand. Although there exist methods for generating globally understandable models, their accuracy and applicability are often insufficient. To achieve high accuracy by understandable models for classification and regression tasks, we propose piecewise simple function (PSF) as a general understandable model and a method for training accurate PSF. PSF consists of a few local submodels and can be regarded as a generalization of the piecewise affine model. However, the output of the proposed method is expected to be more accurate since it utilizes information of accurate black-box AI. More concretely, we specify the partition of regions on the basis of information of black-box AI such as important features and thresholds. The proposed method is based on the hypothesis that black-box AI is often overly complicated in some regions and can be replaced with simpler models. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that PSF often achieves almost the same accuracy as original black-box AI.},

  abstract  = {In the literature, it is often assumed that given a data stream, every instance is provided with its correct label after the prediction for performance evaluation (i.e., the null latency scenario). However, in several real applications, this assumption is invalid. For example, in the problem of predicting if it will rain tomorrow, the actual label will only be available the day after tomorrow, i.e., the actual label will be made available with an unavoidable delay. This scenario is called intermediate latency. Unfortunately, learning with intermediate latency is little investigated in the literature. Furthermore, the data stream can be non-stationary, i.e., their data distribution can change over time. This phenomenon is called concept drift. Therefore, a classification model in a data stream with concept drift will need a set of recent instances with their respective labels to adapt to the new concept. However, in an intermediate latency scenario, the delayed instance labels may not be timely for concept drift detection. Thus, the classification model will not be capable of adapting immediately, implying a reduction of performance. In this paper, we propose a framework that can improve the performance of a classification model in a data stream with intermediate latency through a domain adaptation approach called importance weighting. The framework is called NIW-DSIL (Naive Importance Weighting for Data Stream with Intermediate Latency). The experiments showed that our approach is promising in dealing with this scenario. For the real datasets, the NIW - DSIL got better results in 6 of 8 intermediate latency scenarios.},

In case of online learning, where the distribution may change over time (concept drift) or only few data points are available at once, robust, non-parametric approaches are of particular interest. In this paper we present a new, non-parametric tree-ensemble-based method for CDE that reduces the problem to a simple regression task on the transformed input data and a (unconditional) density estimation. We prove the correctness of our approach and show its usefulness in empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks.

  abstract  = {Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) is the application of Internet of Things (IoT) to a battlefield environment. IoBT networks operate in difficult conditions due to high mobility and unpredictable nature of battle fields and securing them is a challenge. There is increasing interest to use deception techniques to enhance the security of IoBT networks. A honeypot is a system installed on a network as a trap to attract the attention of an attacker and it does not store any valuable data. In this work, we introduce IoBT dual sensor gateways. We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-assisted scheme, in which the IoBT dual sensor gateways intelligently switch between honeypot and real function based on a threshold. The optimal threshold is determined using reinforcement learning approach that adapts to nodes reputation. To focus on the impact of the mobile and uncertain behavior of IoBT networks on the proposed scheme, we consider the nodes as moving vehicles. We statistically analyze the results of our RL-based scheme obtained using ns-3 network simulation, and optimize value of the threshold.},

Thus, a simple swarm intelligence mechanism called call-out and a basic game theoretic auction mechanism are compared and analyzed in terms of communication distance and information fault tolerance. Simulations show that the auction mechanism performs well under varying communication distances but has problems when the communication distance is low and when facing faulty information. The call-out mechanism, however, performs significantly better when communication distances are low and when information transfer between agents is uncertain. Furthermore, call-out performs almost equal to auction for intermittent communication distances but due to the inherent property of “over-coordination” for large communication distances agents become “over-committed” in solving tasks at the expense of searching for new tasks. This fundamental system behavior can only be studied in the combined search and task allocation problem,},

Principally, our research aims to use natural language Processing techniques to provide a novel understanding of YouTube&#39;s reflection of political bias within its search and video recommendation algorithms. We created two experiments to understand each of the aforementioned systems. Experiment 1 examines the relationship between videos&#39; ranking and political biases. We quantified such bias by applying an optimized BERT Natural Language Processing regression model to video transcripts. Experiment 2 examines the progression of bias when repeatedly clicking the “Up-Next” recommended video per each video cycle. We find that while the average bias of videos ranked highly in searches is slightly Democratic-leaning, YouTube surprisingly minimizes the magnitude of bias within their “Up-Next” recommendations. Ultimately, our results provide a nuanced understanding of YouTube&#39;s reflection of political bias and introduce an ethical discussion regarding the fairness of YouTube&#39;s algorithm.},

Most existing work includes a central server that aggregates the local updates from the clients and coordinates the training. Thus, the setting in this existing work is prone to communication and computational bottlenecks, especially when large number of clients are involved. Also, most existing federated learning algorithms do not cater for situations where the data distribution is time-varying such as in real-time traffic monitoring. To address these problems, this paper proposes a differentially-private online mirror descent algorithm. To provide additional privacy to the loss gradients of the clients, local differential privacy is introduced. Simulation results are based on a proposed differentially-private exponential gradient algorithm, which is a variant of differentially-private online mirror descent algorithm with entropic regularizer. The simulation shows that all the clients can converge to the global optimal vector over time. The regret bound of the proposed differentially-private exponential gradient algorithm is compared with the regret bounds of some state-of-the-art online federated learning algorithms found in the literature.},

Hand gesture recognition from RGB video feed is one of the most important relevant tasks where DNN models tend to excel, with many application domains typically demanding their real-time execution (e.g., in human-robot interaction scenarios). However, several operational parameters of similar models, especially concerning the way the input video data are handled, have not yet been sufficiently investigated with a clear goal of identifying best practices. For instance, various design choices about how video frames are fed to the DNN model during its training and its evaluation (e.g., using the traditional temporal subsampling per video approach, or employing a temporal sliding window) directly affect method accuracy. This paper aims at empirically finding optimal strategies regarding such operational parameters for input video handling when training and evaluating learning models that perform real-time, on-line gesture recognition’ using typical CNN-based approaches on a relevant dataset.},

But, the pseudonym must be changed in the proper way to conceal the real identity of the vehicle.

The vehicles are grouped based on the traffic environment and condition to anonymize the vehicle in the group.

In this paper, the specific evolutional concept of mutation for the generative model training improvement is proposed and examined. The idea behind the research is that the generative model learning can be optionally tackled as a complex optimization task. Such an approach is associated with a two-fold problem raised in the paper, meaning that comparing different generators to each other is hard to define, so is the fitness function of the weight vectors. It can be assumed that the fitness function, if existed, might have an unknown but potentially high number of local minima, which could restrict the gradient descent to move in some directions. The vast number of degrees of freedom usually seen in the image processing layers exceeds the standard problems for intelligent optimization algorithms. Therefore the hybrid combination of the gradient descent with the smart usage of mutations is considered and examined, in particular with the proposed novel approach for the mutation masking strategy.},

In North America, FHB is predominantly caused by Fusarium graminearum (Fg). The primary form of Fg inoculum is ascospores, produced within small (&lt; 0.5 mm), darkly pigmented fruiting bodies known as perithecia. The density of the Fg inoculum (i.e., the total number of perithecia) is associated with the potential for FHB severity. In order to provide growers with a timely tool to assess local FHB risk, we have developed machine learning models capable of detecting perithecia and estimating inoculum density from stubble images. We have implemented two deep learning-based object detection approaches: faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO). We have trained and tested a series of deep learning models through a lab-collected data set, with the best model achieving an average precision of 73\% in perithecia detection.

In the second stage, we deploy our proposed autoencoder utilizing the self-supervised learning techniques to address the unavailability of labelled anomalies. The extracted rails from stage one are divided into multiple patches and are fed to the autoencoder, which is trained to reconstruct the non-anomalous data only. Hence, during the inference, the regeneration of images with any abnormalities produces a larger reconstruction error. Applying a predefined threshold to the reconstruction errors can detect an anomaly on a rail track. Stage one, rail extracting network achieves a high value of 52.78\% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The second stage autoencoder network converges well on the training data. Finally, we evaluate our two-fold approach on real scenario test images, no false positives or false negatives were found in the the detected anomalies on the rail tracks.},

  abstract  = {Plant-derived crop residue on soil surface provides many important advantages including preventing erosion and conserving soil moisture. In that sense, making accurate determination on the percent of crop residue cover using RGB images can be a fundamental tool in protecting the soil. In our research, we approach the determination of such percentages as a classification problem, and in this paper, we compare two of these approaches. Both approaches relied on support vector machines (SVM) as the classifier of choice, and the same set of features, which were selected in our previous studies on the same topic. In this paper we developed a SVM ensemble with a hierarchical structure and compared it against a single, multi-class SVM classifier. In the SVM ensemble framework, four two-class SVMs and one five-class SVM were combined in sequence to better separate adjacent levels of residue cover. The rationale of the ensemble was to allow each of the two-class SVMs to find the hyperplanes that maximize the margin between the corresponding two consecutive classes. Then, based on the distance of the samples to these hyperplanes, probabilistic estimates of the data-point belonging to the class were computed and added as extra inputs for the last SVM. In order to enhance the performance of the ensemble, other considerations such as the use of Grid Search method for optimizing the hyperparameters were employed in the tuning of the SVMs. Numerical experiments were conducted over a dataset of 4,400 images, which were collected from 88 locations in 40 row crop fields in five Missouri counties between mid-April and early July in 2018 and 2019. The images were collected using a camera mounted on a tripod, with a spatial resolution of 0.014 cm pixel- 1 GSD (Ground Sampling Distance). The experiments highlighted the better performance of the proposed hierarchical ensemble classifier, which achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 86.3\% vs an accuracy of 80.4\% for the single SVM, while the testing accuracy was 83.8\% when compared to the accuracy of 80.9\% from the single SVM. Other metrics, such as precision, recall and F1 score, were also highly favorable towards the ensemble SVM.},

In neurorehabilitation, it is important because it enables neuroplasticity mechanisms and facilitates the restoration of motor function. For this reason, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been build to facilitate neurorehabilitation. This paper presents a gait adaptation scheme in natural settings. It allows monitoring of subjects in more realistic environment without the requirement of specialized equipment such as treadmill and foot pressure sensors. We extract gait characteristics based on a single RGB camera whereas wireless EEG signals are monitored simultaneously. Based on Regularised Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) that take into consideration both amplitude and frequency EEG features, we demonstrate that the method can not only successfully detect adaptation steps but it also detect efficiently whether the subject adjust their pace to higher or lower speed.},

Based on evaluating the lower and upper bound of re-handling, the parameters of the algorithm are tuned online in handling weight uncertainty.

Comparing with other kinds of complex engineering systems, the hybrid one is the most difficult to be analyzed because of its combination of continuous and discrete behaviors of the system, as well as the internal and external uncertainties. It is necessary to model and simulate the complex engineering system to explore its dynamics and evaluate the effect of different management strategies. Existing modeling and simulation methods of complex engineering systems, especially hybrid system, mostly focus on solving problems in specific systems or scenarios, neglecting the reusability and simplicity of methods. In this paper, a universal hierarchical modeling method for complex engineering system is proposed, which illustrates how to deal with continuous and discrete dynamics, and hybrid simulation method is applied to verify the feasibility and availability. A copper smelter is taken as one case of complex engineering system, and the production process in the smelter is described by the proposed method. Results of simulation show that the universal hierarchical modeling method can describe complex dynamics in the system properly and simply, which contributes to the study on complex engineering system.},

One of the defining advantages of the ChI, compared to other types of aggregations, is that it takes into account how variables interact with one another, which it does by means of what is called a capacity or fuzzy measure. The fuzzy measure captures the relative value, or worth, of different subsets of information sources taken together to make an inference. For data-driven problems, i.e., machine learning, the fuzzy measure comprises the parameters learned for using the ChI. In this work, we apply data-driven ChI decision-level fusion to the problem of classifying sound events from clips of audio. Three benchmark sound classification data sets are utilized: ESC-10, ESC-50, and UrbanSound8K. Six leading classification algorithms-deep networks and transformers-are used as the decision sources. The ChI fusion shows significant gains in accuracy for all three benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {Relative fundamental frequency (RFF) is an acoustic measure used to quantify vocal effort in voice science. Since it seeks to capture transitions between (i.e. to/from) steady-state vowels and unvoiced consonants, any machine learning approach to recognize patterns in these transitions should require time properties capable of identifying the sequence of phonemes. At the same time, Neural Networks (NN) have become a ubiquitous solution for data-driven problems, and Recursive NNs (RNN) provide a time-series schema to address time-dependent problems. Indeed, typical Neural Network solutions require either a time-series schema like in RNN or some spectral transformation to be able to handle time-dependent data. In this study, we decided to ignore - at least momentarily - any time-series dependency of the data and employed a simple NN to classify elements of the speech. Later, a State-Machine was used to identify their sequence with the purpose of localizing the transitions between voiced and unvoiced sounds in vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) productions. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that a pipeline consisting of time-agnostic (Neural Network) and time-dependent (State Machine) components can be used to recognize time-dependent patterns in VCV productions.},

However, hundreds or thousands of megabytes data are involved to store them, making these networks also computationally expensive. For certain applications, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), where such CNNs are to be implemented on resource-constrained and memory-constrained platforms, including Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and embedded devices, CNN architectures and parameters have to be small and efficient. In this paper, an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based adaptive integer quantisation method is proposed to reduce network size. The proposed method uses single objective rank-based evolutionary strategy to find the best quantisation bin boundary for fixed quantised bit width. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a small CNN, the LeNet-5 architecture, using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The aim is to devise a methodology that allows adaptive quantisation of both weights and bias from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integer representation for LeNet-5, while retaining accuracy. The experiments compare straight-forward (linear) quantisation from 32-bits to 8-bits with the proposed adaptive quantisation method. The results show that the proposed method is capable of quantising CNNs to lower bit width representation with only a slight loss in classification accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous driving is a complex task, which has been tackled since the first self-driving car ALVINN in 1989, with a supervised learning approach, or behavioral cloning (BC). In BC, a neural network is trained with state-action pairs that constitute the training set made by an expert, i.e., a human driver. However, this type of imitation learning does not take into account the temporal dependencies that might exist between actions taken in different moments of a navigation trajectory. These type of tasks are better handled by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which need to define a reward function. On the other hand, more recent approaches to imitation learning, such as Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), can train policies without explicitly requiring to define a reward function, allowing an agent to learn by trial and error directly on a training set of expert trajectories. In this work, we propose two variations of GAIL for autonomous navigation of a vehicle in the realistic CARLA simulation environment for urban scenarios. Both of them use the same network architecture, which process high-dimensional image input from three frontal cameras, and other nine continuous inputs representing the velocity, the next point from the sparse trajectory and a high-level driving command. We show that both of them are capable of imitating the expert trajectory from start to end after training ends, but the GAIL loss function that is augmented with BC outperforms the former in terms of convergence time and training stability.},

Recently, randomized NMF has been proposed as an approach to fast NMF of large nonnegative matrices. The main idea of this approach is to perform NMF after reducing the dimensionality of the given nonnegative matrix by multiplying it by a random matrix. Since randomized NMF is formulated as a constrained optimization problem which is slightly different from the one for original NMF, it is necessary to develop suitable algorithms for solving it. However, the conventional algorithm has a serious drawback that the constraints are not satisfied. In addition, the convergence of the algorithm has not been analyzed. In this paper, in order to overcome these drawbacks, we propose to modify the optimization problem and design an algorithm based on the hierarchical alternating least squares method to solve the modified optimization problem. We also prove the global convergence of the designed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a new natural evolution strategy for unconstrained black-box function optimization (BBFO) problems and implicitly constrained BBFO problems. BBFO problems are known to be difficult because explicit representations of objective functions are not available. Implicit constraints make the problems more difficult because whether or not a solution is feasible is revealed when the solution is evaluated with the objective function. DX-NES-IC is one of the promising methods for implicitly constrained BBFO problems. DX-NES-IC has shown better performance than conventional methods on implicitly constrained benchmark problems. However, DX-NES-IC has a problem in that the moving speed of the probability distribution is slow on ridge structure. To address the problem, we propose the Fast Moving Natural Evolution Strategy (FM-NES) that accelerates the movement of the probability distribution on ridge structure by introducing the rank-one update into DX-NES-IC. The rank-one update is utilized in CMA-ES. Since naively introducing the rank-one update makes the search performance deteriorate on implicitly constrained problems, we propose a condition of performing the rank-one update. We also propose to reset the shape of the probability distribution when an infeasible solution is sampled at the first time. In numerical experiments using unconstrained and implicitly constrained benchmark problems, FM-NES showed better performance than DX-NES-IC on problems with ridge structure and almost the same performance as DX-NES-IC on the others. Furthermore, FM-NES outperformed xNES, CMA-ES, xNES with the resampling technique, and CMA-ES with the resampling technique.},

It is based on three main operators: mental search, grouping, and movement. In the original HMS algorithm, a clustering algorithm is used to group the current population in order to identify a promising region in search space, while candidate solutions then move towards the best candidate solution in the promising region. In this paper, we propose a novel HMS algorithm, HMS-OS, which is based on clustering in both objective and search space, where clustering in objective space finds a set of best candidate solutions whose centroid is then also used in updating the population. For further improvement, HMS-OS benefits from an adaptive selection of the number of mental processes in the mental search operator. Experimental results on CEC-2017 benchmark functions with dimensionalities of 50 and 100, and in comparison to other optimisation algorithms, indicate that HMS-OS yields excellent performance, superior to those of other methods.},

  abstract  = {In the automotive industry, radar technology is an essential component for object identification due to its low cost and robust accuracy in harsh weather conditions. Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, groups together individual radar responses to detect objects. Because clustering is a significant step in the automotive object identification pipeline, cluster quality and speed are especially critical. To that extent, density-based clustering algorithms have made significant progress due to their ability to operate on data sets with an unknown quantity of clusters. However, many density-based clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN remain unable to deal with inherently noisy radar data. Furthermore, many existing algorithms are not adapted to operate on state-of-the-art 4D radar systems. Thus, we propose a novel pipeline that utilizes supervised machine learning to predict noisy points on 4D radar point clouds by leveraging historical data. We then input noise predictions into two proposed cluster formation approaches, respectively involving dynamic and fixed search radii. Our best performing model performs roughly 153 percent better than the baseline DBSCAN in terms of V-Measure, and our quickest model finishes in 75 percent less time than DBSCAN while performing 130 percent better in terms of V-Measure.},

While there are several studies already conducted in the control of devices using AR based, steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) control systems in a lab environment, this study seeks to implement a portable, closed-loop, AR-based BCI to assess the feasibility of controlling a physical device through SSVEP. This portable, closed-loop AR-based BCI provides users with the unique opportunity to simultaneously interact with the surrounding environment and control autonomous agents with an 88\% accuracy. The potential benefits of this application include reduced restrictions on handicapped individuals or concurrent control of multiple devices through a single AR interface. Ultimately, we hope this outcome can bridge the BCI field with further real-world, practical applications.},

  abstract  = {A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models for ocular-based user recognition in mobile devices. However, these high-performing networks have enormous space and computational complexity due to the millions of parameters and computations involved. These requirements make the deployment of deep learning models to resource-constrained mobile devices challenging. To this end, only a handful of studies based on knowledge distillation and patch-based models have been proposed to obtain compact size CNN models for ocular recognition in the mobile environment. In order to further advance the state-of-the-art, this study for the first time evaluates five neural network pruning methods and compares them with the knowledge distillation method for on-device CNN inference and mobile user verification using ocular images. Subject-independent analysis on VISOB and UPFR-Periocular datasets suggest the efficacy of layerwise magnitude-based pruning at a compression rate of 8 for mobile ocular-based authentication using ResNet-50 as the base model. Further, comparison with the knowledge distillation suggests the efficacy of knowledge distillation over pruning methods in terms of verification accuracy and the realtime inference measured as deep feature extraction time on five mobile devices, namely, iPhone 6, iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPad Air 2 and iPad 7th Generation.},

Therefore, in this research, we are considering using a Laser Ranging Image Sensor that can obtain an image including the distance as a new vehicle detector. In this paper, we first examined the sensor installation conditions. And then we proposed vehicle detection method for Laser Ranging Image Sensor for One-lane detection and Multiple-lanes detection. Finally, we conducted the demonstration experiment of vehicle detection and compared with the few public information of traditional vehicle detectors. From experiment results, we confirmed that for One-lane detection, it is excellent in accuracy. For Multiple-lines detection, it also has sufficient detection accuracy and can be further improving.

  abstract  = {Fuzzy numbers play an important part in the advanced theory of computational finance, which is undergoing a revolution aided by the powerful simulation and data-driven models. The volatility parameter is the most important parameter for pricing short-term options and arguably one of the important parameters for all financial time series. Traditional option pricing models determine the option&#39;s expected return without taking into account the uncertainty associated with the underlying asset price volatility. Fuzzy set theory can be used to explicitly account for such uncertainty. There has been a growing interest in studying fuzzy option pricing for European options and binary options using hybrid models. However, those fuzzy coefficient hybrid models are not data-driven. This paper uses data-driven volatility forecasts to study fuzzy European option pricing. A simple yet effective fuzzy option pricing model incorporating data-driven exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and neuro volatility models is presented to obtain fuzzy volatility forecasts and fuzzy option prices. The dynamics of the underlying assets is complex and hence it is preferable to use the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, to get rid of the assumptions in the commonly used Black Scholes (BS) models. Using the data-driven fuzzy a-cuts of the annualized volatility, a-cuts of the call and put option prices based on novel MC simulation are obtained using $t$ or Laplace distributed asset log returns. The driving idea, unlike the existing MC option pricing with normality assumption, is that the proposed novel MC method uses the data-driven $t$ or Laplace distribution of asset log returns and nonlinear adaptive fuzzy volatility.},

Moreover, the data-driven algorithmic approach proposed in this paper provides optimal portfolio weights by focusing on the robustness and sparsity of the solution.

Using 150 most traded stock prices downloaded from Yahoo finance, experiments are carried out and the results are described.

  abstract  = {Genome sequencing generates large volumes of data and hence requires increasingly higher computational resources. The growing data problem is even more acute in metagenomics applications, where data from an environmental sample include many organisms instead of just one for the common single organism sequencing. Traditional taxonomic classification and clustering approaches and platforms - while designed to be computationally efficient - are not capable of incrementally updating a previously trained system when new data arrive, which then requires complete re-training with the augmented (old plus new) data. Such complete retraining is inefficient and leads to poor utilization of computational resources. An ability to update a classification system with only new data offers a much lower run-time as new data are presented, and does not require the approach to be re-trained on the entire previous dataset. In this paper, we propose Incremental VSEARCH (I-VSEARCH) and its semi-supervised version for taxonomic classification, as well as a threshold independent VSEARCH (TI-VSEARCH) as wrappers around VSEARCH, a well-established (unsupervised) clustering algorithm for metagenomics. We show - on a 16S rRNA gene dataset - that I-VSEARCH, running incrementally only on the new batches of data that become available over time, does not lose any accuracy over VSEARCH that runs on the full data, while providing attractive computational benefits.},

A single-shot detection (SSD) network is also developed to serve as a baseline approach and for comparative evaluation. Experiments are designed using several images of real and artificial leaves as inputs to the R-CNNs that are trained and tested with different proposal areas of the images. The performances of R-CNNs and SSDs are evaluated using mean average precision (mAP) measure. Results from this study indicate that trained R-CNN s perform well in classification of real and artificial leaves and are robust in performance against changes in many of the experimental factors including minimal training data and resolution of the images. R-CNNs have also performed better than SSDs in the classification tasks with higher values of mAP. The performance of R-CNNs is affected by the proposal area, or the number of subsections the R-CNNs utilizes to determine distinct characteristics of the objects (i.e., leaves) presented. Results based on limited experiments from this study indicate the R-CNNs and their variants are ideally suited for object classification tasks with numerous real-world applications.},

There are many research challenges in maximizing the useful transmitted information through a limited transmission channel. The paper presents self-learning wavelet compression method controlled by Q-Learning (QL), which is able to optimize an amount of transmitted data using lossy compression. The aim is to use transmission channel throughput as effectively as possible without the loss of data. A QL agent selects an appropriate compression method according to buffer use and maintains this level at 70\%. The proposed method was tested on environmental historical data. The results showed that our method is able to use more than 96\% of the available transmission channel throughput with minimal data loss, even if the communications channel throughput experiences significant changes.},

Anomaly detection algorithms that exploit artificial neural networks (ANN) have recently gained particular interest. These algorithms are usually evaluated and compared through effectiveness measures, which aim to quantify how well anomalies are identified based on detection capabilities. However, to the best of our knowledge, the performance characterization from the perspective of computational cost and space, training time, memory consumption, together with a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between algorithm effectiveness and performance, have not been explored yet. In this work, we select four recently proposed unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms based on ANN, namely: REPresentations for a random nEarest Neighbor (REPEN), DevNet, OmniAnomaly, Multi-Objective Generative Adversarial Active Learning (MO-GAAL); we perform a variety of experiments to evaluate the trade-offs between the effectiveness and performance of the selected algorithms using two reference dataset: NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS-2017. Our results confirm the importance of this study, showing that none of the selected algorithms dominate the others in terms of both, effectiveness and performance. Furthermore, it shows that approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks, which exploit the temporal dependency of the samples, have a clear advantage over the others in terms of effectiveness, while exhibiting the worst execution time.},

However, these deep learning models need large amount of labeled data for model training and optimum parameter estimation. Limited labeled data for model training results in overfitting and impacts their generalization performance. However, the collection and annotation of large amount of data is a very time consuming and expensive operation. Further, due to privacy and security concerns, the large amount of labeled data could not be collected for certain applications such as those involving medical field. Self-training, Co-training, and Self-ensemble methods are three types of semi-supervised learning methods that can be used to exploit unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose self-ensemble based deep learning model that along with limited labeled data, harness unlabeled data for improving the generalization performance. We evaluated the proposed self-ensemble based deep-learning model for soft-biometric gender and age classification. Experimental evaluation on CelebA and VISO B datasets suggest gender classification accuracy of 94.46\% and 81.00\%, respectively, using only 1000 labeled samples and remaining 199k samples as unlabeled samples for CelebA dataset and similarly,1000 labeled samples with remaining 107k samples as unlabeled samples for VISOB dataset. Comparative evaluation suggest that there is 5.74\% and 8.47\% improvement in the accuracy of the self-ensemble model when compared with supervised model trained on the entire CelebA and VISOB dataset, respectively. We also evaluated the proposed learning method for age-group prediction on Adience dataset and it outperformed the baseline supervised deep-learning learning model with a better exact accuracy of 55.55 ± 4.28 which is 3.92\% more than the baseline.},

  abstract  = {Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that trains a global model for prediction based on several local models at clients while local data privacy is preserved. Class imbalance is believed to be one of the factors that degrades the global model performance. However, there has been very little research on if and how class imbalance can affect the global performance in various imbalance scenarios. Class imbalance in federated learning is much more complex than that in traditional non-distributed machine learning, due to different class imbalance situations at local clients. Class imbalance needs to be re-defined in distributed learning environments, so that corresponding solutions can be proposed. In this paper, first, we propose two new metrics to define class imbalance - the global class imbalance degree (MID) and the local difference of class imbalance among clients (WCS). Class imbalance is categorized into four scenarios under the definition. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of class imbalance on the global performance in various scenarios. Our results show that a higher MID and a larger WCS degrade more the performance of the global model. Besides, WCS is shown to slow down the convergence of the global model by misdirecting the optimization.},

Hence, suppression of noise in the sound can improve the robustness of the sound classification model. This paper investigated a sound separation technique that separates the input sound into many overlapped-content Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) frames. Our approach is different from the traditional STFT conversion method, which converts each sound into a single STFT image. Contradictory, separating the sound into many STFT frames improves model prediction accuracy by increasing variability in the data and therefore learning from that variability. These separated frames are saved as images and then labeled manually as clean and noisy frames which are then fed into transfer learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification task. The pre-trained CNN architectures that learn from these frames become robust against the noise. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is robust against noise and achieves 94.14\% in terms of classifying 21 classes including 20 classes of sound events and a noisy class.

  abstract  = {Itis a challenging task to identify optimal network configurations for large-scale deep neural networks with cascaded structures. In this research, we propose a hybrid end-to-end model by integrating Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) with Single Shot Detector (SSD), for undertaking object detection. We subsequently employ the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to conduct hyperparameter identification for the DCGAN-SSD model. The detected class labels as well as salient regional features are then used as inputs for a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for image description generation. Evaluated with a video data set in the wild, the empirical results indicate the efficiency of the proposed PSO-enhanced DCGAN-SSD object detector with respect to object detection and image description generation.},

  abstract  = {In machine learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming mainstream because they can learn higher-level features and thus form deep representations. However, DNNs require a lot of memory and training time. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of D NN training has been an increasingly important focus of research in recent years. In this paper, we propose a training method, Ensemble2Net, that can accelerate the training of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), and help student networks learn knowledge from DCNN-based teacher networks. We use a novel algorithm, Ensemble2Net, to accelerate the transfer of learning in VGGnet (13/16/19), and ResNet. The results show that the Ensemble2Net technique can help VGGnet and ResNet achieve the best accuracy at lower cost than current approaches. In particular, ResNet using Ensemble2Net with 20 epochs achieves better accuracy than the original Res Net trained with more than 170 epochs, with a 1.503x speedup in performance.},

Human Mental Search (HMS) is a relatively recent population-based metaheuristic that has been shown to work well in comparison to other algorithms. However, HMS is time-consuming and suffers from relatively poor exploration. Having clustered the candidate solutions, HMS selects a winner cluster with the best mean objective function. This is not necessarily the best criterion to choose the winner group and limits the exploration ability of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose an improvement to the HMS algorithm in which the best bids from multiple clusters are used to benefit from enhanced exploration. We also use a one-step k-means algorithm in the clustering phase to improve the speed of the algorithm. Our experimental results show that MCS-HMS outperforms HMS as well as other population-based metaheuristic algorithms.},

Nevertheless, CCA-based SSVEP detection encounters the spectral non-uniformity of spontaneous background EEG activity which deteriorates the performance. In this study, we found the performance of SSVEP-based BCI highly predictable by the standard deviation of resting-state response using CCA. Therefore, the proposed normalized CCA (nCCA) aims to calibrate the spectral non-uniformity of background activity which causes bias in classification, and outperforms standard CCA significantly in simulated online tests. In addition, nCCA features near-zero calibration making it a nice fit to practical applications of SSVEP-based BCI spellers.},

It is difficult to accurately segment renal parenchyma directly using the classical Unet network. Therefore, we propose a cascaded network, i.e. a segment network that realize segmentation from coarse to fine. The coarse segmentation model is used to obtain the suggested area of the kidney in the diuretic renal image. The cascaded fine segmentation model is to segment the renal parenchyma from the suggested region of the kidney. Compared with the original Unet, the cascade network can reduce the noise interference to a large extent and get better segmentation performance of the renal parenchyma. The experiment showed that the dice coefficient increased by 9.78\%, and the proposed network is efficient in the renal parenchyma segmentation.},

Against this background, this study introduces a prototype simulator that can produce vehicle-mounted camera videos in various driving situations using 3D computer graphics. This simulator easily enables us to validate the effectiveness of models for computing dynamic saliency maps in various driving situations, even dangerous driving situations that are difficult to capture by actual vehicle-mounted cameras. As an initial validation of this simulator, we reproduced vehicle-mounted camera videos in situations with other cars and pedestrians. Subsequently, we applied the models to compute dynamic saliency maps, which were proposed in our previous work to reproduce vehicle-mounted camera videos. The obtained results proved the usefulness of the proposed simulator. Improvements to our models have also been discussed.},

The standard diagnostic testing procedure for COVID-19 is testing a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can take multiple days to provide a diagnosis. Another widespread form of testing is rapid antigen testing, which has a low sensitivity compared to PCR, but is favored for its quick diagnosis time of usually 15–30 minutes. Patients who test positive for COVID-19 demonstrate diffuse alveolar damage in 87\% of cases. Machine learning has proven to have advantages in image classification problems with radiology. In this work, we introduce CovXR as a machine learning model designed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-rays (CXR). CovXR is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on over 4,300 chest X-rays. The performance of the model is measured through accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.5\% and an F1 score of 0.954. The sensitivity is 93.5\% and specificity is 97.5\%. With accuracy above 95\% and F1 score above 0.95, CovXR is highly accurate in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs. The model achieves better accuracy than prior work and uses a unique approach to identify COVID-19 pneumonia. CovXR is highly accurate in identifying COVID-19 on CXRs of patients with a PCR confirmed positive diagnosis and provides much faster results than PCR tests.},

Therefore, emotion detection plays an important role in user-generated content for capturing the state of mind. Moreover, researchers adopted traditional machine learning and deep learning models to capture emotions from the text. Recently, transformers-based architectures achieve better results in various natural language processing tasks. Therefore, we propose a transformer-based emotion detection system, which uses context-dependent features and a one-cycle learning rate policy for a better understanding of emotions from the text.

The aim of SPTP is to find the shortest path that passes multiple disjoint node subsets in a given order. The challenging part is the computational redundancy of existing decomposition-based algorithms, which is caused by determining the shortest paths from all pairs of sources and destinations in each subproblem. Inspired by the ripple spreading motions on water surface, a ripple-spreading algorithm (RSA) is proposed to solve SPTP in this paper. RSA outperforms other algorithms by forming connections among subproblems, and each subproblem can be solved in a single run to determine the shortest paths to every destination node. The time complexity is irrelevant to node quantities, so RSA is more efficient on large scale networks with sparse connections theoretically. Comparative experiments were conducted on fully random networks, and RSA was validated to be the most powerful algorithm by promoting the efficiency several times. Additionally, layered graphs were designed to simulate the topology of NFV. The computational efficiency of RSA also surpassed other algorithms on layered graphs with various parameters. This brand new algorithm should help to endow the SPTP-related problems with excellent solving efficiency and scalability.},

  abstract  = {The present study aims at generating heuristics for Protein Structure Prediction represented in the 2D HP model. Protein Structure Prediction is about determining the 3-dimensional form of a protein from a given amino acid sequence. The resulting structure directly relates to the functionalities of the protein. There are a wide range of algorithms to address Protein Structure Prediction as an optimization problem. Being said that there is no an ultimate algorithm that can effectively solve PSP under varying experimental settings. Hyper-heuristics can offer a solution as high-level, problem-independent search and optimization strategies. Selection Hyper-heuristics operate on given heuristic sets that directly work on the solution space. One group of Selection Hyper-heuristics focus on automatically specify the best heuristics on-the-fly. Yet, the candidate heuristics tend to be decided, preferably a domain expert. Generation Hyper-heuristics approach differently as aiming to generate such heuristics automatically. This work introduces a automated heuristic generation strategy supporting Selection Hyper-heuristics. The generation task is formulated as a selection problem, disclosing the best expected heuristic specifically f or a given problem instance. The heuristic generation process is established as a parameter configuration problem. T he corresponding system is devised by initially generating a training data alongside with a set of basic features characterizing the Protein Structure Prediction problem instances. The data is generated discretizing the parameter configuration space o f a single heuristic. The resulting data is used to predict the best configuration of a specific heuristic used in a heuristic set under Selection Hyper-heuristics. The prediction is performed separately for each instance rather than using one setting for all the instances. The empirical analysis showed that the proposed idea offers both better and robust performance on 22 PSP instances compared to the one-for-all heuristic sets.

  abstract  = {Social media has been a popular source for receiving news or information in daily life due to its rapid dissemination and ease of access. However, this trend causes a series of critical issues. The most critical issue, fake news, is a quickly growing threat. Fake news has the capability to compromise the democracy and credibility of information. Compared to other malicious threats, fake news is harder to detect due to being created to intentionally deceive target audiences. Various studies have been conducted and suggested that machine learning can be effectively utilized in detecting fake news. However, with the increasing amount of data, traditional machine learning algorithms will face challenges in ingesting and processing the data at scale. Thus, we propose a fake news detection system that incorporates both a quantum k-nearest neighbors (QKNN) machine learning model and Genetic and Evolutionary Feature Selection (GEFeS). With our proposed system, the highest accuracy achieved in this research is 87.12\%.},

  abstract  = {The lithology identification plays a fundamental role for the fine characterization and comprehensive evaluation of complex reservoirs. Several methods so far have been proposed for lithology identification such as the analysis of sensitive conventional logging curves, intersection diagrams as well as geostatistical analysis. Though these methods can lead to improving accuracy of lithology recognition, they are either indirectly reflect lithology information or affected by handwork factors, thus the efficiency and accuracy are limited. Recently, in the image processing area, Inception convolutional neural network has become a powerful tool for expressing complex structures and extracting multi-scale feature information due to its parallel structure of convolutional kernel. To this end, in this paper, we propose to apply the Inception network for lithology identification based on high-resolution well-logging imaging. Different from the conventional Inception network, the proposed model is able to automatically extract the typical feature regions of different lithology categories from the raw Formation MicroScanner Image (FMI) data by parameter transfer strategy, which could improve the generalization performance and enhance the accuracy of lithology identification. To alleviate the problem of differences in the distribution of features, the improved Inception model adopts regularized loss function constrained full connection layer to extract high-level features and obtain more available and valuable information. Experimental results show that the network model has the advantages of fewer parameters and less computational load, and the accuracy of lithology identification can reach 97.32\%.},

Situational awareness is essential in the cockpit where manual and autonomous operations co-exist. Many interventions and countermeasures have been designed into cockpits to enhance pilot awareness and performance. This study aims to analyse pilot and copilot teams&#39; awareness by using physiological data which was collected in a flight simulator to train models to predict when pilots are in a state of Channelised Attention (CA), Diverted Attention (DA), and Startle/Surprise (SS). Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals collected for 18 subjects were processed in preparation to develop a comprehensive tool which utilises active Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) data to evaluate machine learning tools which are capable of predicting pilot awareness response. A combination of linear, non-linear, binary and multi-class classification were applied to this data. The results indicate that while all classifiers produced stable results, Decision Tree(DT) far outperformed the others. Further analyses revealed that the maximum value for ECG was the most important feature used by all classifiers evaluated for importance in training the classification models. However, for DT which was the best performing classifier both maximum and minimum ECG values were the most important features in predictions made by this model.},

These effects have poor visibility, dimmed luminosity, low contrast, and distortion of colour. As a result, restoring a degraded image is difficult, especially in hazy conditions. The image dehazing method focuses on improving the visibility of image details while preserving image colours without causing data loss. Many image dehazing methods achieve the goal of removing haze while also addressing other issues such as oversaturation, colour distortion, and halo artefacts. However, the limitation of haze level rendered these approaches ineffective. A volume of various haze level data is required to demonstrate the efficiency of the image dehazing method in removing haze at all haze levels and obtaining the image&#39;s quality. This paper introduced a dynamic scattering coefficient to the dehazing algorithm for determining an applicable visibility range for different haze conditions. These proposed methods improve on the current state-of-the-art dehazing method in terms of image quality measurement results.},

The chaos and complexity associated with the uncertain behavior inherent in pipeline systems lead to difficulty in detection and localisation of leaks in real-time. The timely detection of leakage is important in order to reduce the loss rate and serious environmental consequences. To address this issue, in this paper an auto regressive with exogenous input (ARX)-Laguerre fuzzy proportional -derivative (PD) observation system is pro-posed to detect and estimate a leak in pipelines. In this work, the ARX-Laguerre model has been used to generate better performance in the presence of uncertainty.

Protein Structure Prediction is a critical problem concerned with exploring the structure of a protein, given an amino acid sequence. For the sake of improved search performance, various models have been introduced such as the Hydrophobic Polar (HP) models. These models make PSP computationally approachable. There exists a large suite of algorithms introduces to solve PSP. As in all other problem domains, it is possible to see that the PSP algorithms considered to be strong can fail to address some problem instances. One way of providing further performance improvements without devising a new algorithm is to automatically determine the best possible algorithm for a given PSP problem instance. Algorithm Selection focuses on automatically choosing algorithms for any given problem solving scenario. Unlike the traditional use of AS, this study accommodates Algorithm Selection for specifying the best suited energy function used for search. The process is designed as a rank prediction task on 7 energy functions for Iterated Local Search as the optimization algorithm. The idea is to assess the best energy function that can guide the search process of Iterated Local Search on a per-instance basis. An experimental analysis is reported on 30 PSP instances, each half belongs to the 2D and 3D HP models, respectively. The results show that Algorithm Selection is capable to offer proper selection of the energy functions with robustness. Additionally, a brief algorithm and instance analysis is reported on the instance hardness and matching algorithmic capabilities. This analysis further provides insights on the instance hardness besides instance and algorithm similarities.},

Although different monitoring systems estimating antinociception effect during general anesthesia are available, the performance of these indices is limited. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of the probability of movement if a standardized tetanic stimulation is applied to the patient, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal as input. Seventy-seven female patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures under general anesthesia, were included. EEG segments of 45s, preceding tetanic stimulation, were split into epochs of 5s with no overlapping. Features from both time and frequency domain, including continuous wavelet transform (CWT), were considered. Five different machine learning (ML) models were tested: 1D CNN model for raw EEG signal, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and support vector classifier for extracted features and finally 2D CNN model for CWT scalogram. The results showed that the performance of the proposed ML models to predict movement to standardized tetanic stimulation through the EEG signal was almost equal to the performance of commercially available indices (AUC=0.73). This performance was improved (AUC=0.84) with ML methods in ensemble mode with pupil diameter and remifentanil effect site concentration. Indeed, prediction of movement to noxious stimulation through the EEG signal matches state of the art and could potentially be used in combination of other variables.},

  abstract  = {Reward design in reinforcement learning should be less burdensome on the designer and be able to respond to changes in the environment and task. Therefore, we are studying the Self-generation of Reward, a method of reward design that does not depend on changes in the environment or task. Self-generation of Reward is a method in which an agent generates its own reward by evaluating sensor information from the outside world from multiple perspectives, using the sense of danger avoidance of biological life as an index. The only desired indicator of danger avoidance is a negative evaluation when the sensor information is dangerous. However, when the state is not dangerous, the evaluation is positive. Positive evaluation means that the agent is desired to achieve the goal, but the non-dangerous state has nothing to do with achieving the goal. Therefore, there is a problem that the measure of risk avoidance includes the evaluation of the achievement of undesired goals. To solve this problem, we propose a method to control whether sensor information is evaluated or not. Improve the indicator of risk avoidance to generate only negative evaluations by not including positive evaluations in the sensor evaluation if they are indicated. In this study, we conducted a simulation experiment using path finding on a grid map to verify whether the proposed method can be used for learning. As a result, we found that learning was possible by adjusting the reward given to each action.},

Each i-th NBRF provides three membership degrees: to the i-th class, to the super class made by its complementary classes, and to an extra class representing out-of-classes images. The training process artificially generates extra-class samples, via image transformation and noise addition.

  abstract  = {Threats, posed by ransomware, are rapidly increasing, and its cost on both national and global scales is becoming significantly high as evidenced by the recent events. Ransomware carries out an irreversible process, where it encrypts victims&#39; digital assets to seek financial compensations. Adversaries utilize different means to gain initial access to the target machines, such as phishing emails, vulnerable public-facing software, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), brute-force attacks, and stolen accounts. To combat these threats of ransomware, this paper aims to help researchers gain a better understanding of ransomware application profiles through static analysis, where we identify a list of suspicious indicators and similarities among 727 active ran-somware samples. We start with generating portable executable (PE) metadata for all the studied samples. With our domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis tasks, we introduce some of the suspicious indicators of the structure of ransomware files. We reduce the dimensionality of the generated dataset by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and discover clusters by applying the KMeans algorithm. This motivates us to utilize the one-class classification algorithms on the generated dataset. As a result, the algorithms learn the common data boundary in the structure of our studied ransomware samples, and thereby, we achieve the data-driven similarities. We use the findings to evaluate the trained classifiers with the test samples and observe that the Local Outlier Factor (LoF) performs better on all the selected feature spaces compared to the One-Class SVM and the Isolation Forest algorithms.},

Thus neural networks sometimes produce dramatic reverberating events, when multitudes of neurons fire simultaneously.

In our model we use the self-optimization algorithm, developed in the unsupervised learning field, to show that in fact disruptions to network activity caused by synchronous bursting of the kind associated with the critical behavior, could enhance the performance of the network if the said network is capable of Hebbian learning.},

In this research, we formulate this landmark-based VPR as a deep learning extension of SIMBAD, and propose a new extremely compact scene descriptor based on landmark ranking. Our contributions are as follows. In our study, a scene is described compactly as an ordered list of IDs of most similar landmarks. Such a descriptor can be efficiently indexed and retrieved by an incremental inverted index. Similarity between query and database scenes can be evaluated discriminatively by using reciprocal rank features (RRFs). The result shows an extremely compact data structure that compresses the descriptors into incremental inverted indexes. Experiments using the public NCLT dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This paper proposes a principal component initialization method with anomalous data (PCI-AD) for BU-AE, where the initial weights are obtained by principal component analysis; the PCI-AD is trained to reduce the reconstruction error of normal data and increase that of the anomalous data. Since these weights are equivalent in concept to the objective function of BU-AE, BU-AE with PCI-AD provides stable performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PCI-AD, the proposed method was compared through several computational experiments with He&#39;s initialization, which is a random number-based initialization method. In the experiment using CIFAR-10, it was confirmed that the use of PCI-AD improved the value of AUC by up to 17\% compared to He&#39;s initialization.},

  abstract  = {Developing an accurate tourism forecasting model is essential for making desirable policy decisions for tourism management. Early studies on tourism management focus on discovering external factors related to tourism demand. Recent studies utilize deep learning in demand forecasting along with these external factors. They mainly use recursive neural network models such as LSTM and RNN for their frameworks. However, these models are not suitable for use in forecasting tourism demand. This is because tourism demand is strongly affected by changes in various external factors, and recursive neural network models have limitations in handling these multivariate inputs. We propose a multi-head attention CNN model (MHAC) for addressing these limitations. The MHAC uses 1D-convolutional neural network to analyze temporal patterns and the attention mechanism to reflect correlations between input variables. This model makes it possible to extract spatiotemporal characteristics from time-series data of various variables. We apply our forecasting framework to predict inbound tourist changes in South Korea by considering external factors such as politics, disease, season, and attraction of Korean culture. The performance results of extensive experiments show that our method outperforms other deep-learning-based prediction frameworks in South Korea tourism forecasting.},

The models are tested on data from a transit agency in Santa Clara County, California, including time-of-use (TOU) grid prices, vehicle specifications, and solar generation capabilities. Results show both models achieve full solar utilization and consume less power during peak hours. Dynamic route assignment achieves an 11\% reduction in operational costs and performs over a range of parameters based on sensitivity analysis.

In addition, we applied RF based feature selection and bootstrap aggregation in order to improve model performance and aggregate predictions from different models. Our results show that RF model achieves the best prediction results, and feature selection is able to improve test performance of FNN and ANFIS.

In this way, algorithms and their local hyperparameters are referred to as the same level. Consequently, this approach makes the resulting initial sampling less robust. In this study, we describe a first attempt to formulate the AutoML optimization problem as its nature instead of transfer it into a HPO problem. To take advantage of this paradigm, we propose a novel initial sampling approach to maximize the coverage of the AutoML search space to help BO construct a robust surrogate model. We experiment with 2 independent scenarios of AutoML with 2 operators and 6 operators over 117 benchmark datasets. Results of our experiments demonstrate that the performance of BO significantly improved by using our sampling approach.},

Almost all people have smart devices that are connected worldwide and many are using social media platforms, and thus, most of their personal information is used and shared. An example of cybersecurity threats are malicious URLs and malware, which are very likely to impact general users. For the research community, detecting new types of attacks is a challenge. Most of the past research studies focused on surveying malicious attack detection. The classification models detect the kind of attacks by using machine learning approaches. Interpreting machine learning models is also an important issue. Tree, Deep, and Kernel of SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) are well-known techniques, which achieve efficient performance in interpreting the results. In this paper, two cyber data sets are investigated, both being five-class data sets, for which the Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classification, and the Keras Sequential algorithms are applied. The obtained results confirm that applying the classifiers to generate the models are good choices to detect cybersecurity threats. The efficacy of these models&#39; performance was evaluated by measuring the precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix. In addition, three SHAP methods are used to explain the output of the resulting machine learning models for the five-class data sets.},

  abstract  = {Intrusion Response is a relatively new field of research. Several model-based techniques have been proposed that range from static mapping to complex stateful approaches. However, the main limitation that all of them have in common is that they do not consider the non-stationary behavior of the protected system which, in combination with long planning times, makes it unfeasible to use them on dynamic and large-scale systems. In this work, we propose an Intrusion Response controller based on deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning, which automatically adapts to system changes. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness and its performance on Online Boutique, a cloud-based web application that Google uses to showcase its cloud technologies. We first carry out an extensive tuning of the hyper-parameters of the neural networks that implement our approach. Afterwards, we empirically show the effectiveness and the performance of the realized Intrusion Response controller in a typical cloud scenario, that is, when instances are added or removed from the system. Experimental results show that a proper hyper-parameter tuning can reduce the training time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, transfer learning completely zeroes the transient adaptation stage when the number of replicas of a given service is reduced. The training during the transient stage exhibits instead a speed-up of 1.25x in case a replica is added. For reproducibility, the source code of the Intrusion Response System is released with the onen-source Apache 2.0 license.},

  abstract  = {In Emergency Medical Services (EMS), time is of the essence. It is crucial for one or more ambulances to reach the scene of a medical incident quickly to ensure timely, sometimes life-saving, assistance to people in need. To do so, one needs good estimates of when and where incidents are likely to occur. This work investigates how to best forecast EMS demand in and around Oslo, Norway&#39;s capital. Demand forecasts are computed using machine learning models created from historical EMS and weather data. We use a fine spatio-temporal resolution of 1×1km spatial regions and 1-hr time intervals. Two different approaches are implemented and compared against each other: a split approach that forecasts the volume and distribution of the EMS demand separately, and a complete approach that directly models the EMS demand over our spatial domain. We use multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models to forecast the EMS demand, and compare them to simple aggregation methods and baselines. We also study different feature sets and online learning to improve the models&#39; performance. Experiments suggest that a split online model consisting of a simple aggregation distribution model and an MLP volume model with simple temporal features produces the best forecasts. In particular, the split model produces competitive volume, distribution, and complete forecasts relative to a state-of-the-practice method, MEDIC, and a well-established complete MLP model proposed by Setzler et al.},

Much of the progress has been due to advances in machine learning and the availability of suitable data sets consisting of images, each with multiple captions. However, there has been little research on the impact of varying the number of captions on the quality of image captioning results. In particular, does it improve image captioning performance if we increase the number of captions in a dataset by augmenting the existing captions with paraphrases created using backtranslation? In this paper, we address this question and make the following three main contributions. First, we present a novel method of adding captions to a dataset by means of paraphrasing via backtranslation. Backtranslation amounts, in our case, to translating an English caption to a French counterpart which is then translated back to English. Typically, this results in the backtranslated English caption being different from the original English caption. Such backtranslated English captions can thus be used to augment the original dataset. Second, using our method, we generate paraphrases for the seminal MS COCO image captioning dataset. Our paraphrase dataset consists of around 490 000 paraphrased captions that are different from the original captions in MS COCO. Third, in image captioning experiments with deep learning models, we use datasets augmented with backtranslated paraphrases. We study the extent to which augmenting image captioning training datasets with paraphrases improves image captioning models&#39; performance, and report promising results. Code and data are publicly available.},

  abstract  = {The splitting delivery vehicle routing problem with 3-dimensional loading constraints (3L-SDVRP) is an important and challenging VRP variant. The problem consists of two subproblems: the routing and 3D bin packing, each of which is NP-hard by itself. Compared with CVRP, 3L-SDVRP is much closer to the reality. There have been many studies on 3L-SDVRP. However, to our best knowledge, no complete mathematical model has been formalised with comprehensive loading constraints and there are still some real-world factors ignored in the existing studies. In this paper, we consider a more realistic 3L-SDVRP model with restricted access provided by the 2021 HUAWEI Logistics Competition, which is different from existing problem models in two aspects. First, this problem considers the total travel cost and average loading rate simultaneously. Second, this problem has additional constraints related to certain special pickup points. These differences make existing optimisation approaches not directly applicable. A major contribution of this paper is the formal mathematical model developed for this new 3L-SDVRP. In addition, we propose a genetic algorithm with an efficient fitness evaluation. The proposed algorithm has been demonstrated to significantly outperform the baseline solver provided by the competition in solving the problem instances from the competition and the ones adapted from benchmark datasets of related problems.},

  abstract  = {Human motion characteristics are used to monitor the progression of neurological diseases and mood disorders. Since perceptions of emotions are also interleaved with body posture and movements, emotion recognition from human gait can be used to quantitatively monitor mood changes. Many existing solutions often use shallow machine learning models with raw positional data or manually extracted features to achieve this. However, gait is composed of many highly expressive characteristics that can be used to identify human subjects, and most solutions fail to address this, disregarding the subject&#39;s privacy. This work introduces a novel deep neural network architecture to disentangle human emotions and biometrics. In particular, we propose a cross-subject transfer learning technique for training a multi-encoder autoencoder deep neural network to learn disentangled latent representations of human motion features. By disentangling subject biometrics from the gait data, we show that the subject&#39;s privacy is preserved while the affect recognition performance outperforms traditional methods. Furthermore, we exploit Guided Grad-CAM to provide global explanations of the model&#39;s decision across gait cycles. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method to existing methods at recognizing emotions using both 3D temporal joint signals and manually extracted features. We also show that this data can easily be exploited to expose a subject&#39;s identity. Our method shows up to 7\% improvement and highlights the joints with the most significant influence across the average gait cycle.},

  abstract  = {The prediction of surrounding vehicles&#39; trajectories based on the ego vehicle&#39;s perception is crucial for safe and predictive planning of an autonomous vehicle. In particular on highways, a late detection of cutting in vehicles causes uncomfortable or even hazardous braking maneuvers. To address this, we propose a joint trajectory and cut-in prediction on highways for real-world application. For a large data set with diverse cut-in scenarios, we leverage automatic labeling functions and a retrospective view on recorded driving data of a test vehicle fleet. This allows us to extract 1856 cut-in, an equal number of passing maneuvers, and to generate the trajectory targets and cut-in labels for each time step automatically. For a proper evaluation, we review and correct the automatically generated cut-in labels of the validation and test set. Given this data set, we apply an LSTM-based encoder-decoder model and train a bimodal trajectory prediction with a passing and a cut-in mode. To improve mode separation, we evaluate the effectiveness of soft and hard output constraints. We implement soft constraints with an additional loss term and the hard output constraints according to the recently proposed neural network architecture ConstraintNet. Both constraint types improve mode separation while the hard constraints achieve additionally the best overall performance with respect to mode separation and trajectory accuracy. Further, we show that the duration of cutin labels and an additional weighting of the lateral part of the trajectory loss is important for well-separated modes.},

A family of bio-inspired algorithms, well known as Swarm Intelligence (SI) methods, have recently emerged to meet the requirements for the clustering task and have been successfully applied to various real-world clustering problems. In this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Kmeans, which is one of the most popular cluster algorithms, have been applied. Furthermore, hybrid algorithms consisting of Kmeans and PSO, and Kmeans and ABC have been proposed for the clustering process.

  abstract  = {Trust has been widely recognized as one of the most important factors influencing team performance. The ability to accurately evaluate the trustworthiness of team members (agents) is crucial for effective team performance. Interaction data among agents are suitable sources of information determining each agent&#39;s trustworthiness. However, the existing interaction-based trust models are usually task specific and are only applicable to some well-defined domains (tasks). This paper addresses the problem of accurate trust evaluation in a team of agents by proposing an interaction-based trust evaluation model - the Determination of Trust Model (DoTM), which is applicable to various team tasks. The DoTM maps the relationships between interaction records and the trustworthiness of an agent through a supervised learning algorithm. To take full advantage of the interaction data, before being fed into the machine learner, interaction data are pre-processed by three data processing methods, i.e., combining data from multiple runs, involving indirect interaction records and calculating relative data across agents. A series of experiments are conducted on a simulation platform which performs a cooperative food foraging task. Different types of flawed agents are introduced to distinguish between agents with different trustworthiness. The experimental results demonstrate that the DoTM achieves high accuracy and consistency in scenarios involving different types of flawed agents. The DoTM is compared with an existing interaction-based trust model - LogitTrust and achieved significantly better evaluation accuracy in all considered scenarios. Moreover, the impact of each data processing method is demonstrated through experimental investigations.},

  abstract  = {Model trees typically partition the input space by axis-orthogonal splits into local regions for local regression. Due to these splits, properties of the function to be approximated can only be taken into account to a limited extent, which increases the bias of model trees. To minimize this bias, multivariate model trees with axis-oblique splits can be used. However, existing methods to build axis-oblique splits are either not applicable, ineffective, or limited to certain data distributions and properties of the approximated function. In this work, we present a novel method for axis-oblique splitting that overcomes these drawbacks by using the average direction of non-linearity of the function. This direction is estimated by extending the dimensionality reduction method refined Outer Product of Gradients. Moreover, we present a tree construction algorithm in which our method is integrated, and evaluate the resulting multivariate model tree COMT on synthetic data in an experimental study. In this study, we compare COMT and our split method in terms of prediction accuracy with common regression models and a proven method to identify axis-oblique split directions called Principal Hessian Directions. We also analyze the improvements in bias and variance by our axis-oblique splitting over conventional (univariate) model trees and multivariate regression trees. On the used data, COMT outperforms the competitors in terms of prediction accuracy, and our split method significantly reduces bias and variance.},

The investigation of overlapping linkages has been an important issue in MBGAs that adopt linkage detection. Like some other existing test problems, OCP consists of sub-problems with overlapping linkages. Nevertheless, unlike others, the bits used for fitness calculation in OCP are uniquely designed such that they depend on the pattern of the solution candidate. The experimental analysis shows that if the Hamming distance between two randomly generated solution candidates increases, the difference in the bits used for their fitness calculations increases. The analysis also shows that the Hamming distance between two solution candidates with the same or similar high fitness values is quite large and the bits used for the fitness calculation vary slightly even between two such good ones. These results suggest that at each search stage, the bits used for fitness calculation are not completely fixed and that the linkages are difficult to identify. Several state-of-the-art MBGAs are then tested on OCP. Empirical results suggest that OCP provides a new aspect of difficulty for MBGAs to correctly identify linkages and generate high-quality solutions, applying trial-and-error methods to existing ones is essential.},

It is usually achieved by providing explanations of the system&#39;s behavior. A prominent and intuitive type of explanations are counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations explain a behavior to the user by proposing actions-as changes to the input-that would cause a different (specified) behavior of the system. However, such explanation methods can be unstable with respect to small changes to the input-i.e. even a small change in the input can lead to huge or arbitrary changes in the output and of the explanation. This could be problematic for counterfactual explanations, as two similar individuals might get very different explanations. Even worse, if the recommended actions differ considerably in their complexity, one would consider such unstable (counterfactual) explanations as individually unfair. In this work, we formally and empirically study the robustness of counterfactual explanations in general, as well as under different models and different kinds of perturbations. Furthermore, we propose that plausible counterfactual explanations can be used instead of closest counterfactual explanations to improve the robustness and consequently the individual fairness of counterfactual explanations.},

This framework used records of animals raised and fattened at “El Rosario” farm, located at the municipality of Montería (Córdoba-Colombia), to identify the fattening process. The performance of four machine-learning techniques to identify the ideal weight from real data was compared. The algorithms used were Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), regression based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF). In addition, an outlier-detection process was performed to identify anomalous weights. In general, the results showed that the DT model was the one with the best performance with an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.4 kg.},

Besides the restrictions on feasible sequences, the valuation structures allow us to express further constraints on the formation of coalitions. We present a new dynamic-programming algorithm for the computation of sequences of feasible coalition structures and evaluate it on several scenarios. Although this is a hard problem, we show that constraints inspired by real-world applications reduce the size of the search space significantly.},

  abstract  = {The most widely used method to prevent adversaries from eavesdropping on sensitive sensor, robot, and war fighter communications is mathematically strong cryptographic algorithms. However, prevailing cryptographic protocol mandates are often made without consideration of resource constraints of devices in the internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT). In this article, we address the challenges of IoBT sensor data exchange in contested environments. Battlefield IoT (Internet of Things) devices need to exchange data and receive feedback from other devices such as tanks and command and control infrastructure for analysis, tracking, and real-time engagement. Since data in IoBT systems may be massive or sparse, we introduced a machine learning classifier to determine what type of data to transmit under what conditions. We compared Support Vector Machine, Bayes Point Match, Boosted Decision Trees, Decision Forests, and Decision Jungles on their abilities to recommend the optimal confidentiality preserving data and transmission path considering dynamic threats. We created a synthesized dataset that simulates platoon maneuvers and IED detection components. We found Decision Jungles to produce the most accurate results while requiring the least resources during training to produce those results. We also introduced the JointField blockchain network for joint and allied force data sharing. With our classifier, strategists, and system designers will be able to enable adaptive responses to threats while engaged in real-time field conflict.},

  abstract  = {Domain-dependent expertise knowledge and high-level abstractions to arbitrate between different problem domains can be considered to be essential components of how human problem-solvers build experience and reuse it over the course of their lifetime. However, replicating it from an algorithmic point of view is a less trivial endeavor. Existing knowledge transfer methods in optimization largely fail to provide more specific guidance on specifying the similarity of different optimization problems and the nature of complementary experiences formed on them. A more rigorously grounded approach can be found alternatively in metalearning. This notion neglects any hurdles on characterizing problem similarity in favor of focusing instead on methodology to form domain-dependent inductive biases and mechanisms to arbitrate between them. In principle, we proposed within our previous research methods for constructing inductive biases and predict these from procedural optimization data. However, while we obtained effective methodology, it does not allow the joint construction of predictive components and biases in a cohesive manner. We therefore show in our following study, that improved configurations can be derived for the CMA-ES algorithm which can serve as inductive biases, and that predictors can be trained to recall them. Particularly noteworthy, this scenario allows the construction of predictive component and bias iteratively in a joint manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in a shape optimization scenario, in which the inductive bias is predicted through an operator configuration in a problem-specific manner during run-time.},

Among them, this study focuses on the feature selection method using the null importance. Through our preliminary experiments, we found that this feature selection method often fails to detect input variables that weakly affect the output. We should note that some practical feature selection tasks require to find all of the input variables that actually affect the output. In order to find even input variables that weakly affect the output, we thus modify the feature selection method using the null importance. Specifically, our method, what we call the feature selection method using the modified null importance, normalizes an importance score of each of the input variables by using those of random variables, and then uses the normalized score in order to determine whether or not the variable is relevant to the output. Through numerical experiments, we finally show that the modified method is capable of detecting even input variables that weakly affect the output.},

Machine learning (ML) is an infrastructure for operational cycle control and provides many approaches which provide more energy-efficient operation. One subfield of ML is Q-learning (QL), which forms the basis of the data-driven self-learning (DDSL) controller. The DDSL algorithm dynamically sets operational duty cycles according to estimates of future collected data values, leading to effective operation of power-aware systems. However, QL performs very poorly in stochastic environments as a result of overestimation of action values. The double estimator implemented in QL therefore applies Double QL (DQL) and forms the basis for a novel Double DDSL (DDDSL). The results of testing a DDDSL controller on historical data showed 42–50\% greater performance than a controller with a fixed duty-cycle, and 2–12\% more performance than a DDSL controller.},

This paper addresses deck building in a recently released CCG, Legends of Code and Magic. Our strategy is to evaluate cards by some scoring functions and then select cards into the deck accordingly. We adopt three types of scoring functions and use genetic algorithms (GA) to set proper values of parameters in the scoring functions. We checked the performance of the three versions of deck-building GAs against existing agents and found that scoring by card attributes is effective. We also analyzed the decks built by these algorithms and discussed their pros and cons.},

In order to achieve the goal, we modify the selection mechanisms, which usually enforce the selection of solutions with high quality. This can lead to duplicates in the mating pool. Using the modified tournament selection, we aim to enable the algorithm to select diverse solutions in sparse regions of the search space.

In disaster situations e.g., earthquakes, SHM systems enable early assessment of building safety and therefore ensure evacuation and prevention of human losses. In an urban area, multi-story constructions in congested areas become a hazard if their structural health is not well monitored and maintained properly. A key challenge is the ability to detect damages in an efficient manner for edge computing. In this work, we propose an SNN based low-cost, energy-efficient, and standalone damage classification model for SHM. The proposed classification model is implemented on FPGAs and results show a classification accuracy of 99.46\% on a sensory dataset for earthquake damage on a 7-Story concrete building.},

However, the color-oriented features of the nuclei vary widely depending on the dye and staining protocol employed and also the scanning system used to obtain the digital WSIs. Accordingly, the proposed lightweight network module attached to the front of an arbitrary network can provide a more robust segmentation performance irrespective of staining protocols employed and scanning circumstances.

To achieve scalability, we adopt the island model, commonly used in parallel evolutionary algorithms, to update and communicate multiple independent SA instances. For maximizing efficiency, the copy-on-write operator is used to avoid performance-expensive lock when different instances exchange solutions. For better local search ability, individual step sizes are dynamically adjusted and learned during decomposition. Furthermore, we utilize the shared memory to reduce data redundancy and support concurrent fitness evaluations for challenging problems with costly memory consumption. Experiments based on the powerful Ray distributed computing library empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our parallel version on a set of 2000-dimensional benchmark functions (especially each is rotated with a 2000*2000 orthogonal matrix). To the best of our knowledge, these rotated functions with a memory-expensive data matrix were not tested in all previous works which considered only much lower dimensions.

Simulation results for randomly generated continuous-time linear systems with different system orders demonstrate that the proposed HI approach can save CPU time up to 73\% and reduce the number of iterations to converge up to 98\% comparing with the VI approach.},

One main focus is the assessment of whether the models are robust with respect to the choice of data, and could possibly also be applied in a real-world scenario. XLM-RoBERTa outperforms the other models significantly, most likely due to its extensive pre-training and multi-head attention layers.

While this domain has produced state-of-the-art results for challenging problems like facial recognition, one major limitation is the complexity of training these techniques. Methods like pairwise and triplet learning require heavy micromanagement with respect to intelligent sampling. Furthermore, methods like center loss and SphereFace require precise parameter selection to consistently ensure algorithm convergence. Herein, we propose Contrastive Anchor Network (CAN), a deep neural network that uses stationary anchors to enforce feature separability. CAN does not require intelligent sampling, can be trained with minimum parameter tuning, and uses a generalization of contrastive learning as its objective function. Experiments provide insight to CAN through qualitative feature embeddings and quantitative performance on popular benchmark datasets.},

We assessed the performances of the proposed architecture on node classification tasks. To perform a fair comparison and present significant results, we re-implemented the competing methods from the literature and ran the experimental evaluation considering two different experimental settings with different model selection procedures. The proposed convolution, dubbed Simple Multi-resolution Gated GNN, exhibits state-of-the-art predictive performance on the considered benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy.

The 1D CNNs learn a representation and a discriminant directly from the raw audio signal. Several convolutional layers capture the time-frequency characteristics of the audio signal and learn various filters relevant to the music genre recognition task. The proposed approach splits the audio signal into overlapped segments using a sliding window to comply with the fixed-length input constraint of the 1D CNNs. As a result, music genre classification can be carried out on a single audio segment or on aggregating the predictions on several audio segments, which improves the final accuracy. The performance of the proposed 1D residual CNN is assessed on a public dataset of 1,000 audio clips. The experimental results have shown that it achieves 80.93\% of mean accuracy in classifying music genres and outperforms other 1D CNN architectures.},

Being able to learn correlations or causalities enables the system to predict what future events may occur based on the currently observed events, or to know what actions can be taken to effect future consequences. This is useful for prediction and problem solving processes that are very important aspects of intelligent capabilities. However, the purported correlations or causalities are often accompanied by unrelated noisy events. The noise can intervene between the relevant events, and are termed diachronic causal or correlational noise. The noise can also occur concomitantly with the events of interest, and are termed simultaneous causal or correlational noise. While there has been previous work that addresses the issue of diachronic causal or correlational noise, simultaneous causal or correlational noise, especially in a symbolic rule learning process, has not been adequately addressed. This paper presents an algorithm to remove simultaneous causal noise in order to recover the correct causal rules involved. The same method can also be applied to a correlational situation.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning has been widely used in many applications (e.g., self-driving cars, games, and robots). However, it is not very efficient when there are many actions and states. Thus, many researchers have applied Deep learning to it and call it Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address such a drawback. Unfortunately, recently, some researchers discovered a weakness of Deep learning in the test time and called it an adversarial attack. Since DRL is also Deep learning, it has the same weakness. Hence, DRL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Moreover, some existing works have created adversarial attacks for DRL. Generally, they first decide whether to create an adversarial example for the current state and then determine how much perturbation to add to the current state. This limits the adversary from the information in the previous steps when determining the perturbation. Also, some of the attacks fixed the adversarial action to the worst action, and then, the behavior of the target agent did not look natural. Therefore, we propose combining those two problems into one problem to allow the adversary to receive the information from the previous steps and let the adversary pick an adversarial action that is worth adding the perturbation by formulating and optimizing the problem. At last, we construct the experiment on Atari games to investigate the behavior of the agent attacked by our approach and compare our approach to the state-of-the-art attacks in terms of the amount of added perturbation and reward. As a result, our approach can make an agent play the games as if there was no adversarial attack and outperform the previous works.},

Unfortunately, FL is also vulnerable to attacks including parameter/data poisoning attacks. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of the data poisoning attack on this training method with a label-flipping attack. We propose a poisoning attack mitigation technique based on the reputation of nodes&#39; involved in the training process. The reputation score for each client is calculated using the beta probability distribution method. This is the first work to show the removal of malicious nodes with the poisoned dataset from the training environment based on the calculated reputation score. The improvement in model performance after filtering malicious nodes is validated using the benchmark MNIST dataset. At the same time, our work contributes to preventing denial of service attacks by considering a blockchain-based server network. Our results hold for two different attack settings with different proportions of poisoned data samples.},

  abstract  = {Linear layouts are a graph visualization method that can be used to capture an entry pattern in an adjacency matrix of a given graph. By reordering the node indices of the original adjacency matrix, linear layouts provide knowledge of latent graph structures. Conventional linear layout methods commonly aim to find an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given matrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features to use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always available. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven feature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix is preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called DeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a two-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and it cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used for reordering both rows and columns), owing to the characteristics of its model architecture. In this study, we extend DeepTMR and propose a new one-mode linear layout method referred to as AutoLL. We developed two types of neural network models, AutoLL-D and AutoLL-U, for reordering directed and undirected networks, respectively. To perform one-mode reordering, these AutoLL models have specific encoder architectures, which extract node features from an observed adjacency matrix. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed approach, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

It has become clear that measuring the effectiveness of on-line tutoring, especially on low-income students, is much needed in such difficult times. This paper, which is based on observational data collected before the COVID-19 era, is targeting measuring the impact of a web-based math tutoring program, Noon Academy, on the academic achievement of low-income high school students (grades 10 to 12) in Saudi Arabia. We use a large amount of data collected in a student registration process and two Bayesian generalized linear models (GLM) to measure the tutoring causal effects. Model 1 uses a binomial logistic regression to predict the impact of enrolling in the tutoring program on the rate of passing in a number of students. Model 2 uses a multi-level Beta regression to measure the impact of the number of minutes on the total mark. Model 1 results show that giving math tutoring to higher-failing-risk students significantly improves the rate of passing by +5\%, reaching a maximum of + 17.15\% in some classes of students. Model 2 shows a significant positive impact of the number of tutoring minutes on the yearly math mark (max of 100), reaching an average of +3.52 marks for the highest number of minutes taken. The paper presents an application of a causal analysis approaches on a real-life social problem. It demonstrates how the model is used to obtain a measure of the impact with quantifiable uncertainty that can be used in practice.},

In the present study, we used an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to produce spiking neural systems that emulate the patterns of behavior of biological neurons in vitro. The aim of this approach was to develop a method of producing models capable of exhibiting complex behavior that may be suitable for use as computational substrates. Our models were able to produce a level of network-wide synchrony and showed a range of behaviors depending on the target data used for their evolution, which was from a range of neuronal culture densities and maturities. The genomes of the top-performing models indicate the excitability and density of connections in the model play an important role in determining the complexity of the produced activity.},

  abstract  = {In automotive digital development, engineers utilize multiple virtual prototyping tools to design and assess the performance of 3D shapes. However, accurate performance simulations are computationally expensive and time-consuming, which may be prohibitive for design optimization tasks. To address this challenge, we envision a 3D design assistance system for design exploration with performance assessment in the automotive domain. Recent advances in deep learning methods for learning geometric data are a promising step towards realizing such systems. Deep learning-based (variational) autoencoder models have been used for learning and compressing 3D data allowing engineers to generate low-dimensional representations of 3D designs. Finding representations in a data-driven fashion results in representations that are agnostic to downstream tasks performed on these representations and are believed to capture relevant design features. In this paper, we evaluate whether such data-driven representations contain relevant information about the input data and whether representations are meaningful in performance prediction tasks for the input data. We use machine learning-based surrogate models to predict the performances of car shapes based on the low-dimensional representation learned by 3D point cloud (variational) autoencoders. Furthermore, we exploit the stochastic nature of the representation learned by variational autoencoders to augment the training data for our surrogate models, since the limited amount of data is usually a challenge for surrogate modeling in engineering. We demonstrate that augmenting training with generated shapes improves prediction accuracy. In sum, we find that geometric deep learning approaches offer powerful tools to support the engineering design process.},

  abstract  = {Users interacting with a system through UI are typically obliged to perform their actions in a pre-determined order, to successfully achieve certain functional goals. However, such obligations are often not followed strictly by users, which may lead to the violation to security properties, especially in security-critical systems. To improve the security with the awareness of unexpected user behaviors, a system can be redesigned to a more robust one by changing the order of actions in its specification. Meanwhile, we anticipate that the functionalities would remain consistent following the modifications. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to automatically produce specification revisions tackling the attack scenarios caused by weakened user obligations. By our algorithm, all the revisions would be generated to maintain the integrity of the functionalities using a novel recomposition approach. Then, the eligible revisions that can satisfy the security requirements would be efficiently spotted by a hybrid approach combining model checking and machine learning techniques. We evaluate our algorithm by comparing its performance with a state-of-the-art approach regarding their coverage and searching speed of the desirable revisions.},

  abstract  = {Current context-aware computing still lacks good representation models, particularly in modeling for proactive decision making in the era of Ubiquitous Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), To mitigate this issue, we proposed a state-based model of context in our prior research. Based on the model, we introduced Context State Machines (CSM) for simulating state changes of context attribute, situation, and context, which imply contextual behaviors that are often overlooked while very important to context reasoning and system decisions. This research applies CSMs to a real-world context-aware problem from the literature: a smart elevator control system. We introduce the design and implementation of a CSM engine, evaluate the CSM engine by utilizing two context-aware scenarios of the smart elevator, and show that the model can help automatically capture and reason the context without the inference from the developers. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time in the literature about applying the state-based context modeling approach and the CSM engine to a real-world context-aware application.},

  abstract  = {Cyber adversaries continuously seek new ways to penetrate security systems and infect computer infrastructure. The past decade has witnessed a sharp increase in attacks targeting Domain Name Server (DNS) systems used to store information about the domain names and their corresponding IP addresses (zone file). Therefore, preventing these require a new method for attacks and their strategies. Researchers suggest that appropriate remedial actions against cyber attacks can be attained by detailed investigation about the environment of digital systems. Although initially cited as a solution to attacks such as DNS spoofing and DNS tunneling, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has introduced novel privacy challenges. Therefore, this paper contributes to the investigation of machine learning models as solutions to DNS tunneling and DoH security issues. Thus, focusing to determine how well the classifiers can distinguish between DNS tunneling types using different machine learning models which are frequently used among other researchers. The CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 data set is used for the experiments of ML models. The obtained results confirm that applying the classifiers to generate the models are good choices to detect DNS tunnelings of DNS attacks on DoH traffic. The efficacy of these models&#39; performance was evaluated by measuring the precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix.},

  abstract  = {The significant increase in the computation and parameter storage costs of CNNs promotes its development in various applications and restricts its deployment in edge devices as well. Therefore, many neural network pruning methods has been proposed for neural network compression and acceleration. However, there are two major limitations to these methods: First, prevailing methods usually design single pruning criteria for the primitive network and fail to consider the diversity of potential optimal sub-network structure. Second, these methods utilize traditional training method to train the sub-network, which is not enough to develop the expression ability of the sub-network under the current task. In this paper, we propose Model Selection - Knowledge Distillation (MS-KD) framework to solve the above problems. Specifically, we develop multiple pruning criteria for the primitive network, and the potential optimal structure is obtained through model selection. Furthermore, instead of traditional training methods, we use knowledge distillation to train the learned sub-network and make full use of the structure advantages of the sub-network.To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on prevalent image classification datasets. The results demonstrate that our MS-KD framework outperforms the existing methods under a wide range of data sets, models, and inference costs.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, a robot is required to perform autonomously in complex environment. Some researchers use reinforcement learning that learns actions autonomously according to environment. Reinforcement learning requires exploratory actions, but in conventional reinforcement learning it was random. Random exploratory actions are inefficient and takes a lot of time to learn. To prevent inefficient exploratory actions, we proposed a method that uses Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning system (HMARL) in previous research. HMARL enables efficient exploratory actions by using multiple agents with heterogeneous learning spaces. HMARL system is a system that performs exploratory actions using the learning of multiple agents. In addition, HMARL needs an index that autonomously selects an agent from among all the agents inside heterogeneous learning space. We propose a method to select an agent using the degree of convergence of the learning of the agents in HMARL based on the TD errors. As a result, efficient exploratory actions by multiple agents with different learning spaces was achieved. Then, experiment to compare the proposed method and the method of previous research was conducted. From experimental results, the usefulness of the proposed method has been demonstrated.},

This technique takes advantage of the notion that maritime articles tend to include many precise dates and achieves an F1-score of 0.82 on a dataset of 52 articles. The second technique extracts the names and types of ships involved in a maritime incident using a combination of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and database lookups; an F1-score of 0.89 is achieved. The third and final technique determines the incident type, the severity of the incident, the response taken by the victim, and the eventual impact of this response. To determine these details, five binary classification models were trained and tested. The overall best algorithm was gradient boosting via the CatBoost library, which achieved an average accuracy of 91\%.},

Here, an end-effector design with a spiral-curve tooth is presented, which can contain strawberries in a spherical shell before pulling them away from their stems. Visual feedback with a camera-in-hand configuration is used to identify strawberries of sufficient size and ripeness. A two-step estimation and control approach is proposed including aligning the end-effector with the target strawberries in the $X$ and $Y$ directions and then reaching them along the $Z$ direction. Specifically, the control logic is designed to correct the depth error based on the changing rate of a strawberry diameter in the pixel frame. The unique feature of this approach is that it can precisely move the end-effector to the desired position regardless of the initial depth and size of the target. The end-effector, XYZ table, and control algorithm were extensively tested in an artificial strawberry bed and also partially experimented in a commercial farm.},

The location and output variables of FACTS might be expressed as binary and conditions variables, respectively. Thus, the mathematical formulation results in one of mixed integer nonlinear programming problems. This paper proposes a new method that makes use of two-stage Brain Storm Optimization (TSBSO) as evolutional computation. The goal of optimization is to minimize a margin to the nose point of the PV /QV -curve of the continuation power flow calculation. As a practical optimization method, the idea of Robust Optimization is introduced into TSBSO to consider uncertainties in power systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in the IEEE 30-node system.},

  abstract  = {Recently, it has been demonstrated that evolution strategies (ES), a class of blackbox optimization algorithms, can achieve competitive performance on many reinformance learning (RL) tasks, compared to deep RL algorithms. However, ES can be seen as a randomized local search algorithm based on stochastic finite difference and it is often hard to escape from deep or deceptive local optimum, which means that its exploration ability can be further improved. Brain storm optimization (BSO) is a swarm intelligence algorithm with tradeoff between exploration and exploitation via clustering. To enjoy best of both worlds, this paper proposes a hybrid direct policy search algorithm (BSO-ES) for RL tasks within a distributed computing framework. Specifically, we use BSO as a global searcher to explore the parameter space and ES as a local searcher to further fine-tune policies. We maintain multiple parallel policies at the same time and exchange preferable policies periodically. Experimental results on six challenging continuous control tasks from MuJoCo show that our proposed algorithm is superior to or competitive with OpenAI-ES. In particular, our algorithm has less failures to reach a fixed reward threshold.},

Subsequently, based on the analysis result, we implemented a simple algorithm to classify the interviewer&#39;s utterance into “question” and others. Second, to quantify a part of the communication skills of the interviewer, we proposed a method to detect the interviewer&#39;s nod from a camera. Finally, the voice dialog system and nodding detection method were evaluated through a medical interview experiment with medical students. As a result, the voice dialog system can correctly classify most interviewer utterances. Nodding detection could reduce the false detection of head movements during utterances by excluding the section of the interviewer&#39;s speech activity from the target section.

However, we have found that the clusters formed are not sufficiently discriminatory for micro-segmentation. In a novel approach, we extract temporal features with continuous values from the hidden states of neural networks predicting customers&#39; spending personality from their financial transactions. We consider both temporal and non-sequential models, using long short-term memory (LSTM) and feed-forward neural networks, respectively. We found that recurrent neural networks produce micro-segments where feed-forward networks produce only coarse segments. Finally, we show that classification using these extracted features performs at least as well as bespoke models on two common metrics, namely loan default rate and customer liquidity index.},

  abstract  = {The principles of reinforcement learning present a normative account, firmly related to neuroscience and psychological viewpoints on how animals or humans survive and find their optimal state-action values of an environment. In order to use reinforcement learning successfully in conditions approaching real-world application complexity, however, agents are confronted with a challenging task: they need to obtain correct information of the environment from various kinds of sensors and manage these to generate optimal state-action values from past experience to new conditions and also for long-term survival. Several dedicated approaches have been developed to improve reinforcement learning performances-DQN, Double DQN, SARSA name a few. Since reinforcement learning tasks require maximizing a reward function for the long term, we consider them as challenging optimization problems. Therefore, we use deep Q-network (DQN) that can solve many challenging classic Atari games and robotics problem. However, DQN with BP usually spend a long time to train and difficult to get convergence in short time training. In this paper, we optimize DQN with Genetic Algorithms (GA) for several applications problems. We also provide comparison results between DQN with GA and traditional DQN to show how efficient this method compared to traditional method. The results demonstrate that DQN with GA has better results on each reinforcement learning problem.},

  abstract  = {The problem of extracting information from large volumes of unstructured documents is pervasive in the domain of financial business. Enterprises and investors need automatic methods that can extract information from these documents, particularly for indexing and efficiently retrieving information. To this end, we present a scalable end-to-end document processing system for indexing and information retrieval from large volumes of financial documents. While we show our system works for the use case of financial document processing, the entire system itself is agnostic of the document type and machine learning model type. Thus, it can be applied to any large-scale document processing task involving domain-specific extractors.},
