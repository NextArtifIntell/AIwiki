The field of gene expression data analysis has grown in the past few years from being purely data-centric to integrative, aiming at complementing micro-array analysis with data and knowl-edge from diverse available sources. Since then, it has been used for various science fields including drug discovery, identification of protein coded genes and phenotype prediction based on gene ex-pression. This paper presents an application of gene classification from gene sequence data using data mining and machine learning techniques. Our research&#39;s main goal is to compare different ma-chine learning approaches based on time of execution, and over-all efficiency by testing them on different micro-array datasets of gene sequence and determining the best approach for gene clas-sification. Eight different machine learning techniques have been tested on eleven different gene expression datasets. We also ap-ply feature selection method before we apply classification techniques on the gene expression datasets. The experimental results show that feature selection method improve the performance of the techniques on the gene expression datasets.

The heterogeneity of modern and legacy equipment calls for attention towards diverse network security measures.

These approaches lack the potential to identify unknown attacks. Machine learning has the prospective to address novel attack vectors. This paper systematically evaluates the efficacy of learning algorithms from different families for intrusion detection in IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. One-class SVM and k-Nearest Neighbour unsupervised learning models show small potential when being tested on the IEC 104 unseen dataset with Area Under the Curve score 0.64 and 0.59, in the same order; and Matthews Correlation Coefficient value 0.3 and 0.2, respectively.

The depth model applied to malware needs a huge number of samples for training. In order to solve this issue, we propose a method for generating malware family samples. We use the Grad-CAM algorithm to find the raw data representing malware features. A new sample is created by inserting them into section gaps and new sections in PE files.

In this study, we introduce simple frameworks for dimensional reduction task : Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and fusing two frameworks. The first one has a neuroscience foundation and the second one is from unsupervised machine learning. By conducting image classification task, we analyze the performance of each framework and potential for synergistic interactions between two frameworks for possible performance improvements. Our experimental outcomes demonstrate that standalone PCA performs the best in the most cases. However, properly integrated usage of fused framework achieves similar or better image classification accuracy with significantly decreased classification time than the standalone framework.},

  abstract  = {In machine vision, deep learning frameworks are getting more attractive to researchers owing to their accuracy and robustness for feature extraction. However, the uncertainty in data or model has an adversary impact on the prediction and limits the performance of deep learning. To address the problem associated with uncertainty, we propose a bidirectional self-rectifying network with Bayesian modelling (BSNBM) for feature detection. First, a set of branch networks is proposed, wherein the output of previous convolutional blocks is unified and concatenated to the current ones to reduce the visual impairment in the up/down-sampling stage, taking into account the overall information loss. Further, our framework is probabilistically based on Bayesian modelling using prior knowledge. In the Bayesian model, the weight of the learnable layers are converted into distribution functions. Such conversion aims to improve robustness against outliers and there fore alleviate the overfltting issue. The proposed technique is then applied to identify surface cracks of infrastructure such as roads, bridges or pavements. Extensive comparison with existing techniques is conducted on various datasets, subject to a number of evaluation criteria. Experiments on crack images, including those captured by unmanned aerial vehicles inspecting a monorail bridge, demonstrate the merits of the proposed BSNBM architecture over existing techniques for surface defect inspection. Additional tests on extensive applications show the scalability and robustness of this model for various image processing tasks.},

Specifically, a well-known deep learning model, i.e. Mask R-CNN, is first employed to detect and segment each human subject in an image. The extracted regional features from each segmented region are then passed to a revised Inception-ResNet-v2 model for posture recognition. In particular, the revised Inception-ResNet-v2 model shows great efficiency in deep feature extraction. Evaluated using human action data sets, the proposed hybrid model outperforms two other deep learning methods for posture classification. This two-stage process provides a fundamental step for future research, such as human recognition within a commercial environment.},

More specifically, this paper first analyzes the fuzzy OE-concept lattice proposed by Long and Xu, and points out that the so called “boundary region” cannot help in acquiring useful information for concepts. Based on this, the authors are motivated to dig deeper into this theory, and introducing a pair of “fuzzy boundary operators” for determining the “boundary region” of each concept. Furthermore, this paper redefines object-induced fuzzy three-way operator and fuzzy three-way inverse operator, and fuzzy OE-concept, and their properties are then discussed.

  abstract  = {To realize effective feature representation, this paper proposes a new complex networks (CNs)-based feature fusion scheme to recognize texture images. Specifically, we propose two feature extractors to detect the global and local features of texture images respectively. To capture the global features, we first map a texture image as an undirected graph based on pixel location and intensity, and three feature measurements are selected to further decipher the image features, which retains as much image information as possible. Next, given the original band images (BIs) and the generated feature images, we encode them using local binary patterns (LBPs). Thus, the global feature vector is obtained by concatenating four spatial histograms. To decipher the local features, we jointly transfer and fine-tune a pre-trained VGGNet-16 model. After then, we fuse the middle outputs of max-pooling layers (MPs) and generate the local feature vector based on a global average pooling layer (GAP). Finally, the global and local feature vectors are connected to form the final feature representation of texture images. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical descriptors and several deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models.},

In this paper, we contribute methodologically in multicriteria ranking approach when universities and their evaluations are ready. Through incorporating subjective preferences and objective values, our proposed two-stage skyline superiority and inferiority ranking (SIR) approach relies on relative (rather than absolute) differences of evaluation values. This approach uncovers unique values of those distinctive universities that should have been judged more fairly. We deliberate a comparable analysis based on the prevailing The Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) University Rankings of 2020. Our empirical studies uncover problematic issues in criteria systems of these prevailing university rankings, which are worth pondering on.},

We propose a novel network model which extracts features from the CT images with 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and predicts the brain development age with fully-connected layers. Its performance was evaluated using 60 normally developing newborns between the ages of 0 and 3 years.

Current interpretable word embedding models, however, merely focus on the textual information of the words instead of the multimodalities. In line with the cognition principle, we establish a sparse variational autoencoder, which exploits both the textual and visual information to generate interpretable word embedding. Experiments are conducted to verify the interpretability of word embeddings together with their performance in downstream tasks. Comparing to the state-of-arts, experimental results indicate that the proposed interpretable word embeddings not only effectively increase the interpretability, but also obtain better result in most downstream tasks.},

The recent proliferation of unabated botnet activity has necessitated the investigation of novel botnet detection strategies. In this paper, we introduce BiSAGE; a graph-based machine learning technique capable of detecting the compromised hosts (bot victims) operating on a network. The advantage of our approach is that a bot victim can be detected not only through its actions but also through the actions of the devices it communicates with; an intrinsic characteristic of botnet activity. We provide an empirical evaluation of BiSAGE on CSE-CIC-IDS2018; a comprehensive dataset for evaluating intrusion detection systems. We show that BiSAGE is able to accurately identify bot victims without requiring any labelled samples of botnet activity.},

Notably, the multi-granularity model for continuous parameters has also been attracted extensive attention. Based on such a model, it is often necessary to consider multiple granularities to evaluate the significance of candidate condition attributes in solving problems oriented to attribute reduction, which may lead to high time consumption. In view of this, one acceleration algorithm based on multi-granularity attribute reduction (MGAR) for continuous parameters is designed to decrease the time consumption of acquiring reduct. In fact, the acceleration method we proposed is on the basis of the thinking of positive approximation. Specifically, the iterations of evaluating and selecting condition attributes are carried out on the progressively decreased universe instead of the entire sample space. The experimental results over 10 UCI datasets show that the acceleration algorithm not only can effectively accelerate the process of searching reduct, but also can generate the same reduct with traditional approach.},

The intuitionistic fuzzy sets introduced by Atanassov consider both the degrees of membership (belonging to) and the degrees of non-membership (not belonging to). The first contribution of this pa-per is to define the interval type 2 intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IT2IFS). Such kinds of mathematical functionals can be mapped to the lin-guistic judgments of the MCDM problems. The second contribution is to develop the IT2IFS ranking methodology based on the general graded mean integration representation (GGMIR). Such expressions can be directly utilized in MCDM problems involving IT2IFS criteria weights as well as IT2IFS alternative rates to prioritize alternatives. A numerical example of the MCDM with IT2IFS is performed for demonstrating the proposed methodology.},

However, singer-layer NMF cannot capture the latent hierarchical structure features from images, while deep features play more important roles in the image representation and recognition tasks. To overcome the limitation of NMF, this paper proposes a novel deep grouped NMF (DGNMF) approach to learn different level attributes of the data. It is interesting that DGNMF approach automatically makes the data from distinct classes share different basis images and the feature vectors among different classes are mutually orthogonal at the same layer. Meanwhile, to preserve the local information, our DGNMF model establishes the objective function with graph regularization, and its optimization problem is solved using gradient descent method. The developed DGNMF algorithm is proved to be convergent and is finally evaluated on face datasets for classification. Compared with some state-of-the-art deep NMF variants, the results demonstrate the proposed DGNMF algorithm achieves surpassing performances using different layer features.},

First, the CDE-SSA algorithm is designed on the basis of the sparrow algorithm, and the chaos theory is integrated into the sparrow algorithm to establish the chaotic sparrow algorithm model for the shortcomings of the poor global search ability and unstable initialized sparrow distribution of the sparrow algorithm. To address the shortcomings of the way of discoverer position update in the algorithm, a new variational operator is used instead of the original one to improve the practicality of the algorithm. In order to balance the global search ability and local search ability in the first and second stages of the algorithm, the cosine factor is introduced to improve the proportional operator in the sparrow algorithm, and the information of the number of iterations is introduced into the iterative process. The performance of CDE-SSA algorithm is compared with PSO algorithm and SSA algorithm by testing functions, and the results show that CDE-SSA algorithm shows better performance in terms of search accuracy and search stability. Meanwhile, the CDE-SSA algorithm is used to optimize the LSSVM parameters and build the KPCA-CDE-SSA-LSSVM anomaly detection model, which is applied to the main steam temperature system anomaly detection scenario, and the detection accuracy reaches 98\%, which proves the rationality of the algorithm proposed in this paper.},

However, the sheer number and diversity of devices that comprise most modern networks has vastly increased the complexity of per-forming this management. Motivated by these issues, we exam-ine the application of affiliation graphs to quantify the relation-ship between devices operating on a network and the services for which they connect to via the internet. These relationships can then be used to identify clusters of devices which exhibit similar behavioural characteristics. Through empirical analysis of two 26-hour captures of a uni-versity campus network, we show that affiliation graphs can be utilised to cluster the devices on a network without any a priori knowledge of the network itself. In particular, our preliminary re-sults show that devices can be clustered into specific device types (e.g., servers, user devices, and printers). These clusters can then be used to examine the composition of devices on the network, cre-ate informed device management policies, and identify potentially vulnerable devices.},

The intracerebral hematoma (ICH) is difficult and time-consuming to interpret even for specialists, so an automated method for extracting ICH regions from brain computed-tomography (CT) images is needed to reduce the burden on physicians and improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis. Because the ICH shows high-absorption in CT images, most of conventional methods segment the high-absorption regions. However, the high-absorption region includes hemorrhagic region such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage. These are not ICH. In this study, we propose an automatic extraction method for ICH regions from brain CT images, and the proposed method aims to reduce the over-extraction of high-absorption regions. The proposed method focuses on the anatomical structure of ICH, extracts the high-absorption regions, and proposes a hierarchical method based on classification using convolutional neural network (CNN). The model was trained and evaluated on 33 subjects, and over-extraction was reduced by 82\% (specificity) compared to the test data. However, the recall was 36\%, and further improvement is needed.},

To solve the data imbalance problem, the application of augmentation methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) is proposed.

  abstract  = {Becoming a super-aging society, fragility fracture of the pelvis (FFP) with osteoporosis is a common disease. However, it is hard to find FFP in CT images because of the numerous images and tiny appearance of FFP. This paper proposes a novel method, which is called boring survey based fracture detection (BSFD), to automatically detect FFP in 3D CT images. FFP appears as a tiny crack of the bone that is hard to find by surface observation. Thus, BSFD surveys the FFP by boring from the pelvic surface. It first segments the pelvic bone region from CT images. At every surface point, it bores a small quadrangular prism whose center is the point of interest. The prism is composed of voxels with CT values and is feed to a 3D convolutional neural network which predicts a probability of fracture. The proposed method was evaluated by using 110 elderly subjects with pelvic fractures. The AUC was 0.84 for training subjects and 0.77 for evaluation subjects. In addition, 3D visualization of fracture probability superimposed on the pelvic bone surface is provided for qualitative evaluation and supporting FFP diagnosis by physicians. The boring survey approach will be effective to detect FFP because the bored volume extracts the unique characteristics of tiny fractures in CT images.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes the degree of bone healing by ultrasonic waves for the facture treatment. We employ the frequency components of reflected wave from the bone of rats. This study made a hall in the middle of the thighbone of rat to mimic bone fracture. First, in order to gain frequency response characteristic, we apply Fast Fourier Transform to a reflected wave. We obtained the frequency feature by cross spectrum for the each. Second, we calculate a degree of bone healing by comparing these and Bone Mineral Density (BMD), here, we form pseudo individuals by clustering similar BMD. Finally, we determine the degree of healing process for each individual.},
