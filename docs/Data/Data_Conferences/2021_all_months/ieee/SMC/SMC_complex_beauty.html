  abstract  = {The stability of a humanoid robot is the base of other complex gestures in different and complicated tasks. Each gesture for different joints needs many controllers. To address the outputs from different controller, an adaptive coordinator for multi-variable controller via dynamic basic belief assignment strategy is proposed in this work. The planar inverted pendulum (PIP) platform, which is a very typical, simplify, cheap and an effective system for verification of a multi-variable controller, can generally imitate the stability of a robot as a whole. For each axis of PIP, there are two control variables. One is the angle of the rod, and the other is the displacement for the base cart. We propose an adaptive coordinator for the fuzzy controller in each axis to construct the final output value of control variable from the only motor in different axes. The adaptive coordinator has a dynamic value represented as the belief degree in the framework of belief functions. For different control areas and moment, the coordinator has an adaptive and dynamic basic belief assignment for the corresponding controller. The control strategy for controller design is based on classical and efficient fuzzy control. Simulation experiment verifies the rationality of the adaptive coordinator as well as the effectiveness of the multi-variable controller.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel hierarchical coding scheme for light fields based on transmittance patterns of low-rank multiplicative layers and Fourier disparity layers. The proposed scheme learns stacked multiplicative layers from subsets of light field views determined from different scanning orders. The multiplicative layers are optimized using a fast data-driven convolutional neural network (CNN). The essential factor for multiplicative layers representation, which has not been considered in previous compression approaches, is the origin of redundancy, i.e., the low-rank structure of light field data. The spatial correlation in layer patterns is exploited with varying low ranks through factorization derived from singular value decomposition on a Krylov subspace. Further, encoding with HEVC efficiently removes intra-view and inter-view correlation in low-rank approximated layers. The initial subset of approximated decoded views from multiplicative representation is used to construct Fourier disparity layer (FDL) representation. The FDL model synthesizes the second subset of views identified by a pre-defined hierarchical prediction order. The correlations between the prediction residue of synthesized views are further eliminated by encoding the residual signal. The set of views obtained from decoding the residual is employed to refine the FDL model and predict the next view subsets with improved accuracy. This hierarchical procedure is repeated until all light field views are encoded. The critical advantage of the proposed hybrid layered representation and coding scheme is that it utilizes not just spatial and temporal redundancies but efficiently exploits the strong intrinsic similarities among neighboring sub-aperture images in both horizontal and vertical directions as specified by different predication orders. Besides, the scheme is flexible to realize a range of multiple bitrates at the decoder within a single integrated system. The compression performance analyzed with real light field shows substantial bitrate savings, maintaining good reconstruction quality.},

Our system is capable of producing dense high-fidelity reconstructions of objects by simultaneously tracking and reconstructing their incrementally improving 3D geometry in a sequence of frames captured by a depth-enabled camera setup. In this process, no external information about the object motion is required as long as the camera is stationary. This is accomplished by removing irrelevant scene elements such as the background or the operator hands holding the object to track and fuse its shape over time only using pixels associated with the object mask. Previous approaches either target static scene reconstruction therefore ignoring dynamic elements, or they make strong assumptions about the scanning platform or required scanning sessions. In contrast, we propose a fast and flexible scanning method similar to how humans visually inspect objects, enabling users to easily acquire a true-to-scale 3D CAD models ready for use in other computer vision tasks such as object tracking or pose estimation. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on a real-world dataset and quantitatively analyze the resulting reconstruction accuracy. Demo is available at github.com/4ri4Slr/3DCADFusion},

Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this process focuses on observing a reference movement policy and its adaptation to a robot with a similar body scheme. In the humanoid robots domain, the massive availability of videos on the internet holds the potential to provide reference movements for virtually any task performed by humans. However, 3D pose estimation algorithms based on videos are currently subject to failure due to several practical situations (poor image framing, low video quality, joints occlusions and mismatch, and so on) and typically require applying a complex methodology. This paper presents SoccerKicks, a new dataset that provides 3D reference movements of humans performing dead ball kicks (penalty and foul) obtained from reference videos suitable for use in the robotics soccer domain. In this work we describe: i) the methodology adopted for the videos selection; ii) the algorithms chosen to perform the 2D and 3D pose estimation based on the videos; iii) the evaluation of the algorithms performance; iv) the annotation on these videos and the reference movements provided.

Single image depth estimation has improved drastically in recent years due to the development of DNNs. However, vulnerabilities of DNNs for image classification have been revealed by adversarial attacks, and DNNs for monocular depth estimation could contain similar vulnerabilities. Therefore, research on vulnerabilities of DNNs for monocular depth estimation has spread rapidly; however, many of them assume white-box conditions where inside information of DNNs is available or are transferability-based black-box attacks that require a substitute DNN model and a training dataset. Utilizing Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, the proposed method in this paper analyzes DNNs under the black-box condition where only output depth maps are available. In addition, the proposed method does not require a substitute DNN that has a similar architecture to the target DNN nor any knowledge about training data used to train the target model. Experimental results showed that the proposed method succeeded in attacking two DNN-based methods trained with indoor and outdoor scenes, respectively.},

The proposed algorithm shows high performance for discovering high-fidelity control protocols and for converging to a good policy, compared with standard DQL. The proposed modifications enhance the exploration-exploitation ability for DQL agent and the robustness for solving quantum control problem with high-fidelity at different numbers of control steps.

Since the launch of the IBM Quantum Experience project in 2016, the research activities in this area are strongly increased. This project provides the public access to quantum processors composed of superconducting physical computing elements known as qubits. Unfortunately, qubits are sensitive to noise and, for this reason, quantum computation can be affected by errors. As a consequence, there is a strong emergence for so- called quantum error mitigation methods aimed to attenuate the quantum error as much as possible, without requiring a strong additional computational effort. Among the most error- prone operations, there is surely the quantum measurement. Conventionally, mitigation methods for quantum measurement error compute a so-called mitigation matrix capable of correcting results outputted by a quantum processor. In this paper, a new measurement error mitigation approach based on genetic algorithms whose fitness function uses Bhattacharyya distance is proposed to learn an appropriate mitigation matrix. As shown in the experimental session, the proposed measurement error mitigation method outperforms the traditional approach.},

However, existing methods can not capture code’s long dependencies from AST for effective code summarization. In this paper, we provide a novel way to generate code summaries by combining a graph-based neural network and a Transformer-XL network. We utilize the graph-based neural network to better capture the structure information of AST, and the Transformer-XL network to learn important tokens in the AST and alleviate the problem of long dependency. We evaluate our technique on the standard Java dataset. The experimental results show that the effectiveness of our model is remarkable.

The uncertain decisions of experts are included to MARCOS method to express the uncertainties in human opinions, therefore, the single valued neutrosophic fuzzy numbers are preferred in terms of truth, indeterminacy and falsity membership.

  abstract  = {Market price and yield forecasting models for Fresh Produce (FP) are crucial to protect retailers and consumers from overpriced FP. However, utilizing the data for forecasting is obstructed by the occurrence of missing values. Therefore, it is imperative to impute the encountered missing instances to enable effective forecasting. Most of the work found in literature tackles imputation of missing values when they are randomly scattered in the dataset while very little work is found tackling both: consecutive occurrence of missing data, i.e. missing data chunks, as well as those randomly missing. In this work, the data used for forecasting has missing values in chunks as well as at random points. Therefore, various comprehensive imputation models are used to impute both random as well as chunks of missing values. Since the imputed time series are incomplete, the only way to evaluate those imputation models is to analyze their effect on forecasting performance. The ensemble of two compound deep learning (DL) models, namely Attention Convolutional Neural Networks Long Short Term Memory (Att-CNN-LSTM) and SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), is used for forecasting. For imputation, three DL models are tested: The Ensemble imputation model which is a Voting Regressor of two DL submodels, Residual GRU and LSTM-Deep-GRU. Another deep learning imputation model is used which is a Transfer Learning (TL) model. Finally, a Hybrid model of both DL models is designed to take the pros of each of its integrated models by using the Ensemble model in case of random missing data and the Transfer Learning model in case of missing data chunks. It is observed that, in general, imputing the missing values improves the forecasting result as compared to eliminating the instances with missing values. The Hybrid model improves the overall forecasting performance by up to 60\% compared to the case of using the second-best Transfer Learning model and around 64\% as compared to the case of imputation using the Ensemble model.},

Of many, radiographs and clinical records are reliable sources for viral infection investigation and treatment planning. Clinical records help track the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present a Spike Neural Network (SNN) with supervised synaptic learning to detect abnormalities in Chest X-rays (CXRs) In other words, the proposed SNN can distinguish Covid-19 positive cases from healthy ones. In our decision-making procedure, we introduce clinical practice so Explainable AI (XAI) is possible to carry out. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) provides reliable analysis of abnormalities in Covid-19 clinical data.},

Numerous BCIs have been developed to reconstruct different aspects of speech, such as phonemes and words, from brain activity. However, many challenges remain toward the successful reconstruction of continuous speech from brain activity during speech imagery. Here, we investigate the potential of differentiating speech and non-speech using intracranial brain activity in different frequency bands acquired by stereotactic EEG. The results reveal statistically significant information in the alpha and theta bands for detecting voice activity, and that using a combination of multiple frequency bands further improves performance with over 92\% accuracy. Furthermore, the model is causal and can be implemented with low-latency for future closed-loop experiments. These preliminary findings show the potential of cross-frequency brain signal features for detecting speech activity to enhance speech decoding and synthesis models.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is used for communication between humans and devices by recognizing humans’ status and intention. Communication between humans and a drone using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of the most challenging issues in the BCI domain. In particular, the control of drone swarms (the direction and formation) has more advantages compared to the control of a drone. The visual imagery (VI) paradigm is that subjects visually imagine specific objects or scenes. Reduction of the variability among subjects’ EEG signals is essential for practical BCI-based systems. In this study, we proposed the subepoch-wise feature encoder (SEFE) to improve the performances in the subject-independent tasks by using the VI dataset. This study is the first attempt to demonstrate the possibility of generalization among subjects in the VI-based BCI. We used the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation for evaluating the performances. We obtained higher performances when including our proposed module than excluding our proposed module. The DeepConvNet with SEFE showed the highest performance of 0.72 among six different decoding models. Hence, we demonstrated the feasibility of decoding the VI dataset in the subject-independent task with robust performances by using our proposed module.},

The experiment was divided into three kinds of playing modes, single-player, cooperative, and competitive modes. In addition to behavioral performance estimation, the inter-brain synchrony between subjects was quantified by Phase Locking Value (PLV). Results showed that subjects&#39; reaction time in response to targets was the longest in the single-player mode and the shortest in the competitive mode. Additionally, the inter-brain EEG synchrony changed as the playing mode changed. Stronger inter-brain coupling between subjects has been found in cooperative and competitive modes compared to a single-player mode. The inter-brain synchrony reduced as the roles of subjects switched from a partner to a competitor.},

  abstract  = {Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), which uses blinking light stimulation to estimate the attending target, has been known as a communication technique with severe motor disabilities such as ALS and Locked-in-syndrome. Recently, it was reported that pupil diameter vibration based on pupillary light reflex has been observed in the attending target with a constant blinking frequency. This fact suggests the possibility of a noncontact BCI using pupillometers as alternatives to contacting scalp electrodes. In this study, we show an increment in the number of communication channels by stimulating both eyes alone or in combination with different frequencies. The number of selective targets becomes twice the number of frequencies using this method. Experiments are conducted by recruiting three healthy participants. We prepare six target patterns comprising three frequencies and detect the target using a coefficient of correlation of power spectrum between the pupil diameter and stimulus signal. Consequently, the average classification accuracy of the three participants of approximately 83.4\% is achieved. The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of noncontact BCI systems.},

We designed a scenario in which a ground controller had to guide his/her pilot to reach a location. We also implemented a Controller-Bot and a Pilot-Bot using AI techniques to behave like real human operators. The cooperation between controllers and pilots were either genuine (‘Coop scenarios’ – four missions), explicitly notified as pilot-Bot and controller-Bot interactions (‘No coop scenarios’ – two missions), or with no notification that they were actually collaborating with their AI counterparts (‘fake coop scenarios’ – two missions). Sixteen participants (8 dyads) equipped with EEG and ECG took part in this experiment. Our findings disclosed that Human-Human dyads exhibited similar performance to Human-Bots dyads whether the human participants were aware that they were playing with a bot or not. Our participants declared that they did not realize they were playing with an AI in the fake cooperation condition. These findings indicate that 1) humans can be fooled by AI, and that 2) humans can behave in a natural way with AI. Interestingly enough, our analyses revealed that the cardiac activity of controllers and pilots was more synchronized when they were collaborating together than when they were playing with AI (being aware or not). Similarly, EEG analyses disclosed a higher cerebral efficiency and connectivity between the two brains when teammates were interacting together than when cooperating with AI.},

The holding stack in air traffic management is analyzed and simulated, two generic tasks are designed accordingly. The hybrid 2D-3D radar display settings are evaluated based on six indicators from eye-tracking and brain dynamics data, namely, the frequency of fixation, fixation mean duration, fixation time on an area of interest, emotion, workload, and stress. The results reveal that the hybrid 2D-3D radar display induces spatial memory loss and high workload, while requires a shorter fixation duration.},

Unity3D can visualize the virtual environment. Unity3D also provides a rich set of libraries and assets for user interaction. However, building a GIS requires a projection / coordinate system. Mapbox extension can provide georeferencing services for Unity3D. Mapbox also makes it possible to overlay vector layers in the same way as GIS software.

The glare effect describes a scenario in which sunlight shines onto the display, resulting in less distinguishable colors. For the detection of this obstacle one and two dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D convnets and 2D convnets) are utilized. The 1D convnet decides based on temporal sequences while the 2D convnet uses synthetic images created with those sequences. In order to increase the available training data a cognitive user simulator is used that implements a generative optimization algorithm to simulate behavioural data. Four ensemble-based systems are implemented, one each for 5, 10, 15 and 20 game rounds. The first two are based on 1D and the other two on 2D convnets. Each system consists of multiple models voting for the final prediction. The accuracies of these systems in the order of the number of rounds are 72.5\%, 82.5\%, 80\% and 85\%.},

This paper presents a BIST approach that detects open and short faults in communication media to demonstrate the fault-masking phenomenon. The phenomenon as the self-repairing mode of the communication media improves the yield and performance of the NoCs. Rigorous simulations are made on an 8×8 mesh NoC with faulty and repaired channels. Results reveal that allowing faults in communication tracks degrades the network performance up to 30\% while the self-repairing mode improves nearly 75\%.},

In this assessment, factors such as distance between nodes and different scattering factors (SF) were considered. In addition, the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the packet loss rate were analyzed.

  abstract  = {Fault diagnosis as a research hotspot in the field of prognostics and health management (PHM) has attracted the attention of academia and industry. Deep learning is widely used in academia due to its strong self-learning ability. However, as a &quot;black-box&quot; model, the features extracted by deep learning have poor interpretability which can’t be understood by IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a novel fault diagnosis method based on ensemble feature selection. We separately evaluate our method on the four-fault hydraulic components, which are derived from the real-world hydraulic time series data sets. The results show that compared with the deep learning method the proposed method can greatly reduce the complexity of the model without much reduction accuracy. Meanwhile, the balanced ensemble feature selection method we proposed is better than traditional ensemble methods such as union, intersection, and weighted linear aggregation. After testing, the method we proposed can be applied to the industrial IoT fault diagnosis.},

Bug localization tools can help developers to understand the relation between bug reports and a software system. However, most approaches for localizing bugs work with unstructured textual information from the source codes and bug reports. This paper proposes an approach for locating and visualizing bug reports based on class diagrams representing the overall structural design of a software system. Our approach called IdentiBug takes advantage of deep learning techniques to train our bug localization model to predict connections between a bug report and the system’s class diagram. The result is a ranked list of classes from which we extract and rank a list of class diagram excerpts for assisting the developers during bug documentation and localization.},

This paper, therefore, identifies concrete use cases for relevant processes in small- and medium sized enterprises (SME) in the service industry and enhances them with AI and IPA capabilities. Based on a prototype, the use cases were presented to 10 experts who were interviewed regarding their usefulness and influencing factors. Subsequently, the results of the interviews were categorized and validated again by a quantitative survey within the expert panel. As a result, the use cases were evaluated with regard to the specific influencing factors and the potential for optimization was determined. The use cases were evaluated based on this data. It was shown that IPA features in particular are perceived as useful. On average, AI and IPA features have a cost savings potential of over 31\%. This shows the importance of these features and the need to consider them when modeling modern business processes.},

The above deficiencies would not cater to the idea of Industry 4.0 well, making the cost of individualization products too high or the degree of individualization too low. In this paper, a customer highly involved dynamic demand-driven smart manufacturing mode and a mathematical model are presented for mass individualization production. Under this mode, customers can be prosumers, participating in the whole production process and proposing modifications. Meanwhile, multiple distributed idle productivity resources are employed with dynamic demand-driven manufacturing. In consequence of the mathematical model and algorithms, the multiple task allocation among multiple factories problem is solved, maximizing the total profit of available factories with high efficiency and low resource waste.

Then, the system explains to the user why each job-posting has been recommended to them. The proposed system uses a knowledge graph (KG) structure to model job-postings and user profiles in one homogeneous structure. Graph relations between the job-seekers and job-postings are mined through natural language processing (NLP) of the textual content from job-postings and user-profiles. Based on the graph structure itself and a customized named entity classifier, a human-readable explanation is generated for each recommendation and provided to the job-seeker. The explanation includes information about the matching factors that led the system to recommend a certain job-posting to the user. The proposed system is implemented and tested on a sample data-set of user profiles and job-postings from open online repositories.

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an end-to-end person re-identification method including pan-tilt-zoom camera control in a real-world environment containing many moving people. Person re-identification, which means consistently identifying the same person from images from multiple cameras, brings great benefits to many services such as real-time person search. However, re-identification in the real world has challenges such as uniqueness of appearance, image quality, lighting, and poses of person. We address these challenges in two ways. First, we use the face images for re-identification because the face is the most unique feature of a person. Second, to acquire high-resolution images for facial recognition, our approach utilizes camera zooming. On the other hand, the reduction of field of view by zooming decreases the number of probed people. This paper proposes a method that resolves this trade-off by selecting the probed person from many people in the environment. Although many prior works have focused on data analysis by assuming data are pre-given, the proposed method solves the joint problem of facial recognition and image acquisition. The method selects the probed person who is likely to generate effective images for improving the accuracy of re-identification on the basis of the recognition results and the resolution, quantity, and variation of collected images. Experiments using a video dataset showed that the proposed method increased the success rate of re-identification by 25\% compared with random selection.},

In this paper, we propose a two-stage fast and robust template matching method based on ring projection transformation and pseudo-Zernike moments, which can be used in automatic optical inspection. In the first stage, we use dynamic time warping to estimate the scaling factors and obtain the preliminary candidates according to the extracted ring projection vectors. And then the candidates of the multi objects are obtained by non-maximum suppression. In the second stage, the fine matching process based on pseudo-Zernike moments is performed. Besides, we apply the image pyramid search strategy to improve the computational efficiency. The rotation angle is estimated by the improved ring-shifted method. The experimental results show that the mean errors of rotation, scaling, and translation for the image with or without noise or illumination changes are less than 0.2412°, 0.0037, and 1.0826 pixels, respectively. Compared with the conventional search method, the image pyramid search strategy increases the computational efficiency by 50 times. The experiments of robustness demonstrate that the template matching method we proposed can still obtain high accuracy even in the case of noise or illumination changes. In addition, it can be used for multi objects detection.},

In order to solve the problems of manual calibration wasting manpower, manual reading is error-prone, and to improve the accuracy and robustness of automatic reading recognition of digital meters. In this paper, a deep learning-based reading recognition method of the digital multimeter is proposed. Firstly, the YOLO target detection method is used to extract the digital display area of multimeter. Then, the CNN classification method is used to identify 0~9 numbers, negative signs and blanks in the reading area. Simultaneously, the connected domain method is adopted to locate the decimal point based on its location characteristics. Finally, the complete reading information can be obtained by merging the reading recognition result and the decimal point positioning result. Experiments were conducted and the results shown that the overall characters recognition accuracy reaches 99.85\%. Besides, only one error occurred in the final test with an accuracy of 98\%. Meanwhile, this proposed method can adapt to various complex environments, and meet the real-time requirements.

  abstract  = {Fingerspelling in sign language has been the means of communicating technical terms and proper nouns when they do not have dedicated sign language gestures. Automatic recognition of fingerspelling can help resolve communication barriers when interacting with deaf people. The main challenges prevalent in fingerspelling recognition are the ambiguity in the gestures and strong articulation of the hands. The automatic recognition model should address high inter-class visual similarity and high intra-class variation in the gestures. Most of the existing research in fingerspelling recognition has focused on the dataset collected in a controlled environment. The recent collection of a large-scale annotated fingerspelling dataset in the wild, from social media and online platforms, captures the challenges in a real-world scenario. In this work, we propose a fine-grained visual attention mechanism using the Transformer model for the sequence-to-sequence prediction task in the wild dataset. The fine-grained attention is achieved by utilizing the change in motion of the video frames (optical flow) in sequential context-based attention along with a Transformer encoder model. The unsegmented continuous video dataset is jointly trained by balancing the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss and the maximum-entropy loss. The proposed approach can capture better fine-grained attention in a single iteration. Experiment evaluations show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.},

To handle the limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework termed as CSAGAN which contains a new discriminator structure, a novel attention module, and a new normalized function. The discriminator is an attention-guided feature pyramid discriminator which makes use of low-level and high-level features to determine an image’s realness. The new attention module integrating channel attention and spatial attention can guide generators focus on the most discriminative regions of feature maps to generate high-quality translated images. Moreover, our attention module embedded into generators requires less computation compared with other self-attention methods. In addition, the new normalized function helps generators limberly control the variation of shape, color, and texture through learning parameters. Experimental results indicate that our approach performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods.},

Therefore, a cost-effective equipment failure prediction technology is needed, such as a failure prediction model, which can detect highway equipment failures in time and reduce maintenance costs. In this paper, knowledge map technology is introduced to construct a highway equipment map, and a highway equipment fault prediction model based on the combination of semi-supervised Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed. This model is based on the GCN’s device network feature perception process, with the fault prediction of highway equipment, which uses GRU to extract the real-time features of the device. The initial values of parameters in GCN and GRU adopt Gaussian distribution and uniform distribution respectively. We apply our model to the problem of active maintenance of highway equipment, and have an experiment with the model using a real data set from a Chinese highway company. The results show that our model can effectively use equipment map information and real-time information, and effectively predict the fault of highway equipment only by partial samples, thereby saving fault response time and maintenance costs.},

Graph theory is a widely used framework for modeling such complex networks and to evaluate their robustness to disruptions. Particularly, identification of critical nodes/links in a graph can facilitate the enhancement of graph (system) robustness and characterize crucial factors of system performance. Most existing methods of critical node identification are based on an iterative approach that explores each node/link of a graph. These methods suffer from high computational complexity and the resulting analysis is network specific. Additionally, uncertainty associated with the underlying graphical model further limits the potential value of these traditional approaches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bayesian graph neural network based node classification framework that is computationally efficient and systematically incorporates uncertainties. Instead of utilizing the observed graph for training the model, a MAP estimate of the graph is computed based on the observed topology and node target labels. Further, a Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout algorithm is incorporated to account for the epistemic uncertainty. The fidelity and the gain in computational complexity offered by the Bayesian framework is illustrated using simulation results.},

In this paper, we propose the use of deep neural networks to learn sub-regions of the admissible state-space where replacing the strong solver with the weak solver maintains constraint satisfaction properties and does not result in a significant deterioration of performance.

Moreover, the importance of architecture alignment across the bi-level optimization may be underestimated.

  abstract  = {In recent years we have witnessed an increase in cyber threats and malicious software attacks on different platforms with important consequences to persons and businesses. It has become critical to find automated machine learning techniques to proactively defend against malware. Transformers, a category of attention-based deep learning techniques, have recently shown impressive results in solving different tasks mainly related to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we propose the use of a Transformers architecture to automatically detect malicious software. We propose MalBERT, a model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) which performs a static analysis on the source code of Android applications using preprocessed features to characterize existing malware and classify it into different representative malware categories. The obtained results are promising and show the high performance obtained by Transformer-based models for malicious software detection.},

  abstract  = {Currently, fleet management approaches only focus on the perspective of the fleet operating company and the operators, but not on the perspective of the manufacturer of the fleet members. The manufacturer aims at optimizing existing fleets and supporting the development process of future fleet generations. Furthermore, data-driven models have increasing importance in fleet applications. Thus, this paper proposes a concept for a holistic fleet management approach for manufacturers supporting the development process of future fleet generations and services. We build our concept on three layers, one for the manufacturer, the fleet operator, and the machines respectively. We also discuss interactions and information flow in between the layers. Thus, enabling manufacturers to integrate operational data of customers into the development process making the products and services more customer-oriented. Before launching data-driven fleet services extensive training data is required. However, when launching new fleets disadvantageously only little data is available. As solution, we discuss the transfer of machine learning models in between different fleets (inter-fleet transfer learning). This enables quickly launching reliable machine models for new fleets with a lack of data.},

In recent years, with the continuous improvement of computational complexity and the development of research on the deployment of neural networks on terminal devices, new neural network models suitable for terminal devices such as MobileNet, SqueezeNet and ShuffleNet have also appeared in CNN model. These network models have special structures or units to reduce the amount of calculation.the lightweight features of the model cannot take advantage of due to the lack of customized design for them when GPU is used for acceleration. The characteristics of FPGA such as customization and parallelism just meet the needs of research. However, there is a little research on implementing and optimizing new lightweight networks on FPGAs. In this paper, we optimize each part of the model based on FPGA, achieve 8bit quantification, and redesign depthwise separable convolution operation and channel shuffle module, which make the module can be operated in a hardware-friendly way. Under the premise of maintaining the original model structure and performance, we make full use of the abundant LUT, FF and other resources on the FPGA. we use HLS (high-level synthesis) to analyze the structure of the ShuffleNet V2 model on xilinxzynqxc-7Z045. Compared with the performance of the original model in CPU, GPU and FPGA, our design achieves the acceleration performance of 8.7x, 1.3x and 3.3x respectively, and the accuracy is only reduced by 0.8\%.

  abstract  = {Manufacturing processes in most of the industries involve complex interactions between its input processing parameters, such as, input materials and temperature, pressure, humidity, etc., in which their interdependence is highly complex and nonlinear. The physical properties of the output product, such as, hardness, tensile strength, etc., depend on these interactions. However, there may not have any exact analytical solution to determine the input process parameters for a given physical property of the output. To fulfill one of the objectives of sustainable manufacturing, it is necessary to predict an optimum set of input process parameters for a given physical property of the output product, in order to reduce the use of precious natural resources and energy, and to reduce wastage. In this paper, a novel inverse modeling of the manufacturing process is proposed that is based on a hybrid scheme of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. By taking a case study of manufacturing of austempered ductile iron (ADI), with extensive simulation results, it is shown that the proposed technique is able to predict an optimum set of input process parameters which can save materials and reduce the cost of production. It is shown that the model predicted processing parameters can save US$40-$85 per tonne of ADI produced (i.e., about 13-25\% in cost saving).},

Based on the interaction between users, a communication topological network is constructed and the emotional direction is explored. We find that people had different sentiments between Chinese vaccine and those in other countries. The sentiment value might be affected by the number of daily news cases and deaths, the nature of key issues in the communication network.

  abstract  = {Mobile Devices (MDs) support various delay/computation-intensive applications. Yet they only have limited battery energy and computing resources, thereby failing to totally run all applications. A mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm has been proposed, and its servers are often deployed in both macro base stations (MBSs) and small base stations (SBSs). Thus, it is highly challenging to associate resource-limited MDs to them with high performance, and realize partial computation offloading among them for minimizing total energy consumption of an MEC system. This work formulates total energy consumption minimization as a constrained mixed integer non-linear program. To solve it, this work designs an improved meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called Particle swarm optimization based on Genetic Learning (PGL), which integrates strong local search capacity of a particle swarm optimizer, and genetic operations of a genetic algorithm. PGL jointly optimizes task offloading among MDs, SBSs and MBS, users’ connection to SBSs, MDs’ CPU speeds and transmission power, SBSs and MBS, and bandwidth allocation of available channels. Simulations with real-world data collected from Google cluster trace demonstrate that PGL significantly outperforms other existing methods in total energy consumption.},

  abstract  = {Prediction of movement intention is of paramount importance to enable volitional control of assistive devices. The performances of current Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are yet to reach the desired degree of accuracy necessary for real-life assistive technologies. Therefore, the prediction of gait intention remains a critical topic of research. This paper proposes an algorithm by leveraging two powerful empirical time-frequency analysis tools: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Wavelet Synchrosqueezed Transform (WSST). A combination of VMD and WSST was implemented to extract high-quality features in the time-frequency plane from Electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from six healthy individuals. The data were collected while they performed self-paced repetitions of gait initiations and terminations without any external audio or visual cue. The extracted features were later used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis kernel to predict the intention to start or stop the gait cycle from gait-related EEG data. The combined VMD-WSST approach reached 83.36±1.75\% accuracy, 82.83±2.99\% sensitivity, and 83.45±3.59\% specificity in starting intention detection. While, in the case of stopping intention prediction, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 81.57±1.70\%, 81.14±3.06\%, and 82.06±3.28\%, respectively. The performances obtained by the proposed methodology were better than or competitive with those obtained by numerous state-of-the-art BCI methodologies. The results of this study show promise in predicting intention to start or stop walking from EEG, which could potentially enable assistive devices to be controlled volitionally.},

Decoding complex neuronal signatures such as direction, speed, orientation from Electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging due to complex network connectivity in the brain. In the existing work, phase and amplitude-related features are used to decode the direction information during motor execution task. In this paper, we aim to decode the binary direction (left v/s right direction) during hand motor imagination task. We use the phase-related feature known as Wavelet-Phase Locking Value (W-PLV) to decode the hand motor imagery direction on calibration session data of 20 healthy subjects. Further, an online session is conducted on 13 subjects that use the trained model from the calibration session to decode imagined movement direction. The average classification accuracy achieved on calibration and online session data using phase related features (W-PLV) is 64. 39 ± 4. 23\% and 58. 67 ± 4. 06\%, respectively. The phase related features (W-PLV) achieve an improvement of 4. 82\% and 3. 04\% on calibration and online sessions, respectively compared to the amplitude related features alone. Online decoding of user’s intentions such as direction can aid in achieving more natural control of a BCI system.},

Calibration phase can be lengthy and exhausting for motor imagery-based (MI) BCI, and can potentially reduce the effectiveness of BCI system. Transfer learning (TL) approaches have been implemented in the field of BCI to tackle this problem. Transfer learning based on domain adaptation reduces domain discrepancy between two domains. Transfer component analysis (TCA) is one domain adaptation technique that maps features of both domains into a new space while simultaneously reducing their domain discrepancy. Recently, Euclidean alignment (EA) is used as transfer learning technique in BCI preprocessing step to align electroencephalography (EEG) trials between subjects. This paper proposed a combination of both EA and TCA (EA-TCA) as a TL approach for inter-subject transfer learning. This paper also proposed TCA method that can reuse existing projection matrix to transform new target data (TCA-W). The efficacy of EA to this method is also observed (EA-TCA-W). Results indicate that EA-TCA and EA-TCA-W outperform classification accuracy of those without EA by 3.32\% and 6.50\%, respectively. This concludes that EA can improve performance of both conventional TCA and proposed TCA-W.},

Specifically, at the frame-level, a Rate-SATD-QP (RSQ) model is derived based on the sum of absolute transformed difference (SATD) to calculate the quantization parameter (QP). Furthermore, at the coding tree uint (CTU) level, a feedback mechanism is developed to adjust QP for more fine-grained rate control. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the Fixed-QP algorithm in the AVS3 reference software (HPM 7.0), our scheme achieves 0.13\% bitrate error on average with a 0.08\% BD-rate gain in the Y component, meanwhile producing 2.19\% and 2.53\% BD-rate gains in the U and V components, respectively.},

These two tools are utilized to preserve high video reconstruction quality and compression efficiency as well as enhance hidden capacity. In specific, MTS is for hiding information into luminance blocks by modifying the selections of transforms. Comparing with other tools, MTS has less significant impact on compression quality and efficiency. In addition, CCLM is further used to hide information into chrominance blocks to further enlarge the hidden capacity with little impact on the other two metrics. To our best knowledge, it is the first information hiding method exclusively designed for H.266/VVC. Experimental results show that our proposed information hiding method ensures high hidden capacity, remarkable video reconstruction quality and insignificant impact on compression efficiency, which achieves better overall performances comparing to existing methods for compressed video.},

  abstract  = {It is straightforward to encrypt the outsourced data to protect its confidentiality using symmetric cryptography in cloud storage. How to control and restrict the use of the encryption key in data users’ devices becomes one of the critical issues. In most of existing time-based and policy-based schemes, the key cannot be stored locally in data users’ devices, making the traffic cost linear with the data access times as the key should be retrieved in each data access. In this paper, we propose a times-based scheme with Intel SGX to restrict the times the key can be used in the data user’s device to restrict the times of data access. The basic idea is to compare the current used times with the specified maximal times to determine whether the key can be used or not. To this end, we use a monotonic counter to count the times the key has been used. When the use condition is not satisfied, we destroy the key securely and generate public proof so that (i) the encrypted data cannot be accessed anymore, i.e., the data is deleted assuredly, (ii) the deletion can be verified. In addition, a hash-based integrity check approach is utilized to detect and prevent replay attacks. The experimental results on the implemented prototype show our scheme is feasible in practice.},

  abstract  = {Decision makers frequently encounter environments without perfect information, in which factors such as the distribution of missing information and estimates of missing information significantly impact decision accuracy and speed. This work presents an experiment which modifies an environment with missing information (total information, option imbalance, cue balance) and examines user estimates of the missing information to understand how accuracy and decision speed respond under time pressure. Results indicate that regardless of the way missing information is estimated, certain distributions of missing information reduce decision accuracy. Results from this work also indicate that beyond information distribution and estimation strategy, differences in decision strategy adopted may explain significant differences in decision performance. High performers tend to ignore a greater percentage of information instead of attempting to estimate it, thereby adopting a strategy more heuristic in nature.},

  abstract  = {A forcing function is an intervention for constraining human behavior. However, the literature describing forcing functions provides little guidance for when and how to apply forcing functions or their associated trade-offs. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by introducing a novel taxonomy of forcing functions. This taxonomy extends the previous methods in four ways. First, it identifies two levels of forcing function solidity: hard forcing functions, which explicitly enforce constraints through the system, and soft forcing functions, which convey or communicate constraints. Second, each solidity level is decomposed into specific types. Third, the taxonomy hierarchically ranks forcing function solidities and types based on trade-offs of constraint and resilience. Fourth, for hard forcing functions, our taxonomy offers formal guidance for identifying the minimally constraining intervention that will prevent a specific error from occurring. We validated the ability of our method to identify effective error interventions by applying it to systems with known errors from the literature. We then compared the solutions offered by our method to known, effective interventions. We discuss our results and offer suggestions for further developments in future research.},

  abstract  = {Recently, research by groups in academia, industry, and government has shifted toward the development of AI and machine learning tools to advise human decision-making in complex, dynamic problems. Within this collaborative environment, humans alone are burdened with the task of managing team strategy due to the AI-agent’s use of an unrealistic model of the human-agent’s decision-making process. This work investigates the use of an unsupervised machine learning method to enable AI-systems to differentiate between human decision-making strategies, enabling improved team collaboration and decision support. An interactive experiment is designed in which human-agents are subjected to a complex decision-making environment (a storm tracking interface) in which the provided visual data sources change over time. Behavioral data from the human-agent is collected, and a k-means clustering algorithm is used to identify individual decision strategies. This approach provides evidence of three distinct decision strategies which demonstrated similar degrees of success as measured by task performance. One cluster utilized a more analytic approach to decision-making, spending more time observing and interacting with each data source, while the other two clusters utilized more heuristic decision-making strategies. These findings indicate that if AI-based decision support systems utilize this approach to distinguish between the human-agent’s decision strategies in real time, the AI could develop an improved “awareness” of team strategy, enabling better collaboration with human teammates.},

  abstract  = {Daily decision-making circumstances often include risk and uncertainty, and the decision-maker’s risk preference constantly influences the course of action taken. Modeling how individuals make decisions in real-world situations remains a key challenge, and the use of machine learning techniques to model and augment individuals’ decision-making processes has garnered little attention. In this paper, we propose a new framework to evaluate the feasibility of inferring risk attitudes from human behavior modeled using the Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. The RL-based model framework is then generalized by including a situational or contextual variable that is indicative of cognitive biases observed in human decision-making, using an equipment maintenance scenario as a case study. Interestingly, when compared to human participants with working experience, the mean performance of a trained RL agent bears some semblance to the surveyed human participants. Riding on such strong empirical results, we also discover that the risk-seeking group of human participants are 9 times more likely to engage in risk-seeking associated actions. Besides, our exploratory simulations show that near optimal performance can be consistently achieved with several enhancements to state-of-the-art advantage actor-critic RL algorithms under the situational context of BUSY and IDLE. Overall, our proposed RL-based model framework can categorically infer the user-defined human risk attitude, and the trained RL agent demonstrates its rational decision-making prowess by outperforming the majority of human participants.},

By limiting the width of U-Net and employing a full-domain activation function, a network of aggregated weak learners is able to achieve a mean F 1 score within 93\% of the EfficientNetB0 baseline using only 0.5\% of the trainable parameters. A similar network of aggregated strong learners matches the mean F 1 score of the baseline on the Severstal dataset using only 10\% of the trainable parameters. Gradient boosting is then applied to the weak learners, achieving a mean F 1 score within 98\% of the strong learner network on the Severstal dataset with approximately 20\% of the FLOPS; the key insight is in constraining the O(n 2 ) relationship between network width and FLOPS. The same approach is applied to the KiTS19 dataset with good success in kidney detection. Interestingly, the method does not perform as well on the much harder to isolate tumor class, and the authors explore some possible reasons. In analyzing the impact of the full-domain activation function, the authors show that density of information is promoted by significantly reduced peaks in layer outputs and a wider range of output values. The method has significant implications in constrained deployments, as many small devices could be used to compute the overall network.},

MDs have limited resources and energy capacity, and they have to offload some tasks of computational/delay-intensive applications to their nearby small base station (SBS), which is a paradigm of MEC. Although task offloading decreases energy consumed by MDs, it brings additional transmission delay among MDs and SBS/cloud data center (CDC), and processing delay in SBS and CDC. It is challenging to minimize the total cost of a heterogeneous system including MDs, an SBS and a CDC while strictly guaranteeing delay limits of tasks. This work adopts different queuing systems to analyze the performance of MDs, the SBS and the CDC in the heterogeneous MEC system. Then, this work formulates a constrained optimization problem to minimize the total cost of the system. To solve it, we design a hybrid method named Genetic Simulated-annealing-based Particle swarm optimization (GSP) integrating genetic operations of genetic algorithm and the Metropolis acceptance rule of simulated annealing into particle swarm optimization. Real-life data-based simulation results demonstrate that GSP’s solution outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of total cost.},

  abstract  = {A big-data-related application like a Terminal Interaction Pattern Analysis System (TIPAS) commonly involves massive entities interacting with each other dynamically. Such interactions can be represented by a Dynamically Weighted Directed Network (DWDN). A large number of involved entities results in a high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) network, which can be represented by an HDI tensor with numerous missing entries. In spite of its HDI nature, this tensor contains much useful knowledge regarding various desired patterns like unobserved links in DWDN. However, due to its extremely high dimensionality and low data density, it is very challenging to build a learning model that can precisely represent an HDI tensor. To address this issue, this work proposes a Neural Latent Factorization of Tensors (NeuLFoT) model with three interesting ideas: a) adopting the principle of density-oriented modeling and Canonical Polyadic tensor factorization to build rank-one tensor series relying on three-dimensional latent factors for precisely representing an HDI tensor’s known data; b) treating the obtained rank-one tensors as neurons to form a novel neural tensor network model; and c) proposing a novel Backward Propagation algorithm for Latent factorization of tensors (BPL) to ensure high training efficiency. Experimental results on two large-scale DWDNs generated by a real TIPAS demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art models, the proposed model achieves significant gain in prediction accuracy for missing links of a DWDN and achieves highly competitive computational efficiency.},

Although the science of UVGI is well established, it can be difficult to determine in practice if sufficient levels of UVC has been irradiated to kill the target microbes in a room. This research presents the development of a low-cost wireless UVC sensor that can be used to systematically track the UV irradiation dose on target surfaces during a UV disinfection procedure. We present key elements of the design of this device, which included a custom PCB, enclosure, operating software, and graphical user interface. The applicability of the system was assessed through an experiment where the devices were placed at 12 locations in a CT scan treatment room that was subject to a UVGI disinfection procedure using an autonomous UV robot. Over the course of three cleaning sessions, each lasting approximately 10 minutes, it was found that each site location received an average UVC dose of 13mJ/cm 2 , which is more than published D90 values for SARS-Cov-2, influenza, and a number of known pathogens that are commonly found in hospital settings. This study provides early validation of the potential effectiveness of low-power wireless UV level monitoring technology, which may form part of future distributed room sensing networks or as part of smart wearable devices carried by relevant hospital staff.},

  abstract  = {A large-scale undirected weighted network (LUWN) is described by a symmetric high-dimensional and sparse (SHiDS) matrix. To correctly represent its symmetry, existing models adopt a strong symmetry assumption, i.e., reducing the solution space to adopt a unique latent factor matrix to describe an SHiDS matrix’s symmetry. Yet it may impair a resultant model’s representativeness to its numerical features. Aiming at addressing this issue, this work proposes a Relaxed Symmetric Non-negative latent factor analysis (RSN) model that adopts three-fold ideas: a) Introducing a triple equation constraint into its learning objective for relaxing the strong symmetry assumption, thereby greatly improving its representativeness to the numerical features of an SHiDS matrix; b) Adopting the framework of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers to fast realize its learning objective subject to multiple constraints; and c) utilizing a data density-oriented principle during its modeling and optimization, thereby precisely representing an SHiDS matrix’s imbalanced data. Empirical studies on four industrial SHiDS matrices describing real LUWNs demonstrate that RSN outperforms state-of-the-art models in representing an SHiDS matrix precisely, as well as achieves highly competitive computational efficiency. Hence, this work greatly advances the area of LUWN analysis.},

  abstract  = {Aiming at the problems of difficult segmentation, time-consuming and low precision of 3D liver medical images, 3D liver image semantic segmentation method based on context attention strategy is proposed. This method combines the three-dimensional spatial boundary information on the upper liver features map and the overall channel information on the lower liver features map. The model used the LiTS data set for ablation experiments in comparison with the previous model. Experimental results show that the Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) is increased by 1.6\%, and the volume overlap error (VOE) is reduced by 2.49\% in comparison with Channel-Unet. The relative volume difference (RVD), the average symmetric surface distance (ASD) and the root mean square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) which indicates that the algorithm improves the performance of 3D liver medical images segmentation. Extended experiments were carried out on the Sliver07 data set, the CT data set in CHAOS and the clinical MRI liver medical imaging data set of a hospital, and the results indicated that the proposed method has strong generalization ability.},

  abstract  = {Age estimation is a focal point of computer vision research. With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), some previous studies utilize large-scale models to learn the informative age representations to boost performance. However, these models with a large number of parameters are not suited to the low-power devices. In this paper, we propose a compact model called Soft-Lite ECA RepVGG network (LERep) for age estimation to alleviate this problem. We utilize the re-parameterization technique and the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module to construct a novel model. Decoupling the training and inference stage can reduce the computation cost. In other words, the training-time model is a multi-branch model, and then we convert the multi-branch model to a single plain model during inference time. Our approach has been proven to effectively trade off the performance and parameters for age estimation. Moreover, we propose a novel loss that utilizes the ordinal age information and expectation of age label distribution to address the non-stationary aging problem. According to the experimental results on MORPH II, FG-NET and CLAP2015, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compare with other compact models. In particular, our models also achieve competitive performance compare with over larger models, while our models have approximately 1/250 parameters of the VGG-16 network.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, plane wave (PW) ultrasound (US) imaging has emerged as a promising method for ultrafast US imaging due to its high temporal resolution. PW transmissions have a lower image quality when the number of PW is limited. The conventional approach to reconstruction entails a coherently summing sequence of US signals at the cost of frame rate. In this paper, an improved deep neural network approach is applied for reconstructing a high-quality PW image from a single PW radio frequency (RF) signal. Specifically, the deformable convolution is utilized as a feature extractor added on the U-net network, and a discriminator is utilized to improve the network fitting effect. It aims to learn a mapping between a single PW and compounding 75 PWs by training the network with in vitro and in vivo samples. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in terms of structural similarity (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Extensive quantitative and visual evaluations reveal that the proposed model improves PSNR by 32.97 percent and 21.24 percent in cross-section and longitudinal sections of the carotid artery respectively, compared to the U-net. The results suggest the potential of reconstructing high-quality images from a single PW via deep learning.},

The application of optical coherence tomography (OCT) assisting ophthalmologists to analyze them is essential in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recently, the two-stage attention-based method was proposed to classify and segment the lesion area. However, the knowledge learned by the classification task cannot be transferred to the segmentation task in the two-stage method. In this paper, we propose a novel one-stage attention-based method for retinal OCT image classification and segmentation, simultaneously the two tasks can promote each other. Specifically, attention map obtained by Convolutional neural networks (CNN) classifiers are applied for guiding the network to achieve more accurate classification. For gaining stronger discrimination ability, we apply the priori knowledge of grayscale difference to generate pseudo ground truth for constraining the attention map. Experimental results on the UCSD dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed network.},

In the literature, most of the image captioning works have been accomplished in the English language only. This paper proposes a new approach for image captioning in the Hindi language using deep learning-based encoder-decoder architecture. Hindi, widely spoken in India and South Asia, is the fourth most spoken language globally; it is India’s official language. In recent years, significant advancement has been made in image captioning, utilizing encoder-decoder architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Encoder CNN extracts features from input images, whereas decoder RNN performs language modeling. The proposed encoder-decoder architecture utilizes information multiplexing in the encoder CNN to achieve a performance gain in feature extraction. Extensive experimentation is carried out on the benchmark MSCOCO Hindi dataset, and significant improvements in BLEU score are reported compared to the baselines. Manual human evaluation in terms of adequacy and fluency of the generated captions further establishes the proposed method’s efficacy in generating good quality captions.},

To deal with clothing brand identification problem, we construct a new very large-scale clothing dataset containing brand information and the brand logo bounding box information if it has one. Totally, we collected 416 fashion clothing brands in our newly built dataset. In this work, we propose a fashion Clothing Brand Recognition Network (CBR-Net), which contains two parts. First part is the identification network for the clothing brand logo detection and recognition, and the second part is an attention module based network for classifying clothing brands without logos.

To minimize the black-box effect of these models and also to make them better exploit compositionality, we propose a Dynamic Neural Network (DMN), which can understand a particular question and then dynamically assemble various relatively shallow deep learning modules from a pool of modules to form a network. We incorporate compositional temporal attention to these deep learning based modules to increase compositionality exploitation. This results in achieving better understanding of complex questions and also provides reasoning as to why the module predicts a particular answer. Experimental analysis on the two benchmark datasets, VQA2.0 and CLEVR, depicts that our model outperforms the previous approaches for Visual Question Answering task as well as provides better reasoning, thus making it reliable for mission critical applications like safety and security.},

In this study, we have proposed such a model which can detect the presence of 14 different thoracic diseases from a chest X-ray alone. Our novel dense convolutional neural network model works in 2 stages, first training on images from disease-ridden patients alone, and then training the entire network on the whole dataset which includes X-rays from both healthy and unhealthy patients. Given a chest X-ray alone, our model can give accurate predictions, with an AUROC mean score of 82.9\% competing with the existing state-of-the-art models in this field.},

In the existing solutions, the methods using the difference between onset frame and apex frame have high accuracy and low computational cost. But their extraction of dynamic features is not integrated with classification network, resulting in the lack of feedback from classification loss to the extracted dynamic features. In this paper, we propose a novel Displacement Generating Module (DGM) which uses convolution module to generate the displacement feature between onset frame and apex frame instead of traditional optical flow or dynamic image. The new DGM is integrated with the existing LEARNet to form an end-to-end micro-expression recognition network, where the classification loss can feed backward to the parameters of DGM to obtain better displacement features. We also present a random selection method of apex frame to increase the amount of training data, and present a normalization operation for the displacement features with different scales. Our new approach has been tested on SAMM, SMIC, CASME II datasets with LOSO evaluation method, and achieves 0.737 on UF1 and 0.726 on UAR, which is obviously higher than existing networks with optical flow and dynamic imaging techniques.},

Although many detection methods have been proposed, they have either designed sophisticated neural networks that lack enough interpretability, or found defects specific to one manipulation method. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to explore the defects of fake facial images after wavelet transform and call it GFS (Grayscale Frequency Statistics). First, we utilize Haar wavelet transformation to decompose the image into low-frequency approximation, horizontal detail, vertical detail, and diagonal detail. The GFS of real and fake images exhibit different distribution and forms in these four subbands. We qualitatively analyze these differences and quantify them as weights. Then, these four subband images are used to train four CNNs respectively, and the obtained detection results also verify the differences in GFS. After that, we combine the prediction results of the four CNNs and the corresponding weights to further improve the detection performance. We conduct extensive experiments on 11 datasets generated by various facial manipulation methods, and the superior results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our findings indicate that the fake images generated by the current facial manipulation methods cannot simulate real images in wavelet-domain.},

A number of researchers have reported that many countries, including Taiwan, have a significant and noticeable increase in ED visits. This phenomenon, overcrowding in the ED, has caused several adverse effects not only on patients but also on the healthcare delivery process, quality of care, and care efficiency. However, the currently adopted five-level triage system, Taiwan Triage and Acuity Scale (TTAS), is insufficient to distinguish patients’ conditions into different priorities. Therefore, a system that could help to triage a patients’ conditions accurately is demanded. While most of the existing studies have only utilized retrospective data and used traditional machine learning as the approaches, which might not satisfy for clinical decisions and real-world situations, this paper proposed an interpretable novel triage prediction system for predicting hospitalization based on prospectively collected data in the emergency department, including vital signs and chief complaints. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated on our own collected data in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), with 73 samples needing hospital admission and 73 samples discharged. Ten times of 10-fold cross-validation were done to evaluate the performance of our proposed model, a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean accuracy are achieved at 0.836 and 0.805, respectively.},

This paper proposes a semi-supervised classification method for three kinds of apicomplexan parasites and non-infected host cells microscopic images, which uses a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data for training. There are two challenges in microscopic image recognition. The first is that salient structures of the microscopic images are more fuzzy and intricate than natural images’ on a real-world scale. The second is that insignificant textures, like background staining, lightness, and contrast level, vary a lot in samples from different clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we aim to learn a distinguishable and appearance-invariant representation by contrastive learning strategy. On one hand, macroscopic images, which share similar shape characteristics in morphology, are introduced to contrast for structure enhancement. On the other hand, different appearance transformations, including color distortion and flittering, are utilized to contrast for texture elimination. In the case where only 1\% of microscopic images are labeled, the proposed method reaches an accuracy of 94.90\% in a generalized testing set.},

Furthermore, self-attention mechanisms are used for identifying the relationship among agents in the form of graphs.

  abstract  = {Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in real-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory patterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully modelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative distances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is because they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different types of road users on the trajectory to be predicted—for example, a nearby pedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper, we propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural network to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class labels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which is combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the objects’ velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM). SAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to automatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the fixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal dependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional network to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose new metrics, known as Average 2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final Displacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We call our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance to the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.},

It was found this methodology is viable using only 5\% of available motor imagery trials during training, yielding 92.6\% classification accuracy on the selected test subject. Furthermore, the utility for real-time applications is promising with a rapid classification that takes less than 100 ms after the initial calibration procedure is completed.},

  abstract  = {Neurorehabilitation based on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) show important rehabilitation effects for patients after stroke. Previous studies have shown improvements for patients that are in a chronic stage and/or have severe hemiparesis and are particularly challenging for conventional rehabilitation techniques. Seven stroke patients in chronic phase with lower extremity hemiparesis were recruited. All of them participated in 25 BCI-sessions about 3 times/week. The BCI-system was based on the Motor Imagery (MI) of the paretic-ankle dorsiflexion and healthy-wrist dorsiflexion with Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) and avatar feedback. Assessments were conducted to assess the changes before and after the therapy. The functional scales used were: 10-meters walking test (10MWT), Range of Motion (ROM) of the ankle dorsiflexion and Timed Up and Go (TUG). Results show a significant increase in the gait speed in the primary measure 10MWT self-velocity of 0.14 m/s (SD = 0.10). This improvement is above of the minimally clinically important difference. The speed in the TUG also significantly increased by 0.08 m/s, P = 0.016. The range of motion also was increased after the therapy, ΔROM passive= 8.83° (SD = 7.22), P=0.016, and ΔROM active = 7.14° (SD = 4.84), P= 0.016. These outcomes show the feasibility of this BCI approach, and further support the growing consensus that these types of tools might develop into a new paradigm for gait rehabilitation tool for stroke patients. However, the results are from seven chronic stroke patients so the authors believe that this approach should be further validated in broader studies involving more patients.},

  abstract  = {Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that allows users to control computer devices by imaging body part movements or MI tasks. In BCI applications, the classification of MI using electroencephalogram (EEG) is challenging because EEG is highly susceptible to noise and artifacts. The latency and length of MI period also vary between subjects and sessions; however, many conventional applications tend to empirically define time windows for feature extraction. This can lead to lower MI-BCI performance. This paper proposes two mutual information-based time window adaptation (MT) algorithms; sliding window MT (SWMT) and genetic algorithm MT (GAMT). Both algorithms used optimized reference signals and mutual information analysis to constantly adjust the time window starting point and length. Reference signals were optimized based on mutual information analysis and performance evaluation. Feature extraction and classification algorithms were finally applied to evaluate SWMT and GAMT performance. The results indicate that SWMT and GAMT were able to improve the conventional approach by increasing the classification accuracy by 6.00\% and 6.37\%, respectively.},

Although the SSVEP-BCI are characterized by their high and robust classification performance, the repetitive presentation of flickering stimuli is uncomfortable from a user experience perspective point of view. Indeed, the low-level visual features of SSVEP stimuli make them straining to the eyes over time and could be disruptive to the execution of tasks requiring sustained attention. They could even induce epileptic seizures. This study explores the reduction of the stimulation amplitude depth (a magnitude diminution of 90\%) for the design of SSVEP stimuli as a solution to improve user comfort. The classification accuracy obtained by different pipelines was systematically compared between low amplitude and standard full amplitude SSVEP stimuli. The results reveal high classification accuracy for both high (99.8\%) and low magnitude (80.2\%) stimuli using the Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA) classification method. The present findings demonstrate the validity of reducing SSVEP stimuli amplitude to increase users’ comfort paving the way for transparent BCI operation.},

  abstract  = {A stochastic-gradient-descent-based Latent Factor Analysis (LFA) model is highly efficient in representative learning of a High-Dimensional and Sparse (HiDS) matrix. Its learning rate adaptation is vital in ensuring its efficiency. Such adaptation can be realized with an evolutionary computing algorithm. However, a resultant model tends to suffer from two issues: a) the pre-mature convergence of the swarm of learning rates as caused by an adopted evolution algorithm, and b) the pre-mature convergence of the LFA model as caused jointly by evolution-based learning rate adaptation and an optimization algorithm. This paper focuses on the methods to address such issues. A Hierarchical Particle-swarm-optimization-incorporated Latent factor analysis (HPL) model with a two-layered structure is proposed, where the first layer pre-trains desired latent factors with a position-transitional particle-swarm-optimization-based LFA model, and the second layer performs latent factor refining with a newly-proposed mini-batch particle swarm optimizer. With such design, an HPL model can well handle the pre-mature convergence, which is supported by the positive experimental results achieved on HiDS matrices from industrial applications.},

  abstract  = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are one of the human brain-inspired neural networks, which have been applied to various applications. SNNs can be implemented on hardware and can realize low-costs, low-power consumption and high-parallelism computation. There, however, are few researches to solve continuous optimization problems using SNNs. Swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm is a population-based metaheuristics, which is effective in solving those problems. SI algorithm requires many search agents to search for good quality of solutions. Since SNNs can provide high-parallelism computation, SNNs and SI algorithm are well suited. In this paper, we propose a new swarm intelligence algorithm called an optimizer based on spiking neural-oscillator networks (OSNN). In OSNN, each particle consists of plural spiking neural-oscillators which search one-dimensional search space. These spiking neuraloscillators are networked (i.e. SNNs), networks of which affect search dynamics and performances of OSNN. We performed numerical experiments to investigate basic search dynamics of OSNN and evaluated search performances of OSNN compared to OPRC and PSO. As the results, network topology of OSNN affects spike timing for spiking neural-oscillator, search dynamics and search performances. In addition, OSNN shows better search performances than OPRC and PSO.},

The application of evolutionary computation (EC) for traffic signal timing optimization (TSTO) can effectively alleviate traffic congestion at a single intersection. However, while in more complicated regional traffic signal timing optimization (RTSTO) problems, the canonical EC algorithm such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) still has limitation due to population prematurity. In this paper, a multi-exemplar learning (MEL) strategy is adopted to improve the diversity of the population, so that the particles can have more opportunities to explore the search space. Furthermore, multiple traffic indicators are used in this paper to measure the comprehensive performance of the solution. Moreover, the microsimulation software is adopted to evaluate the solution to simulate the real-world intersection, making the obtained solution more practical in real-world application. Experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of MEL-PSO. The results show that the MEL-PSO algorithm is more effective and efficient than the compared algorithms on RTSTO problems.},

  abstract  = {Logistics scheduling is an important issue in nowadays smart city construction because the scheduling results can determine the efficiency of logistics distribution, and thus influence the development of logistics companies. Although many remarkable works attempted to solve the logistics scheduling problems, especially the logistics-related vehicle routing problem (VRP), most of them established the models based on Euclidean distance, which may result in suboptimal solutions due to the ignorance of road layout. That is, the optimal solution of the model may be suboptimal or even impractical when applied to the real-world situation because of the difference between the model and the real situation. To deal with this weakness, a VRP-based real traffic distance-aware logistics scheduling model that considers the road layout is established in this paper, where the real traffic distance is used as the input of the model. With the assistance of Baidu Map API, the real traffic distance between any two locations and the real traffic duration between them can be captured. In this way, a problem instance set with three scales (i.e., with 20, 30, and 40 locations) is built up for experiments. Besides, the ant colony system (ACS) is employed to solve the problem instances under the cases of using Euclidean distance, linear distance, and real traffic distance to measure the solutions. Comparison results from perspectives of both real traffic distance and real traffic duration show the better performance of solutions obtained under the case of real traffic distance.},

The multi-objective optimizer utilizes a reference point-based system to allocate particles into an equidistant sub-swarm, in which particles are attracted to a pareto optimal solution in that sub-swarm. To encourage diversity and avoid local minima, density and turbulence factors are included. RPB-PSWO is capable of optimizing problems with many dependent variables, as the position update method of PSO inherently preserves dependent relationships, but suffers from an increased computation cost compared to NSGA-II. The proposed algorithm, although less computationally efficient, is capable of creating diverse pareto front solutions for standardized and custom optimization problems.},

However, many dialect areas in China make the AVQS have to response the multi-accented Mandarin users by single acoustic model in ASR. This problem severely limits the accuracy of ASR for multi-accented speech in the AVQS. In this paper, a new framework for AVQS is proposed to improve the accuracy of response. Firstly, the fusion feature including iVector and filterbank acoustic features is used to train the Transformer-CTC model. Secondly, the transformer-CTC model is used to construct the end-to-end ASR. Finally, keywords matching algorithm for AVQS based on fuzzy mathematic theory is proposed to further improve the accuracy of response. The results show that the final accuracy in our proposed framework for AVQS arrives at 91.5\%. The proposed framework for AVQS can satisfy the service requirement of different areas in mainland of China.

Tactile stimuli provide early warning of dangerous movements and proximity to the robot, based on the human reaction time and instantaneous velocities of robot and op-erator. A preliminary experiment was performed to identify the reaction time of participants when they are exposed to tactile stimuli in a collaborative environment with controlled conditions. In a second experiment, we evaluated our approach into a study case where human worker and cobot performed collaborative planetary gear assembly. Results show that the applied approach increased the average minimum distance between the robot’s end-effector and hand by 44\% compared to the operator relying only on the visual feedback. Moreover, the participants without the haptic support have failed several times to maintain the protective separation distance.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a 6-DOF haptic interface with force feedback capability for foot-based interaction. To direct a &quot;third arm&quot; to any position that the operator wants to reach while both hands are busy, the controller needs 6-DOF input from a modality that does not rely on the hands. We focus on foot-based operation and propose a device that is composed of a parallel link and omni wheel. We evaluated the operating performance of this device during a robot manipulation task, an obstacle avoidance task, and a Fitts’ Law task. The results show the precision of the 6-DOF manipulations to be 1.83 cm. The performance of the obstacle avoidance task is significantly higher with force feedback. The performance measure of the Fitts’ Law task, the throughput, differed depending on the plane of operation. In comparison with prior study, the throughput of 1.21 bits/s, the average of all planes, was higher than the prior study. The proposed device could be effective as an interface to control the third arm.},

  abstract  = {Interactive human-machine systems (HMS), such as compute-based virtual environments (VEs), have been increasingly relied upon for decision-making. Building trust between human users and machines is crucial to enable a cooperative relationship. One aspect of building trust requires modeling sensory feedback from virtual objects in VEs to the users for appropriate understanding and utilization. In current VEs, of interest is modelling the integration of vibrotactile and force cues for providing sensory feedback to stimulate the haptic modality of the users. Behavioral models, such as maximum likelihood estimation, have failed to interpret the integration. Underlying this failure might be subtle internal processes of the human brain. Hence, we conducted an experiment to investigate the feasibility of modeling the integration using a drift-diffusion model (DDM), which is known to bridge observed behavioral outcomes and internal processes. In the experiment, human participants undertook a navigation and detection task within a 3D VE. Their task execution was aided by vibrotactile or/and force cues. Analyses on task accuracy and response time to the cues confirmed that DDM was feasible to interpret behavioral outcomes of the participants. The interpretation implies a link between the outcomes and the internal processes, paving a potential way to use DDM for elucidating the integration of vibrotactile and force cues.},

  abstract  = {By taking advantage of Deep Learning (DL), Received signal strength (RSS) fingerprint-based indoor localization has attracted more attention. Training DL models require an immense amount of RSS samples, and crowdsourcing has been another way to collect data by users. Recently, some researchers apply Federated Learning (FL) in indoor localization instead of crowdsourcing for privacy protection. However, more practical issues are still not considered.For further guaranteeing privacy and deploying systems in real time, this paper proposes OPFL, a privacy-preserved online personalized federated learning framework for fingerprint-based indoor localization. In OPFL, users update model parameters and collect new labeled samples meanwhile. By adding artificial noise based on the Differential Privacy (DP) mechanism, it is harder for attackers to infer information. Besides, the deterioration of models results from DP is mitigating by applying the personalized algorithm. The experimental results show that under the noise perturbing, the performance of OPFL testing on the local test set is far better than the conventional federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg), and is even close to the centralized training.},

  abstract  = {Oil resources are becoming increasingly scarce. Pure electric vehicles have huge advantages, in terms of energy efficiency and emission reduction. In cities, the locations of required charging stations and the number of required charging piles are determined according to the traffic flow on a road. Unreasonable allocation not only creates safety problems due to high electrical loads, but also increases the cost of the placements. Such allocations will involve the many-to-many (M2M) assignment in the process, which is necessary to establish an optimal model for distributing. Thus, this paper formalizes the charging pile siting problem (CPSP) via the group multirole assignment (GMRA) model, which is one of the most important methods to deal with the M2M problem. Based on GMRA, this paper proposes a role negotiation method by using a spectral clustering K-Means++ Algorithm based on location. The formalization of GMRA makes it easy to find a solution using the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX) via the Integer Programming (IP). All the proposed approaches are verified by simulation experiments, which have been proved to be efficient, feasible and practicable.},

  abstract  = {This COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the world in health and economic terms since 2020 with more than 200 million confirmed infected people and more than 4 million deaths across 190 countries. Treatment used against COVID-19 disease has initially been based on the combination of several medicaments, such as hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, azithromycin and kaletra, each of which can individually delay the ventricular depolarization and repolarization processes through morphological changes in the patient’s electrocardiogram. These changes can produce serious arrhythmias that lead to the sudden death of the patient.This paper presents an interpretable fuzzy rule-based system for fatal ventricular arrhythmia risk level estimation due to COVID-19 treatment, whose decisions are made on the basis of the evolution of electrocardiogram morphology and certain patient’s clinical information. For the risk level estimation, the proposed fuzzy rule-based system considers three different risk levels (High, Moderate and Low) which are indicated by means of three different colors (Red, Orange and Green). Decisions made by the fuzzy rule-based system present a reliable behavior in comparison with cardiologist’s decision. To be precise, the obtained accuracy, when comparing both decisions, reaches the 96.43\%, which, joint to the high measured interpretability of the decision making system, result in a powerful tool in order to avoid death in patients, even in health centers without specialized clinical staff, and to reduce the stress in medical centers by reducing reaction times in critical patient situations.},

  abstract  = {An important property of fuzzy systems is the interpretability provided by their rules. However, if a fuzzy system is derived through machine learning algorithms, its interpretability is often greatly diminished as membership functions and rules are adjusted to minimize error in respect to a data set. To address part of this challenge, we propose a novel two-step fuzzy rule generation framework leveraging the concept of the Markov blanket, i.e., the set of variables which are causally related to a target variable – such as a system’s output. By estimating the Markov blanket for a given application, we restrict rule learning to (only) the variables which are causally linked to the system output, thus minimising the generation of spurious rules (based on spurious correlations of variables). This decreases the complexity of fuzzy systems and maintains a causal link between rules’ antecedents and consequent(s) – as expected by humans when viewing rules. The proposed framework can improve the interpretability of fuzzy rule based systems which are tuned using machine learning techniques, while also providing performance advantages as are commonly associated with feature selection techniques. Experiment results show that even the initial implementation of the framework proposed here can generate more concise and interpretable rule bases without compromising performance.},

  abstract  = {The real-time motion satellite tracking mechanism of an antenna, allowing communication to and from the satellite is critical for space applications. Mostly, parallel-based mechanisms are employed in space fields for motorizing the antenna due to the cost-effectiveness, high stiffness, easiness of inverse kinematic solution, and high reachable acceleration. Unfortunately, the angular displacements of the end-effector using parallel-based mechanisms are highly limited due to the existence of the passive joints. More recently, serial-based mechanisms are being used to motorize the antenna for tracking the satellite motions in larger horizons compared with parallel-based mechanisms. The inverse kinematic solution complexity, the iso-metric configurations of the joints for a specific position of the end-effector, and highly advanced controller mechanisms are the main difficulties of serial-based mechanisms that should be considered in their implementations. The existing system is using a traditional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller along with the kinematic modelling which can cause tracking error, inaccuracies and consequently loss in receiving data from satellite. In this study, the ABB irb120 robot is employed as a serial-based mechanism with the attached antenna to efficiently track the low-, medium-, and high-altitudes orbiting satellites. The inverse kinematic model of the proposed robot has been incorporated to extract the robot joints’ configurations with a combination of the new fuzzy logic controller compared with a PID controller to increase the motion tracking performance. The simulation study is conducted using MATLAB/SimMechanic to model the mechanism with consideration of the constraints. The results prove satellite motion can be tracked with higher accuracy using the fuzzy logic controller compared to the existing PID controller.},

To address these issues, we propose a novel video salient object detection network with bidirectional memory and spatiotemporal constraints. The global and local cues are first cascaded to extract spatial location information and internal structural details by residual skip connections. After obtaining reliable and fine-grained spatial saliency for a single frame, we design a DB-ConvLSTM module with bidirectional memory that retains the past and future information. A global temporal attention mechanism is added in the temporal dimension to correlate each frame with the whole video to obtain accurate salient objects of globally consistent. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the other seven state-of-the-art models on four datasets, viz. DAVIS, FBMS, SegTrackV2, and UVSD.},

In addition to the diagnosis of COVID-19, it is vital to distinguish the severity of the confirmed cases, which is conducive to the selection and planning of treatment methods. At a critical juncture of the epidemic crisis, we are committed to developing a non-local hierarchical refinement fully convolutional network to assist experts in automatically segmenting the COVID-19-caused pneumonia infection regions. The architecture of the proposed model is a deep encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, we exploit a non-local perception module to capture more complementary coarse-structure information from different pyramid levels and a local refinement model to explicitly heighten the fine-detail information of each convolution layer. Moreover, the non-local and local features are aggregated through a boundary-aware multiple supervision strategy to produce the gratifying edge-preserving segmentation map. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in boosting the learning ability of accurately identify the lung infected regions with clear contours. In particular, our model is superior remarkably to the state-of-the-art segmentation models both quantitatively and qualitatively on a real CT dataset of COVID-19.},

  abstract  = {This study aims to explore different pre-trained models offered in the Torchvision package which is available in the PyTorch library. And investigate their effectiveness on fine-grained images classification. Transfer Learning is an effective method of achieving extremely good performance with insufficient training data. In many real-world situations, people cannot collect sufficient data required to train a deep neural network model efficiently. Transfer Learning models are pre-trained on a large data set, and can bring a good performance on smaller datasets with significantly lower training time. Torchvision package offers us many models to apply the Transfer Learning on smaller datasets. Therefore, researchers may need a guideline for the selection of a good model. We investigate Torchvision pre-trained models on four different data sets: 10 Monkey Species, 225 Bird Species, Fruits 360, and Oxford 102 Flowers. These data sets have images of different resolutions, class numbers, and different achievable accuracies. We also apply their usual fully-connected layer and the Spinal fully-connected layer to investigate the effectiveness of SpinalNet. The Spinal fully-connected layer brings better performance in most situations. We apply the same augmentation for different models for the same data set for a fair comparison. This paper may help future Computer Vision researchers in choosing a proper Transfer Learning model.},

Existing unsupervised person re-identification methods focus on one-shot learning and domain adaptation, but they still rely on the labels of the source domain or a small number of sample labels. To solve this problem, we formulate a very simple but effective unsupervised person re-identification method: Diversity and Salience Clustering (DSC). The method generates a stable clustering feature space for unsupervised re-identification by considering the diversity and salience of pedestrian samples. As a pure unsupervised person re-identification model, our approach does not use any camera annotations, pedestrian labels and source domain data. Extensive experiments on two image datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised person re-identification methods.},

In this research, we successfully mounted adversarial attacks on a federated learning (FL) environment using three different datasets. The attacks leveraged generative adversarial networks (GANs) to affect the learning process and strive to reconstruct the private data of users by learning hidden features from shared local model parameters. The attack was target-oriented drawing data with distinct class distribution from the CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST respectively. Moreover, by measuring the Euclidean distance between the real data and the reconstructed adversarial samples, we evaluated the performance of the adversary in the learning processes in various scenarios. At last, we successfully reconstructed the real data of the victim from the shared global model parameters with all the applied datasets.},

When constructing a BLS based classifier with domain adaption capability, the mapped features and enhancement nodes are determined by random parameters. Thus, there will be discrepancy between the hidden layer features of the source domain and target domain. Therefore, we propose a new semi-supervised classifier with domain adaption capability based on BLS. Firstly, in order to reduce the discrepancy between the hidden layer features of domains, our method aligns the second-order statistics of mapped features due to the fact that enhancement nodes are generated by mapped features. Further, when learning the classifier through the aligned features, we embed balanced distribution adaptation to improve domain adaption capability of the classifier. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate our method has better classification accuracy than some existences.},

  abstract  = {The 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), which is a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based statistical model that represents a 3D face using linear basis functions, has shown promising results for reconstructing 3D faces from single-view in-the-wild images. However, 3DMM has restricted representation power due to the limited number of 3D scans and global linear basis. To address the limitations of 3DMM, we propose a straightforward learning-based method that reconstructs a 3D face mesh through Free-Form Deformation (FFD) for the first time. FFD is a geometric modeling method that embeds a reference mesh within a parallelepiped grid and deforms the mesh by moving the sparse control points of the grid. As FFD is based on mathematically defined basis functions, it has no limitation in representation power. Thus, we can recover accurate 3D face meshes by estimating the appropriate deviation of control points as deformation parameters. Although both 3DMM and FFD are parametric models, deformation parameters of FFD are easier to interpret in terms of their effect on the final shape. This practical advantage of FFD allows the resulting mesh and control points to serve as a good starting point for 3D face modeling, in that ordinary users can fine-tune the mesh by using widely available 3D software tools. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate how our method successfully estimates the 3D face geometry and facial expressions from 2D face images, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Although deep learning played a major role in the recent success of acne detection, there are still several challenges such as color shift by inconsistent illumination, variation in scales, and high density distribution. To address these problems, we propose an acne detection network which consists of three components, specifically: Composite Feature Refinement, Dynamic Context Enhancement, and Mask-Aware Multi-Attention. First, Composite Feature Refinement integrates semantic information and fine details to enrich feature representation, which mitigates the adverse impact of imbalanced illumination. Then, Dynamic Context Enhancement controls different receptive fields of multi-scale features for context enhancement to handle scale variation. Finally, Mask-Aware Multi-Attention detects densely arranged and small acne by suppressing uninformative regions and highlighting probable acne regions. Experiments are performed on acne image dataset ACNE04 and natural image dataset PASCAL VOC 2007. We demonstrate how our method achieves the state-of-the-art result on ACNE04 and competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods on the PASCAL VOC 2007.},

  abstract  = {Anomaly detection is an active area of computer vision and widely applied in diverse fields. As known, it is a considerable challenge to collect abnormalities in practice. To tackle it, researchers propose many unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithms based on autoencoders or their variants. They focus on reconstruction loss between input and reconstructed samples but ignore the latent features extracted by an autoencoder. Namely, the existing algorithms tend to learn the local features of samples and have the approximate capabilities to reconstruct normal and abnormal samples. To capture the latent spatial features of anomaly detection, we present an unsupervised latent feature autoencoder via adversarial training. Particularly, we propose a weighted feature consistency loss to exploit the correlation between the corresponding layers of an encoder and decoder in the autoencoder. A feature discrimination loss is also designed to improve its ability to identify real and reconstructed samples by utilizing the latent spatial features of a discriminator. Next, we develop a discriminator that consists of two networks, i.e., a feature extraction network and a classification one. The pre-trained model can extract the input features accurately and stably, while the classification network can avoid excessive information losses and strengthen the ability to acquire deep semantics. Extensive experiments conducted on six public datasets show that the proposed method is competitive with the existing mainstream methods.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic analysis of real-world software systems is challenging due to imperfections, noise and data loss. Moreover, these systems evolve with time and their requirements are usually either not clearly specified or unknown, which makes it hard to analyze them. Therefore, it is important to create models that can learn to behave similarly to these systems to enable us to predict their actions, recover missing data, or detect potential failures ahead of time.Several models have been proposed to model sequential data, but the vast majority of them only have a qualitative notion of time or no notion of it at all. In this paper, we extend the work on incorporating a quantitative notion of time to RNN and introduce Time GRU. This modified GRU can learn the behaviour of complex software systems to a very high degree of accuracy. Our approach is scalable and has shown state-of-the-art performance on industry-strength software with real operating logs from Blackberry’s QNX real-time operating system. The proposed model can predict upcoming sequences of events more than 100 timesteps ahead in time with more than 90\% accuracy.

Existing methods have extracted brain states using principal component analysis and clustering. However, they work on the spike count data, fail to exploit the full information of spike timings, and result in a relatively coarse time resolution. Quick-response BMIs call for fine temporal resolution brain states estimation. The high-temporal resolution can be achieved by directly operating on spike timings. A cross-intensity (CI) kernel family facilitate this by mathematically describing the spike timings in a functional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In this paper, we applied a CI kernel distance-based clustering method on multi-neuron spike trains for brain state estimation. We tested this method on the neural data from the primary motor cortex of a Sprague Dawley rat performing lever-press tasks. The spike trains are grouped into several clusters by proposed method. We found the timings of clustered brain states to be highly correlated to specific stages of lever-press process. We compared CI-based clustering with L1-norm based clustering on multi-neuron spike trains, and found that CI-based clustering on average has 24.3\% improvement on the correlation with lever-press states. These clustered brain states can be used to correlate local field potentials, and this correlation potentially helps build long-term stable BMIs.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates binaural beat stimulation (BBs) on mitigating mental stress levels at the workplace. We developed an experimental protocol to induce stress levels by performing Stroop Color-Word Task (SCWT) under time pressure and negative feedback. Then, we mitigated the levels of stress using 16 Hz BBs. The level of stress was assessed by utilizing Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), salivary alpha-amylase, and behavioral responses. We quantified the level of stress using statistical analysis, functional connectivity based on Phase Locking Value (PLV), and support vector machines (SVM) classifier. We found that BBs has significantly improved the accuracy of target detection by 27.35\%, (p&lt;0.005) and reduced the cortisol level. The classification results showed that the SVM technique with PLV features differentiates between three levels of mental states (control, stress and mitigation) with an average accuracy of 65.22\%, and sensitivity of 81.79\% and specificity of 80.10\%.},

  abstract  = {Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) are a widely used paradigm for the detection of attended objects. However, their aid in the recognition of other attentional states has not yet been studied in detail. In this study (n=21), we assessed the benefits of including SSVEP stimuli as probes in a screen-based task to classify internal and external attention based on 16-channel EEG data offline. Previous studies have shown that the distinction between these two attentional states based on brain activity is possible. We compared several SSVEP-stimulus settings with a baseline where no SSVEP stimulus was present. Different flickering frequencies and stimulus placements were evaluated for the possibilities of different experimental setups. We found that the influence of the stimulus on the classification accuracy is highly dependent on the settings. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) performance increased significantly when an SSVEP-evoking stimulus with a low flickering frequency was present in the center of fixation. As well as when a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-coefficient was added as the SSVEP-specific feature to a generic band-power feature set. A simple training-free, person-independent threshold approach for internal and external attention detection resulted in accuracies significantly higher than chance based on SSVEP-features that were calculated only on three occipital electrodes. These results show that such stimuli can aid the recognition of internal and external attention. Thus, they can be used in experiments or applications for a more robust detection rate. Specifically, they could improve SSVEP-based BCI paradigms by adding another level of attention-awareness.},

Prior work has demonstrated that these models can recognize the mental state in a variety of tasks, but few have specifically explored their performance concerning human factors that come into play with the use of brain-computer interfaces in day-to-day applications. For this research, we explored the use of 1D-convolutional neural networks to recognize two mental states–mental arithmetic and rest–from electroencephalograph signals. We focused our analysis on three parameters that affect the design and usability of brain-computer interfaces: input data representation (i.e. domain), window size (i.e. latency), and electrode montage (i.e. form-factor). In line with prior work, we found a clear bias in performance towards the frequency domain representation. We also found that training our model with short windows of time (i.e. 0.25s) provided close to peak accuracy. Furthermore, high accuracy was maintained with sparse electrode subsets of the full 10-20 system. We discuss these findings and how they can contribute to ongoing work to bring deep learning enabled brain-computer interfaces into day-to-day applications.},

Relationship between agents such as their spatial proximity and functional similarities could play a crucial role in cooperation between agents. Trust level between agents is an essential factor in evaluating their relationships’ reliability and stability, much as people do. This paper proposes a new model called Relative Needs Entropy (RNE) to assess trust between robotic agents. RNE measures the distance of needs distribution between individual agents or groups of agents. To exemplify its utility, we implement and demonstrate our trust model through experiments simulating a heterogeneous multi-robot grouping task in a persistent urban search and rescue mission consisting of tasks at two levels of difficulty. The results suggest that RNE trust-Based grouping of robots can achieve better performance and adaptability for diverse task execution compared to the state-of-the-art energy-based or distance-based grouping models.},

  abstract  = {The surrogate-assisted optimization algorithm is a method to solve expensive optimization problems by constructing a predicted evaluation model to replace the real objective function. The evaluation of the objective function is generally time-consuming and the target is to use a small amount of exact function evaluation (EFE) to achieve better solutions in shorter time. The generation and selection of the candidate solutions to have the EFE are the most important. For the generation of candidate solutions, this paper proposes an ensemble method for two state-of-the-art models, i.e. the Gaussian process (GP) and the Radial basis function (RBF) model to have better prediction of the solutions. For the selection of candidate solutions, the traditional similarity-based multipoint infill criterion (SMIC) strategy is modified and the proposed method is termed the best SMIC (bSMIC). The social learning particle swarm optimization (SLPSO) algorithm is used as the basic optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed ensemble surrogate-assisted SLPSO (ESLPSO) has been fully analyzed in various problems and compared with other algorithms.},

Traditional FJSP ignores sequence-dependent setup times and resource constraints. However, these constraints should be taken into account during the manufacturing process. To deal with the extended FJSP with sequence-dependent setup times and resource constraints, this paper proposes a self-learning harris hawks optimization (SLHHO) algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to get the smallest makespan. In the proposed algorithm, we use two-vector code to encode machine sequence and operation sequence, design a new decoding method to satisfy the resource constraints, and use reinforcement learning to optimize the key parameters of the algorithm intelligently. We compare it with other three effective algorithms on benchmark instances with varying scales. The experimental result shows that SLHHO performs better and can get a more effective solution.},

  abstract  = {Controlling a large swarm of agents is a challenging task. Shepherding refers to an active field of research that seeks to address this challenge by using a control agent (sheepdog), which guides a swarm (sheep) towards a goal. Traditional shepherding involves switching between two main behaviours: driving the swarm towards the goal, and collecting stray sheep back to the flock. Evidently, the movement of the agents are dependent on their sensed information. Therefore, effectively controlling a swarm is even more challenging when sensor information or communication channels are unreliable. In this paper, we propose a shepherding methodology to achieve efficient swarm control in the presence of noise in the sensed information. The proposed approach consists of a new resting behaviour and a neural network-based reinforcement learning model. The neural network is used to learn shepherding policies using the new resting behaviour, where the objective is to optimise the frequency of sheep-to-dog interactions with varying levels of noise. The proposed approach is validated through simulations. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach results in a more effective and stable performance compared to some conventional shepherding models from the literature.},

  abstract  = {Real-time obstacle avoidance is a vital component for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) when autonomously following mobile ground vehicles (MGVs) in unstructured and dynamic environments. The Artificial Potential Field (APF) technique is a widely used method for UAV path planning due to its simplicity, ease of use and its inherent efficiency in obstacle avoidance. However, this technique has many shortcomings with obstacles such as falling in local minima, tendency to produce longer planned paths when avoiding obstacles, high probability of colliding with symmetrical obstacles, and increase in oscillatory movements near obstacles. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel two-dimensional path planning technique for obstacle avoidance based on the APF method. The proposed technique produces velocity waypoints for the UAV’s planned path based on GPS data and use of basic distance sensors for obstacle avoidance; therefore, it can be deployed on most types of UAVs utilizing flight controllers with autopilots such as PX4 and Ardupilot. The performance of the proposed technique is validated for different simulation scenarios in ROS and Gazebo supported PX4-SITL. The results show the suitability of the proposed technique for real-time obstacle avoidance for UAVs autonomously following MGVs in dynamic environments with different types of obstacles.},

  abstract  = {The development of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) is driven by the many benefits they offer. However, the complexities associated with ADSs and their interactions with the environment pose challenges for their safety assurance. A key aspect during its development process is knowing the capabilities, limitations, and being able to convey them in a clear manner for various types of stakeholders. The Operational Design Domain (ODD) concept was introduced to define the operating boundaries where a system can operate safely. It is therefore a key element for the safety assurance of ADSs. Efforts have been made to define the scope and the content an ODD for ADSs should cover, however there remains the need for a common, exchangeable, executable, and human-readable format for the description. This paper presents a language for the description of the ODD of ADSs, in a textual format that leans on natural language influence. Such format is intended to be both human and machine-readable and would be relevant to end users such as regulators and systems designers. The two-level abstraction approach – a structured natural language representation and a formal representation (covered across two papers) -- has been developed to have the ability to describe complex ODD conditionalities and utilize a well-defined domain ontology to achieve rich semantics. It is aimed to support ODD related activities throughout the development cycle of ADSs (specification as well as verification and validation), while covering a diverse range of stakeholders.},

  abstract  = {Continuum robots are utilized in applications where a high-level accuracy and delicacy is desired, which in return demand a robust control design. However, due to their nonlinearity and elasticity, this task of robust control design presents a steep challenge. A challenge that is mostly simplified through restrictive modelling and operating assumptions. One common assumption used is the uncertainty matching condition, in which the controller is expected to have direct access to any affecting uncertainty. This assumption is difficult to justify in continuum robots as due to their high nonlinear dynamics, practical limitations, and congested operating environments. Uncertainties could affect continuum robots from any of their states and are not necessarily reachable by the controller. Here, we will solve this problem using the multi-surface sliding mode control technique in combination with RBF neural networks as our uncertainties approximators. First, Cosserat rod theory is used to derive the dynamic model of the continuum robot due to its generality. Then, we propose an adaptive RBF neural network based multi-surface sliding mode control to guarantee tracking stability. Simulation results are included to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

To this end we evaluate the accuracy, inference time and power consumption for two different deep neural network-based recognition models and compare the results to other computer systems available as standard.

  abstract  = {Gesture Elicitation Studies (GES) are a widely used empirical method to develop gesture vocabularies, interaction models and methods for gesture-based systems in different contexts. While GES show great promise to identify user-defined gestures, there are inherent problems with current methods used for GES. Especially during the ongoing pandemic, it has been nearly impossible to conduct in-person, in-lab GES, while ensuring the safety and well-being of the participants, and complying with social distancing regulations. Further, with prevailing experiment designs, increasing the number of participants is time consuming, while in-lab environments also limit ecological validity. This study explores an intuitive way of conducting self-guided GES using immersive Virtual Reality (VR), utilizing its capability to simulate various contexts to enhance ecological validity. We present a methodology and a tool set that use an immersive VR environment to conduct ecologically valid GES (as a use case) while requiring minimal involvement by the investigator. We evaluate our method using the case of a smart home environment and measure participant acceptance and discuss opportunities and challenges involved in this method. We believe that this study will help HCI research to move forward with participatory design research, even when lab experiments are difficult to conduct.},

Currently, the inherent complexity of human physical activities makes it difficult to accurately recognize gestures with wearable sensors, especially in real time. To this end, a real-time hand gesture recognition system is presented in this paper. In particular, sliding window technology and y-axis threshold are used to detect intended gestures from a continuous data stream and then the segmented data are classified by applying a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. After noise is removed, six-axis sensor data from wrist-worn devices are fed into the model without requiring feature engineering. We use twelve common hand gestures to evaluate the performance of our model. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed system with an accuracy of 99.8\% on average. Our approach allows for an accurate and nonindividual hand gesture recognition. It holds potential to be integrated into a smart watch or other wearable devices for intuitive human computer interaction.},

  abstract  = {At present, sign language recognition (SLR) researchers are mainly committed to establishing a sign language recognition model based on single-mode data. Nevertheless, this manipulation often leads to a defective understanding of the sign language semantics and ignoring some visual information. In a nutshell, the challenges locate redundancy removing and the alignment of the sign language data with the given tag. To solve the conundrum, this paper proposes a deep learning strategy called CRB-Net, which has used a kind of multimodal fusion attention mechanism. We first extract the features from RGB video and depth video, respectively, then conduct multi-modal fusion. Finally, the fused feature information is fed into an encoder-decoder network to achieve the goal of end-to-end continuous SLR. We verify the effectiveness of our method on three datasets, including the German dataset RWTH-Phoenix-Weather-2014, the Chinese dataset USTC-CSL and the Chinese dataset TJUT-SLRT. As shown by experimental results, the accuracy of 98.5\% of our framework CRB-Net has outperformed the state-of-the-art works in the comparison, both in accuracy and algorithm execution efficiency.},

Recently, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and projectors have been used in a natural public facility such as a park. However, these displays sometimes spoil natural scenery because they look like artificial materials. Our proposed method is useful to develop a natural landscape-friendly display. We develop a grass pixel system to display the gradation. The grass pixel consists of yellow and green grass, and the length of the green grass moves vertically. The grass pixel uses a pin-based shape-changing system using a stepper motor to control the grass length dynamically. We evaluated the gradation of the grass pixel through an image processing of HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value of Brightness) values. In the measurement, the pixel system moved the grass length from minimum to maximum, and we took images of the running grass pixel from several angles. As a result, we observed that the HSV values changed linearly with the movement of the length of the green grass. We also developed a 3 × 3 pixels grass display, which can show several gradation animations as demonstrations.},

To achieve this purpose, an XLNet-based language model is presented to extract news keywords and their relationships. The clustering algorithm is designed to obtain news event topic clustering and named entity clustering. At the same time, we build the relationship mappings in news events to visualize the correlation between news events better.

The possible faults in a system are modeled as faulty transitions (a subset of unobservable transitions) of a Petri net system. Moreover, the observable transitions are indistinguishable (i.e., two or more transitions may share the same label). We first construct two compact diagnosers, called a redundant basis reachability diagnoser and a basis reachability diagnoser, of a net system involving faulty transitions. Then, a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability is provided by checking whether each cycle in the two diagnosers satisfies particular conditions. The approach is efficient since the exhaustive enumeration of the reachability space is avoided thanks to a compact representation of the state space of a discrete event system.},

The RRAP aims to achieve the system&#39;s optimal reliability considering the minimum number of redundant system components while keeping volume, weight, and cost in mind as the key constraints. However, the dynamic changes in the manufacturing process lead to uncertainty in these system parameters, which makes them the suitable fit for being formulated as a fuzzy quantity. There are previous studies that have modelled the parameters as fuzzy and solved various fuzzy RRAP as separate problems to cope with the uncertainty. However, owing to some similarities between the cases, such as fuzzy series and complex bridge systems, they can also be solved simultaneously. As a result, using the Multi-factorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) method, this paper proposes a technique for simultaneously solving two fuzzy RRAP cases: fuzzy complex (bridge) and fuzzy series system. The similar characteristics of these two systems facilitate the evolution process through implicit knowledge. The experiments&#39; findings demonstrate that the developed methodology, as compared to other evolutionary approaches using a benchmark dataset, was able to solve these problems effectively.},

The aim of these methods is to project the users and items to a common representation space and obtain their latent features. Although these methods have been widely used in the literature, they suffer from the limited expressiveness of Dot product function. In other words, Dot product cannot describe different impacts of various latent factors. To solve this issue, we propose a novel recommender system named Deep-MSR which exploits the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and stacked auto-encoder network (SAN) to extract item latent factors and user latent factors from user-item interaction matrix. The obtained latent factors are used in the proposed rating prediction module which integrates user preferences and item features in the recommendation process. Our experiments on two well-known datasets show that our method can outperform the competitive baseline recommendation methods.},

  abstract  = {Tourists’ revisit has significant monetary benefits to destinations because the cost of retaining existing visitors is less than attracting new visitors. Re-visit intention is often based on tourists experience and satisfaction at a destination. An important aspect that influences the relationship between satisfaction and intention to revisit is the weather conditions at a destination given the increased frequency of heatwaves that strike summer holiday destinations over the summer months. This work applies natural language processing and classification techniques to evaluate the impact of weather information on revisit intention utilizing reviews from TripAdvisor and online weather data. Information retrieval techniques (Doc2Vec) are applied on online reviews collected during the summer months between 2010-2019 from tourists that visited Cyprus. Reviews are labeled as &quot;revisits&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; based on their textual content. The labelled reviews dataset is enhanced with weather information based on the reviews’ timestamp, such as temperature and humidity of tourists’ country of origin and Cyprus at the time of the visit to the hotel/destination. To account for the influence of hotel infrastructure and available services to deal with heatwaves (i.e., climate-controlled), the training dataset included hotel star rating as an additional parameter. An ensemble gradient boosting tree classifier is trained utilizing the compiled dataset to predict revisit intention. The classifier is evaluated against the area under the curve. To interpret the classifier’s inherent patterns, a popular machine learning interpretation technique is used, namely Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP). Visualizations of the model using SHAP indicate that the heat index and weather difference between destination and country of origin influence revisit intention. Such preliminary insights are encouraging for further investigations with an end goal to develop a decision support system to assist destination managers during their target marketing campaigns.},

  abstract  = {Pressure-sensitive smart floors deployed within homes can give great insight to the health and activity level of individuals through gait and location information. Due to the ever-changing dynamic nature of household deployments involving furniture movement, floor tile shifts, and sensor drift, challenges arise in ensuring the constant reliability of floor sensor readings over time. This paper presents a procedure to automatically calibrate a smart floor’s force sensors without specialized physical effort. The calibration algorithm automatically filters out non-human static weight while retaining weight generated by human activity. This technique is designed to correctly translate sensor values to weight units even when direct access to the force sensors is not available and when a shared tile floor sits above the sensor grid. These calibrated sensor values can then feed machine learning techniques used to extract individual contact points generated by a person’s walking cycle. Using known human weights but no knowledge of the human’s location or walking trajectory, this calibration technique resulted in small percentage differences of -7.8\%, -4.8\%, and -1.6\% for the mean, median, and mode of calibrated smart floor walking sequences, respectively.},

Wearable technology has the potential to help patients with AD improve their self-management by allowing them to monitor itching, one of the most burdensome symptoms which can lead to impaired quality of life. In this research we aimed to investigate patient experience and acceptance of a wrist-worn wearable system to measure nocturnal scratch behavior and provide objective feedback based on the measured data. To provide a comfortable and easy-to-use system, a wristband and user interface were co-designed with a patient with AD. We conducted a 14-day field trial in which four patients used our prototype. The results showed that the prototype was generally well accepted and would be helpful in understanding their itching conditions and enhancing current therapeutic strategies. We then discuss the implications of our results for designing wearable healthcare systems for patients with AD.},

  abstract  = {The possibility to automate medical triage is appealing as it could decrease the burden on humans. In instances of mass casualty events, this could allow for much faster triage as the process would occur in parallel instead of in sequence. The greatest efficacy could be achieved with a system that relies solely on remote sensors, which would necessitate an adaptation of existing triage algorithms that rely on human observations. A policy capturing method is proposed to demonstrate the possibility to mimic medical experts’ decision-making model of triage based only on observable parameters sampled by wearables: heart rate, respiration rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation. Two medical experts classified simulated cases from these five parameters and sex in regards of four potential outcomes: Delayed green, Urgent yellow, Immediate red, or Expectant black. Seven model types were trained to replicate the decision pattern of the experts. Overall, the decision pattern was best captured by a decision tree (test set accuracy of 92\% and 76\% for Raters 1 and 2, respectively). Interestingly, common physiological differences were found across the four classifications for both experts. The model was optimized during a workshop with the experts. We discuss the implications of using such a model to support medical triage, especially for military contexts.},

In our study, we experimented with several classifiers, including k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree, Gaussian Naive Bayesian, neural network with multiplayer perception (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM), and several combinations of static skeleton features. In all scenarios, KNN outperforms other classifiers consistently.

A useful application of this in the context of ambient assisted living is in the monitoring of older adults daily for improved wellbeing and quality of life. The existing solutions are based on per-individual monitoring, therefore the systems are managed independently for each ambient intelligent environment. In this paper, we proposed a centralised system for the collective monitoring of individuals in a community. The proposed approach is based on a cloud-based solution where data collection and processing are centralised. Since the data are aggregated for all the residents, the system has the potential of promoting social interaction among the community residents. Additionally, the cost of the in-home monitoring system can be reduced since only the sensing devices are required for data collection, while the processing is carried out on the cloud infrastructure. This also reduces the tedious tasks required in setting up individual home monitoring systems. The role of assistive robots, the possibility of remote monitoring and potential challenges of the proposed approach are explored.},

  abstract  = {With the large-scale application of lithium-ion batteries (LIB), using deep neural networks to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of LIB has gradually become a hotshot in recent years. RUL prediction method based on deep neural network can avoid studying electrochemical phenomena and manual extracting the features in battery. But single neural network has the different prediction accuracy and features extraction on different dataset. In this study, an ensemble method for the heterogeneous neural network is proposed, which integrates the prediction results of multiple heterogeneous neural networks with the adaptive weight. The weight of the neural network is higher with the closer correlation to the majority prediction results, vice versa. Furthermore, the weight of the neural network is adjusted via the predicting results for neural network on the different dataset, so that the computed weight of the neural network is adapted to the various dataset, and the effects of poor predictions of certain neural networks can be reduced sufficiently. The effectiveness of the ensemble method is verified on MIT-Stanford LIB degradation dataset, and the results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy than the existing ensemble methods for neural network.},

However, the sparsity of the user-POI matrix and the cold-start issue have generated serious challenges, resulting in a substantial decrease in collaborative filtering methods’ recommendation results. In reality, location-based recommendation demands spatiotemporal context awareness. In order to overcome these challenges, we develop an embedding model based on the heterogeneous graph attention network. Geographic influence, social relation and historical check-in influence are captured in a unified way by constructing a user-POI heterogeneous graph. Subsequently, we use the LSTM-based model to learn the category weight of the next POI to select. We are developing a score function to recommend the next POI for users by integrating category weights, user preferences and time impact. We conduct experiments on existing large-scale datasets to evaluate the performance of our model. The results demonstrate our proposal is superior to other rivals. Additionally, our method has been significantly improved compared with other competitive approaches in terms of recommending cold-start POI.},

Recently, Secure FL framework is developed to address data leakage issue when central node is not fully trustable. This encryption process has made existing DL model watermarking schemes impossible to embed watermark at the central node. In this paper, we propose a novel client-side Federated Learning watermarking method to tackle the model verification issue under the Secure FL framework. In specific, we design a backdoor-based watermarking scheme to allow model owners to embed their pre-designed noise patterns into the FL deep model. Thus, our method provides reliable copyright protection while ensuring the data privacy because the central node has no access to the encrypted gradient information. The experimental results have demonstrated the efficiency of our method in terms of both FL model performance and watermarking robustness.},

  abstract  = {Training Deep neural networks (DNNs) on noisy labeled datasets is a challenging problem, because learning on mislabeled examples deteriorates the performance of the network. As the ground truth availability is limited with real-world noisy datasets, previous papers created synthetic noisy datasets by randomly modifying the labels of training examples of clean datasets. However, no final conclusions can be derived by just using this random noise, since it excludes feature-dependent noise. Thus, it is imperative to generate feature-dependent noisy datasets that additionally provide ground truth. Therefore, we propose an intuitive approach to creating feature-dependent noisy datasets by utilizing the training predictions of DNNs on clean datasets that also retain true label information. We refer to these datasets as &quot;Pseudo Noisy datasets&quot;. We conduct several experiments to establish that Pseudo noisy datasets resemble feature-dependent noisy datasets across different conditions. We further randomly generate synthetic noisy datasets with the same noise distribution as that of Pseudo noise (referred as &quot;Randomized Noise&quot;) to empirically show that i) learning is easier with feature-dependent label noise compared to random noise, ii) irrespective of noise distribution, Pseudo noisy datasets mimic feature-dependent label noise and iii) current training methods are not generalizable to feature-dependent label noise. Therefore, we believe that Pseudo noisy datasets will be quite helpful to study and develop robust training methods.},

Though social media plat-forms allow everyone to express their opinions freely, they create convenience for rumor propagation in the meantime, which brings huge negative influence on the public and makes rumor detection extremely necessary. Currently, the most effective methods regard rumor propagation network as a graph and adopt graph convolutional networks (GCN) to detect rumor automatically. Such methods achieve promising performance in rumor detection, however, we argue that they have two critical defects: 1) they neglect the position contributions of rumor nodes in a graph, reducing the accuracy of rumor detection results; 2) they are inadequate in dealing with imbalanced data, which also indicates the inflexibility and the poor generalization ability of the model. To overcome these issues, we incorporate Katz centrality into spectral-domain graph convolution and propose a novel model named Out-In-Degree Graph Convolutional Networks (OID-GCN). Specifically, besides enhancing accuracy, Katz centrality can efficiently capture the position information of nodes, while the rest structure of OID-GCN shows a superb ability in dealing with imbalanced data. Comprehensive experimental results on two real-world datasets Twitter-15 and Twitter-16 demonstrate our OID-GCN outperforms existing methods.},

  abstract  = {Mental stress is the main well-being problem worldwide today. It is responsible for most of all mental-brain diseases. It does not need any specific reason to happen. It can be experienced from a very little incident to a huge incident. The consequence of it depends on how people handle it. Depression and anxiety are the results of mental stress, and they are the major challenges in today’s world. Depression and anxiety are the leading causes of suicide. Most of the time suicidal patients hide their true feelings and fail to communicate their psychiatric problems to physicians. The specific issues that need to be addressed are finding an easy, reliable and realistic way to diagnose mental stress to keep it from becoming a serious and irreversible condition. The primary prevention of mental stress utilizing machine learning algorithms based on reward and punishment processing is important to avoid mental diseases. Several techniques have been used to detect mental stress, and very few papers have tried to detect a patients’ comorbidity condition. However, literature shows that there are still chances of further improvement in this field. The traditional methods of detecting mental stress involve a statistical questionnaire approach with some shortcomings as results based on the traditional approach can be biased, which is not possible if Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a method to evaluate the EEG signals on thirty-two individuals for identifying comorbid patients using nine machine learning classifiers based on reward and punishment processing. The performance of our method is also shown to be better than some existing methods.},

  abstract  = {Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in image classification, a large amount of training data is required for training models. Especially in industrial applications, not only is there a demand for reducing the cost of labeling images, but also, it is difficult to obtain a large amount of training images. Several approaches have been proposed to improve classification accuracy by embedding human knowledge other than labels into the models. However, in these approaches, the annotation methods tend to become complex and applicable only to specific model architectures corresponding to those methods.In this study, we propose a new approach to improve the image classification accuracy of CNNs by adding human knowledge as simple region annotations. In our method, annotators draw the regions that attract the most attention as a single ellipse per image for classifying image categories. This annotation is called non-strict attentional region annotation (NARA) and is used for training CNNs together with the labels. We also propose a training method using NARA, which is applicable to common CNNs. For the proof of concept, we have added region annotations to all 5,000 images of the STL-10 training dataset. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is effective to improve image classification accuracy with relatively inexpensive additional cost. Our annotation dataset is available at: https://git.io/stl10nara.},

In this study, a TS similarity detection framework is proposed to explore alike-behavior fresh produce (FP) in the yield forecast domain through several factors. The sequential daily yield datasets of three types of FP, including strawberry, raspberry, and blueberry, as well as environmental information related to the Santa Maria region, California, between the years 2011 to 2019, are used to develop and evaluate the models. The framework&#39;s output is decided to be the similarity percentage (SP) by considering some thresholds that have been tuned using several synthetic yield datasets. According to the results, the SP is 82\% and 52\% for strawberry versus raspberry and strawberry versus blueberry, respectively. This indicates the fact that strawberry and raspberry have a relatively similar yield pattern compared to blueberry, which is a considerable matter in generalizing forecast models.},

In previous work, a notion of equivalence named FH-Bisimulation was defined for OA, coming with both Strong and Weak flavors, where Weak means ignoring internal moves when they do not affect the external behavior. Both flavors have been proven to be congruent for the OA’s composition. In this paper, we propose a new definition of (weak) OA, that is both more expressive for encoding the behavior of parameterized systems and suitable as a finite encoding of weak OA. We name this meta (weak) OA and provide two methods to check their equivalence, either explicitly building the meta-WOA, or constructing their meta open transitions on-demand. The last strategy has better termination properties.},

  abstract  = {Due to the increasing demand for computing power in many industries, heterogeneous multi-core processors are needed to solve the problem. In order to make full use of multi-core computing resources, an effective scheduling strategy for heterogeneous multi-core processor tasks is required. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) is usually used to represent data dependencies between tasks. Each task needs to be executed in the order of its data dependencies. Research under this model has made great progress. In this article, we study and improve the DAG-based task model, taking into account the fact that not only one-way data transmission is possible between tasks, but also two-way data exchange. Based on this model, we propose two scheduling strategies, overall cutting scheduling (OCS) and greedy selection scheduling (GSS). As far as we know, there is currently no work considering the existence of a special task model of two-way transmission between tasks, nor has it considered task scheduling in two-way transmission. In order to evaluate and demonstrate its feasibility and practicability, we proposed a reference method and supplemented with large-scale system experiments. These experiments show that the scheduling efficiency of the proposed method is greatly improved.},

Most exoskeletons struggle to accommodate a slight variation in functionality from their original design. This work addresses the design and development of a light-weight semi-active elbow exoskeleton. The main objectives consist of the development of a semi-active actuation mechanism with an adaptive exoskeleton frame and harness to accommodate varying user anthropometrics. The effectiveness of the proposed exoskeleton design has been evaluated through simulation. Furthermore, the system has been implemented in order to determine the physical feasibility and practicality through rapid fabrication prototyping. The outcomes of the study show that the exoskeleton can adjust to varying anthropometrics and assist elbow flexion, reducing stress and fatigue on the human elbow joint and muscles induced by gravity during flexion.},

  abstract  = {Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) requires more significant investment than traditional systems engineering in the early system life cycle phases. Program management justifies this additional investment by arguing that such investments can be expected to produce continuous gains across later phases of the systems life cycle resulting from early detection of defects, risk reduction, improved communication, superior supply chain integration, product line definition, and enhanced traceability. Since systems continue to evolve over their life cycle, system models need to be updated continually to reflect the system&#39;s current state and thereby sustain value. However, in today&#39;s systems engineering organizations, the current practice is to reallocate modeling resources to other projects once initial modeling on a particular project is completed. This practice results in a resource shortfall that impedes the ability to continuously update system models through the later phases of the system life cycle. This paper presents how digital twin technology can be exploited within MBSE to ensure continuous model updates throughout the system life cycle. This paper also presents preliminary results from prototyping and experiments conducted with a digital twin that is continuously updated with data from the physical system operating in the real world. Finally, this paper shows how operational analysis and system modeling can be significantly enhanced by leveraging digital twin technology within MBSE.},

However, this assumption is not quite realistic because some interferences such as noise, friction and inaccurate control input could disturb the robot motion, leading to a stochastic behavior. In this paper, we tackle the problem of planning a multi-robot path based on the robot probabilistic motion model. At the beginning, we model the robot action with several probability distributions, where the basic actions include going forward, turning left/right, going backward, and wait. We then extend A-star algorithm incorporating these actions such that an optimal path can be planned for a single robot. Based on this result, we apply conflict-based search to optimally plan path for a multi-robot system. Because probability calculation demands too much computation we simplify the conflict detection scheme and make it applicable for online practice.},

Simulating measurement noise is one method of reducing these performance differences. Here, we examine the effect of measurement noise on the behaviour and topology of evolved neuromodulated neurocontrollers applied to control evader agents in a pursuit-evasion game. Measurement noise in the form of a zero-mean, normally distributed random signal is applied to the evader’s radar range and angle signals. The results indicate that increasing the levels of measurement noise increases the number of generations required to evolve fit agents. Noise at the neurocontroller outputs is of lesser amplitude than that at the inputs, suggesting a low-pass filtering operation. When levels of measurement noise different to those with which they were evolved were applied to the neurocontrollers, greater amplitude in the measurement noise signal increased the average length of time required to capture the evader. When the level of measurement noise was changed during evolution, after a few generations of further evolution, the neurocontrollers were able to adapt to both increases and decreases in the amount of noise. The evolutionary neurocontrollers are robust to high levels of measurement noise and can adapt to large changes in noise amplitude. This suggests that the neurocontrollers will be robust when used in the field on real robots, and that they may be a good solution to bridging the gap between simulation and reality.},

  abstract  = {As far back as Weiner, orthonormal basis functions were proposed for expressing the response of linear dynamical systems. Later, such functions were found useful for controller design in the case of linear time-invariant systems. This study explores the use of orthonormal functions in model predictive controller design for biomechanical sit-to-stand (STS) movement. Due to its simplicity and flexibility, model predictive control (MPC) has been popular in process control applications. MPC assumes finite prediction and control horizons, and optimizes a quadratic cost of state and incremental control variables subject to state and input constraints. In this study, MPC controller design technique is applied to a multi-segment biomechanical model, tasked to mimic physiological STS movement. Two sets of orthogonal functions, that is, Laguerre and Kautz functions, were explored. In both cases, MPC design generated physiologically constrained torques at ankle, knee, and hip joints that facilitated smooth STS movement. The MPC framework can be extended to controller design for other voluntary movements in a model based environment.},

  abstract  = {A realistic control strategy for stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) should consider uncertainties such as unknown dynamics of the agents, limited accessibility of the leader state, and external disturbances. Here, we propose an adaptive fuzzy control structure for a class of stochastic uncertain MAS that have partially unknown heterogeneous higher-order dynamics of the agents. Artificial potential functions (APFs) are incorporated to model the communication among the agents, and the unknown dynamics are approximated by the aid of fuzzy logic systems. The current work extends our previous work to the case where only some of the agents could access the states of the leader to reach an n-dimensional consensus on the leader states. The overall system’s stability is assured using Lyapunov stability theory, and all of the closed-loop signals of the system are shown to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the mean square. Simulation results ensure the capability of the system in low tracking error with reasonable control input usage.},

However, the state of the art in eye-tracking applications suffers from a significant amount of measurement noise. Also, the inherent nature of the eye-gaze movement adds to the difficulty of obtaining valuable information from eye-gaze measurements. In this paper, a novel classification approach is proposed to classify the lines being read based on eye-gaze measurements. The proposed approach consists of a novel Kalman smoother-based preprocessing procedure to separate eye-gaze data corresponding to different text lines and to reduce variance. The preprocessed data is then used to train two different classifiers, one based on Gaussian discriminants and the other based on support vector machines. The resulting line-classification approach is shown to be superior in performance compared to other recent approaches.},

  abstract  = {Objectively measuring and monitoring human mental states in a non-intrusive way is important in improving the context-awareness of smart objects. One of the suitable bio-signals in measuring human mental states is aye-tracking data, as visual is the first channel of information collection. In addition, eye-tracking data shows the process of human-system interactions. Traditionally, many studies have been conducted to investigate the correlations between eye-tracking data and human mental states. Recently, with advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, the spatial and temporal patterns of eye-tracking data can be deeply analyzed for detecting human mental states. This study aims to explore and review eye-tracking parameters and state-of-art methods for mental states assessments. The study reveals that both statistical methods and novel methods, such as machine learning and deep learning have been applied to process eye-tracking data. Besides, novel features extracted from eye-tracking data, such as gaze-bin and entropy have been used in assessing human mental states. This review is expected to provide references for eye-tracking data analysis.},

This motivates an investigation of eye activity for emotion, cognitive load and task transition recognition in a single study with the goal of understanding the capability of eye activity. We recorded 15 participants’ eye data while they completed a sequence of free-viewing emotional image tasks and a sequence of arithmetic tasks. Eye activity features within fixed analysis windows were extracted to classify (i) between four levels of arousal, (ii) three levels of valence, (iii) between three levels of cognitive load, (iv) between affective and cognitive tasks, and (v) between task transition and non-transition. The results suggest that eye activity can best be used for task transition recognition, with an accuracy of 77\%, followed by cognitive load level recognition, then affective and cognitive task recognition. Implications of this finding include automatically segmenting long and continuous signals into task units with eye activity before analyzing human behavior.},

In order to investigate the performance of saccade and fixation detection using gaze and pupil data, three representative saccade detection algorithms are applied to both pupil data and gaze data collected with and without head movement, and their performance is evaluated against a stimulus-induced ground truth under different measures. Results indicate that saccade/fixation detection using pupil data generally provides better performance than using gaze data with an 8.6\% improvement in Cohen’s Kappa (averaged across the three algorithms), even when moderate head movement is involved. Hence, pupil data can be used as an alternative to gaze data for saccade and fixation detection in wearable contexts with less effort in calibration and higher accuracy.},

Additionally, the still requested customization of cars leads to more variants, models, and decoupled development cycles in terms of software and hardware. To ensure a flexible APN design, this paper demonstrates a modular approach for the power management combining auction theory and service-oriented architecture (SOA) for APNs with multiple voltage levels. The presented algorithm facilitates distributed decision-making by the growing number of components in the network regarding their power consumption. Hence, the individual components adapt their behavior in terms of component states and the APN condition. Furthermore, the SOA paradigm ensures the scalability and fault tolerance of the proposed algorithm.},

In this sense, a process for supporting decision makers in selecting indicators is desired and so, the organization can prioritize the most important indicators to be monitored in a given time window to leverage its business strategy. In this research, the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) was used to identify key indicators and a decision support model is proposed based on FITradeoff to prioritize the indicators.

  abstract  = {The growing generation of solid waste in developing countries is a problem with environmental, social, and economic impacts that draws the attention of authorities since it is associated with the results that countries present with its economic activities and the consumption of natural resources. In Brazil, for example, public authorities sanctioned the Brazilian National Solid Waste Policy that extends the responsibility for solid waste management to all segments of society through reverse logistics actions. On the other hand, the linear model of managing waste in Brazil (production-consumption-disposal) does not absorb anymore the amount of waste generated. In this sense, a transition to a circular model (production-consumption-reintroduction) must occur to proper management of the waste generated to environmental, economic, and social collapses may be avoided. However, the responsibilities&#39; definition is a conflictual situation because it is group decision-making between segments that present different perspectives and objectives. Moreover, the current way of defining responsibilities and allocating their costs has been a point of dissatisfaction in Brazilian society. Thus, this study aimed to propose a group decision support system to develop actions, define responsibilities and allocate costs between the segments fairly to promote the transition to a circular economy model. The system is based on the combination of Problem Structuring Method, FITradeoff method, and Shapley value. A case study with packaging is presented to validate the system. The results showed that the system made the segments reach mutually acceptable decisions on actions, responsibilities, and allocated costs. Furthermore, it promoted their satisfaction and commitment to action implementation.},

HIFU treatments allow a noninvasive and non-ionising approach when compared to more conventional cancer treatments, such as radio and chemo-therapy or open surgery, which can lead to a multitude of complications after the treatment. In recent years, a realistic thermal model accounting for patient-specific materials to design HIFU treatment plans was introduced, along with an evolutionary strategy to optimize them. However, the execution times of this model is too prohibitive to allow for a routine use. This paper presents a comparison of two distinct distributed evolutionary models employing a further optimized fitness model. The experiments show up to 6 times decrease in the evolution time.

  abstract  = {Recent studies on stochastic resonance have been considered in various fields for engineering applications. Chaotic dynamics derive a phenomenon called chaotic resonance, which is similar to stochastic resonance. The engineering applications of chaotic resonance are limited due to its controlling difficulty, although it exhibits a high sensitivity to signal responses. To address this limitation, we previously proposed a &quot;reduced region of orbit&quot; (RRO) feedback method which induces chaotic resonance using external feedback signals. This method was evaluated under noise-free conditions. However, in practical scenarios, background noise and measurement error are observed when estimating the RRO feedback strength. The influence of these factors on chaotic resonance must be evaluated for preliminary practical application of chaotic resonance. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated chaotic resonance induced by the RRO feedback method in chaotic neural systems under stochastic noise. We focus on chaotic resonance induced by RRO feedback signals in a discrete neural system comprising excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which are typical neural systems that entail chaotic resonance under additive noise and feedback signals, including measurement errors (called contaminant noise). Although both types of noise commonly degrade the degree of synchronization of chaotic resonance induced by the RRO feedback strength, their characteristics are considerably different. In actual neural systems, the influence of noise is inevitable; therefore, this study highlighted the importance of noise countermeasures during the application of chaotic resonance.},

As MASs work in networked environments, their security control becomes critically desirable in response to various cyberattacks, such as denial of service (DoS). The resulting topologies caused by DoS attacks may destabilize the consensus performance of MASs. Especially under connectivity-broken attacks, the connectivity between agents is destroyed. To deal with these difficulties, a novel defense strategy consisting of distributed delayed consensus control is proposed. To guarantee cyber secure consensus of the addressed systems to determine the stability of the resulting error system, sufficient criteria including the condition in terms of LMI are derived on the basis of the Caputo fractional difference operator, by employing the Lyapunov function approach, algebraic graph theory and average dwell time (ADT). At last, the effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated by performing simulations on the proposed systems.},

  abstract  = {Object affordance learning is the ability to process information about objects and how to use them. Embedding this knowledge in robots is an essential step for the development of intelligent and truly autonomous agents. This work proposes the development of a framework for learning affordances for robotic manipulation. The proposed approach was implemented as a reinforcement function in a network with a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm and trained in simulation with a humanoid robot. Among different affordance complexities (touching and grabbing the object), the results show a rate of up to 95\% correctness in the best scenario, with the agent properly performing all desired actions. Such results suggest that it is possible to define reward functions representing the object’s affordances for different objects.},

  abstract  = {Style image painting is the process of using some stylized strokes to redraw a reference image purposefully and meaningfully. It is a kind of style image generation. In recent years, the application of GAN has greatly improved the quality of generated images for style image generation. However, those methods which use GAN are usually non-serialized. To solve this problem, reinforcement learning and RNN methods are applied to the generation of style images based on strokes. To speed up training, stroke-based style image painting using CNN framework is also proposed. But none of the existing style image painting methods takes into account the content distribution in the reference image, which makes the painting process lack a clear order. We extract the feature of the object contained in the image through the content acquisition module and use the optimal transmission theory to construct a compound loss function to integrate the content information into the painting process. As more advanced macro content information is added to the painting process, our painting method can draw images in a more orderly way. We have conducted a lot of experiments to prove that our method is superior to the current state-of-the-art style image painting method.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new paradigm that utilizes trained models shared by multiple systems and also proposes a mandatory method to achieve it. Reinforcement learning and transfer learning are powerful technologies to automatically build systems composed of shared devices with various combinations of installation positions and device types. However, current works are premised on an individual system, and learning knowledge is not shared across multiple systems. Our proposed method enables systems to select and transfer an appropriate trained model from shared models across multiple systems. The trained model is selected on the basis of the similarity of input data of learning. The proposed method enables individual systems to complete learning with a small number of demonstrations while maintaining an appropriate number of trained models in the learning model pool. Moreover, since the proposed method does not depend on a specific learning algorithm, it can be applied to various systems. In the simulation of the robot navigation task, the selection of the transfer model by the proposed method increased the sum of rewards by 32\% compared with randomly selecting the transfer model. In addition, in experiments on multiple successive learning requests, the proposed method updated the learning model pool and increased the sum of rewards of all systems by 34\% compared with the case without transfer learning.},

In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to handle imbalanced multi-class classification by combining the population-based sampling method and a multi-expert classifier. In the implementation, we choose the Ant Colony Optimization to realize the sampling process. As for the classifier, the voting mechanism is applied to intensify the weak classifiers. To test the algorithm’s performance, we choose 10 representative imbalanced multi-class data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. G – mean and mAUC are chosen as the metrics. According to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm dominates in 8 data sets and gets a second place in 1 data set when evaluated by G – mean, and ranks first in 3 data sets and top-3 among the most for mAUC.},

Nevertheless, existing methods require extensive environmental interactions or high-quality demonstrations, which limits their application in practice. To alleviate this problem, a practical algorithm, named self-imitation learning with guide reward (SILGR), is proposed. The algorithm selects relatively good trajectories as expert data instead of external demonstrations and then assigns a guide reward to each transition. The criterion of the guide reward generator improves consistently with the evolution of the agent. In this way, the agent explores the environment in a task-relevant direction and exploits the experience more effectively, improving sample efficiency and performance. The results on four continuous locomotion tasks indicate that the proposed scheme achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art deep RL methods.},

The symptoms of Cybersickness are similar to motion sickness symptoms. The adverse effects of this common phenomenon can negatively affect the training outcome and benefits using VR, undermine users’ health and usefulness of simulators as it involves health risk and contributes to the increase of dropout rates. Therefore, to mitigate these issues, MS should be detected and measured. The primary objective of this study is to subjectively and objectively detect and quantify cybersickness level using a helicopter simulator. This study has also investigated the change in cybersickness self-reported scores in different weather conditions such as clear and stormy. Simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) has been employed for subjective scoring. This research also aimed to correlate SSQ scores with physiological data such as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). The findings demonstrated that the SSQ total score (TS) has increased significantly from clear weather to stormy for the participants. There is also a positive correlation found between the change in TS and the amount of GSR but not significant.},

The correlation between elite baseball players’ visual acuity and their on-field performance has been the subject of many previous research studies. But realistic computer simulation is rarely used in those studies. We have developed a computer graphics program to simulate a pitched baseball at different speeds and rotations, and used it to evaluate the visual abilities of US college Division I level athletes in baseball and softball to correctly identify the spin, seam count, and a projected geometric shape on the simulated baseball. Each athlete who completed the test was then given a set of Visual Acuity Test scores. These results were then correlated with their individual batting statistics. The results showed a statistically significant, positive correlation between the seam recognition ability and many offensive performance indicators such as batting averages, slugging percentages, home runs, RBIs, etc. Spin recognition was trended towards the same conclusion. This study shows that visual simulation can be a viable tool for sports performance analysis and prediction.},

Then, an improved ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF algorithm) is presented, where Hessian matrix and gray centroid method are adopted to give the scale and direction information to the feature points, Hamming distance is used to match the feature points, and RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus algorithm) further optimizes the matching results. Furthermore, the image registration algorithm based on improved TLD and improved ORB is proposed, which reduces the detection range of feature points, improves the speed of object tracking, and can quickly calculate the transformation matrix between virtual and real scenes. The experimental results show that the proposed image registration algorithm has high accuracy and good robustness in the mobile augmented reality, so it can better meet the application needs of augmented reality in the mobile terminal.},

Firstly, transformer is used in the target guidance module to extract the object’s features to guide the backbone network to complete the positioning task, which can solve the problem of distinguishing the instances within the classification. Secondly, self-attention mechanism is introduced into the model, which is mainly completed by spatial attention module (SAM) and channel attention module (CAM). By using the characteristics of self-attention mechanism, the attention matrix is dynamically self-learned in two dimensions of space and channel to obtain a more robust object representation. The proposed model is evaluated on the OTB-2013, OTB-50, OTB-2015 and VOT-2016 benchmarks, and the experimental results demonstrate the excellent tracking performance and robustness of our model.},

Several studies have extracted features for classification tasks using transfer learning. In addition, researchers have applied feature extraction to style conversion, such as generative adversarial networks to transform poses; however, only a few studies have implemented learning to reduce individual differences. If motion features with little individuality are obtained, reproducing motions with individual characteristics becomes possible. When applied to style conversion, it enables person-to-person mapping of movements and detecting anomalies, among others. This study first proposes a method for extracting features with little individual difference using graph structure layers in neural networks; subsequently, we applied it to predict the movement of a person in the near future and compared its accuracy with the conventional method that does not explicitly consider individual differences. The accuracy improvement was confirmed in many cases for prediction up to 0.4 s ahead. For motion prediction up to 0.32 s ahead, accuracy improved in 14 out of 15 motions, and for the average score, accuracy improved by approximately 38\%.},

  abstract  = {Video prediction is an active machine learning problem to use past information in a video sequence to acquire human-like understanding and then predicting future consequences of object states and actions. The existing prediction frameworks integrated the decomposition and disentanglement techniques to observe object interaction and use them to predict future video scenes. However, the previous works did not consider physical interaction among objects in the prediction. Thus, this research utilizes the physical reasoning concept to represent object dynamics in the real world and estimate future sequences enclosing object dependencies. This paper addresses the investigation of object interaction using stochastic video prediction with physical reasoning representation. We propose a self-supervised framework called Relational Prediction Auto-Encoder (RPAE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RPAE can effectively improve the generation and prediction of the near future sequences. We also confirmed the predicted object dynamics by measuring the velocity of each object and its physical interaction in the experiments.},

  abstract  = {Deep convolutional neural network (DNN) has been widely used in image recognition, target detection, and natural language processing. Unfortunately, the previous state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) increase model accuracy by increasing the number of layers of the network, which leads to the problem of large models and complex calculations. Previous work has demonstrated that network compression can be achieved by weight pruning approaches, and that specialized hardware can be used to speed up reasoning. However, the format of compressed sparse rows (CSR) or compressed sparse columns (CSC) is generally used in model pruning. The approach leads to coding operations before calculation and decoding operations during calculation by processing units on specialized hardware. And the approach degrades the performance of the model.In this paper, we propose a combination of hardware and software to address above bottlenecks. Firstly, we propose a novel software-based structured pruning, called vector-pruning. Secondly, we design a novel dataflow for our pruning method, called Vector-Sparse, our method eliminates complex coding and decoding Then, we design the corresponding hardware architecture for vector-prune. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our pruning approach for AlexNet on Xilinx xcvu19p-fsva3824-2-e. Experiments show that compared with a state-of-the-art convolution network accelerator, we proposed a software/hardware co-design approach that is 1.01x and 1.3x better in performance, effectively improving the inference speed of the model on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).},

Our framework works using the Amazon Web Services platform by creating a Linux instance on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). A high concurrency web server allows us to store the landscape images to be further processed within the Linux instance using Django, Python libraries and artificial intelligence for classification and counting of superpixels that resemble micropatches of biotic and abiotic components. Our framework is request-based which allows us to perform processing and obtain task results in real time. On average, our framework classifies all superpixels of a landscape image in 1.37 minutes using 13 classes of patterns.},

Evaluating a system in operation may not be trivial, or it can hinder the continuity of services.

A single robotic agent can comprise hundreds of sensors and actuators, and production processes performed by multiple agents can demand high computational costs, possibly only via remote resources in cloud or fog computing layers. In this context, it is paramount of importance to assimilate the performance of such computing paradigms for production chains of robotic agents in industrial factories and to provide IoRT system designers with assessment tools to comprehend and anticipate the operational performance of their projects at different development stages. This paper proposes an M/M/c/K model for the performance evaluation of IoRT systems integrated with fog-cloud computing paradigms. Focusing on routing strategies, we demonstrated that the proposed model allows evaluating how different configurations of components in an IoRT architecture impact the performance of the system using the performance metrics including mean response time, component utilization, number of messages, and drop rate. The performance modeling and evaluation of a specific IoRT in this paper can help computing system administrators to design and adopt advanced cloud/fog/IoT computing paradigms to maximize manufacturing productivity in industrial factories.},

Collaborative Filtering (CF)-based models have been widely adopted to address such an HiDS matrix. However, a CF-based model is unable to learn the property distribution characteristic of user’s preference from an HiDS matrix, thereby its representation ability is limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Model Regularization Wasserstein GAN(MRWGAN) to extract the distribution of user’s preferences. Its main ideas are two-fold: a) adopting an auto-encoder to implement the generator model of GAN; b) proposing a model-regularized Wasserstein distance as an objective function to training a GAN model. Empirical studies on four HiDS matrices from industrial applications demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art models, the proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy for missing data of an HiDS matrix.},

The proposed model eliminates the necessity of deploying a separate visual-servoing controller and a robot controller, thereby reducing the on-board computational load drastically. The proposed model, as opposed to the conventional PBVS and IBVS approaches, helps in the use of torque control strategies. To utilize this feature of the model, a non-singular fast-terminal sliding mode modified super-twisting controller (NSFTSM-MSTC) is proposed. The non-singular fast-terminal sliding manifold ensures the fast and finite time convergence of the error between the desired and actual points of interest, while ensuring smoother transitions in the quadrotor states. The modified super-twisting reaching law ensures that the control input is continuous thereby ensuring chattering attenuation. The overall system stability is presented using Lyapunov’s stability criteria and an expression for convergence time is also derived. The proposed theory is validated using numerical simulations and is compared with the existing conventional sliding mode based visual servoing approach (CSMVS).},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a novel synchronous Q-learning method is proposed for solving discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems. To begin with, the Bellman equation corresponding to the optimal Q-function is reformulated into a consistency equation on the parameters of the optimal Q-function and the optimal controller. Then an actor-critic structure is introduced to learn the optimal Q-function and the optimal controller online in real time by using the state samples generated by the behavior policy. Particularly, the proposed synchronous Q-learning scheme simultaneously updates the Q-function approximation and the optimal controller approximation, rather than iterating between policy evaluation and policy improvement. The proposed control scheme is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) under appropriate learning rates, provided that certain persistence of excitation (PE) conditions are satisfied. Besides, the PE conditions can be easily met by injecting appropriate exploration noise into the behavior policy without causing any excitation noise bias. Finally, one simulation example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed synchronous Q-learning method.},

In well-structured environments, such as buildings, planes can be segmented and used for registration, similarly to the classical point-based ICP approach. Using planes tremendously reduces the number of inputs.In this article, an efficient plane-based registration algorithm is presented. The optimal transformation is estimated through a two-step approach, successively performing robust plane-to-plane minimization and non-linear robust point-to-plane registration. Experiments on the Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) benchmark dataset show that the proposed method enables to successfully register 100\% of the scans from the three indoor sequences. Experiments also show that the proposed method is robust in large motion scenarios and more accurate than other state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, a new challenging dataset, LOOP’IN, is provided. It is composed of two loops in real-world indoor scenes, with a large number of scans captured with a 3D LiDAR. Tests led on this dataset show that the algorithm is able to register long sequences, to close loops and to build an incremental map of the explored environment.},

In the current article, we investigate the use of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MEA) for BRS and thus, we name our approach as MEABRS. For MEA, we utilize the search capability of multi-objective bi-nary differential evolution (MOBDE) where we simultaneously optimize different aspects of BRS including diversity among sentences, sentence relevance using term weighting scheme, and length of the sentence. A keyword-based objective function is also incorporated in our optimization process to improve the quality of a bug report’s summary and in order to do so, rapid automatic keyword extraction (RAKE) toolkit is utilized. The generated summaries are evaluated with the available gold summaries corresponding to the two benchmark datasets (ADS and SDS) in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and ROUGE measure. Results obtained demonstrate the efficacy of MEABRS with an average improvement (over both datasets) of 4.5\% in terms of F1-Measure. Further, results are also validated using a statistical significance t-test.},

  abstract  = {Modeling sequential transformations between two trees is a fundamental task in domains such as bioinformatics. Traditional methods to address this usually rely on hand-coded heuristics and algorithms which are often hard to derive. The large advances in deep learning technologies and computational power have recently opened up new potential avenues. In particular, representation and policy learning provides an interesting opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of two trees, where each tree can be embedded in a Euclidean space and its evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space.In this paper, we propose a representation and policy learning framework that learns a representation for arbitrary sized binary tree pairs using recurrent LSTM networks and a policy to transfer one tree in to the corresponding target tree using Reinforcement Learning. Here, the representation is pre-trained on tree transfer similarity to transform pairs of tree-structured data into an approximate numerical multidimensional vector which encodes the original structure information. This model, used with a deep reinforcement learning approach, yields a constructive method for generating basis functions for approximating value functions and permits to learn an efficient, general tree transfer policy that incrementally transforms the source tree into the target tree.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an intelligent robust controller design scheme for a quadrotor where system dynamics of quadrotor are not known and quadrotor actuators may suffer from partial loss of effectiveness (PLOE) along with the actuator saturation. Robust controller design employs an integral fast terminal sliding mode controller (IFTSMC) which provides faster response and singularity free control action along with the finite-time convergence. Actuator saturation is accommodated by employing an auxiliary variable. To cope with the unknown quadrotor dynamics, a radial basis function neural network (RBFN) along with the robust compensator has been introduced to directly approximate control law instead of approximating system dynamics separately. The letter requires more computational effort and that is greatly reduced by the proposed methodology. Weights of RBFN are updated in real-time where update laws of these weights are obtained using the principle of Lyapunov stability and overall stability of the system is guaranteed using the same. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulation results have been provided for ∞-shaped trajectory tracking.},

We discovered two natural formulations for UTC: one is the proportional-integral tracking controller (PITC), which includes a proportional and an integral part of states errors; the other is the adaptive feedforward tracking controller (AFTC), which consists of a feedback part of state errors and a feedforward part which is obtained adaptively by using the previous sampled input. When the integral gain is high, it is found that PITC and AFTC are approximately equivalent with the integral gain be proportional to the sampling rate. Thus PITC and AFTC together form a unified framework of UTC, where PI and PID are only particular cases of first-order and second-order PITC, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Accurate tracking control of nonminimum phase systems relies on the calculation of the ideal internal dynamics (IID). Traditional IID calculation methods fail when applied to nonminimum phase nonhyperbolic systems (systems with nonhyperbolic zero dynamics). Recently, we propose the optimal bounded inversion method for IID calculation, which obtains IID by solving a trajectory optimization problem. In this paper, we extend our previous result and show that optimal bounded inversion can also deal with nonminimum phase nonhyperbolic systems. More than that, it is also possible to achieve different control goals by setting different cost functions. Particularly, three cases are investigated in this paper. The first uses minimal initial value deviation as the cost function, resulting in &quot;T-IID&quot; which can achieve accurate output tracking. The second applies minimal terminal value as the cost function, resulting in &quot;S-IID&quot; which leads to a final rest for the system. The last combines &quot;T-IID&quot; and &quot;S-IID&quot; to achieve a compound goal. The effectiveness is verified through Matlab simulations of a two-cart inverted-pendulum system.},

  abstract  = {Safe optimization aims to find the optimum of an unknown function by experimentally sampling its values at selective points, without any experiment leading to a violation of prescribed safety constraints. Bayesian optimization approaches are often used here because of the need for confidence prediction. This procedure is computationally expensive: depending on the discretization resolution, even three dimensions are problematic for the average desktop computer and thus exclude safe optimization in applications with several tuning parameters. For handling high-dimensional Bayesian optimization, iterative decomposition into sub-problems is a common strategy. However, the usual definition of sub-problem focuses either on exploration (random sub-problem) or exploitation (sub-problem at the previous maximum). We present a novel approach which iteratively defines at least two sub-problems, with each sub-problem targeting either exploration or exploitation. In addition, sub-problems can be defined in terms of ellipsoid-shaped sub-spaces, whose shapes are adapted through the Gaussian process regression. Our empirical evaluation with up to 40-dimensional test functions suggests that the ellipsoidal sub-space is well suited for exploration far from local optima, while a linear sub-space has its advantages in local exploitation. Their combination outperformed all evaluated safe optimization methods and was applied to a complex power grid system.},

  abstract  = {Lying is a common act in daily life and may have various degrees of falsehood. Deception detection has always been a fascinating area of research in which many studies have been conducted using subjects’ facial, verbal or bodily cues to spot potential deceit. However, none of the studies have investigated the physiological responses of observers in response to misleading statements with various degrees of falsehood. In this paper, we investigated this problem by first conducting designed experiments to collect participants’ physiological signals while they were watching stimulus videos with various falsehood levels. Then, the data was analysed using machine learning or deep learning models. Various challenges including relatively small amounts of training data and imbalanced classes have been addressed by implementing data augmentation. The results show that deep learning models, such as ResNet and VAE-LSTM, can predict the degree of falsehood with an F1-measure up to 0.83 from observers’ reactions when compared to the stimuli ground truth. This was attained when the model was trained with the most useful physiological signal in this study, Electrodermal Activity (EDA). This result indicates that observers’ physiological signals can be used as an indicator to determine the degree of falsehood for misleading statements. In the future, this system may be applied to provide an objective evaluation for deception detection.},

With the ever advancing machine learning and neural network computational power, several models have been proposed for classifying the emotion states. Training an efficient classifier requires selection of appropriate features demanding complex computations. The present article investigates whether dense convolutional neural networks can extract the features from just pre-processed raw EEG signals enabling a suitability for online classification. The article presents a fully connected multi-channel neural network model comprising of dense con-volutional layers coupled with sparse autoencoder and dense perceptron layers for classifying emotions from 62-channel EEG data. The proposed model uses the dense convolution layers to learn emotion features directly from each channel. The cascaded SAE layer coupled with dense perceptron network learns correlations between the channels for efficient classification. In addition, different methods exist to generate training and testing sets for validating classifier models. In this light, the article discusses three most recent methods to generate training and testing sets employed in emotion classification. The proposed model achieves a best testing accuracy of 97.42\%.},

  abstract  = {Emotion recognition, which aims to identify an individual’s emotional state from the acquired physiological or body signals, is very important in affective computing. Emotions have two common representations: categorical, e.g., happy, sad, etc., and dimensional (continuous), e.g., valence, arousal and dominance. Training a good emotion classification or regression model usually requires a large number of labeled data. However, the labeling process is very difficult. As emotions are subtle and uncertain, it usually requires multiple assessors to label each emotional instance to obtain the groundtruth categorical label or dimensional values. In this paper, we propose a multi-task active learning (MTAL) framework to query the most useful samples for labeling, which enables the efficient training of an emotion classification model and multiple emotion regression models simultaneously. This is novel and challenging, as all previous research considered only emotion classification or regression alone, but not simultaneously. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrated that MTAL outperformed random selection and several state-of-the-art single task active learning approaches, i.e., with the same number of labeled samples, MTAL can obtain better emotion classification and regression models simultaneously.},

Wavelet packets has been widely used as a means of time-frequency analysis of EEG in many different applications including brain computer interface systems. Features for emotion recognition are extracted from the EEG signals using a depth 6 wavelet packet tree. Wavelet packet energy of the sub-bands corresponding to delta (0-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), and gamma (30-49Hz) are taken as emotional features. Feature selection based on feature ranking is applied to select the most prominent EEG channel-frequency combinations for emotion recognition. Four classical classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor and naive Bayes were used to detect the emotional states from the extracted features. To evaluate the effectiveness and validation of the proposed model, the SEED database has been employed. Based on the experiment results obtained, our method demonstrates that the LDA is more suitable for emotion recognition as compared to other classical classifier, which achieving the best average accuracy of 90.9386.

Second, discriminative features are extracted using the CLBP technique.

However, CEP is only capable of detecting attacks that have been previously modeled as event patterns. This requires a domain expert who knows the conditions that must be satisfied so that certain attacks can be detected, thus identifying unmodeled ones is not possible. This paper aims to address this problem by proposing a machine learning algorithm that allows for the automatic creation of CEP patterns based on categorized data if the goal is to classify attacks, or even uncategorized data if the objective is to detect anomalies.

Knowing, planning, and stabilizing the yield of semiconductor manufacturing is highly important to meet the rising demand. One indication for potential root causes is the identification of defect patterns on wafers. Wafers are the base silicon layer on which sets of chips are manufactured. If a certain process damages chips, then this produces characteristic patterns of failing chips on the wafer, which are then investigated by engineers to isolate the root-cause. According to studies, human-expert based defect pattern recognition methods have a maximum accuracy of about 45\%. To help engineers to improve recognition and root cause analysis of defect patterns, this paper introduces a novel process for analysis. For this, unsupervised machine learning and clustering techniques are utilized to identify and group unknown defect patterns. A tailored process is introduced, using autoencoders and an iterative classification, which is tested on a use case with a pre-known root cause.},

Most conventional feature selection methods focus on handling homogeneous features, while real-world datasets usually have a mixture of continuous and discrete features. Some recent mixed-type feature selection studies only select features with high relevance to class labels and ignore the redundancy among features. The determination of an appropriate feature subset is also a challenge. In this paper, a supervised feature selection method using density-based feature clustering (SFSDFC) is proposed to obtain an appropriate final feature subset for mixed-type data. SFSDFC decomposes the feature space into a set of disjoint feature clusters using a novel density-based clustering method. Then, an effective feature selection strategy is employed to obtain a subset of important features with minimal redundancy from those feature clusters. Extensive experiments as well as comparison studies with five state-of-the-art methods are conducted on SFSDFC using thirteen real-world benchmark datasets and results justify the efficacy of the SFSDFC method.},

  abstract  = {Hydronephrosis may lead to many potential diseases, and the diagnosis of hydronephrosis is time-consuming and laborious. To assist physicians in hydronephrosis diagnosis and treatment planning, an accurate and automatic kidney segmentation method is highly required in clinical practice. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks such as Unet plays a key role in the field of image segmentation, but Unet itself cannot adjust the receptive field actively, which may result in poor attention to the characteristics of the segmented target. We propose an encoder-decoder network with weighted skip connections and the idea of hierarchical equal resolution that can manually control the receptive field. We evaluated our method by comparing it with various classical networks using a dataset of 1850 annotated images. The MPA of the model is 94.12 and the MIoU is 89.49, which outperformed other classical networks we compared to.},

  abstract  = {An echo state network (ESN) is a reservoir computing framework consisting of an input layer, a reservoir, and a readout layer. A reservoir is a recursive network comprising neuron models. In the reservoir, various models use analog neurons with a logistic output function. Time-series learning for ESNs requires a high memory capacity for storing the historical information of past inputs. However, analog neurons are incapable of storing time history by themselves. Therefore, historical information gained by introducing internal neural dynamics can enhance the memory capacity of ESNs. In this context, we hypothesized that the evaluation of the functions of internal-neural decay factors and optimal balances between the decay factors of chaotic neurons can provide useful results for improving the performance of ESNs comprising chaotic neural networks. Therefore, to validate this hypothesis, we investigated the performance of an ESN using a reservoir comprising a chaotic neural network (ChESN). The ChESN significantly outperformed a conventional ESN owing to its high memory capacity at a large temporal scale, even when the spectral radius of the reservoir synaptic weight was small. The proposed approach is expected to have wide applications in reservoir computing.},

Tweets of users commenting on the GST information system were extracted for the period June 2017 to May 2020 using pre-identified key terms. The paper presents a unique approach of combining co-occurrence graphs and Attention based deep learning technique for analyzing the importance of co-occurring terms in the tweets by taxpayers. Co-occurrence graphs between the terms in the tweets helped in identifying important terms related to GST, based on the frequency of their connections with the key terms. In order to assess how much the pair of key terms and the adjoining important term contribute, attention weights were found for this pair using Attention based bi-directional LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model. A measure called &quot;Attention factor&quot; has been introduced to find the relevance of the pair in the tweets which will help in making improvements in the GST system.},

In this project, we used age as a feature to compare the pacient’s age and the predicted age value from gait data. The aim of this research is to show the most important features that contributed to the result of the age prediction. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and LightGBM are algorithms that had the lowest estimation errors for age prediction. Next, we carried out experiments to identify the most relevant features for the age difference. SHappley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) were applied for global and local interpretation, respectively. The results showed that groups of features could be identified during the interpretation.

  abstract  = {The usage of autonomous vehicles in the transportation sector can achieve the objective of a safe environment. To increase riding comfort in an autonomous vehicle, one main challenge is to implement motion scenarios according to the passenger’s driving behaviours. This leads to customization of the driving style of an autonomous vehicle according to the preference of its passenger. The main disadvantage of the current autonomous vehicles is the regeneration of driving motion signals without taking into consideration the comfort/discomfort of the passengers according to their driving behaviours and preferred driving styles such as acceleration/deceleration rate and steering styles. In this paper, a nonlinear autoregressive network model is developed and trained based on the generated motion scenarios of the passenger and the position of the autonomous vehicle, in order to predict and replicate the motion signals based on the passenger’s driving behaviours. The MATLAB toolbox is used to train the network and forecast the motion signals. The results show the usefulness of the proposed method in terms of a higher shape similarity level and a lower mean square error rate between the actual and forecasted motion signals. These regenerated motion signals can increase the riding comfort of autonomous vehicle’s passengers as it is able to imitate the behaviour of the passengers.},

  abstract  = {In skiing sport, snow friction is a crucial factor in determining the ski roughness that can produce high speed and quick finishing time for a skier. However, snow friction is influenced by many factors associated with weather and snow conditions which affect the choice of the optimal ski’s roughness. This paper proposes an ensemble learning system that can accurately recommend the best ski roughness under different weather conditions. The data used in this study is a unique data set that has been collected from field tests and competitions. Though this data set recorded information about ski treatment and weather conditions over a 10-years period, it is affected by noise and outliers, and it has an imbalanced distribution in the ski roughness classes. This work addresses these challenges in the data by applying preprocessing techniques and class balancing strategies. Furthermore, correlation and clustering approaches are employed to identify redundancies in the data and to recognise the subsets of weather conditions that have the highest influence on the selection of the ski roughness. Using the resultant clusters, an ensemble system is introduced to recommend the most suitable skis roughness for a given weather condition. This system can be used as a guiding tool in skiing competitions to aid technicians in choosing the skis roughness. The results showed that air and snow temperatures as well as snow humidity have the highest impact on the choice of the ski roughness.},

  abstract  = {Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods for zero-shot learning (ZSL) use the base category data as output and the semantic descriptors as conditional input for training so that the network can synthesize data for the novel classes. Using these generated data, the ZSL problem is converted into a supervised learning problem. Since the GAN is trained on only the base categories, the model prediction is biased towards the base categories. Also, the generated data for the novel categories might not accurately represent the ground truth. To address these problems, we propose a three-way solution. Firstly, we constrain the generation process such that the generated data from the novel classes can be highly discriminated from that of the base classes. This constraint tries to get rid of the biasness problem. Secondly, we enforce semantic consistency by reconstructing the semantic attributes from the generated data. Finally, we selectively adapt and transform the generated data from the novel classes to be close to the ground-truth unlabeled test data. We evaluated our framework on five standard datasets for ZSL and found our method to be highly competitive when compared with previous work. We also carried out additional studies to better understand our framework.},

Only a few methods involve dedicated objective function to help detect anomalies and they are not visually explainable as well as reconstruction based approaches. Though the popular reconstruction-based approach for anomaly detection using Convolutional AutoEncoder has achieved the state of the art results, there is no provision to induce the fabrication of discriminatively learnt embeddings from the inputs to well reflect anomalies in the output. We propose an approach using Support Vector Data Description as a regularizer to enforce discriminative ability to easily segregate anomalies from normality with little effort in modelling and tuning the AutoEncoders in our work. We evaluate our approach on several visual anomaly detection datasets to show the capability of our approach. We also perform extensive ablation studies for efficient tuning of parameters.},

Therefore, the microscopic images of cells tend to have low image quality but these images are not good for semantic segmentation. Here we propose a method to translate an input image to the images that are easy to recognize by deep learning. The proposed method consists of two deep neural networks. The first network is the usual training for semantic segmentation, and penultimate feature maps of the first network are used as filters to translate an input image to the images that emphasize each class. This is the automatic preprocessing and translated cell images are easily classified. The input cell image with low quality is translated by the feature maps in the first network, and the translated images are fed into the second network for semantic segmentation. Since the outputs of the second network are multiple segmentation results, we conduct the weighted ensemble of those segmentation images. Two networks are trained by end-to-end manner, and we do not need to prepare images with high quality for the translation. We confirmed that our proposed method can translate cell images with low quality to the images that are easy to segment, and segmentation accuracy has improved using the weighted ensemble learning.},

The participants were asked to deliver packages in six different scenarios that were created based on the common setups seen in the real world. The findings indicated that the participants either prefer the package to be easily visible right in front of the door or at a partially hidden location that is secure and avoids theft. The preferences of the participants were also seen that they depend on other factors like the objects present in the delivery site and the neighborhood.

Indeed, deployment settings (e.g., Cloud- or Edge-based scenarios, network bandwidth, hardware resource availability), algorithmic aspects (e.g., the specific algorithm used to solve a problem) and data features (e.g., packet size and rate) deeply affect the overall functioning of an IoT service and its compliance with specific requirements such as reactivity, reliability and efficiency. An accurate parameter sweep based on realistic IoT simulations is a viable, yet still unexplored, solution to obtain a full-fledged overview and specific evaluations about the performance of an IoT system under development. In such a direction, in this paper we present an approach for assessing Edge analytic in complex IoT scenarios through a parameter sweep analysis conducted through a simulation-based process, enabling a fine-grained modeling of hybrid IoT systems (both Cloud and Edge) of different scales (small, medium and large). Four typical IoT use cases (autonomous vehicles, smart healthcare, gaming, and industrial IoT) are presented to show the benefits of our approach in finding the right settings for configuring and running them. Indeed, the obtained results show that our approach concretely helps IoT developers in the challenging task of tuning the parameters’ set so as to meet the given requirements, even in the case of large solution spaces and before the actual deployment phase.},

  abstract  = {Image semantic segmentation has made great progress using deep neural networks. However, methods based on deep neural networks rely on numerous pixel-level annotations, and such pixel-level annotations require considerable time and money. To overcome this problem, researchers have proposed a weakly supervised image semantic segmentation, which requires only simple annotations to achieve high segmentation accuracy. In this article, we propose an algorithm that uses bounding box annotations to achieve image semantic segmentation. The basic steps are divided into two steps: generating temporary semantic segmentation labels and training the network and then iterating these two steps. We have conducted many experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 to prove that this algorithm is effective, and the performance improved, which is close to the performance of the corresponding fully supervised network.},

  abstract  = {Forecasting crop yields and prices is crucial for both global food security and providing farmers with valuable information to avoid a price crash. This work proposes a hybrid deep learning model that uses satellite images to forecast strawberry yield along with farmers’ prices, applied in three counties in California. For tractability, a dimensionality reduction technique is applied by converting the images to histograms representing the pixel frequency. The models tested are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Variational AutoEncoder (VAE), CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM), Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE), and a voting ensemble of CNN-LSTM and SAE. It is found that the proposed voting ensemble of CNN-LSTM and SAE is the best at forecasting the daily strawberry yields and prices in all three counties. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), the voting ensemble model outperforms the models suggested in literature with up to 70\% forecasting improvement compared to the CNN model and up to 22\% improvement over the CNN-LSTM model.},

The number of worldwide facilities and of treated patients is increasing every year. A challenge of proton therapy is that treatment planning systems require accurate dose computation, but the golden standard in accuracy are Monte Carlo algorithms that are slow. For this reason, accurate and faster dose calculation algorithms are needed. In this paper we use Deep Learning to achieve both speed and accuracy in dose calculation for proton therapy. The results positively compare with previous existing literature in the thorax cases, that are usually the most difficult to calculate by fast algorithms.},

From generating art works in the style of famous artists like Paul Cezanne and Claude Monet to simulating styles of art movements like Ukiyo-e, a variety of creative applications have been explored using AI. However, there has been very little focus concerning the ethical implications of AI generated art. Can AI model artists&#39; styles without stereotyping them? Does AI do justice to the socio-cultural nuances of art movements? In this work, we take a first step towards analyzing these issues. Leveraging directed acyclic graphs to represent potential processes of art creation, we propose a simple metric to quantify confounding bias due to the lack of modeling the influence of art movements in learning artists&#39; styles. As a case study, we consider the popular cycleGAN model and analyze confounding bias across various genres. The proposed metric is more effective than state-of-the-art outlier detection method in understanding the influence of art movements in artworks. We also highlight how the proposed metric can aid in determining authenticity of artworks. We hope our work triggers discussions related to ethical implications of AI generated art.},

  abstract  = {When applying template matching to the robot arm grasping of rotated objects with high aspect ratios, the accuracy of the matching process is often degraded by the occurrence of high similarity scores with pixels or patches located in neighboring objects. Accordingly, we propose a learning-based template matching (LbTM) algorithm in which the accuracy of the matching results is improved by clearing the matching scores of these confused pixels or patches to zero using a spatial clustering process. This algorithm consists of two modules: First, the translation matching module uses the learning-based pairwise similarity matrix. Having determined the center coordinate of the target object, the second module is applied to estimate the target rotation angle by using a Siamese network. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for 600 template-rotated target pairs. It is shown that the area under curve (AUC) performance of the proposed algorithm (0.678) is higher than that of three other template matching algorithms (DDIS, CoTM, and QATM). Moreover, our algorithm achieves a minimum success rate of 80\% in practical grasping trials performed even using high-aspect objects with various rotational angles and positions.},

The combination of spatial separable convolution is mainly used to enable AMISPP to perform convolution on regions with different aspect ratios.

We also analyze the influence of the handwriting types on the efficiency of the writer identification process. In this regard, we perform a comparative study between handcrafted and automated features. Under multiple classifiers (RF, XGB, KNN and SVM). We find that writers with good and well clear handwriting have fewer similarities, thus, provides enhanced experimental identification rates. However, Bad handwriting presents more similarities between the writers, which explains the reduction in the identification rate.},

Firstly, this paper establishes a coupling model to describe the electro-thermal-aging behavior of battery. Secondly, the heating time and capacity loss jointly form a multi-objective optimization problem with the current constraint. The optimization problem is solved by using the particle swarm optimization(PSO) algorithm and the effect of weighting coefficient on heating performance is discussed to obtain the optimal pulse current.

Information attained from monitoring can be employed for maintenance scheduling, hence, minimizing maintenance costs. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is a critical aspect of CM. This paper introduces a new RUL prediction method for wind turbine blades using a novel fuzzy-based failure dynamic modeling via a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. For this goal, a recursive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to compress the SCADA data and extract real-time Principal Components (PCs). Next, a wavelet-based Probability Density Function (PDF) is applied to obtain the probability of staying healthy from the extracted PCs. It is anticipated that blade degradation will lead to a subsequent decline in the PDF curve. A failure trajectory is then captured by transforming the PDF into the PC’s surface. Subsequently, the T–S fuzzy system is utilized to form the mathematical model of degradation from this failure trajectory. Next, a Bayesian algorithm is adaptively administered to predict the RUL. Experimental test results on Canadian wind farms explain a high performance of the proposed failure prognosis method in comparison with a Bayesian algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Air pollution has threatened people’s health. It is urgent for the government to strengthen and improve the ability of air pollution monitoring. This paper proposes a winner-take-all (WTA) autoencoder-based piecewise linear model for imputing air quality prediction under the missing data scenario. The main idea consists of two parts. Firstly, overcomplete WTA stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAEs) are proposed to handle missing data, which play two roles: 1) devise the multiple imputation strategy to fill in missing values; 2) generate a set of binary gate control sequences to construct the sophisticated partitioning. Besides, renewed teacher signals are updated based on clustering information in the trained SDAEs to improve the accuracy of filling in missing samples. Secondly, the piecewise linear model is then proposed by the generated set of gate signals using the information from the feature layers of SDAEs. By using a quasi-linear kernel based on the trained gating mechanism, our piecewise air quality predictor is finally identified in the exact same way as support vector regression. The proposed modeling method is applied to real air quality datasets to show that it has led to greater performance than traditional models.},

However, an SNLFA model commonly adopts a first-order optimization algorithm that cannot well handle its non-convex learning objective, thereby resulting in inaccurate representation to a target network. On the other hand, higher-order learning algorithms like a Newton-type one is expected to solve a non-convex optimization problem well, but its computation efficiency and scalability are greatly limited due to its direct manipulation of the Hessian matrix that can be huge in an SNLFA model. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Truncated Newton-method-based Symmetric Non-negative Latent Factor Analysis (TNS) model for utilizing second-order information in the latent factor analysis process without manipulating the Hessian matrix, thereby achieving high computational efficiency and scalability. Empirical studies indicate that TNS outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy with an affordable computational burden.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to solve a multimodal transportation planning problem, in which containers must be assigned to a truck or to trains that will transport them to their destination. While traditional planning methods work &quot;offline&quot; (i.e., they take decisions for a batch of containers before the transportation starts), the proposed approach is &quot;online&quot;, in that it can take decisions for individual containers, while transportation is being executed. Planning transportation online helps to effectively respond to unforeseen events that may affect the original transportation plan, thus supporting companies in lowering transportation costs. We implemented different container selection heuristics within the proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm and we evaluated its performance for each heuristic using data that simulate a realistic scenario, designed on the basis of a real case study at a logistics company. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method was able to learn effective patterns of container assignment. It out-performed tested competitors in terms of total transportation costs and utilization of train capacity by 20.48\% to 55.32\% for the cost and by 7.51\% to 20.54\% for the capacity. Furthermore, it obtained results within 2.7\% for the cost and 0.72\% for the capacity of the optimal solution generated by an Integer Linear Programming solver in an offline setting.},

  abstract  = {A Conditional Preference Network (CP-net) is a graphical model widely used to represent qualitative preferences in many real-world applications. Preference elicitation, representation, and reasoning plays an essential role in e-commerce and other applications relying on users’ preferences and desires. However, managing preferences often comes with dealing with hard and soft constraints. While hard constraints are requirements that can either be satisfied or violated, this two-level of satisfiability can be generalized to multiple levels through soft constraints. In this context, our main objective is to manage conditional and qualitative preferences together with hard and soft constraints, within a unique model. The constrained CP-net graphical model has been proposed to manage both conditional preferences and hard constraints. In order to include soft constraints, we extend the underlying constraint network of the constrained CP-net to a Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP). A WCSP is a CSP where (soft) constraints can be violated or satisfied with associated costs. More precisely, a cost function is associated to each constraint. We call the Weighted Constrained CP-nets (WCCP-net) the new model we propose. Like for CP-nets and Constrained CP-nets, there are two queries to consider for WCCP-nets: outcome optimization and outcome comparison. The outcome optimization query in the case of a constrained CP-net consists in finding the set of feasible solutions that are not dominated by any other solutions. This set is called the Pareto optimal set. In the case of the WCCP-net, this task consists of finding those solutions, from the Pareto optimal set, that maximize the total cost function of the underlying WCSP. This is a NP-hard problem that we tackle using a variant of the branch and bound algorithm that has been proposed to solve the outcome optimization in the case of constrained CP-nets.},

This multi-skills patient scheduling problem is modeled through four dimensional (hypercube) solutions search space whose axes are: Medical staff, Patients, ED structure and Time and it can be formulated as a flexible job shop scheduling problem. We have then to solve a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem (COP) in the emergency department (ED). The objective is to minimize a score integrating the total waiting time of patients in the (ED) with emphasis on patients with severe conditions. The Friends and Enemies collaboration protocol between agents is developed for solving the problem where each agent integrate a complete metaheuristic scheme in its behavior. Each agent act autonomously in the solution environment and interacts cooperatively with it and with the other agents. The interaction between agents allows the metaheuristic hybridization including the tuning of its parameters. The simulation results show that the scenarios with 2 or more agents were significantly higher in performance than the scenarios with 1 single agent. Thus, it is confirmed that the collaboration protocol between agents influences the quality of the solutions and the scalability of our approach, with the addition of new agents, there is an improvement in the results. Our approach is tested on a set of real (ED) data and the simulation results show that the proposed friends end enemies collaboration protocol can significantly improve the efficiency of the (ED) by reducing the score and especially the total waiting time of multi-skills patient scheduling problem.},

In general, the information of the nearby vehicles in terms of geometry information and historical states are utilized to increase localization accuracy. However, the geometry information can be unknown and the historical states of the nearby vehicles cannot be obtained under certain circumstances. In this paper, a Bayesian-based localization approach, named as BayesNVL is proposed to estimate the absolute positions of the nearby vehicles from an ego vehicle through incorporating the GPS measurements and measured relative positions. Different from the existing work, our pro-posed approach can be applied to the real driving scenarios without the geometry information of road network and the historical states of the nearby vehicles. We evaluate the proposed approach in terms of localization accuracy and efficiency by using a real dataset containing the trajectories of vehicles. The experimental results show that our proposed approach is able to achieve higher localization accuracy compared with the existing approaches and acceptable localization efficiency.},

  abstract  = {We present a probabilistic collision mitigation system (CMS) that aims to decrease the severity of unavoidable collisions. CMSs have to decide when to act in order to keep enough trajectories for lowering severity available, while at the same time not increasing the collision probability. This paper operationalises the choice of when to act as a probability threshold, which is applied to all or part of the trajectories available to an automated vehicle equipped with the CMS. Through simulations the relationship between the value of the threshold, and the trade-off between being able to reduce the collision severity and not causing a collision, is investigated. We identify two types of behaviours that increase the severity of collisions: one when acting late (setting a higher threshold) reduces the number of available trajectories with lower severity, and one when acting early is susceptible to prediction errors. Regardless, by setting a lower prediction horizon the prediction accuracy increases, but also reduces the available trajectories with lower severity. We also note that the outcome of the CMS improves when the severity of a trajectory is aligned with the maximum risk of collision along it, rather than the severity at the time step when it crosses the probability threshold.},

Our system should deal with the different selected locations and get information about the congested roads and the travel time in a dynamic environment to estimate the fastest path.In this paper, we developed a system based on a time-dependent Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the problem of finding the fastest traffic path instead of the shortest path. In addition, we implemented a dynamic real tests generator based on big Global Positioning System (GPS) datasets to get information about the traffic states in roads and generate dynamic problem instances. A mobile application has been developed to provide the drivers with accurate details of the path to visit the selected locations as well as the best time to begin the trip to avoid congestion and reach their destination as fast as possible. The exhaustive experimentations have shown the capabilities of the modified time-dependent ACO in solving dynamic optimization problems.},

However, drivers’ experience hidden in their driving history and their personal preferences are less considered in path planning. In this paper we propose a dynamic time-constrained path recommendation method, utilizing the historical GPS trajectory information and user preferences. First, based on graph entropy, critical intersections are extracted from trajectory information to simplify the road network structure. Then the time-dependent mostly chosen path (TDMCP) is obtained by trajectories processing to determine the time-varying paths between critical intersections. Thus the original complex road network is abstracted as a search subnet. Finally we propose an improved dynamic A* search (IDAS) on the search sub-net to find the candidate paths satisfying the time-constraints, and further allow users to set personal preferences to select the final optimal path. The proposed method is validated on the real-world data set, and the result shows that the proposed method surpasses the competing ones especially on long distance path recommendation.},

Automated driving vehicles that share control with human drivers have been shown to acts better than fully automated systems and manual driving. However, there is little consensus in guidelines for the design and definition of shared control, some researchers assist humans using haptic feedback, and others use an optimization process and many other works. In this paper, a non-haptic shared control is applied to navigate an intelligent vehicle based on two inputs one by a human driver and the other obtained by an autonomous algorithm. Where, Non-Cooperative Game Theory is applied to formulate the final input of the vehicle in the form of linear velocity and steering wheel angle; where a joystick is used for manipulating human inputs and a computer vision technology “Visual Servoing” is implemented to command the autonomous driving inputs, after calculating the fusion coefficient value, which is determined by a function dependent on the admissibility of inputs and the similarity between them. The final navigation decision sent to the intelligent vehicle is the output of the fusion system. Noting that, it has the only right to command the driving inputs to the vehicle.

The motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is the main component of the motion simulator with the responsibility of motion cues regeneration while respecting the motion simulator’s joint limitations. Recently, a model predictive control (MPC) method has been introduced in the MCA, which is able to extract an optimum input signal within the model constraints. The washout speed of the end-effector using the existing MPC-based MCA model is not considered because the integral of linear displacement of the platform is omitted as an output. As a result, the motion simulator platform returns to the neutral position without the consideration of the motion behavior. In this study, the integral of the end-effector linear displacement is consider inside the MPC-based MCA model to select the best washout speed of the end-effector. Moreover, a grey wolf optimizer is utilized to identify the best MPC weighting indexes, in order to increase the model efficiency for both existing and proposed models. The proposed method outperforms the MPC-based MCA model in producing better regeneration of the motion cues. It yields a higher correlation coefficient and a lower root means square error between the motion sensation signal pertaining to the real vehicle and motion simulator platform users.},

  abstract  = {Interactive driving simulation has become a key technology to support the development and optimization process of modern vehicle components and driver assistance systems both in academic research and in the automotive industry. However, the validity of the results obtained within the virtual environment depends essentially on the adequate reproduction of the simulated vehicle movements and the corresponding immersion of the driver. For that reason, specific motion platform control strategies, so-called Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCA), are used to replicate the simulated accelerations and angular velocities within the physical limitations of the driving simulator best possible. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a subjective comparison of three different filter- and optimization-based MCA resulting from previous research. For that purpose, a Human-in-the-Loop experiment was conducted with 27 participants in four typical driving situations, using a hybrid kinematics motion system as an application example. The statistical analysis of the study proves that the optimization-based algorithm is preferred by the subjects regardless of the presentation sequence and the respective driving maneuver, while the filter-based approaches differ only insignificantly in their ranking. Results thus correlate with the findings of an objective evaluation of the control quality and identify further potentials for improving the driving experience.},

  abstract  = {In the context of hands-on partial driving automation, drivers engage in a combination of lane centering system (LCS) and adaptive cruise control (ACC). In lane change scenarios, what should the system do, if it detects the approach of vehicle in the blind spot? Humans with powerful and intelligent machine sometimes suffer from such as automation surprises and distrust in automation. By contrast, haptic and continuous information would enable the driver to virtually touch their potentially hazardous environment. In this study, we propose the haptic protection with an adaptive level of authority that can be turned based on risk indicators, i.e., TTC and THW , in the blind spot scenarios. In haptic guidance systems, the artificial stiffness around the controller’s desired steering angle is used as the level of haptic authority to guide the driver to normative behavior. On the other hand, in the proposed protection system, the artificial stiffness around the driver’s desired steering angle is used as the level of haptic authority to warn the driver about their erroneous action. Thus, the definition of the level of haptic authority (LoHA) is different between the guidance-type and protection-type in terms of the objective. In a simulation with a parameter space of lane change scenarios, this study highlighted the combined impact of the haptic guidance and haptic protection on the driver bahavior. Results indicated that the use of the proposed haptic protection can enable the drivers to recognize their inappropriate actions.},

We conducted an experiment using a driver assistance system that alerted drivers when the system detected pedestrians at the intersection. A human–machine interface (HMI) was first displayed when the subject vehicle (ego vehicle) stopped in front of the intersection due to a red light. The display was then turned off when the traffic light changed to green, and the ego vehicle started moving. It was displayed again when the ego vehicle entered the intersection. We found that HMI display was effective in increasing the percentage of driver’s gazing time at pedestrians and in ensuring safety by the vehicle’s stopping to move forward. Furthermore, we found that HMI’s effectiveness was the most significant in the situation when three preceding vehicles made a right turn.},

Most existing solutions for this problem adopted that the UAV returns to the charging station and replenishes energy, which ensures the complete coverage for the area of interest. However, to guarantee the integrity of the uncovered area, there is usually no gain to the cover task during the process of returning, which leads to poor efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a shadow-following (SF) strategy which performs the cover task when the UAV returns along the shadow path, improving the energy utilization and coverage efficiency. Then, we extend for multi-UAV scenarios and propose a load-balanced (LB) multi-UAV CPP algorithm, which minimizes the number of robots and assigns the balanced task to each UAV. Finally, we validate the results in experiments performed with a UAV and multiple UAVs. The results show that the SF and LB algorithm performs well in the coverage efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Estuarine aquaculture in the coastal belt plays a key role in food security, production and supply chain. In the current COVID scenario, an efficient, sustainable and contactless system is the need of the hour, to keep up with the rising demands for food. Estuarine aquaculture involves culturing of fish species in a controlled environment so as to meet the increased demands. This requires continuous monitoring of the controlled environment which results in a labor-intensive proposition at the site. To simplify the task of the aquaculture farmers, the proposed solution named as ‘Estuarine-Star’ ensures that the entire site of aquaculture is maintained autonomously without the presence of the farmer at the site. The system comprises of 5 underwater sensors connected in the form of a star placed at strategic points in the site. These strategically placed underwater sensors sense the environmental parameters and through edge computing take appropriate actions to maintain an optimal environment. The data is also stored on the cloud. Furthermore, a camera system captures the underwater view of the fishes to study and understand the behavior of the fishes. This will help in taking targeted actions when abnormality in parameters is detected. The system ensures optimal conditions for rearing of fish thereby providing sustainable and profitable growth for the farmers. The interactive application hosted on cloud makes use of real time parameters and live video for alert generation and recommendations.},

  abstract  = {The adaptation of perceptive functions to new tasks or new domains is currently a major challenge in the field of autonomous driving. Since the creation of manually labeled datasets is generally time-consuming and cost-intensive, training approaches based on virtual simulation are becoming more relevant. Current approaches focus on the usage of virtual simulation to adapt machine learning models. However, in many automotive applications, perceptive functions consist of combined machine learning and traditional-rule-based approaches, called hybrid approaches. Rather than changing underlying machine learning models, we approach the task of domain adaptation of such hybrid perceptive functions by the optimization of often neglected and arbitrary black-box parameters. We therefore present a general methodology for end-to-end black-box optimization of hybrid perceptive functions for a specific target domain using virtual simulation. In a proof-of-concept, we carried out experiments to adapt a hybrid 3D object detector to the KITTI domain, using the simulator CARLA. Without the need for manually labeled data, our proposed methodology cannot only improve performance in the simulated target domain but can also improve performance in the real target domain. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of different black-box optimization algorithms for this specific task. Based on convergence behavior and the maximum achieved performance, we recommend the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES).},

  abstract  = {Advances in mobile computing have allowed billions of people to use mobile devices to perform their everyday activities. On the other hand, the constant use of mobile applications ends up impacting the limited processing, memory, storage and, mainly, battery of these devices. To minimize these limitations, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) seeks to transfer the execution of mobile device tasks and applications to be processed on clouds or servers with higher computing powers. However, computational discharge in the cloud, known as offloading, will not always have a positive impact, and this impact depends on factors such as network quality. In this context, deciding when to perform this computational offloading is a task with high relevance and complexity. Thus, this work proposes a solution to support the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to decide where the execution of tasks will occur most efficiently, local or remote. The decision is made from sensitive context information, including details of the mobile device and the task to be performed. The evaluation of this work showed that the proposed solution has a positive performance impact on MCC environments.},

However, general-purpose processors(CPU and GPU) have invested excessive hardware resources in the design because they have to flexibly support a variety of tasks, they are not efficient for the implementation of Transformer. Consequently, various software optimizations that towards general-purpose processors have been proposed one after another. But, under the condition of ensuring sufficient accuracy, the degree of software optimization is limited. It is requisite to friendly-support Transformer at the hardware level.After analysing the computational characteristics of the Transformer model, based on RISC-V, we designed a hardware friendly instruction set architecture for the Transformer model. In addition to the basic instruction, for the intensive and general computing part of the model, according to the expansion rules of RISC-V instruction, we design the matrix load/store instruction calculation instruction, softmax instruction, activation instruction and other user-defined instructions. They support any matrix scale, and deploy it on FPGA to realize a flexible and efficient custom processor RISC-VTF for Transformer. The design is integrated on the Xilinx toolkit zynq-7000 FPGA, and the resource consumption and performance are analyzed. Compared with the traditional common ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) such as x86, arm or MIPs, RISC-VTF provides higher code density and performance efficiency.},

MBNDE finds multiple feature combinations that can achieve the highest classification rate. Three different strategies have been applied to MBNDE in the niching process, and the corresponding algorithms are termed MBNDE-CC (crowding and cluster), MBNDE-CS (crowding and speciation), as well as MBNDE (index-based). A modified 3-NN classifier is designed to evaluate the classification rate of different feature combinations. The results of the proposed method and some existing multimodal and unimodal algorithms for FS are compared. The proposed algorithm shows promising performance.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary Multi-Tasking (EMT), which solves multiple optimization tasks simultaneously, is a burgeoning topic in the area of evolutionary computation. As the EMT transfers useful knowledge across tasks to guide the search while the optimization process progresses online, superior search performance has been obtained in many recent attempts. Autoencoding evolutionary multitasking is a recently proposed EMT algorithm, which employs a single-layer denoising auto-encoder for knowledge transfer. However, since the autoencoding evolutionary multitasking (AEEMT) algorithm learns the relationships between tasks through a linear auto-encoder, it may lead to negative transfer in cases that the linear variable relationship does not hold across tasks. Taking this cue, we propose an evolutionary multitasking algorithm with artificial neural networks for transferring knowledge across tasks in this paper, which possesses higher modeling capability of variable relationships. To test and verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive empirical studies on the well-known single-objectives multi-task optimization benchmarks. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method has a remarkable effect on the evolutionary search in terms of both search speed and solution quality and comparing to the autoencoding evolutionary multitasking algorithms and the single-task evolutionary counterpart.},

  abstract  = {Advances in modeling and computation have resulted in high-fidelity digital models capable of simulating the dynamics of a wide range of industrial systems. These models often require calibration, or the estimation of an optimal set of parameters, to reflect a system’s observed behavior. While searching over the parameter space is an inevitable part of the calibration process, models are seldom designed to be valid for arbitrarily large parameter spaces. Application of existing black-box calibration methods, therefore, often require repeatedly evaluating a model over a wide range of parameters. For some parameter combinations, the simulations could be unreasonably slow or fail altogether. In general, the shape of subregions in the parameter space that could result in simulation failure is unknown and near-impossible to ascertain analytically. In this paper, we propose a novel failure robust Bayesian optimization (FR-BO) algorithm that learns these failure regions from simulation data and informs a Bayesian optimization algorithm to avoid failure regions while searching for optimal parameters. This results in acceleration of the optimizer’s convergence and prevents wastage of time trying to simulate parameters with high failure probabilities.},

The literature of dynamic classifier systems presents a good variety of competence measures, but some are not suitable for time series forecasting. However, some dynamic regression selection works present measures that can be used with time series forecasting problems. Such measures are extracted from the region of competence, and this work aims to evaluate these competence measures to calculate the weights of the models to combine them dynamically. The experiments are performed using three different machine learning algorithms with ten time series datasets and compare dynamic weighting algorithm, single model, and classic statistical combination techniques as Mean and Median.

In many engineering applications, acquiring and accurately labeling the training data can be time consuming, burdensome, and costly. Active learning is an area of machine learning that selects observations in an unlabeled set to be passed to an oracle to retrieve the ground truth label, thereby improving the efficiency of the labeling and training process. However, most active learning algorithms only consider model improvement and, therefore, ignore cost considerations. The active learning algorithms that do consider cost require the practitioner to specify the trade-off between model improvement and cost. We propose an active learning with cost method that does not require this trade-off to be specified by randomly sampling observations from the Pareto optimal frontier. Further, we propose an extension to this method that accounts for uncertainty in the cost estimate of labeling an observation. These methods are evaluated on publicly available data sets, and the numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can produce models that achieve similar performance to standard active learning algorithms while reducing the labeling cost.},

Automation takes more control authority when the novices skill-level is poor, or it allows the novice to have more control authority when his/her skill-level is close to that of the expert to let the novice learn from his/her own control experience.

The objective of this paper is firstly to introduce the concept of pattern and the way to adapt this concept in the context of cooperation. Then, a second part addresses methodological aspects and proposes methods to identify cooperative patterns. The third and fourth parts apply this method to the design of a Human-Cyber-Physical System studied within the framework of the HUMANISM project, and preliminary results of an experiment are presented.},

  abstract  = {Human control over artificial agents is of increased importance today given the recent advances of artificial intelligence and its impact on today’s societies. This makes interdisciplinary cooperation especially between human-factors/ergonomics and artificial intelligence an important challenge that needs to be addressed. In addition to the common bridge that exists between human-factors/ergonomics and artificial intelligence, i.e., the balanced integration of humans and artificial agents into one loop, we reinterpret the work of cognitive systems engineering and resilience engineering as human-machine intelligence. The goal of human-machine intelligence is to understand and create intelligence in the homo machina, an intelligent organism made of human- and artificial agents. We define intelligence in a way that highlights decision making and adaptation and apply this definition to the design of the homo machina. This creates a unified viewpoint which fosters a shared approach between human-factors/ergonomics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology.},

  abstract  = {Large vehicle-manipulators are systems consisting of a medium-sized heavy-duty vehicle and a hydraulic manipulator. They operate in an unstructured environment and are therefore not fully automated. However, semi-automation of such a system is possible, where the automation controls the vehicle and a human operator controls the manipulator. Since in the unstructured environment not all system trajectories are measurable for the automation, a so-called Limited Information Cooperative Shared-Controller (LICSC) has been proposed in previous work. However, the design of the LICSC is done through tuning which is sensitive to the operator controlling the manipulator. The first contribution of this work is to reduce this sensitivity. A novel personalized design of the LICSC is presented that provides control tailored to the human operator. Our proposed approach uses state-of-the-art design methods of a cooperative controller to obtain the LICSC. The second contribution is the experimental validation of the LICSC, which proves the importance of the personalization to the human operator and demonstrates the advantage of the method.},

The existing methods tend to decrease accuracy when they adhere to the preservation of the ordinal relation. Therefore, we propose a new deep neural network that can consider ordinal relations while maintaining high accuracy. The proposed method consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork classifies the instances by considering the ordering relation. The relation is embedded in the subnetwork using the distributional distance between labels. The second subnetwork modifies the output of the first subnetwork from the viewpoint of cross-entropy error. The accuracy and the relation are adjusted by combining the outputs of the two subnetworks. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted experiments on two datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable to or superior to the existing methods in terms of accuracy and mean absolute error.},

This neurodegenerative disease consists of three general stages, which we classified in this research and that includes very mild (early stage), mild (middle stage) and finally, the moderate stage (late-stage). Using transfer learning, we implemented five existing efficient and recent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models such as VGG19, Inception- ResNetv2, ResNet152v2, EfficientNetB5 and EfficientNetB6, and another custom one of our own. Later, we ensembled thrice with multiple combinations of the models to enhance our outcome. This led us to achieve our proposed model, which is a weighted average ensemble of all the six classifiers mentioned above and this novel approach gave us an accuracy of 96\%, which was quite satisfactory compared to any other existing models.},

To solve the problem of information redundancy in the multimodal sentiment classification task, first, an image feature extraction model is established based on an attention neural network, which highlights the key areas of the image sentiment information. Second, the tensor product of the text and image mode is used as the joint feature expression of the multimodal data by using the tensor fusion method. After that, a specific information extraction module is designed to extract the fusion features and eliminate the redundant information in the joint features. Results of the experiments performed on two real Twitter image and text datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can outperform the existing models in classifying sentiments.},

With the accelerated development of deep learning techniques, it has been successfully applied extensively in many real-world applications, including health sectors such as medical image interpretation and disease diagnosis. By combining more modalities that being engaged in the processing of information, multimodal learning can extract better features and improve the predictive ability. The conventional methods for lung cancer survival analysis normally utilize clinical data and only provide a statistical probability. To improve the survival prediction accuracy and help prognostic decision-making in clinical practice for medical experts, we for the first time propose a multimodal deep learning framework for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival analysis, named DeepMMSA. This framework leverages CT images in combination with clinical data, enabling the abundant information held within medical images to be associate with lung cancer survival information. We validate our model on the data of 422 NSCLC patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Experimental results support our hypothesis that there is an underlying relationship between prognostic information and radiomic images. Besides, quantitative results show that our method could surpass the state-of-the-art methods by 4\% on concordance.},

Some existing cross-modal hashing methods construct pairwise similarities to represent the relationship of heterogeneous data, which require much computation time and storage space, making them unscalable for large-scale retrieval tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised Discrete Semantic Embedding Hashing (DSEH) for cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, we first learn the common representation of heterogeneous data by embedding the semantic labels into a collective matrix factorization, such that both intra- and inter-modality similarities can be well captured. Then, we learn the hash codes in the discrete space based on the learned common representation via an orthogonal rotation technique. Moreover, we learn the multi-modal hash functions that can efficiently convert out-of-sample instances into unified hash codes. Extensive experimental results on three widely used benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DSEH compared with previous state-of-the-arts.},

In specific, we build mappings between the extracted DRHFM features and secret messages. These features are robust to various of attacks, especially to geometrical attacks. We further deploy the DRHFM parameters to adjust the feature length, thus ensuring the high hidden capacity. Moreover, we introduce a chaos encryption algorithm to enhance the security of the mapping features.

This paper aims to investigate the performance of a novel SPECT nuclear imaging system proposed for small animal and brain imaging based on introducing the concept of the Laue lens as a part of a multi-pinhole collimation system. The proposed design is based on placing a Laue lens centered at each pinhole on a conventional multi-pinhole collimator. As an application, the system is optimized for the 140.6 KeV energy of Tc 99 . A lens-based SPECT imaging will open the door for light field image refocusing, the potential to have a system adapted to different organ size and shape. A more efficient SPECT system would also lead to a decrease in the dose of the injected radiotracers to the patient. A tracking Monte Carlo simulation is implemented in a MATLAB environment to predict the photon distribution of diffracted high energy photons. The obtained resolution of 0.1 mm would be an outstanding performance for SPECT in oncology imaging. One hit per 42 source photons was detected, corresponding to a sensitivity of 27 cps/MBq for one Laue lens. The attenuation, transmission, and absorption effects on the lens rings are also considered in this study. The comparison between the lens-based and conventional parallel LEHR SPECT is carried out in terms of system resolution, sensitivity, and the capacity to resolve adjacent submillimeter objects.},

The prosumers own renewable energy sources (RESs), while they can buy/sell their energy imbalance directly from/to the power grid. For the sake of increasing the penetration of RESs and reducing the operating cost, prosumers leverage on the shared CES: in particular, each user can only employ a portion of the overall CES charge/discharge profile. Differently from the related literature, where storage devices are individually owned and the battery degradation aspects are typically disregarded, we propose a novel control mechanism based on noncooperative game theory, which allows users to minimize their energy cost as well as concur on the CES resources allocation with minimal-degradation. The effectiveness of the method is validated through numerical experiments on a realistic case study, where a shared CES supplies energy to the local community of residential prosumers. Finally, the comparison with a centralized control approach shows that the proposed framework allows all prosumers to achieve a fair cost-optimal utilization of the shared CES.},

However, the integration of intelligence and cyber system to a smart grid can result in serious cyber security concerns and presents the entire power system more vulnerable to be attacked. In this paper, a new cyber attack model with the alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM) based optimal power flow (OPF) problem is introduced and exploited by malicious attackers. To deal with this challenge, a defence mechanism is presented to not only detect the existence of data injection attack, but also mitigate the potential impact to improve the stability of the smart grid. This scheme takes the power measurements between neighbouring nodes into account, and distinguishes the time-delay attack and bad data injection attack by monitoring the measurement variations between received data and predicted data based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has the capability of detecting and mitigating the stealthy attacks significantly by using a 33-bus power system. Consequently, it is a significant study in the actual smart grid and can minimise the impact of the cyber attack.},

  abstract  = {In this paper an event based adaptive neural network (ANN) observer is designed, where selected neurons are trained by an adaptive law to estimate uncertainties in order to mitigate agent misbehave in the multiagent featured microgrid. Time dependent uncertainties can be directly compensated through sliding mode controller (SMC) but to compensate state dependent uncertainties and agent uncertainties, ANN algorithm is proposed. Novel triggering law is derived for neurons weight update in ANN observer. Event trigger consensus control in multiagent scenario allows all agents (DGs) to achieve desired reference value while reducing the control effort. Robust and fast response is guaranteed by designing integral sliding surface with proportional surface term in SMC reaching law. Proposed method is immune to system sensitivity against both state and time dependent uncertainties. The controller efficacy is demonstrated in MATLAB/Simulink platform.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the use of virtual engineering design processes has become more prevalent within industry. This increase has been facilitated by the availability of cost-effective computational machinery on which to run complex simulations of alternative candidate designs. Nevertheless it is frequently the case that, when working with complex problems, the number of simulation-based design evaluations available is limited. Within both industry and academia, it is usual for the stages of simulation model calibration and model-based optimization to be considered as separate consecutive steps rather than as a combined process. However, there is no guarantee that this approach makes the most efficient use of the available function evaluations. This work presents a new alternating methodology that aims to make more efficient use of the evaluation budget, through switching back and forth between the stages of calibration and optimization. To assess the effectiveness of the method, a new benchmark problem is introduced that contains both model parameters to be estimated and design variables to be selected. The new alternating method is found to possess improved calibration and comparable optimization performance in comparison to the sequential method on a budget of 5000 evaluations.},

  abstract  = {The pandemic disease COVID-19, originated from the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread globally. Researchers are working tirelessly on areas including studying the transmission of COVID-19, promoting its identification, designing new vaccines and therapies, and recognizing its socio-economic consequences. This extensive research leads to the exploration of thousands of scientific papers related to biology, chemistry, genetics, health, and economy. Therefore, it is essential to develop an intelligent text mining technique for segregating this rich source of data to perform easy access, information retrieval, and interpretation within minimum time and resources. We propose a multi-objective optimization-based document clustering approach for the CORD-19 (COVID-19 Open Research Dataset) dataset in this paper. Here, a new technique utilizing BioBERT has been proposed, which benefits from the abstract and the document text, rather than only the brief abstract, to perceive a concise understanding of the text to generate clusters with better definitions. The main contributions of the proposed work are two-fold: in the first step, we have used BioBERT to generate the sentence embedding which is further used for the document representation. In the next step, we have developed a multi-objective optimization (MOO) based clustering algorithm for grouping the generated document vector representations. In this MOO-based clustering, we have used Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and Fuzzy c-means algorithm as the underlying MOO and clustering technique, respectively. This model is evaluated using the Silhouette Score (Silhouette score) and Calinski-Harabasz index (CH index), and the clustering solutions are visualized using word clouds. The clustering results exhibit significant improvements over various other existing clustering models.},

While there exists a great variety of automated planning algorithms, the modeling of a problem instance often requires expertise in problem recognition and faculty of abstraction—a task which can be done best by humans. In order to exploit the synergy potential inherent in human-machine cooperative planning, we propose a new reoptimization framework based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for heterogeneous multi-robot task allocation problems including cooperative tasks and precedence constraints. The main idea of the reoptimization framework is to reuse insights from previous solutions of similar problem instances. In particular, a modified problem instance, resulting for example from adding or deleting individual tasks, is solved based on the solution of the unmodified problem instance. To this end, we introduce suitable heuristics for the adaption of the initial solution based on the considered problem modification. The simulative investigation of the proposed approach shows great positive effects compared to the application of a standardized GA that does not make use of the solution of the unmodified problem instance.},

This paper proposes a simple but effective method to empower Bayesian optimization to solve dynamic optimization problems. It augments the covariance function with the measurement of the relationship between historical observations and the current ones. By doing so, the Bayesian optimization is able to leverage the observations from the previous time step to jump start the optimization in the new environment with a strictly limited computational budget.

This technique can tailor balance between various aspects of vehicle dynamics such as vehicle’s speed, acceleration and jerk. This study proposes a longitudinal controller for AV using a data-driven MPC based on human driving demonstration. A novel parameterised cost function-based MPC is designed in order to provide a general solution for different driving scenarios. This parametric cost function provides a customisable approach towards longitudinal motion generation by learning a proper set of parameter values from the user’s driving style. Instead of using any classification technique for identifying driving styles, we asked human drivers to drive with different styles and use that data directly to learn the values of the parameters. The Bayesian Optimisation (BO) approach is used to learn an optimised set of parameters minimising the gap between some carefully chosen feature values of the controller and human-generated motion. The observations of simulation show that the proposed controller is capable of generating customisable longitudinal vehicle speed, acceleration, jerk, as well as headway distance between vehicles based on a specific human driving style.},

  abstract  = {The grim reality of fatigued driving-caused traffic accidents indicates the urgent need to establish a robust fatigued driving detection method to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving. Previous studies on this topic have little consideration on the sequence-level characteristics of driver’s behaviors, furthermore, many of them only focus on one type of feature, which limits the accuracy and flexibility. Besides, most existing computer vision-based studies perform experiments on high-performance hardware like GPUs, which can not demonstrate their performance in the reality, as it is impractical to equip such high-end computing hardware in vehicles. This paper proposes a novel low-power hardware-friendly fatigued driving detection method based on multi-feature fusion and time series classification. The system utilizes a camera installed on the vehicle for driver monitoring. Continuous frames of a specific duration are a detection sequence. Multiple physical features including head orientation, face landmark coordinates, EFV (Eye Feature Vector), and MFV (Mouth Feature Vector) are extracted from each frame. A neural network optimized for low-power hardware is used to classify the multivariate time series samples denoting the driver’s state into two classes: fatigued or alert. Sequence-level analysis reduces the false positive rate by avoiding being affected by accidental symptoms. Multi-feature enhances the capability to give the right detection results in complex and changeable driving scenarios. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on an ARM platform-based device simulating the low-power in-vehicle hardware environment. Experiments show our models surpass existing studies by up to 11.49\% on accuracy and achieve up to 1.41× speedup, proving the significant advantages of the proposed method.},

The evaluation and selection of optimal path shares is performed by the rider agent based on its objective function.

This paper proposes an approach for finding the best itinerary to CAVs into a road network. If we consider only a single CAV, the problem turns into the shortest path problem according to the real-time traffic information. When it comes to a road network served by several CAVs, such as in Personal Rapid Transit (PRT), the problem of the traffic assignment equilibrium is raised. However, the known algorithms for solving such problems are greedy in terms of computation time and memory. In order to solve the problem, this paper introduces a new distributed approach, using multi-agent systems. We call the approach Mixed Node Reservation (MNR). Each CAV agent computes its itinerary by using an accurate estimation of its travel time through its connectivity to node agents of the network. To this end, two new key concepts are introduced. The first one is the node reservation. This allows to adjust the travel time between two nodes, by considering the acceleration time as well as the time spent into the next intersection. The second key concept is the spawned virtual CAVs. This aims to accurately estimate the future lost time generated by CAVs which are not yet in the network. Other approaches of the literature are simulated for comparisons. The experiment results show that MNR allows CAVs to share the network much more efficiently.},

  abstract  = {Stress and cognitive overload during driving are associated with decreased performance potentially leading to serious mistakes and even fatal incidents. Therefore, research on drivers’ mental states recognition is promising to reduce these traffic accidents caused by human error (e.g., in combination with driver assistance systems and automated driving functions). Easy-to-use, unobtrusive wearables allow convenient measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA) which is an informative measure for the experienced stress level. In this article, we explore the potential of various conventional machine learning (ML) models with hand-crafted features, automated pipeline optimization (AutoML), and deep learning (DL) to recognize drivers’ stress states from EDA recordings in a driving simulator. Three different stress states (low, mid, and high stress) were induced via (a) the complexity level of the driving task (manual and automated driving) and (b) simultaneous secondary cognitive tasks. Our results reveal that a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier with handcrafted features of the phasic and tonic EDA response as well as a pipeline suggested by AutoML via Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization (TPOT) are particularly suited with a high classification performance above an empirical chance level estimated via a dummy classifier. Predicting the three stress levels, they achieved a bootstrapped balanced accuracy of 63.7\% (KNN; 95\% confidence interval (CI): [36.7, 86.7]) and 71.6\% (stacking classifier of the AutoML; 95\% CI: [50.0, 90.0]), respectively. Interestingly, the DL model architecture was not superior in performance compared to the conventional and AutoML models with handcrafted features. Our results propose that AutoML might be beneficial to find optimal ML pipelines for EDA-based state recognition. In the future, we aim to evaluate the here proposed models regarding their generalization ability by applying them (a) on new datasets collected during realistic driving scenarios and (b) within a subject-independent approach (i.e., training one model for all subjects).},

Using the hybrid system model, the movement of the traffic agent is divided into maneuvers. Therefore, the decision-making process is a maneuver selection problem having reduced complexity compared to trajectory planning. While previous models used maneuver description with constant acceleration values, the presented approach models the maneuvers on a more macroscopic level using the well known Intelligent Driver Model. This has the advantage of creating more realistic acceleration profiles without increasing the computational complexity of the model. The maneuver selection process is modeled using the nash equilibrium concept of game theory. The resulting coupled optimization problem for each player is solved using an iterated best response algorithm determining the nash equilibrium. Finally, using simulation examples, it is shown that the presented model is capable of creating a variety of scenarios using different parameter sets as well as simulating scenarios with a high number of traffic participants.},

Being capable of assessing, in real-time, the operator’s workload could help prevent calamitous events from occurring. This workload estimation could enable an AI to make informed decisions to assist or advise the operator, in an advanced human-robot interaction framework. We propose a method, named Fessonia, for real-time cognitive workload estimation from multiple parameters of an operator’s driving behaviour via the use of behavioural entropy. Fessonia is comprised of: a method to calculate the entropy (i.e. unpredictability) of the operator driving behaviour profile; the Driver Profile Update algorithm which adapts the entropy calculations to the evolving driving profile of individual operators; and a Warning And Indication System that uses workload estimations to issue advice to the operator. Fessonia is evaluated in a robot teleoperation scenario that incorporated cognitively demanding secondary tasks to induce varying degrees of workload. The results demonstrate the ability of Fessonia to estimate different levels of imposed workload. Additionally, it is demonstrated that our approach is able to detect and adapt to the evolving driving profile of the different operators. Lastly, based on data obtained, a decrease in entropy is observed when a warning indication is issued, suggesting a more attentive approach focused on the primary navigation task.},

To this end, we classify all drivers’ characteristics into three types: calm, moderate and aggressive, in accordance with their differences in response coefficient, expectation safe distance, maximum speed and lane-changing intention. Based on Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory, our model can reproduce the empirical features of spontaneous traffic breakdown phenomena, revealing the mechanism of congestion formation and state transitions. In addition, we examine how the traffic accident, honking and fast-slow lanes could affect the heterogeneous traffic flows. Numerical experiments show that the drivers’ characteristics play an essential role in stabilizing the traffic flow on multilane roads. The results may contribute to traffic planning and control on the urban roadways.},

  abstract  = {Driver mental fatigue is a major influential factor that results in inattentive driver condition ultimately to fatal crashes. In this paper, the driver mental fatigue patterns based on the driver’s body postural behaviour are identified using a novel adaptive pattern recognition technique. The experiments were conducted on 20 healthy subjects in a MATHWORKS simulated driving environment. The posture of the driver was measured using the XSENS motion capture system. To monitor the actions performed under the influence of mental fatigue, variations in the acceleration of the head, neck, and sternum were extracted and deployed in an unsupervised manner. A fully adaptive version of the symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm based on unsupervised clustering was developed that identifies the time-series patterns of driver fatigue posture. The time-variant fatigue patterns were dynamically segmented and symbolized according to the discrepancy in the postural behaviour. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm successfully detects the time-variant fatigue patterns of multivariate dataset compared to the original symbolic pattern recognition tool. The limitations of the current approach and future work in improving driver safety are explored.},

Some practical guidelines to easily design the proposed controllers are given.

  abstract  = {Intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles are expected to bring new experiences with enhanced efficiency and safety to road users in the near future. However, an efficient and robust vehicular communication system should act as a strong backbone to offer the needed infrastructure connectivity. Deep learning (DL)-based algorithms are widely adopted recently in various vehicular communication applications due to their achieved low latency and fast reconfiguration properties. Yet, collecting actual and sufficient transportation data to train DL-based vehicular communication models is costly and complex. This paper introduces a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) verification platform based on an actual traffic simulator and spectrum-aware access. This integrated platform can generate realistic transportation and communication data, benefiting the development and adaptivity of DL-based solutions. Accordingly, vehicular spectrum recognition and management are further investigated to demonstrate the potentials of dynamic slidelink access. Numerical results show that our platform can effectively train and realize DL-based C-V2X algorithms. The developed slidelink communication scheme can adopt different operating bands with remarkable spectrum detection performance, validating its practicality in real-world vehicular environments.},

To deal with the challenges associated with the autonomous driving scenarios, an integrated tracking and detection framework is proposed. The detection phase is performed by converting LiDAR streams to computationally tractable depth images, and then, a deep neural network is developed to identify pedestrian candidates both in RGB and depth images. To provide accurate information, the detection phase is further enhanced by fusing multi-modal sensor information using the Kalman filter. The tracking phase is a combination of the Kalman filter prediction and an optical flow algorithm to track multiple pedestrians in a scene. We evaluate our framework on a real public driving dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement over a baseline method that solely uses image-based pedestrian detection.},

Even though this advancement has provided numerous transportation modes, it has resulted in serious transportation issues including road congestion. Hence, estimating the number of vehicles on a road will enable traffic managers to take appropriate decisions to curb congestion. In this paper, we propose to use an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to efficiently and accurately predict the hourly traffic volume. We investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method for different scenarios including how well it performs during extreme weather conditions and holidays. We further investigate the effect of ridge and LASSO regularization on the performance of XGBoost. We then propose a new approach for setting the LASSO regularization parameter in terms of the number of observations and predictors. The performance and computational efficiency of the proposed approach is evaluated on data collected from Interstate-94, Minnesota and the results are compared with existing methods. The results show that the proposed method provides a good balance between performance and computational efficiency.},

It is the process of finding an optimal geometric transformation to align two images, which could be defined as a parameter optimization issue. Genetic Algorithm(GA) is one of the most efficient methods for solving complex optimization problems and it has been applied to the real-coding IR problem. However, the classical GA suffers from premature convergence and is easy to fall into local optimum. Inspired by heterosis, which is a common phenomenon in biology, this study proposes an improved GA. By artificially simulating the breeding process of Chinese three-line hybrid rice, known as a successful application of heterosis, the original crossover and mutation mechanisms of GA are improved, and a dynamic diversity controller is designed. This study conducts several multimodal biomedical IR experiments to compare the improved GA with state-of-the-art IR methods, the results show that the proposed method outperforms the others in most scenarios with faster convergence speed and greater robustness.},

  abstract  = {In this paper an optimized robust feedforward/feedback control strategy for anesthesia induction is proposed. Propofol is used to induce hypnosis and the bispectral index scale (BIS) is employed as an indicator of depth of hypnosis. The control action is divided in two parts, a feedforward action, which acts alone in the first phase of anesthesia induction, and a feedback PID action that concludes the induction by smoothly driving the BIS to the target value. The feedforward action is given by an optimized bolus of propofol that is determined by taking into account the uncertainty of the nonlinear pharmacodynamic model for the effect of propofol on BIS. In particular, the bolus is obtained as the solution of a constrained minimum-time control problem in order to minimize the induction time of anesthesia while preventing the undershoot of the BIS level. Thus the patient’s safety is ensured by avoiding side-effects due to drug overdosing. The PID controller is then used in order to compensate for the deviation of the BIS from the theoretical behaviour caused by the effect of inter-patient and intra-patient variability.},

  abstract  = {People perform most of their activities while being in an upright position. Nonetheless, there are some circumstances where they are required to adapt to different positions other than the upright position as in air manoeuvres and sport gymnastics. In these unexpected scenarios, the physiological signals are likely to change which can affect their performance. While some studies investigated the correlation between physiological signals and different body positions, to our best knowledge, these studies were limited to a rotating chair (1 or 2 degree of freedoms). Here, we investigated and evaluated human physiological responses (such as pupil diameter, skin temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate) to different seated positions including seated supine, seated side, seated inverted, and seated upright using Universal Motion Simulator (UMS), a 6 degree of freedom simulator with the most realistic acceleration and motion sensation. Open loop acrobatic flight motion sensation for the 11 participants were created and accompanied with a series of pre- and post-questionnaires to subjectively assess the physical wellbeing of each participant. The results of the study based on the objective assessment of collected physiological data showed that the mean heart rate decreases during an inverted position (82 beats per minutes bpm) and increased by an average of 7 beats per minute in an upright position 89.5 bpm. Moreover, the mean breathing rate in an upright position was 18.3 respirations per minutes (rpm) which is higher than mean breathing rate in the side position 19.8 rpm. Furthermore, it was found that the mean pupil diameter (PD) in an upright position was 4.33 mm which is higher compared to other positions. Independent from the motion scenarios and body positions, the Skin Temperature kept increasing which might be because of excitement and other emotional factors.},

  abstract  = {Driver’s drowsiness is one of the leading causes of traffic accidents. Drowsiness can be detected using brain waves (EEG) because it reflects the cognitive state of the brain. However, using EEG for drowsiness detection in vehicles is still impractical. The non-contact brain signal sensor NBM (Neuro-Bio Monitor), introduced by Freer Logic, has a potential to detect the driver’s drowsiness while driving due to its unobtrusive nature of brain signal sensing. In this study, a novel driver drowsiness detection algorithm was introduced using NBM signals. In addition, the feasibility of the NBM-based drowsiness detection algorithm in a driving simulator environment was evaluated by comparison with conventional methods including the eyelid closure ratio (PERCLOS) and the self-reported Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The study recruited 14 healthy adults and asked them to drive about 70 minutes on a night drive mode. NBM signals were recorded simultaneously with PERCLOS and KSS. The algorithm shows an accuracy of 78.79\% and a detection rate of 95\% by comparison with KSS based drowsiness. It also shows a correlation of more than 70\% with PERCLOS. This study demonstrated that NBM can be used in vehicle to detect driver drowsiness during driving.},

  abstract  = {Human-swarm interaction has recently gained attention due to its plethora of new applications in disaster relief, surveillance, rescue, and exploration. However, if the task difficulty increases, the performance of the human operator decreases, thereby decreasing the overall efficacy of the human-swarm team. Thus, it is critical to identify the task difficulty and adaptively allocate the task to the human operator to maintain optimal performance. In this direction, we study the classification of task difficulty in a human-swarm interaction experiment performing a target search mission. The human may control platoons of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) to search a partially observable environment during the target search mission. The mission complexity is increased by introducing adversarial teams that humans may only see when the environment is explored. While the human is completing the mission, their brain activity is recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG), which is used to classify the task difficulty. We have used two different approaches for classification: A feature-based approach using coherence values as input and a deep learning-based approach using raw EEG as input. Both approaches can classify the task difficulty well above the chance. The results showed the importance of the occipital lobe (O1 and O2) coherence feature with the other brain regions. Moreover, we also study individual differences (expert vs. novice) in the classification results. The analysis revealed that the temporal lobe in experts (T4 and T3) is predominant for task difficulty classification compared with novices.},

  abstract  = {It is well-known that stress affects sleep quality, suggesting abnormal brain activity during sleep when people are stressed. However, no study has examined where brain processes stress during sleep. This study aims to explore the associations between bedtime stress and the hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the first sleep cycle under free-living conditions. Stress biomarkers including salivary cortisol and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) were measured using the SOMA Dual Analyte LFD test kits on the experiment nights between 22:00-23:00 to control the circadian oscillation of the stress-related hormones. Perceived stress level was rated on a 1-10 Likert scale right after the collection of the salivary samples. The hemodynamics of the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) was measured using a wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device. Correlation analysis with statistical test was performed to examine the associations between different stress indicators and a set of time-domain and frequency-domain features derived from the hemodynamic responses. Significantly positive linear correlations were observed in the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis between the average concentration change of oxyhemoglobin and that of deoxyhemoglobin in the whole region of interest. Stress was found to correlate to the hemodynamics in the mid-DLPFC, the caudal-DLPFC, and the left RLPFC. The relationships between stress and these PFC subregions depends on the stress indicator adopted. Our finding provides supplementary support to the role of the PFC in processing stress. The preliminary results also shed light on the development of stress response markers in brain activity that can be measured with wearable brain-computer interface technologies.},

It is challenging to solve these tasks in reinforcement learning, especially for those that require combining high-level actions with flexible control. To address these challenges, we introduce a distributed self-play training framework for an extended proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that learns to act in parameterized action space and plays against a group of opponents, i.e., a league. Experiments on the domain of simulated RoboCup soccer show that, the approach is effective and learns more robust policies against various opponents compared to existing reinforcement learning methods.

While numerous attempts have been made to the few-shot speaker adaptation system, there is still a gap in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker depending on the amount of data. To bridge the gap, we propose GC-TTS which achieves high-quality speaker adaptation with significantly improved speaker similarity. Specifically, we leverage two geometric constraints to learn discriminative speaker representations. Here, a TTS model is pre-trained for base speakers with a sufficient amount of data, and then fine-tuned for novel speakers on a few minutes of data with two geometric constraints. Two geometric constraints enable the model to extract discriminative speaker embeddings from limited data, which leads to the synthesis of intelligible speech. We discuss and verify the effectiveness of GC-TTS by comparing it with popular and essential methods. The experimental results demonstrate that GC-TTS generates high-quality speech from only a few minutes of training data, outperforming standard techniques in terms of speaker similarity to the target speaker.},

  abstract  = {Adaptive adjustment of excavation parameters makes a significant role in the process of tunneling by tunnel boring machine (TBM), which ensures the tunneling carried out safely and efficiently. Though substantial effort has been devoted to this area, there is still a lack of a comprehensive method for TBM data analysis. In this paper, we analyzed the TBM data from different perspectives. The data source is from the Songhua River Water Conveyance Project. In order to facilitate the processing and analysis of the data, we proposed the concepts of rising characteristic interval (RCI) and stable characteristic interval (SCI), which are the first 30 seconds of the rising stage and one sixth of the center part of the stable stage respectively. As a key parameter, the cutterhead torque (T), which reflects the interaction between the cutter and the soil, is selected as our prediction target. In order to forecast the value of T in the SCIs, the time series characteristic and the non time series (mean and variance) characteristic of the important excavation parameters in the RCIs are analyzed. A sequential combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), LSTM-MLP for short, is used to make a comprehensive analysis of the two characteristics. Notably, adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) was employed to optimize the topology structure and the hyper parameters of our neural network, which ensures the convergence of the basic genetic algorithm and maintains the diversity of the population at the same time. The experimental results indicate that, LSTM-MLP performs better in comparison with LSTM network and backpropagation neural network (BPNN, a kind of MLP). Our work provides a reference for the control and optimization of TBM’s excavation parameters. To make our results fully reproducible, all the relevant source codes and the preprocessed dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Dandelionslove/LSTM MLP for TBM.},

Then we apply spectrograms on frequency modulated signals to capture the patterns. The proposed approach has been evaluated on 4 different medical datasets across both prediction and classification tasks. Significant results are found showing the efficacy of the approach for vital sign signals.

  abstract  = {The modern recognition methods based on deep learning have established high requirements for the size of training data. However, such data is not always publicly available, often undersized, or limited by the number of classes. Preparing ground truth data is very expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone during collecting as well as annotation for many applications, particularly for optical character recognition and handwriting recognition. In many applications, such as recognition of 2-dimensional languages (diagrams, charts, mathematical formulas), annotation is further complicated by the fact that in addition to the large number of symbol classes that vary depending on the application, the spatial relations between symbols or classes must also be annotated. In this work, we propose an approach for automatic annotation of online handwritten mathematical expressions. This iterative approach provides a hierarchical annotation using an LSTM-based recognition model and a small annotated dataset as a starting point and provides an increase in the alphabet, gradually improving the recognition accuracy of new classes of symbols. The proposed approach does not imply prior verification of the gathered dataset and comprises three main stages: training recognition models, automatic annotation using recognition and matching algorithms, and automatic verification. These stages are repeated until the number of new automatically recognized and annotated samples becomes small enough. Samples that have not passed automatic verification are suspicious and require manual verification or refining, which is done at the last stage. In our experiment, more than 85\% of the samples were automatically annotated. The annotation accuracy at the symbol level is more than 99\%. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach provided time-saving of up to 90\% on manual operations. The proposed approach can also be applied to high-noise datasets.},

  abstract  = {The research on face image generation has gained widespread attention in the field of image generation. However, large datasets are required to train a generative model to produce images of high quality and resolution. It is especially difficult to collect multiple face images of a specific group. It may also be difficult to establish an efficient model by training with a small dataset.This paper presents a novel method for the generation of face images with the features of a specific group. The face images of a dataset are embedded into a latent space as sets of latent variables by Image2StyleGAN and are expressed as a distribution of the sets of latent variables in the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the features of the distribution. The generation of images for different groups does not require re-training of the model, as a pre-trained model is used instead. Furthermore, the proposed method can generate high-quality images with the features of the group from a dataset with only about 100 face images. However, the quality and the variety of the generated images can vary depending on a Cumulative Contribution Rate (CCR) of the PCA. Therefore, this study also proposes a metric called the Fréchet Inception Distance in Principal Component Space (FID-PCS), which can evaluate the generated images even with a small dataset. The FID-PCS can be used to determine the CCR that generates images with a good balance between the quality and the variety. The face images of three groups were collected as datasets to evaluate the validity of the proposed method, which include male idols, female idols, and male mixed martial artists. It was observed that images with the features of the group are generated by the face distributions extracted by the PCA, and the images with high quality and wide variety are generated by determining the appropriate CCR by the FID-PCS.},

  abstract  = {Many path planning algorithms have been introduced so far, but most are costly, in path cost and in processing time, in large-scale uncluttered 3D environments such as underground mining stopes explored by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms are popular because of their probabilistic completeness and rapidity in finding a feasible path in single-query problems. Many of the algorithms (e.g. Informed RRT*, RRT#) developed to improve RRT need considerable time to converge in large environments. Shortcutting an RRT is an old idea that has been proven to outperform RRT variants. This paper introduces a new method, RRT-Rope, that aims at finding a near-optimal solution in a drastically shorter amount of time. The proposed approach benefits from fast computation of a feasible path with an altered version of RRT-connect, and post-processes it quickly with a deterministic shortcutting technique, taking advantage of intermediate nodes added to each branch of the tree. This paper presents simulations and statistics carried out to show the efficiency of RRT-Rope, which gives better results in terms of path cost and computation time than other popular RRT variations and shortening techniques in all our simulation environments, and is up to 70\% faster than the next best algorithm in a representative stope.},

  abstract  = {An active ankle foot orthosis (AAFO) is an assistive device that applies plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance to the ankle joint by means of a compliant actuator. The device must apply sufficient torque assistance to track the desired ankle trajectory. However, torque disturbances are prevalent throughout the gait cycle. Accurately modelling the AAFO in conjunction with the ankle joint disturbance torque is a difficult task, as the model parameters can change over time. As a result, parameters such as inertia and friction are often roughly estimated based on the user’s weight. The uncertainties due to unmodelled disturbances and errors in dynamics modelling can severely compromise the device’s ability to provide appropriate assistance.This paper presents a novel extended parameter estimation observer combined with a disturbance rejection controller to estimate the model’s inertia and friction. First, an extended state observer (ESO) is employed in which the extended state is the estimated disturbance. Knowing the nominal ankle torque trajectory and the disturbance, a novel control law is formulated to reject the effects of endogenous disturbance torque during trajectory tracking. Then, based on the observed difference between the observed disturbance and nominal ankle torque, the paper introduces a novel method to estimate the inertial and friction parameters of the AAFO.Simulation results show that state feedback with the ESO is able to reduce the root mean square tracking error by 5.2\% and 71.1\% for high and low feedback gains, respectively. The results also indicate that the estimated AAFO and ankle joint inertial and damping parameters converge close to the nominal plant parameters. Simulations also show the effectiveness of the estimation laws from various initial plant estimates.},

  abstract  = {To operate in unstructured settings, robots require control strategies that effectively respond to temporal changes in their environment. In the domain of robotic manipulation, most state-of-the-art approaches assume the objects to be grasped are static. Although some research has investigated the challenges of grasping moving objects, these studies have tended to use grasping plans which require a real-time estimate of a gripper-object interception point, which can be difficult to precisely obtain. The goal of this research was to investigate the performance benefits of using a controller with a reactive component for grasping tasks involving moving objects. We hypothesised that using a reactive control strategy, based on tactile sensing in the fingertips, would lead to improved performance and robustness across a wider range of grasping conditions. To test this hypothesis, the ability of a two-finger gripper to grasp a moving ball under a range of dynamic conditions was tested in simulation using the Gazebo robotic simulator and ODE physics engine. Tests revealed that for controllers where the grasp was not informed by tactile sensing, grasping success dropped significantly with increased misalignment between the centre point of the gripper and the point of interception with the moving object. In contrast, the performance of a reactive grasping strategy based on tactile sensing was found to be more robust across these conditions. These findings indicate that tactile sensing could play an important role in enabling robots to interact more effectively with dynamic objects.},

The results of two optimisation methods will be compared through the application of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to evaluate both the performance of each algorithm and the real word translation of their effectiveness. The outcomes reveal that, although the gradient-based method shows better statistical results, GA can result in a superior minimum FoS of 3.5 satisfying the requirements for most common structural design applications.},

As a result, the manifold structures in the raw data are well preserved in the feature space being from the top layer.

However, multiple tasks cannot provide enough labeled samples, training a neural network with a limited number of labeled samples is challenging. Therefore, meta-learning emerges. It aims to summarize from few-shot tasks and can quickly adapt to new categories. However, it is challenging to ensure that the trained feature extractor in the meta-train can adapt to the novel class in the meta-test. In this paper, we propose a subspace learning module to deal with the feature-mismatch problem. Specifically, we embed the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) module into the few-shot learning framework. It guarantees the feature embeddings in each few-shot task are more discriminative via increasing the inter-class distance and reducing the intra-class variances. We conduct experiments on four benchmark few-shot learning datasets, namely mini-Imagenet, CIFAR-FS, tiered-ImageNet, and CUB, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module. Experimental results show that this method has better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Automatic analysis of ECG recordings from a multiple-channel perspective has not been given enough attention, so it is essential to analyze an ECG recording from a multiple-channel perspective.

Typically, parallel manipulators are employed in the space industry for tracking the satellites with the antenna mounted on the end-effector. However, the workspace limitations of the parallel manipulators are highly restricted in terms of the end-effector’s linear and angular motions compared with the serial manipulators. In order to take the privilege of a serial manipulator advantages, the antenna is mounted on the ABB irb6600 manipulator’s end-effector while only generating 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) motions for simplification. Unfortunately, the current system cannot track the satellite motion accurately as it cannot generate the smooth motion while following a path, especially when the end-effector is in the vertical position. In this study, a real-time motion control tracking system using the 6-DoF motion of the ABB irb6600 robot is designed and developed using TCP/IP communication technique between MATLAB and IRC5 controller aiming to accurately track the satellite path with the ability to decrease the jerkiness of the motion. The proposed method has been tested in simulation environment using the small prototype of the ABB robot (irb120) while Simulink Desktop Real-Time and RoboStudio are used. The inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor is used to prove the tracking accuracy of the proposed method and elimination of the jerky motions using the proposed algorithm.},

However, the tuning of the weights for model predictive control is incredibly challenging to reduce the motion sensation errors. In this paper, a whale optimisation algorithm is used to gain the optimised weights of the model predictive control. The weights are optimized to reduce the cost function which is defined based on the motion inputs, input rates, and outputs. The recalculated weights via the whale optimisation algorithm should consider the limitations of the applications such as maximum tolerated error of motion sensation via the motion platform user, maximum linear and angular displacements, and maximum linear velocity. The proposed method is simulated seven times to demonstrate the accuracy and repeatability of the algorithm.

In this work, we investigate how to achieve the kinematic control of soft continuum robots without knowing model parameters of the robots. To this end, a model-free scheme based on varying-parameter recurrent neural networks (VP-RNN) is proposed. The scheme involves two components, one of which solves the inverse kinematics problem based on a VP-RNN model, and the other employs another VP-RNN model to estimate the pseudo-inverse of Jacobian matrix of continuum robots. Finally, the feasibility and robustness of the proposed control strategy are validated by simulations, including comparisons with other methods and case study with jammed actuation.},

  abstract  = {Small, lighter-than-air (LTA) robotic airship platforms offer an alternative to the more common, rotor-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). LTA vehicles are attractive due to their inherent safety, mobility, low power consumption, and extended flight times, making them suitable for operation in populated indoor environments. This paper explores the use of shared control strategies for teleoperation of miniature indoor robotic airships, paired with an autonomous landing and charging system. The teleoperation scheme passes the operator inputs to the airship actuators in a standardized manner, allowing for simple integration with various control input devices. Specifically, this work employs three different devices with distinctive user input mechanics. The autonomous landing system relies on ArUco markers and an on-board camera for state estimation. The developed docking station relies on a magnet-based winch mechanism that catches and pulls the airship to the appropriate position for charging. Finally, the shared control teleoperation framework is validated through a series of experiments involving user-guided indoor exploration and autonomous landing, with promising results.},

  abstract  = {We present new models of optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotic pick-and-place (P&amp;P), which plan action sequences and motion trajectory with low computational costs. We improved an existing state-of-the-art TAMP model integrated with the collision avoidance, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programing (MILP) problem. To enable the MILP solver to search for solutions efficiently, we introduced two approaches leveraging features of collision avoidance in robotic P&amp;P. The first approach reduces number of binary variables, which are related to the collision avoidance of delivery objects, by reformulating them as continuous variables with additional hard constraints. These hard constraints maintain consistency by conditionally propagating binary values, which are related to the carry action state and collision avoidance of robots, to the reformulated continuous variables. The second approach is more aware of the branch-and-bound method, which is the fundamental algorithm of modern MILP solvers. This approach guides the MILP solver to find integer solutions with shallower branching by adding a soft constraint, which softly restricts a robot’s routes around delivery objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches with a modern MILP solver.},

Recent work has proposed triggers and metrics for explainable AI based on human mental models and psychological explanation quality. We complement this previous work by (1) extending and supporting these triggers and metrics with existing directives for information integrity, transparency, and rigor, (2) outlining a provenance-based framework for recording human-machine collaboration, and (3) demonstrating that a provenance-based approach address many of these explainable AI triggers and metrics. We show that provenance-based analyses help address questions of foundations, alternatives, necessity vs. sufficiency, sensitivity (e.g., what-if analyses), impact, and rationale, and we provide concrete evidence using an implemented human-machine analytic workspace. We outline ways to empirically measure the ability of these additional interpretation strategies to improve human understanding.},

Using a small-scale design experiment we compare human explanations with explanations created by an ML system.

Then, based on POS data, we mark consumers as high volume, low volume and none volume customer groups with historical purchase volume as target variables. Based on RFID data, stay time, shopping background, flow direction and number of return visits are extracted as explanatory variables. In the experiment, a classification model of consumer behavior is established by using long short-term memory based neural network (LSTM-NN).

In multi-robot applications, autonomy levels such as teleoperation and fully autonomous are extended to team levels, and depending on the task might have complex hierarchical relations.This paper presents a preliminary work on multi-robot coordination strategy based on evaluating the robot’s level of autonomy. With appropriate assumptions, choosing the level of autonomy can be interpreted as a cooperative planning problem. To this end, we propose to encode the robot’s task and motion plans as a Behavior Tree (BT) to monitor the execution and react to external disturbances. Our approach combines an informative path planning with BT synthesis to obtain a plan that allows a robot to explore and act depending on the uncertainty in an environment representation. We demonstrate how a robot can switch between the single and cooperative execution depending on the exploration’s outcome in a navigation among movable objects scenario.},

Here, we address this difficulty by using mean field games (MFGs), which is a framework that deduces the macroscopic dynamics describing the density profile of agents from their microscopic dynamics. To effectively use the MFG, we propose a model predictive MFG (MP-MFG), which estimates the agent population density profile with using kernel density estimation and manages the input generation with model predictive control. The proposed MP-MFG generates control inputs by monitoring the agent population at each time step, and thus achieves higher robustness than the conventional MFG. Numerical results show that the MP-MFG outperforms the MFG when the agent model has modeling errors or the number of agents in the system is small.},

To this end, an upper bound on the convergence rate factor of the TADMM algorithm is derived in terms of the weight matrix of the network. To achieve faster convergence, the optimal weight matrix is computed using a semi-definite programming (SDP) formulation. Lastly, we implement the optimization problem in a Distributed Model-Predictive Control problem for a group of aircraft in formation flight and solve it using both Fast-Tracking ADMM (F-TADMM) and TADMM to demonstrate faster convergence of the proposed algorithm.},

To address this problem, we develop a distributed framework by reimplementing one of state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., CoFex, by using MapReduce. In particular, we adopt a novel tree-based data structure to reduce the heavy memory consumption cased by the huge sequence information of proteins. After that, the procedure of CoFex is modified by following the paradigm of MapReduce such that the prediction task can be completed in a distributed manner, thus fulfilling the demanding requirements of large-scale protein-protein interaction prediction. A series of experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed distributed framework in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can considerably improve the efficiency of CoFex by achieving more than two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency while retaining a comparable level of accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Applying Machine learning algorithms to data streams is a challenging task because traditional strategies suppose datasets to be labeled, finite and stationary. In the context of data streams, where the data is generated in real-time and the labels may be missing due to the high cost of the labeling process, the proposal of semi-supervised learning (SSL) strategies to learn from labeled and unlabeled data at the same time seems to be a viable solution, despite also being challenging. In this paper, we present a novel approach to handle missing labels for classification learning in data streams, named co-op training, which is based on self-training incremental and co-training. In a controlled experiment, we execute the proposed algorithm, along with most well-known semi-supervised learning strategies, in 11 artificial and real-world datasets, and compare the results. We found our strategy to be more accurate than the other SSL algorithms in most datasets, also presenting better run-times when accuracies were similar. These methods are implemented in the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) open-source software as an internal benchmark component, to help researchers to run experimental comparisons on semi-supervised learning on data streams easily.},

  abstract  = {Word embeddings have become the de-facto tool for representing text in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, as they can capture semantic and syntactic relations, unlike their precedents such as Bag-of-Words. Although word embeddings have been employed in various studies in recent years and proven to be effective in many NLP tasks, they are still immature for sentiment analysis, as they suffer from insufficient sentiment information. General word embedding models pre-trained on large corpora with methods such as Word2Vec or GloVe achieve limited success in domain-specific NLP tasks. On the other hand, training domain-specific word embeddings from scratch requires a high amount of data and computation power. In this work, we target both shortcomings of pre-trained word embeddings to boost the performance of domain-specific sentiment analysis tasks. We propose a model that refines pre-trained word embeddings with context information and leverages the sentiment scores of sentences obtained from a lexicon-based method to further improve performance. Experiment results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed method significantly increases the accuracy of sentiment classification.},

  abstract  = {In interconnected industrial control networks like smart grids, topology attacks on physical grids can lead to severe cascading failures and large-scale blackouts. Effective defense on vulnerable devices can significantly reduce the risk of cascading failures and improve overall system robustness. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability analysis problem from a graph theoretical classification perspective. By calculating a node vulnerability vector composed of features based on complex network theory, node embedding, extended betweenness and power flow distribution, we propose a node vulnerability analysis method based on XGBoost classifier. A cascading failure simulation model based on DC power flow is used to simulate the smart grid behaviours under topology attacks and create the dataset for the XGBoost classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed XGBoost-based method with newly-introduced features is demonstrated by case studies.},

  abstract  = {Discovering genes closely related to complex dis-eases is extremely important for disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Most existing methods use a two-step strategy with the beginning feature fusion step and the following inductive learning step to predict the potential gene-disease associations, ignoring the reciprocal relationship between the two steps which could help each other in achieving more accurate prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel One-step Multi-view Inductive Matrix Completion (OMIMC) model, highlighted by joint latent representation learning and weighted PU (positive-unlabeled) learning, to predict gene-disease associations. Specifically, our model employ the latent representation learning scheme to simultaneously capture the consistency and complementary information of the sample with multi-view (even the sample with missing views), and thus obtain the common latent representations for genes/diseases. Furthermore, considering that the gene-disease associations prediction is essentially a PU learning problem, we also introduce the adaptive weighting scheme into traditional inductive matrix completion model to penalize the observed and the unknown associations differently. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on several real data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

Thus, the normally adopted fully automated task execution approaches based on environmental perception and motion planning techniques are still inadequate and problematic for the arduous twisting tasks. To this end, this paper presents a novel strategy of the dual-arm coordinated control for twisting manipulation based on the combination of optimized motion planning for one arm and real-time telecontrol with human intelligence for the other.

The assistance efficiency of these devices, however, is less optimized because the parameters in the active impedance control are manually designated. This paper presented a novel assistance control scheme to address the sub-optimal issue. This study poses that the assistance efficiency can be maximized by modifying the mechanical impedance to resonate with the muscle driving force, in which the human-exoskeleton coupling system is approximated with a second-order dynamical system. Based on this, the exoskeleton virtual stiffness is adaptively tuned to make the system intrinsic frequency align with the intended swing frequency. The proposed assistance control scheme demonstrated an increased assistance efficiency than the conventional active impedance control in a simulated study. Experiments that were managed on a newly custom-made hip assistance robotic exoskeleton also demonstrated strong evidence of improved gait kinematics with decreased muscle-skeleton efforts.},

Foot-controlled interfaces have previously shown the capability to be used for the continuous control of robot arms. However, the use of such interfaces for controlling a supernumerary robotic limb in coordination with the natural limbs is not well understood. In this paper, a teleoperation task imitating physically-coupled hands in a virtual reality scene was conducted with 14 subjects to evaluate human performance during trimanipulation. The participants were required to move three limbs together in a coordinated way mimicking three arms holding a shared physical object. It was found that after a short practice session, three-hand trimanipulation with a single subject’s hands and foot was still slower than dyad operation.

  abstract  = {Dynamic gesture recognition is a typical human-computer interaction method owing to its great potential in practical applications. Currently, most of research work on gesture recognition has mainly focused on vision-based and surface electromyography (sEMG) methods. Compared to vision-based methods, the sequential sEMG signal can directly depict the muscle activity of different gestures which could lead to higher recognition efficiency. However, the effective feature design and selection of sEMG signal is still complicated since muscle fatigue and small electrode displacement will affect the recognition precision of sEMG signals. In this paper, a novel end-to-end dynamic gesture recognition method is developed. The raw sEMG signals are converted into an image form by using the time-frequency transformation method to obtain more comprehensive information for model training and test. And a recognition model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built for high-precision time-frequency image recognition. Experiments indicate that the proposed method could acquire distinguishing features from the pre-prossed images and the overall recognition accuracy on different gestures can reach up to 98.3\%.},

This task becomes even more complex because different road users have different driving behaviors. There are underlying intentions that cannot be predicted with certainty without direct communication. In the current state of the art, most promising pattern-based models are trained on a dataset and then applied in the real world. In this paper we present an algorithm for vehicle trajectory prediction that is using online learning. The algorithm uses observations during the inference to optimize the underlying neural network at runtime. We show that our model can adapt to an observed behavior and thus improve the predicted uncertainty of trajectory predictions. Furthermore, we emphasize that our online learning approach can be transferred to many problems in self-supervised learning.

A compound Deep Learning (DL) model, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Attention (Att-SeriesNet-GRU), is used in this work to predict the apple yield for 15 counties across 6 different Crop Reporting Districts (CRD) in California. The DL model is trained using static soil parameters, which remain constant over years per county and dynamic parameters, which change daily or monthly for a specific county as input, and the corresponding annual apple yield for that county as output. If the training is done based on a single county data then the static parameters won’t add information to the DL model since they remain constant over years per county. Therefore, considering different counties across California is decided to study the effect of considering the static soil parameters along with the dynamic ones. The county level annual apple yield forecast using both static and dynamic parameters together gives promising results. Experimenting with the test set as input shows that adding the static parameters together with the dynamic ones gives an improvement of around 34\% in the value of Aggregated Measure (AGM) over the case of using the dynamic parameters alone for yield forecasting. It is also found that training the DL model with augmented training set improves the AGM value by around 12\%.},

  abstract  = {Today, railway infrastructure is subject to regular inspections carried out by image acquisition. Experts need automatic tools to process these images and extract defects. These defects can be classified in two categories : linear defects, like cracks, and surface defects, like spall, humidity, graffiti… Cracks detection has been presented in a previous work, and is based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) extraction and our FLASH algorithm [1]. In this paper, we propose a new method, using the same LBP descriptors, already extracted, to detect surface defects using generative adversarial networks (GAN). The detection is followed by a classification with a potentially scalable system. Experiments show that our detector achieves better performance than the state-of-the art in application to defect detection.},

While different works address this issue, bridging domain gap with high-level representation is hard as it comprises of entangled information including identity, background, occlusion, and other domain-specific variations. In this paper, we propose a disentangled reconstruction method to address the domain-shift problem for Re-ID in an unsupervised manner. To this end, we have two major contributions. First, we propose to disentangle identity-relevant and identity-irrelevant features from person images. Second, in the target domain, we explicitly consider the camera style transfer images as a data augmentation to address intra-domain discrepancy and to learn the camera invariant features. Experimental results on the challenging benchmarks of Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance.},

When the number of systems and their interactions keeps increasing in the future mosaic warfare oriented combat SoS, optimal architecture selection becomes very important due to the large number of possible design alternatives. However, in the optimal architecture selection problems, the dependency relationship between component systems has not been well captured. Thus, this paper developed a functional dependency incorporated architecture optimization formulation through a non-linear capability aggregation model. The architectural decisions include the allocation of physical systems to given functions and the determination of dependency parameters. Differential evolution algorithm is employed to solve this non-linear optimization problem. An application to a synthetic naval air and missile defense example in the end demonstrates that the proposed method can pick out the optimized architecture decisions for the combat SoS development.},

To solve the problem, this paper puts forward a framework for the disintegration of enemy combat networks under incomplete information. First, a weapon system of systems is modeled as a HCN by abstracting diversified systems and information flows into multiple types of nodes and edges. Next, the HCN is reconstructed with the link prediction method based on representation learning. Then, based on the conception of killing chain, a new index is proposed to evaluate the effect of disintegration considering the capability attribute of weapons and its attack cost. Last, a real-world HCN is taken as a case study and extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that the framework proposed in this paper can provide decision-making support for battlefield command under incomplete information.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality resulting in poor performances when handling large-scale problems. Cooperative coevolution aims to overcome these issues in a divide and conquer approach by decomposing the original problem into several lower-dimensional sub-problems. For each sub-problem a chosen EA is applied for a defined number of function evaluations. This is repeated in a round robin like fashion until a terminating condition is met. A recently proposed area in the evolutionary computation field is the evolutionary multitask optimization (EMTO) framework. By jointly optimising several tasks, EMTO aims to exploit beneficial information across multiple tasks to improve the performance compared to optimising each task in isolation. In this paper, we consider a large-scale problem as a multi-task optimization problem by considering each sub-problem as an independent task. Applying an EMTO algorithm, knowledge transfer across sub-problems is carried out explicitly to improve the optimization of each sub-problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms empirically on a suite of separable and non-separable benchmark problems of varying dimensions.},

However, providing the DMs with a large amount of the trade-off alternatives not only increase their workload, but also add irrelevant noise to the decision-making process. Without any prior knowledge, knee points, characterised as their smallest trade-off loss at all objectives, are attractive to decision makers in multi-criterion decision-making. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective knee point identification method based on Voronoi diagram. It divides the objective space into several Voronoi cells to capture the geometric characteristics of the underlying trade-off solution set. Thereafter, the knee points are identified as those having a local Voronoi distance. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to identify knee points located in both convex and concave part of the corresponding Pareto-optimal front.},

There are over 1 billion sites on the world-wide web 1 . It is important to understand the user’s query and return the top results that are majorly related to the query. In Search Result Clustering, results returned by one or more search engines are clustered into meaningful groups.The Search Results Clustering problem is modelled as a multi-view clustering problem in this study. The problem is then solved using an optimization framework. Experiments have been performed considering various combinations of four views including word-mover distance, BERT, TFIDF, and universal sentence encoder. The multi-objective binary differential evolution (MBDE) approach is used to optimise multiple quality measures computed on clusters produced by different views at the same time. We considered a set of possible solutions where each solution represents partitioning information obtained using different views. An agreement index that checks the consistency of partitionings of multiple views is also optimised. To get a single ensembled partitioning after considering various views, consensus partitioning technique and generative modeling are explored. The proposed model can automatically detect the number of clusters for any query. Our approach outperforms by 3.33\% F1-score on three widely-used datasets over state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract  = {Hypervolume subset selection is a hot topic in the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) due to the increasing needs of selecting a small set of representative solutions from a large set of non-dominated solutions (e.g., unbounded external archive). To maximize the hypervolume (HV) of the selected subset, a number of HV subset selction (HSS) methods have been proposed. Greedy forward selection (GFS) subset selection method is the most popular one, which has been actively investigated in the literature. However, few studies focus on local search (LS) HSS method, which is similar to the mechanism of SMS-EMOA. The time cost of the LS method is usually high, and the quality of the subset selected by this method is always poor. To address these two issues, in this paper, we first adopt an HV contribution update strategy to the original LS method to significantly reduce its time cost. In addition, two efficient strategies are proposed to improve the performance of the LS method to get a better subset. Finally, experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the improved LS method.},

The robot can travel at most B distance with its battery fully charged. The objective of this energy-constrained robot is to travel from location S to location G in the presence of k charging stations while minimizing the incurred travel cost. As the robot is constrained by its energy, it needs to stop at one or more charging stations in order to recharge its battery. To solve the stated problem, we have proposed a variant of the classical A * search algorithm that plans the path of the robot in such a way that it moves as much distance as possible with a full recharge (the maximum being B). Furthermore, it chooses the one to be the next charging station that minimizes the extra distance that needs to be covered to reach it on top of the shortest distance from S to G. We have designed novel heuristic functions that guide the search towards such charging stations where the deviation from the shortest path without the constraint is the minimum. We prove that the proposed approach is complete. Results show that our proposed algorithm finds an optimal solution while taking a negligible time to execute.},

  abstract  = {Learning to drive in highly crowded urban areas with multi-agent interaction is a challenging task. Most of the current methods rely on hand-crafting the policy required for the decision-making process. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers proper methodologies to automatically formulate the best policy without manual intervention. However, the baseline RL algorithms face a challenge in handling simulated driving situations (e.g., keep driving in the current lane center, and keep a safe distance from a leading vehicle) in high fidelity and complex urban areas. In this study, we propose an end-to-end autonomous driving system using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) with a new observation input to enable the RL agent to learn driving in complex environments i.e. CARLA simulator. The observation input comprises a tuple of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) image data from the forward-facing camera, vehicle speed, and vehicle angle from the road center. The output comprises the steering, brake, and acceleration commands. Our proposed model, in conjunction with formulating the proper reward function, results in a rapid convergence with a better performance and safer driving behaviors from an autonomous driving agent. The results indicate that the LSTM-DQN model enables the autonomous agent in controlling the vehicle in a lane while keeping a safe distance from the leading vehicle in varied unseen road conditions.},

  abstract  = {While researchers have found benefits in the use of Augmented Reality (AR) for training in maintenance tasks, many existing applications are limited to the use of hand-held controllers for interaction with the virtual environment. One novel alternative to traditional controls is the use of Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) systems and Motor Imagery (MI), using data from the user’s brain in the form of electroencephalography (EEG) waves. While some research has explored the use of BMI with virtual environments, the use of MI in an AR system has not been explored for use in training how to accomplish a procedural task. Therefore, this paper presents a BMI system combined with AR, to create a framework that allows for hands-free traversal of a predefined instruction-set for training using user brain activity. The created prototype allows for control of an AR environment using three modalities: brain activity, voice commands, and hand gestures. The created BMI-AR prototype allows for control of navigation through a predetermined instruction set using a user’s brain waves or voice commands, as well as allow users to see their passive EEG readings of affective mental state in real time. The initial prototype resulted in promising initial machine learning (ML) accuracy scores for motor imagery (MI) tasks.},

  abstract  = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) permit neural activity to be directly interpreted and used for applications, like therapeutic replacement of lost function (e.g. stroke) or to supplement existing function (e.g. handsfree applications). Two major challenges for BCI are accurate interpretation of neural activity and signal processing speed for real-time applications i.e. correctly decode a user’s intent and the timely execution of that intent. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has advantages over Electroencephalography (EEG) with respect to spatial and temporal resolution which could potentially allow better decoding of brain activity. High spatial and temporal resolution using MEG generates a large volume of data which must be rapidly preprocessed and classified correctly for practical realtime BCI. This paper presents a simple data processing technique to clean, normalise and reduce data dimensionality, for optimal class label decoding using a simple Logistic Regression classifier. Good decoding performance was achieved using an off-line MEG dataset, with or without data dimensionality reduction, comparable to more complex data pre-processing methods and classifiers already studied.},

Our main objective in this paper is to evaluate a high-frequency stimuli SSVEP system, which are not optimal for evoking the target signals. This experimental scenario is closer to real situations, a step towards BCI-based aid for decision-making in unconstrained situations. To that end, we performed experiments with four subjects to evaluate SSVEP stimuli at low frequencies, traditionally used in the paradigm, and high frequencies configured in a threshold not visible to the human eye, allowing the prototype to behave more closely to real-world situations while avoiding visual fatigue. The average accuracy among the four subjects was 89.37\% ± 8.26\% for low-frequencies and 80.62\% ± 7.18\% for high-frequencies. This indicates that it is possible to achieve acceptable results with high-frequency stimuli for decision-making.},

However, if there is a high contradiction between two bodies of evidence, the classical Dempster combination rule often gives the fusion result which violates the intuitive results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a single factor belief function with a new evidence reliability coefficient. The original evidence is preprocessed based on the reliability coefficient to get new evidence and to generate a reasonable basic probability assignment (BPA) function. After that, the combined results of the evidence are expressed in the binary form of reliability coefficient and BPA. The merit of the proposed method is that it takes advantage of the characteristics of the evidence itself to deal with the uncertain data and avoids the problem that the classical Dempster combination rule is not applicable for high conflict evidence. Finally, two UCI data sets are used to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the new method.},

This article aims to solve the problem of priority inversion caused by simultaneous access to shared resources by tasks in a multi-processor real-time system. We propose a task allocation model and partition scheduling algorithm based on the MSRP protocol, which is called SASR-MSRP. Firstly, the algorithm divides the task set into two categories based on whether the task accesses shared resources or not. Secondly, calculate the system utilization rate U of the task that accesses the shared resource and determine the execution priority of the task according to its non-increasing order and assign it to the corresponding processor. Finally, we use the EDF scheduling algorithm to sequentially allocate the remaining independent tasks to the idle time period of the application processor. This algorithm not only reduces the problem of priority inversion, but also improves the overall scheduling efficiency of the system.},

In this regard and to jointly utilize potential benefits that can be achieved by coupling clustering and image compression, the paper proposes a novel routing methodology referred to as the Energy Efficient Cluster-based Image Transmission (EECIT) scheme. In the proposed EECIT scheme, the multimedia-based sensor network is divided into different clusters depending on the node’s density, in which one node is adaptively assigned as the Cluster Head (CH). A key novelty of the proposed EECIT lies in the routing stage where ranking sensor nodes is performed via a new metric named Fair Selection (FS) coefficient, which is designed by considering a combination of mean-deviation and the number of times that nodes involve in routing. As a consequence of the fair distribution of energy consumption across the network, the network’s lifetime increases.},

In this paper, we introduce, make a comparison, and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CE with Elite strategy (ECE), which is based on the heuristic information from the elite individuals of the current population. Moreover, because in CE, the distribution characteristic of the chaotic system plays a very important role in deciding the search power, we also make paired comparison and analyze the optimization performance between our proposed ECE algorithms using different types of chaotic map and the canonical CE by applying 12 well-known Benchmark functions as the test functions and some measurement tests.

Automatic text summarization provides a good method to simplify text information. Traditional methods are mainly divided into extractive and abstractive methods. However most extractive methods do not have too much context connection, which leads to unsmooth abstracts. Abstractive method is the mainstream method, but it also deviates from the text content and has the problem of poor readability. In this paper, a hybrid automatic text summarization method is proposed based on deep learning and a rapid self-attention mechanism. This mechanism is used to obtain a hybrid model DNM (Dilated Neural Random Attention with Minimal Risk Loss) by optimizing the network structure and combining it with a specific loss function. The ROUGE score of our model is compared with the extractive Neural Document Summarization (NEUSUM), the abstractive Graph-Based Attentional (GBA) and the hybrid model CopyNet on the LCSTS dataset so as to achieve more accurate and reasonable automatic text summarization.},

  abstract  = {Data stream classification differs from batch learning classification methods as data is made available sequentially and may drift over time. Therefore, data stream classification can be simultaneous to all other kinds of classification problems, and it has been revisiting many aspects related to classification in the last years. So far, hierarchical classification was weakly addressed in streaming scenarios despite being a well-established research topic. To fill in this gap between such areas, in this paper, we propose the adaptive global k-Nearest Neighbors for the hierarchical classification of data streams (Global kNN-hDS). Our proposal classifies hierarchical data streams using a constrained memory buffer and a global classification approach. We compare our method against a stateof-the-art local kNN also tailored for streaming scenarios, and results show that our method obtains competitive prediction rates while being statistically faster.},

  abstract  = {This research presents a novel and simple approach to the concept drift detection problem, a fundamental issue in data stream mining because the generated models need to be updated when significant changes in the underlying data distribution occur. A number of drift detectors has been proposed but most of them have limitations such as limited effect on the accuracy results, high computational complexity, poor sensitivity to gradual change, or the opposite problem of high false positive rate. The proposed method, Ultimately Simple Drift Detector (USDD), has low false positive and negative rates as well as low computational complexity. Extensive experiments against seven drift detectors on a wide variety of datasets reveals that, using limited resources, USDD delivers high accuracy in classification and, at the same time, maintains a competitive true detection rate when compared to the other methods.},

  abstract  = {The reinforcement learning (RL) problem is typically formalized as the Markov Decision Process (MDP), where an agent interacts with the environment to maximize the long-term expected reward. As an important branch of RL, Lifelong RL requires the agent to consecutively solve a series of tasks modeled as MDPs, each of which is drawn from some distribution. A crucial issue in Lifelong RL is how best to utilize the knowledge from the previous tasks for improving the performance in the current task. As a pioneering work in this field, MaxQInit takes the maximum over action-values learned from previous tasks’ environmental rewards as the initial action-value of the current task. In this way, MaxQInit improves the initial performance in the current task and reduces the sample complexity of learning. However, the rewards obtained in the learning process are usually delayed and sparse, dramatically decreasing the learning efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new method, Shaping Rewards for Lifelong RL (SR-LLRL), to speed up the lifelong learning process by shaping timely and informative rewards for each task. Critically, we construct the Lifetime Reward Shaping (LRS) function based on the knowledge of optimal trajectories collected in previous tasks, providing additional reward information for the current task. Compared with MaxQInit, our method exhibits higher learning efficiency and superior performance in Lifelong RL experiments.},

To this end, we propose a neural network (NN) to predict walking motions—the most frequent human motion in HRI. In a previous study, an NN was set up for predicting the walking position 0.5 s ahead by using skeletal coordinates with a low root mean square error. However, the prediction accuracy was found to be lower when predicting the four limbs, possibly because their motions had strong position uncertainty during walking. In the present study, a particle filter (PF) was used to predict a possible range, rather than the specific coordinates, of foot positions. The PF was used in three steps: initialization, sampling importance resampling, and moving the particle to predict. Once the initial distribution was set up, only the last two steps needed to be repeated frame-by-frame. The probability state distribution results of the feet were verified using three measures, and the reliability of these results was verified.},

In existing research, the robot powered by DRL adopts coupled observation of the environment and the human partner to learn both dynamics simultaneously. However, such a learning strategy is limited in terms of learning efficiency and team performance. This work proposes a novel task decomposition method with a hierarchical reward mechanism that enables the robot to learn the hierarchical dynamic control task separately from learning the human partner’s behavior. The method is validated with a hierarchical control task in a simulated environment with human subject experiments. Our method also provides insight into the design of the learning strategy for HRC. The results show that the robot should learn the task first to achieve higher team performance and learn the human first to achieve higher learning efficiency.},

In this paper, a novel active attention allocation strategy based on robot performance prediction is developed. Different from previous work, this strategy attempts to avoid potential issues before their occurrence instead of fixing them afterward. Based on a mathematical robot performance model, a robot’s performance level can be predicted with accumulated human attention given to that robot. The human attention can then be actively allocated to maximize team performance in the short future. Simulations using a domain search task are performed. The results demonstrate the validity of the attention-based robot performance model and the effectiveness of the active attention allocation strategy in improving team performance.},

To address such challenging issue, this study incorporates a generalized Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method into the mentioned learning algorithm, thereby achieving a new algorithm. Based on this algorithm, a new model is successfully constructed. Empirical studies on two industrial datasets indicate that this new model is superior to the state-of-the-art models in both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy for missing QoS data after performing presentation learning on dynamic QoS data.

It is also vital to reduce energy cost and harmful gas emission. However, it is highly challenging to achieve it due to unstable characteristics of renewable energy. Traditional prediction methods are mainly time series forecasting ones, and their prediction accuracy is unsatisfactory since they ignore spatial dependence in wind speed data. This work proposes a spatio-temporal prediction method to predict the wind speed data. It adopts a Savitzky-Golay filter to smooth the wind speed data to reduce the noise interference. It learns the spatial dependence through a graph convolutional network, and adopts a gated recurrent unit to extract temporal dependence of the wind speed data. In this way, this method effectively removes the noise and obtains temporal and spatial features of the wind speed data, thereby achieving better prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other baseline peers by using real-world datasets.},

However, traffic factors are rarely considered in their works, in which the traveling time between customer locations is assumed to be constant over the planning horizon. For many practical scenarios, the traffic conditions between customer locations may change over time due to the impact of traffic patterns. Thus, this paper considers a Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows (TDTSPTW), where the time dependency is obtained by fitting the collected traffic data into real-time traffic function with the interpolation method. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework to solve TDTSPTW. Extensive experiments on TDTSPTW instances indicate that the proposed method can capture the real-time traffic changes and yield high-quality solutions within a very short time, compared with other typical baseline algorithms.},

However, the proportion of the overlapping area of these images is usually relatively small, and there are few feature points in the overlap area of some images. Traditional image stitching algorithms are not effective in processing such images, and it is difficult to meet the requirements of real-time stitching. Therefore, we propose RTStitch, a method specially used for real-time stitching of high-resolution PCB images in AOI systems. We divide the images into two categories. An image with a large change in the pixel gray value of the first column in the overlapping area is the first type of image, otherwise, it is the second type of image. We use different methods to obtain a relatively accurate maximum overlap position for these two types of images. Besides, we propose a new method of selecting template images, then perform template matching to obtain horizontal and vertical errors. We focus on the areas where the gray level changes drastically in the overlapping area to improve the accuracy of the registration. Our experimental results show that for the first type of image, RTStitch improves the registration accuracy by more than 2\%, while for the second type of image, the registration accuracy is improved by more than 10\%. And more than doubled the stitching speed. Moreover, RTStitch can meet the high-precision and real-time requirements of the AOI system.},

  abstract  = {When making professional headshots, it has some standards, for example, illumination and color of face images should be adjusted well to show important features. In this paper, we propose a method to convert one image captured by smart phone into identification photo or professional headshot. It includes three stages. Firstly, face region is detected and the background is removed from image captured by some mobile device. The second stage is to enhance low illumination regions by estimating illumination map. Thirdly, skin regions are detected through the Cr channel in YCrCb color space. The skin regions with high illumination are adjusted to a specific domain, which aims to provide a comfortable visual perception. These strategies contribute to a pleasing adjustment. Experiments performed on random images indicate our method can obtain a good illumination and color adjustment for face images with a promising adaptability.},

  abstract  = {2D codes are widely used as a shortcut from analog media to online information, and it has been used for authentication of boarding passes of airplanes and trains. Especially in recent years, 2D codes have become popular as a means of cashless payment. However, they are subject to distortion when printed on non-rigid materials, such as papers and clothes. Although general 2D code decoders correct uniform distortion such as perspective distortion, it is difficult to correct non-uniform and irregular distortion of the 2D code itself. This paper proposes a method that can decode 2D codes if they are distorted irregularly and non-uniformly. The proposed method formulates a problem of recognizing the relative position of edges constituting 2D code modules as a combinatorial optimization problem, and locates all modules to reconstruct 2D codes by solving the problem. Experimental results showed that the proposed method decodes the irregularly distorted 2D codes without the help of auxiliary patterns embedded in 2D codes.},

Complex network is an important tool for modelling software systems from the macro perspective, and it expresses software as a complex network by analyzing the dependencies between software components. In this paper, we propose a new model called weighted class dependency network (WCDN) based on complex network theory to describe the characteristics of object-oriented software systems. WCDN model is based on class granularity, which considers not only the difference of multiple dependencies caused by object-oriented programming languages, but also the disparity of class importance. We apply WCDN to a refactoring algorithm based on three modular metrics, and evaluate the rationality and effectiveness of the network through disturbing-recovering experiments. After the comparative experiments of 12 open-source software systems, the results prove that WCDN can represent the architecture of the object-oriented software system correctly.},

  abstract  = {With the advancement in electrical, electronics and telecommunication technologies, the use of sensors in manufacturing facilities has enabled the industrial internet of things (IIoT). IIoT has the potential to optimize and save cost by understanding the data gathered by various sensors in these facilities. By embracing techniques, such as, machine learning and artificial intelligence, the data collated through these sensors can be utilized to improve the efficiency and optimize the use of resources and reduce the cost of manufacturing processes. To achieve these efficiencies and optimization, the manufacturing process needs to be first modeled using machine-learning techniques and then by using evolutionary computation algorithms, the optimal input process parameters can be determined. In this paper, we have comprehensively analyzed the manufacturing process of austempered ductile iron (ADI) to obtain desired property (e.g., Vickers hardness number, VHN). This is achieved by modeling the ADI process using a genetic algorithm (GA) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based inverse model to predict the optimal ADI process parameters, i.e., the austempering heat treatment temperature and time, and the alloying element proportions. With extensive simulation results, we have shown that the MLP model can predict VHN of ADI with a mean square error of 0.61. Using the optimal alloying element proportions predicted by the proposed GA-MLP-based inverse model, US$50-$90 can be saved for every tonne of ADI produced (i.e., 15-25\%). Use of this model will help to realize the potential of IIoT by reducing wastage of alloying elements and to achieve reduction in manufacturing cost of ADI with specific desired property.},

  abstract  = {The main disadvantage of vision-based control systems is the inherent time delay due to the processing of the image information, which leads to significant performance losses of the control system. We present a cascaded Kalman Filter structure to compensate for the time delay introduced by the 6d pose estimation in vision based control systems. In addition to delay compensation the structure allows all sensor data to be used asynchronously for state correction. The first Kalman Filter runs in the past and compensates for the time delay of the pose estimation. The second Kalman Filter is used exclusively for sensor data fusion. A special structure within the filter allows all sensor data to be used for state correction regardless of their sampling rate. The sampling rate, at which the second Kalman filter provides the state vector for a controller, can be set independently of all other variables.The entire structure has been tested by simulation and in experiments on a three degree of freedom robot. By applying the cascaded Kalman Filter structure, the position as well as angular errors in orientation can be reduced by more than 50\%.},

  abstract  = {A two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) flexure-based nanopositioner is investigated for the planar scanning tasks, and a robust controller design scheme based on the convex inner approximation method is proposed. In practice, a flexure-based mechanism is usually represented by a second-order dynamic model. However, the second-order dynamic model cannot precisely fit the real system dynamics, and the model mismatch renders it difficult to achieve satisfying system performance in applications. Such a mismatch includes the parameter uncertainties caused by inaccurate model identification, different motion conditions, as well as high-order resonances. Note that if the controller is not well designed, the high-order resonances can be frequently activated, especially when the system input variation is significant. Therefore, to deal with the above impediments, a novel scheme for the robust controller design is proposed, with the variation of system input considered. In the proposed scheme, a subset of gains that can stabilize the closed-loop system is characterized elegantly via an inner approximation method considering the model uncertainties, and the formulated optimization problem regarding the determination of the controller parameters can be efficiently solved. Furthermore, the proposed scheme guarantees the performance regarding the H 2 -norm level and limits the H ∞ -norm level in a designated range. Finally, numerical optimization and comparative experiments are carried out, and the results evidently show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Furthermore, this paper highlights the potential of the information flow analysis to identify the relevant system elements across the entire value chain of an organization system in order to meet requirements. Moreover, the flexible implementation of requirements today demands agility. For this purpose, it is shown how the information flow analysis helps to design an organization system in a modular way to enable flexible adaptations.

A number of large-scale EMO algorithms based on different strategies (e.g., divide-and-conquer, coevolution, and dimensionality reduction) have been proposed over the last decade. The performance of the large-scale EMO algorithms was empirically evaluated using several benchmark test suites, including the ZDT, DTLZ, WFG, MaF, UF and LSMOP test suites. Even though these test suites are theoretically scalable to any number of decision variables, they are not necessarily appropriate for examining the performance of large-scale EMO algorithms. In fact, among these benchmark test suites, only the LSMOP test suite is specifically designed to test the performance of large-scale EMO algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new scalable multi- and many-objective test problem for examining large-scale EMO algorithms. The proposed test problem has the following features: 1) the number of objectives and decision variables can be arbitrarily specified; 2) the interaction strength among the objectives can be adjusted by a correlation parameter. The performance of six EMO algorithms is examined on the new test problem. Our experimental results show that the proposed new test problem poses difficulties to some state-of-the-art large-scale EMO algorithms.},

Three popular DR techniques, which are the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), are selected for comparison and discussion. The experimental results showed that considering only correlation during DR is not effective enough to provide a suitable reduced set of problem dimensions, and that GP with DR may perform worse than its counterpart without DR. Meanwhile, we propose a novel two-phase DR method, considering both correlation and redundancy. The proposed method can give a more reasonable set of reduced dimensions, which can effectively improve the performance of GP on HDSR problems.},

In this paper, we first review some classic clustering algorithms. We also point out that another popular subset selection method, i.e., inverted generational distance (IGD)-based subset selection, can be viewed as clustering. Then, we perform a comprehensive experimental study to evaluate the performance of various clustering algorithms in different scenarios. Experimental results are analyzed in detail, and some suggestions about the use of clustering algorithms for subset selection are derived. Additionally, we demonstrate that decision maker’s preference can be introduced to clustering-based subset selection.},

  abstract  = {The inverse modeling multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (IM-MOEA) is a method to solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOP) that samples candidate solutions straight from the objective space, making it easier to control the diversity of the solutions. In the literature, the objective space is partitioned into several subregions by predefining a set of reference vectors, and the selection criterion adopted is based on dominance. These features can cause difficulties to deal with large-scale MOPs (LSMOPs) and with many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). To address such an issue, this paper proposes the IM-MOEA based on decomposition (IM-MOEA/D) which uses a new scheme for grouping in the objective space based on k-means and a selection criterion based on decomposition, global replacement, that chooses the most appropriate reference vector from the whole population. The experimental results on 45 LSMOPs for 2 to 6 objectives suggest that IM-MOEA/D reached better performance than the compared state-of-the-art MOEAs.},

Second, we employ a modified metaheuristic algorithm, the global best-guide quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm with quantum not gate (GNQTS), to efficiently search for the optimized parameters for RSI. Third, our approach also applies a sliding window to flexibly adjust training periods and avoid over fitting at the same time.

The omnidirectional ring laser can enable dense 3D measurement of cross-sections of the environment via the structured light method. Structure from Motion (SfM) is used to measure the motion of the camera to integrate the laser cross sections to obtain a dense 3D model.However, the result of SfM does not contain real-world scale information. The novelty of this research lies in a new method to obtain the real-world scale. The real-world scale is determined by comparing a mesh generated from the resultant SfM point cloud and the integrated laser sections in terms of each scale.In a simulated environment, the proposed method was found to be accurate up to 1 mm. It was also able to accurately measure the 3D shape of a real environment.},

Sensors in-stalled on the robot enable proprioception and could help the robot understand its error configuration. This paper proposes a method to determine from these sensor measurements, which are most critical in differentiating the error states such that the robot could understand its predicament, and could attempt at recovering without human aid. A classification model is built using the forward stepwise method and a scoring metric to overcome indecision in choosing between different features. This modified method is applied to three robot operating mode data sets. The experiments indicate an improvement to the classifier performance when using this the model built by the method compared to using all available predictor variables (features). With further refinement, this scoring metric could be a simple yet effective way to build classification models for increasing robot autonomy.},

  abstract  = {Rollover is a potential dangerous factor for mobile robots to accomplish a task. However, to our best knowledge, there still lacks a systematic research on the rollover mechanism and active rollover prevention control of mobile robots in the literature. This paper aims to propose a general control framework for rollover prevention of high-speed wheeled mobile robots. First, the lateral dynamics of the robot is modelled and the Load Transfer Ratio (LTR) is used as an index to measure the rollover level. Second, an optimal algorithm-based reference governor (RG) is developed, by which the wheel speed command that satisfies the constraint is induced, retaining the actual LTR within the threshold safety value. In addition, an integral sliding mode (ISM) wheel speed tracking controller is proposed. Lastly, simulations results show that for both trajectory tracking and path following cases, the controlled robot avoids possible rollover successfully.},

Wireless power transfer systems have the problem that the power transmission efficiency and the transmitted power change depending on the changes in the position and distance of the transmission and receiving coils and the size of the load resistance. In this paper, the efficiency is controlled by controlling the DC-DC converter at the power receiving side, and the output voltage is controlled at the power transmitting side using the operator theory.

  abstract  = {An interface for a powered upper limb prosthesis is designed to achieve the target poses intended by the human user as interpreted from input features measured from a variety of sensors typically worn on the residual limb. Selection of which input features to use in the interface is usually done based on which features provide the best likelihood to identify the intended target poses. This work investigates the outcomes of the prosthetic interfaces constructed with input features selected based on the performance of all subjects (population-averaged) vs. the performance of individual subjects (personalised). Specifically, two outcomes are evaluated. First, the diversity in the resulting input feature sets across different subjects is evaluated. Second, the accuracy in identifying the intended target pose using the input features selected through personalised and population-averaged data are analysed and compared. The experiment was conducted with 10 able-bodied subjects in a virtual reality (VR) platform. The corresponding kinematic information of their arm movements and muscle activities were recorded and utilised to construct the input features in the scenario of transhumeral prostheses. The outcomes show a significant variation in the resulting input feature sets from subject to subject. The accuracy of the personalised feature sets is found to be higher in classifying the intended target poses. For the case of selecting 2 out of the 41 input features constructed from the recorded sensor data, none of the 10 subjects shares any common set of input features and the accuracy is improved by 10.4±6.8\% with the personalised selection. The outcomes demonstrate the extent of person-to-person variation that needs to be taken into account when designing prosthetic interfaces and the quantified potential gain (albeit in a specific application) from personalising interfaces.},

Herein a working prototype of a BCI-based wheelchair is detailed that can navigate inside a typical home environment with minimum structural modification and without any visual obstruction and discomfort to the user. The prototype is based on a combined mechanism of steady-state visually evoked potential and eye blinks. To elicit SSVEP, LEDs flickering at 13Hz and 15Hz were used to select the left and right direction, respectively, and EEG data was recorded. In addition, the occurrence of three continuous blinks was used as an indicator for stopping an ongoing action. The wavelet packet denoising method was applied, followed by feature extraction methods such as Wavelet Packet Decomposition and Canonical Correlation Analysis over narrowband reconstructed EEG signals. Bayesian optimization was used to obtain 5-fold cross-validations to optimize the hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine. The resulting new model was tested and the average cross-validation accuracy 89.65\% ± 6.6\% (SD) and testing accuracy 83.53\% ± 8.59\% (SD) were obtained. The wheelchair was controlled by RaspberryPi through WiFi. The developed prototype demonstrated an average of 86.97\% success rate for all trials with 4.015s for each command execution. The prototype can be used efficiently in a home environment without causing any discomfort to the user.},

  abstract  = {Intelligent electric wheelchairs have been developed for personal mobility, and eye-gaze measurement is essential for comprehending the user&#39;s attention and for assisting operations. In previous studies, the gaze vector (i.e., the visual or optical axis of the eye) was projected onto the environmental map; hence, an eye tracker was installed on the wheelchair. In addition, hardware calibration, which determines the geometric relationship between the eye tracker and other sensors, such as LiDAR, was performed beforehand. Recently, wearable eye-trackers are expected to employ a daily-use device; therefore, the cooperation between sensors is essential without geometric constraints. Accordingly, we propose a method for estimating focused pedestrians using smooth-pursuit eye movements in the real world. Pedestrians are tracked using a point cloud obtained with 3D LiDAR, and the trajectories of the focused pedestrian are recorded on an environmental map constructed with simultaneous localization and mapping. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the computational methods for the correlation between eye movements and moving objects, and we confirmed the feasibility and the current issues through these experiments.},

A shared-control wheelchair may perform actions that do not reflect its user&#39;s intent in order to protect their safety, causing frustration or distrust in the process. Unlike physical accidents there is currently no frame-work for investigating or adjudicating these events, leading to a reduced capability to improve the shared control algorithm&#39;s user experience. In this paper we suggest a system based on the idea of an ‘ethical black box&#39; that records the sensor context of sub-critical disagreements and collision risks in order to allow human investigators to examine them in retrospect and assess whether the algorithm has taken control from the user without justification.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a blockchain-enabled secure sensing data processing and logging system. Although in our implementation we use the IOTA distributed ledger, the main mechanisms introduced in the system are independent from any particular blockchain platform for maximum flexibility. A blockchain platform is used as an immutable datastore to store critical data for secure sensing data processing and logging. This system corporates several innovative mechanisms. First, a sensor identification mechanism is put in place to ensure that only sensing data submitted by eligible sensors are accepted. Second, only aggregated sensing data are transmitted to the blockchain for safe-keeping. This strategy has two benefits: (1) it reduces the throughput requirement on the public blockchain; and (2) it saves on the transaction fees for asking the blockchain to store the data. Furthermore, a mechanism is introduced to allow two-level logging using a local datastore in conjunction with the blockchain to extend the immutability property offered by the blockchain to the locally stored raw sensing data. Third, a set of mechanisms are designed to facilitate the query of the blockchain for a particular subset of the aggregated data, and to ensure that given an aggregated data item, the corresponding raw data can be quickly located, which is essential for data retrieval needed when situations arise such as forensic analysis in cases of incidents and for auditing purposes. The system is implemented in the Python programming language and a preliminary testing on the functionality of the system has been conducted.},

However, herding behaviors cause complex crowd behaviors among the evacuees, making the sign arrangements difficult to see. In this study, we analyze the visual evacuation signage assignment problem, seeking to maximize the number of evacuees who select the correct exit by assigning a sign in an environment with two exits—one correct and the other incorrect. For this problem, placing the signage in front of the incorrect exit is the optimum solution; however, this increases evacuation times, when minimizing them is crucial. Treating this problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which we seek to maximize the number of agents selecting the correct exit and minimize the evacuation time, enabled us to apply the mean-risk model to the problem; here, the expected objective values are maximized and the uncertainty risks are minimized. In multi-agent simulations, we placed a visual sign at each candidate position and analyzed the results. For both objective functions, we generated the Pareto-optimum solutions of the expected values and risk measures and investigated the relationship between them. Some solutions proved to be the Pareto-optimums for both the expected values and risk measures; these show several desirable properties for solving the visual evacuation signage assignment problem.},

In this paper, considering the effects of the one-sided versus two-sided presentation of a controversial issue, we improve the classic HK model and propose a novel information-type education-based Hegselmann–Krause model. In our work, we formulate rules of how agents’ opinions change and carry out simulation experiments on networks with different proportions of high-educated agents. Extensive experiments on artificially generated networks show that it is more difficult for someone to reach a consensus with another one who is within a group with a higher proportion of low-educated people than with a higher proportion of high-educated people, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

The variety of platforms used for implementing cyber-physical systems and the dynamic interconnection of their components make the resilience issue of these systems very important. Our work aims to use the knowledge from human and social sciences, particularly to inspire from the emotional processes for creating an agent architecture that increases the cyber-physical systems resilience. Emotional inspiration occurs in the individual decision-making processes as well as in the social coordination mechanisms. In addition, one of the principal hypotheses in our research is that the multi-agent paradigm is suitable for integrating emotional processes into cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract  = {While Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) shows remarkable performance in many high dimensional imitation learning tasks, it requires too many sampled transitions, which are infeasible for some real world problems. In this paper, we demonstrate how exploiting the reward function in GAIL can improve sample efficiency. We design our algorithm end-to-end differentiable so that the learned reward function can directly participate in policy updates. End-to-end differentiability can be achieved by introducing a forward model of the environment, enabling direct calculation of the cumulative reward function. However, using a forward model has two significant limitations that it heavily relies on the performance of the forward model and requires multi-step prediction, which causes severe error accumulation. The proposed end-to-end differentiable adversarial imitation learning algorithm alleviates these limitations. Also, we suggest applying several existing regularization techniques for robust training of a forward model. We call our algorithm, integrated with these regularization methods, fully Differentiable Regularized GAIL (DRGAIL), and test DRGAIL on continuous control tasks.},

A complete PPI network is crucial for detection performance. However, experimentally identified PPIs are usually very limited, resulting in incomplete PPI networks. To solve this problem, we propose a deep transfer learning based predictor for the PPI prediction, consisting of a semi-supervised SVM classifier and a deep feature extractor of convolution neural network (CNN). Considering the fact that the similarities of gene ontology (GO) annotations contribute to protein interaction, and the difference of subcellular localizations contribute to negative interactions, we pre-train the deep CNN feature extractor in deep GO annotation and subcellular localization predictors and then transfer it to the PPI prediction. In this way, we have a deep PPI detector enhanced with transfer learning of GO annotation and subcellular localization prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.},

This technology utilises pattern recognition and can contribute to the development of human-in-the-loop control of different systems such as orthoses and exoskeletons. The majority of reported studies use a small dataset collected from an experiment for a specific purpose. The downsides of this approach include: 1) it is hard to generalise the outcome to different people with different biomechanical characteristics and health conditions, and 2) it cannot be implemented in applications other than the original experiment. To address these deficiencies, the current study investigates using a publicly available dataset collected for pathology diagnosis purposes to train Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. A dataset containing knee motion of participants performing different exercises has been used to classify human activity. The algorithms used in this study are Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors Vote, Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosting. Furthermore, two training approaches are compared to raw data (de-noised) and manually extracted features. The results show up to 0.94 performance of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric for 11-fold cross-validation for Gradient Boosting algorithm using raw data.

  abstract  = {In an aging society, it is increasingly important to solve problems related to human gait. One of these issues is the relationship between gait and muscle tone. In this study, we propose a neuromusculoskeletal model that can be used to represent and evaluate the movement changes generated by changes in muscle tone in human gait using computational simulations. The model is based using a musculoskeletal model with 70 muscles and a neurological controller model that can represent muscle tone. As a hypothesis to judge the validity of the model, a high muscle tone makes it difficult to maintain gait and makes the stride length narrow. A total of 1470 parameters were optimized for 3 days for each trial with varying muscle tone. As a result under the condition of high muscle tone, the gait maintenance time became shorter, and the stride length became narrow compared with the experimental value. Therefore, the hypothesis used to judge the validity of the model that gait maintenance becomes difficult and stride length becomes narrow under high muscle tone was proved. In addition, the tendency for changes in the angle of the knee joint, the distance traveled by the center of the foot pressure, the number of times the foot touched the ground, the distance the foot swung forward, the regularity and periodicity of each gait, and the bimodality of foot pressure were evaluated and confirmed to be natural. From these results, we conclude that the neuromusculoskeletal model for gait proposed in this study was proper.},

Early risk detection is essential for reducing lifting injuries but requires trained observers to perform assessments manually. Machine learning and computer vision techniques have been proposed to aid ergonomists in lifting risk assessments. However, these methods may not bring the practitioners into the decision-making process and frequently not interpretable to practitioners. We conducted a user study with a proposed risk assessment system that consists of a prediction module, explanation module, and prototype user interface. The prediction module consists of a logistics regression model capable of distinguishing the injury risk levels induced by different levels of force exertion in common lifting tasks. The logistics regression model makes predictions based on explainable body motion, posture, and facial features extracted through computer vision techniques. The explanation module makes up of explainable AI techniques. Specifically, a surrogate model provides local explanations for presenting how the system makes each prediction to users. The prototype interface presents the system’s predictions and explanations. A usability study shows that the proposed system increases crowd-workers’ and domain scholars’ performance in assessing workers’ injury risks in lifting. Furthermore, the usability study also shows that the proposed system increases their confidence in the assessment tasks when the system’s evaluations agree with their subjective evaluations.},

In this paper, we present a novel Box Regression-Guided Anchor-free for Robust Visual Tracking. Firstly, a scale-aware regression module is designed to satisfy the feature requirements of the regression branch, which can capture feature information of various scales. Secondly, regression-guided classification module is applied to aligning the feature between the regression result and correlation feature, thereby avoiding the introduction of background information to classification branch. In addition, the new correlation operation is introduced to gain more superb correlation feature.

  abstract  = {With more Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) models applied to recommendation tasks, graph data of tremendous scalability becomes much harder to train for existing models. Many existing works of adapting GCN models to recommendation tasks often try to improve accuracy by aggregating messages from all high-order neighboring nodes, which can result in insufficient computational efficiency. To tackle with data with large scalability, we propose a novel recommendation algorithm—Rec-clusterGCN, which utilizes the cluster structure of graphs, and is suitable for SGD-based training. It goes as follows: at every step, a dense subgraph of user-item interaction will be constructed, and each node will only aggregate messages from neighboring nodes within the subgraph. Next, our model accepts the LightGCN model structure. It can reduce a huge amount of computational time cost and make training of larger graph possible without sacrificing too much accuracy. In addition, by using our node enhancement technique, the performance of Rec-clusterGCN is further improved. The experimental results also indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms most baseline algorithms. Significant improvement has been made in computational efficiency (on average about 30.0\% relative improvement for different layers in the Gowalla dataset).},

Current methods on such tasks usually judge options independently and ignore their relations. Thus, this work designs a four-way bidirectional attention strategy to formulate the interactions among the passage, questions and candidate options. In particular, the relations among options are well represented. This enables the model to leverage the option correlation information for inferring the final answer accurately. The experimental evaluations on the CosmosQA dataset demonstrate the competitive performance of our model, and confirm the effectiveness of the option comparison strategy.},

  abstract  = {Detection of illegal and threatening items in bag-gage is one of the utmost security concern nowadays. Even for experienced security personnel, manual detection is a time-consuming and stressful task.Many academics have created automated frameworks for detecting suspicious and contraband data from X-ray scans of luggage. However, to our knowledge, no framework exists that utilizes temporal baggage X-ray imagery to effectively screen highly concealed and occluded objects which are barely visible even to the naked eye. To address this, we present a novel temporal fusion driven multi-scale residual fashioned encoder-decoder that takes series of consecutive scans as input and fuses them to generate distinct feature representations of the suspicious and non-suspicious baggage content, leading towards a more accurate extraction of the contraband data. The proposed methodology has been thoroughly tested using the publicly accessible GDXray dataset, which is the only dataset containing temporally linked grayscale X-ray scans showcasing extremely concealed contraband data. The proposed framework outperforms its competitors on the GDXray dataset on various metrics.},

Therefore, to run in real-time, this paper proposes a simple and practical feature refinement module, named Temporally-aware Convolutional Block Attention Module (TCBAM), based on a novel self-attention recurrent neural network. The model exploits still-image-based feature maps to refine temporal constant feature maps for better capturing widely varied appearances of video text. For better generalization, we also provide the flow-based data augmentation method with artificial data. Explements on the scene text video datasets including ICDAR2013 Video, Minetto, and RoadText-1K demonstrate that the proposed methods perform the competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art models within real-time running.

  abstract  = {Learning of the convolutional neural network (CNN) from noisy labeled samples is a crucial problem, and many studies have been conducted. Although the state-of-the-art method called Joint training with Co-Regularization (JoCoR) has achieved high performance, it is a still challenging problem to accurately classify samples with asymmetric noise, i.e., wrong labels between similar classes (e.g., CAT ↔ DOG). In this paper, we newly found that there is a difference between the prediction norm for clean labeled samples and that for noisy labeled samples. In addition, we found that there is a positive correlation between the prediction norm difference and the classification accuracy for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Therefore, we hypothesize that the discriminative power would be improved if we increase the prediction norm difference. Based on this hypothesis, a novel method for learning CNN from noisy labeled samples is proposed. Specifically, we take JoCoR as the base architecture and weight the loss function of JoCoR to make the prediction norm difference large. Experimental results for the CIFAR-10 dataset suggest that our hypothesis is correct. The classification accuracy by the proposed method is higher than some state-of-the-art methods including JoCoR for samples with asymmetric noise as well as those with symmetric noise (i.e., wrong labels between other classes).},

The dynamic berth allocation problem asks to determine the allocation and berthing time of each vessel to the berth that minimizes the total service time given a set of vessels and a set of berths. The branch and bound algorithms have been used to solve the problem as an exact solution algorithm. However, it becomes intractable to solve the problem by the conventional branch and bound algorithms when the number of ships and berths is increased. In this paper, we propose a new branch-and-bound algorithm called Neural Network Assisted Branch-and-Bound (NN-B&amp;B) to determine the search priority of each node to reduce the total computation time of the branch-and-bound method. By determining the search priority of the node from the result of the neural network, the optimal solution is quickly searched for the learned problem.

In this paper, the energy-aware machining parameter optimization problem is described and formulated. Based on the description and formula, an approach which considers multiple machining parameters including spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and width of cut simultaneously is developed. This approach consists of two key steps: modelling the energy consumed in the machining process and searching for the optimal machining parameters. In the modelling step, a hybrid modelling method which integrates regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) is developed to characterize the relationship between energy consumption and the machining parameters and obtain the energy consumption prediction model. In the searching step, an improved flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is presented to achieve the further searching for the optimal machining parameters with energy consideration. The approach has been tested and validated on multiple groups of experimental data. The results demonstrate that the approach can lead to a more accurate energy consumption prediction and an optimal solution for machining parameters.},

A big advantage is that this kind of energy can be generated not only on a large scale, such as by wind turbines or hydroelectric power plants, but also by individual households through (among others) so-called Photovoltaic-Battery (PVB) systems which are based on solar energy. Compared with energy from the power grid, such systems naturally involve higher acquisition costs, which can, however, potentially be amortized. This raises the question of how large such systems should be designed, what the optimal strategy of usage is, and how relevant typical sizes of the individual elements available on the market are to the design strategy. Against this background, we investigate the problems addressed, taking into account different pricing strategies, and show, based on a simulation study, that PVB systems can bring major benefits in the long term. Additionally, our results indicate, that – to a certain extent – efficient energy management is able to compensate for limitations in sizing.},

For this purpose, a transdisciplinary perspective from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Climate science, Socio-economics discipline is leveraged to map and identify their inter-relationships and challenges using Soft System Methodology (SSM). A transdisciplinary framework, named ADRELO1 Disaster Support System (ADSS), is therefore proposed to (1) identify the key parameters that can influence climate change, (2) stitch together a reusable multilayered transdisciplinary knowledge model, and (3) apply the observed multivariant data to AI-based algorithm to forecast climate change, analyze the impact of climate change on socio-economic outcomes and suggest potential disaster risk reduction actions. Research-based outcomes, from the given framework, will be used for policy prescription towards making flood-affected local communities self-resilient. ADSS will be applied first in a flood-prone region, such as Nyando in Kenya and Mozambique. It will then be extrapolated in other coastal regions of Florida and North-eastern Brazil to examine the applicability of the framework.},

The greedy HSS (GHSS) is the most efficient way for solving the HSS problem. When we use GHSS, we implicitly assume that well-distributed solutions over the entire Pareto front will be selected. However, the distribution of selected solutions by GHSS has not been studied. In this paper, we investigate this issue by examining selected solution subsets for different reference point specifications in GHSS. First, we show that a sufficiently large reference point is a good choice for GHSS to select a well-distributed subset on a triangular Pareto front. However, it is not easy to properly specify a reference point for an inverted triangular Pareto front. Then, we propose a dynamic reference point specification method for GHSS to select a well-distributed subset for various types of Pareto fronts. Static and dynamic reference point specifications are compared through computational experiments using 3- and 5-objective candidate solution sets from various types of Pareto front shapes. The experimental results demonstrate the effect of different reference point specifications on the subsets selected by GHSS and the usefulness of the dynamic reference point specification for GHSS.},

To solve MMOPs, an optimizer is required to locate multiple sets of Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space. In this paper, a novel decomposition-based hybrid evolutionary algorithm is proposed for handling MMOPs efficiently. In the proposed algorithm, each reference vector is associated with a sub-population. In this manner, each reference vector is able to preserve multiple optima of the corresponding sub-problem in its own sub-population. In each generation, the following three procedures are used to update each sub-population. First, the sub-population evolves independently based on the deterministic crowding mechanism to maintain the diversity in the decision space. Second, the sub-population evolves in a collaborative manner with neighboring sub-populations. Subsequently, solutions that are converging to the same optimal solution are identified. All identified solutions except for the best one are re-initialized. This mechanism impels the solutions in each sub-population to converge to different optima in the decision space. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in comparison with four state-of-the-art algorithms on various test problems.},

To alleviate this dilemma, this paper devises two simple yet effective adaptive adjustment strategies for the two parameters, leading to an adaptive LLSO(ALLSO). Specifically, this paper first defines a novel aggregation indicator based on the difference between the global best fitness and the averaged fitness of the swarm, to roughly evaluate the evolution state of the swarm. Then, based on this indicator, two adaptive adjustment strategies are devised to dynamically determine the values of the two parameters during the evolution. With these two strategies, the swarm is expected to maintain a potentially good balance between intensification and diversification. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used large- scale benchmark sets demonstrate that the two adaptive strategies effectively improve the performance of LLSO.},

Based on the UMSs with fuzzy information, an adaptive robust control method is then designed, and an analytical solution of the control input is determined, even if the servo constraints are non-holonomic. Furthermore, a concomitant parameter in the designed controller is analyzed, and a feasible controller admitting the optimal performance can be determined by minimizing a predefined performance index, such that the deterministic system performance can be ensured to be at a satisfying level. As supported by rigorous proofs, the existence and the uniqueness of the global solution to the optimization problem are presented. Finally, a numerical experiment is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design methodology.},

  abstract  = {Many robotic applications that are critical for robot performance require immediate feedback, hence execution time is a critical concern. Furthermore, it is common that robots come with a fixed quantity of hardware resources; if an application requires more computational resources than the robot can accommodate, its onboard execution might be extended to a degree that degrades the robot’s performance. Cloud computing, on the other hand, features on-demand computational resources; by enabling robots to leverage those resources, application execution time can be reduced. The key to enabling robot use of cloud computing is designing an efficient offloading algorithm that makes optimum use of the robot’s onboard capabilities and also forms a quick consensus on when to offload without any prior knowledge or information about the application. In this paper, we propose a predictive algorithm to anticipate the time needed to execute an application for a given application data input size with the help of a small number of previous observations. To validate the algorithm, we train it on the previous N observations, which include independent (input data size) and dependent (execution time) variables. To understand how algorithm performance varies in terms of prediction accuracy and error, we tested various N values using linear regression and a mobile robot path planning application. From our experiments and analysis, we determined the algorithm to have acceptable error and prediction accuracy when N&gt;40.},

In this context, recognition of the operator’s intended navigational goal, could enable an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to assist the operator in an advanced human-robot interaction framework. We propose a Bayesian Operator Intent Recognition (BOIR) probabilistic method that utilizes: (i) an observation model that fuses information as a weighting combination of multiple observation sources providing geometric information; (ii) a transition model that indicates the evolution of the state; and (iii) an action model, the Active Intent Recognition Model (AIRM), that enables the operator to communicate their explicit intent asynchronously. The proposed method is evaluated in an experiment where operators controlling a remote mobile robot are tasked with navigation and exploration under various scenarios with different map and obstacle layouts. Results demonstrate that BOIR outperforms two related methods from literature in terms of accuracy and uncertainty of the intent recognition.},

In industrial settings, these approaches are not commonly deployed since several factors negatively impact their productive use. The most common reasons are safety concerns on various levels. First, industrial robots are only allowed to be operated in direct contact if the operator has sufficient experience. Secondly, many PbD systems do not incorporate force measurements in their model directly. This renders them ineffective for assembly tasks, such as snap- fit connections. In this paper we (a) present an approach to incorporate force measurements into a generative model (b) using only external sensors without relying on measurements from the robot during demonstrating to decouple the teaching process from the robot and (c) show the benefit of explicit force measurement and modeling on a Franka Emika Panda robot by the example of assembling terminal clamps on a DIN rail.},

  abstract  = {Symmetry in running was observed by Marc Raibert and was applied to simplify the control of dynamic legged systems. In this paper, we show that symmetry also exists in biped walking and investigate it using two simplified 2D models, that are, the inverted pendulum (IP) model and the linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model, both leading to similar conclusions. To characterize the symmetry in biped walking, the concept of acceleration factor is proposed. Symmetry occurs when the acceleration factor is zero, which results in an unchanged mid-stance velocity. And an important property of symmetry is that the n-step reachable region and the n-step controllable region are exactly the same. This means that if we can achieve speed B from A in n steps, then we can also achieve speed A from B in n steps. Symmetry in walking helps us to better understand human walking and also provides an intuitive way to control robotic walking. As an example, we propose a feedforward controller and a feedback controller, respectively, which can regulate the walking speed very effectively. This work provides us some new insights to view biped walking.},

  abstract  = {Data anonymization methods have been investigated as strategies to provide data privacy and to minimize prejudices against minorities. Recent works on machine learning have shown impressive results in generating new examples of images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Creating synthetic facial images that resembles a group, but no one in particular seem an interesting strategy to anonymize a face. Nevertheless, the image synthesis process is computationally expensive and requires a very large training dataset to produce a human-acceptable outcome. This paper presents an investigation on the trade-off between the required number of instances (size) and the images’ inter-variability of a training set for using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate human-acceptable synthetic images. We report an experiment using the Appen crowdsourcing platform to evaluate the human acceptance of the synthetic images generated by our DCGAN trained using different samples of the CelebA public dataset, taken according to facial attributes, such as cheekbones protuberance, face shape and eyebrow thickness. The results indicate that (1) Facial attributes have a significant effect on diminishing the images’ inter-variability, specially face shape; (2) smaller images’ inter-variability leads to smaller required training dataset and (3) filtering the DCGAN’s training datasets using oval face shape led to a required dataset almost 50\% lesser than without filtering for generating images humanly acceptable. We believe this result may help individuals to anonymize their visual data maintaining certain characteristics but keeping their privacy at a lower computational cost.},

  abstract  = {Accelerated by the pandemic and the resulting increased adoption of online classes by universities, E-learning and the challenge to increase its efficiency in terms of conveying content effectively to the individual learner has gained interest and importance. To achieve this customization, personalization of the learning path and the learning objects based on the characteristics of the learner could form an important component that is currently largely absent from the most used e-learning modalities. This paper introduces an approach to personalization of the learning path that attempts to optimize the learner’s performance using Reinforcement Learning based on implicit feedback while minimizing the need for actual interaction with the learning system during training. The proposed system adopts the concepts of the Felder and Silverman Learning Style Model and Differentiated Pedagogy and builds an architecture using two interacting machine learning components, one using Reinforcement Learning to optimize the learning path and learning objects, and one using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to rapidly adapt a model of the learner’s characteristics. The model strives to minimize student interactions to learn about the learner’s performance characteristics and to generate personalized learning paths, thus reducing negative experiences during training. For this, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks is used that can rapidly adapt to provide realistic simulations of the student’s performance to use in the training of the e-learning strategy and thus to help reduce the need for actual learner feedback. In a set of base experiments with synthetic data, the model is shown to be effective at learning personalization for different learner types and efficient compared to models without Generative Adversarial Networks.},

To solve the first problem, it is proposed to leverage the expressiveness of ontologies and the technology of ontology-based smart spaces. To address the second one, a concept of assisted self-organization is proposed, including a method to assist in team-formation and a method to detect and resolve non-productive situations in the collective work.},

  abstract  = {Personality Computing is a field related to artificial intelligence that can recognize personality automatically from texts (TB-APR). To accomplish this task, personality inventories are used to build a corpus for supervised machine learning. Although personality inventories are easy options for responding to and rating personality, they lack efficient mechanisms to control omissions (proposital or non-conscient) and adulterations of personality characteristics. In our literature review, we found that state-of-art models have low to moderate correlations between texts and personality scales; we think the flaws of personality inventories can explain that. The present study provides a new TB-APR approach, using a projective technique to build corpus, for avoiding personality inventories’ biases. For this task, we chose the Thematic Apperception Test, rated by the Revised Morvalian System (RMS), producing an appropriate quantity of texts during the application time. The RMS, which is a revision of a qualitative system developed in the 1980’s, provides not yet explored personality dimensions for artificial intelligence and TB-APR models. The proposed model used the TF-IDF technique with some state-of-art classification algorithms. The results are promising, with an AUC-ROC of average 0.853, suggesting strong correlations between the texts and the scales proposed by the RMS.},

Nevertheless, gaining access to the kidney remains a challenging component of the procedure with a steep learning curve. As a result, the procedure would benefit from robotic assistance to partially or fully automate this critical component of the intervention. A key component of automated kidney access, using a robotic manipulator, is to define and follow a tool path planning based on preoperative imaging and a target entry point.In this paper, the use of the multiobjective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to plan a B-spline curve that will be used as the tool trajectory during the procedure. Here, NSGA-II is used to determine the anchor point locations for a uniform 3rd order B-spline curve. The optimal path minimizes path length, tissue potential energy due to tissue compression, and path smoothness while maximizing the distance to obstacles. The multiobjective optimization is evaluated using simulations and physical trials. The results show that the planned trajectories show minimal tissue deformation, are relatively short and smooth and do not collide with the internal kidney structures.},

  abstract  = {Hydronephrosis is a common renal disease in children which can lead to a series of complications, and ultrasonography is a basic examination usually performed on suspected hydronephrosis patients. If we can use deep learning approaches to judge and grade the disease in the ultrasonic examination stage, we can save a lot of manpower, medical resources, money, and help the suffered patients. For the semantic segmentation of kidney ultrasound image, we designed an Attention-based Pyramid Scene Parsing Network (A-PSPNet), the core of which is the basic feature extraction network combining Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and pyramid analysis module. Experiments were carried out on a hydronephrosis dataset containing 1850 annotated ultrasound images, including the arrangement of attention units, statistical computing power, and comparison of the effectiveness between the benchmark and our proposed method. Our constructed model achieved better segmentation performance than benchmarks with only little extra overhead, which validated the lightweight and effectiveness of the model.},

  abstract  = {Identifying causes of unknown failures during the manufacturing process is quite difficult because of the uncertainty nature of the failures. As the manufacturing process becomes more complicated, failure-cause identification becomes more time consuming due to the increased number of causal candidates to be checked when addressing anomalies, and the complicatedly intertwined factors are difficult to discern. To solve these problems, various methods of anomaly detection and ranking have been developed using sensor data gathered during the manufacturing process. However, once an anomaly occurs at any point in the process, it propagates to other steps. Conventional anomaly detection methods are not sufficient against the complicated and unpredictable anomalies. In this study, we developed a novel anomaly ranking method based on a causal model. It employs a fusion model of human knowledge and sensor data to acquire a suitable causal model for accurate ranking. Experiments were conducted on a real packaging machine, the results of which showed a roughly 30\% reduction of the ranking average compared with that of the conventional methods.},

  abstract  = {Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) is used by forensic officers to analyse bloodstains left at crime scenes. As a consequence, it has a crucial role in the investigations of bloody crimes. Currently, BPA activities are performed manually by leading to a slow and potentially imprecise analysis of the crime scenes. In order to overcome these issues, recently, some software tools have been developed in order to support forensic investigators in performing BPA activities in a more objective and fast way. However, only few approaches in literature use artificial intelligence methodologies to achieve this goal. Starting from this consideration, this paper presents a new intelligent tool based, for the first time, on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) for supporting BPA activities. As shown in a case study, the proposed intelligent tool produces results that match with the ground truth.},

  abstract  = {Classification of time series measured by sensor devices has been attracting the attention of researchers and industrial practitioners of deep learning because of its practical applications, such as anomaly detection and state estimation. With the wide spread use of deep learning, several deep learning models have been developed for time series classification, and these models achieve satisfactory performance compared with conventional machine learning. Actual systems should utilize small models of deep learning that can be embedded in edge devices for practical use; therefore, model compression and acceleration for deep neural networks are currently important requirements. Knowledge distillation for deep neural networks is the primary approach for compressing models. However, it has a performance limitation in terms of model size and over-fitting when used for time series classification with the Multi-Channel MACD-Histogram-based LSTM-FCN (MC-MHLF) model. The MC-MHLF model is a high-accuracy deep learning model for classifying time series. To address the aforementioned problem, we propose a novel learning model for model compression using knowledge distillation. A comparison experiment using the UCR time series classification archive showed that our proposed learning model yields a higher accuracy for a smaller model than when only distillation is used.},
