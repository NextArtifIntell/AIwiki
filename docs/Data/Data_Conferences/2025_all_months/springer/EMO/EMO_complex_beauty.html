  abstract  = {Real-world optimization problems often involve multiple conflicting objective functions to be optimized simultaneously. The optima to such multiobjective optimization problems are trade-off solutions constituting a so-called Pareto front. Practically, a few representative solutions are of interest for decision-making in lieu of the entire Pareto front as the latter is computationally and cognitively demanding to generate and analyze, respectively. However, finding a set of a few uniformly distributed solutions on the Pareto front is challenging for large-scale problems with irregularly-shaped Pareto fronts. We address this gap for a special type of problems inspired by a real-world case study in forest management. The proposed iterative Pareto representer uses an achievement scalarizing function to identify and prune certain search directions that are likely to yield duplicate or densely packed solutions. A subset selection technique is then used to identify the next search direction for achieving a relatively uniform distribution. Numerical experiments on 23 problems demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed approach over three alternate ones.},

  abstract  = {The state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms (EAs), developed to solve constrained multi/many-objective optimization problems (M/MaOPs), mostly deal with deterministic design variables causing no uncertainty in their implementation. However, from a practical point of view, it is imperative to consider unavoidable uncertainties in implementing design variables and parameters. In the presence of hard constraints, a slight change in one or more variables may cause a feasible optimal solution to become infeasible upon implementation and result in a failure during operation. The literature suggests reliability-based techniques for solving such M/MaOPs to obtain a Reliable Front (ReF), rather than a Pareto-optimal front (PF). A ReF is usually either a part of the PF or a completely different set of trade-off solutions dominated by the deterministic PF. However, in the presence of decision-making, computing the complete ReF may not be necessary, as the focus would be to locate only the preferred part of the ReF, dictated by the objective preference information provided by a decision-maker (DM). The proposed approach incorporates DM’s preferences and variable uncertainty information a priori. The proposed Reliability-based Multi-criteria Decision-making (ReMCDM) approach uses the hybrid mean value (HMV) method for constrained handling under variable uncertainties and R-NSGA-III for preference incorporation by DMs to conduct MCDM. Results obtained by the proposed method, implemented on several benchmark and real-world engineering examples, encourage future EMO research combining constraint handling, uncertainty in decision variables, and preference incorporation.},

  abstract  = {Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are major solutions for solving multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). However, to design efficient and powerful operators in MOEAs, a tedious process of trial-and-error with domain experts is usually required. This paper investigates a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLM) to design MOEA operators. Firstly, with proper prompt engineering, we directly employ an LLM to serve as a black-box search operator for decomposition-based MOEA in a zero-shot manner. In this way, we can get rid of the time-consuming manual operator design process. In addition, we further design a white-box operator to interpret and approximate the behaviour of LLM and propose a new version of decomposition-based MOEA, termed MOEA/D-LMO. This white-box operator improves generalization and reduces runtime by eliminating costly LLM interaction. Experimental studies on different test benchmarks show that our proposed method can achieve competitive performance with widely used MOEAs. Furthermore, the operators only learned from LLMs on a few instances have good generalization performances on unseen problems with different patterns and settings.},

The proposed utilizes an autoencoder-based surrogate model and gradient descent to search for Pareto optimal solutions. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms excel in finding diverse non-dominated solutions but often suffer from excessive execution times, particularly for real-world applications. Surrogate models offer a promising alternative by reducing the computational cost of objective function evaluations, and as such, have become the focus of increasing research interest. However, challenges persist in achieving accurate approximations and reducing surrogate model training times, limiting their practicality. To address this, we propose a method that uses an autoencoder with residual connections as surrogate models, introducing active learning to reduce sampling costs. The problem is then decomposed into multiple single-objective problems using weighted sum decomposition, and the solutions are optimized based on the approximate gradients established by the surrogate model. Evaluation experiments using the ZDT series and a human-powered aircraft design problem demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces sampling and training time, while achieving better approximation accuracy compared to existing surrogate methods. Furthermore, it achieves Pareto optimal fronts more quickly, while maintaining solution accuracy comparable to other representative evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

  abstract  = {A low-fidelity model using surrogate functions helps reduce the overall computational time for optimizing problems involving time-consuming evaluation of objectives and constraints. Most surrogate-assisted evolutionary multi- and many-objective optimization (SA-EM(a)O) algorithms evaluate a newly-created population member either using high-fidelity or low-fidelity models for all objectives and constraints. However, recent studies have shown that a mixed-fidelity evaluation of a population member, in which some objectives and constraints are evaluated using a high-fidelity model and others are evaluated using a low-fidelity model, may be more efficient. This is because the time saved by not evaluating constraint functions for largely infeasible or largely feasible solutions, and objective functions for largely infeasible solutions can be utilized to evaluate potential solutions near the constraint boundaries and feasible regions, respectively. In this paper, we propose a metric that determines the potential benefit for evaluating every objective and constraint function for every population member independently. The metric uses the potential for the solution’s probability to dominate other neighboring members, modeling error, and extent of constraint violation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by presenting results on two to 10-variable test and engineering design problems having up to eight objectives and up to 10 constraints. We compare the proposed approach with a SA-EMO algorithm which evaluates every constraint and objective function for every new offspring. This preliminary study shows promise as a new direction of research in the area of surrogate-assisted evolutionary multi- and many-objective optimization.},

In the former case, a single surrogate model is built of the scalarised function; in the latter case, separate surrogates are built for each objective function. A recent study argued that the multi-surrogate approach should be preferred and presented empirical findings supportive of this case. However, these findings were based on an outdated approach to benchmarking algorithm performance and were limited to low-dimensional problems. In this study, we use the modern COCO benchmarking framework to analyse the performance of single-surrogate and multi-surrogate ParEGO algorithms and compare these to random sampling, Sobol space-filling, and the high-performing optimizer known as TPB. Our findings broadly support the original findings for low-dimensional problems, but we find that multi-surrogate ParEGO performs comparatively poorly in higher dimensions. TPB tends to outperform both ParEGOs, suggesting that initial budget investment in ideal and nadir point identification is a favourable strategy.},

We propose a scalarization based knowledge gradient acquisition function which accounts for the different evaluation costs of the objectives.

In the literature, the population size is usually specified in the range of 100–300 to approximate the entire Pareto front. Recently, a new framework with an external archive has been actively studied where a solution set selected from the archive is used to approximate the Pareto front. In this framework, a small population size can be better than a standard population size since a smaller population size means a larger number of generations under the termination condition specified by the same number of evaluated solutions. In this paper, we numerically examine whether better results are obtained from a smaller population size specification than a standard specification when the algorithm performance is evaluated using a solution set selected from an external archive. In our experiments, we examine the performance of four representative EMO algorithms (NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and SMS-EMOA) with four specifications of the population size (36, 66, 120, and 210) on two frequently-used artificial test suites (DTLZ and WFG) and three real-world test suites (RWA, DDMOP, and RE). Our experimental results show that better results are obtained from a smaller population size specification in many cases when we cannot evaluate many solutions (i.e., when solution evaluation is expensive).},

In this study, we consider the problem of capturing the entire Pareto front (ideally in the mathematical sense). As the base algorithm we will take $$ArchiveUpdateP_Q$$ that stores all non-dominated solutions found during the run of the algorithm. Our discussion and results indicate that while existing CHTs work adequately, they come with certain issues, such as introducing additional parameters that need adjustment, lacking theoretical results, or incurring a certain computational overhead.

We examine the parameter-free Max-Min Diversity and the Riesz $$s$$ -Energy, which features uniformly distributed solution sets. Focusing on multi-objective diversity optimization, we discuss different diversity indicators from the perspective of indicator-based evolutionary algorithms with multiple objectives. We examine theoretical, computational, and practical properties of these indicators, such as monotonicity in species, twinning, monotonicity in distance, strict monotonicity in distance, uniformity of maximizing point sets, computational effort for a set of size $$n$$ , single-point contributions, subset selection, and submodularity. We present new theorems—including a proof of the NP-hardness of the Riesz $$s$$ -Energy Subset Selection Problem—and consolidate existing results from the literature. In the experiments, we apply these indicators in the NOAH algorithm to analyze search dynamics via an example. We study how optimizing one indicator impacts others and propose NOAH-specific modifications for the Max-Min indicator.},

  abstract  = {Regardless of the recent trends regarding the design of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), non-dominated sorting remains as an important mechanism to classify solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. Non-dominated sorting is defined for a set of points in M-dimensional space (where M is the number of objectives of a multi-objective problem). These points are the objective vectors associated with the solutions of the optimization problem. Many approaches have been proposed in the last two decades to produce more computationally efficient non-dominated sorting procedures. A recent approach is Merge Non-Dominated Sorting (MNDS) which uses the concept of dominance set of points and exploits the efficient implementation of bitset in the Java programming language. In the original paper proposing MNDS, it was claimed that for the best case to happen, there should be no dominance among the points, i.e., all points should be in a single front. However, in this paper, we show that, in this particular scenario, the worst-case can also occur. So, when there is no dominance among the points, i.e., all the points are in the same front, the best and the worst cases can occur. We also provide here a detailed complexity analysis of this algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Population update in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can be seen as an archiving process, namely, updating the population by comparing it with new solutions and deciding which ones to keep and which ones to discard. It thus may be useful for a population update mechanism to have some desirable archiving properties; for example, non-deteriorating, i.e., the population does not accept solutions that are inferior to solutions eliminated in the past. Unfortunately, none of mainstream MOEAs hold such a property. On the other hand, different from the archiving process which focuses on how to choose the best solutions from a set of candidate solutions, population update in MOEAs also cares about where these candidate solutions come from and what they are used for. It has been reported recently that allowing some dominated solutions in the population may help the search jump out of local optima. In this paper, we investigate the above seemingly “contradictory” observations, and aim to answer the question of whether holding the property non-deteriorating is beneficial or detrimental to MOEAs. We examine three representative MOEAs and modify their population update rules to make them non-deteriorating. We find that holding it is not necessarily beneficial for all the algorithms, but is generally useful, particularly for those whose population update mechanism does not hold any other desirable properties (e.g., set-monotone and limit-stable) like NSGA-II.},

  abstract  = {Recently, neural network-based inverse models have been used for multi-objective optimization. The basic idea is to approximate the mapping from the Pareto front to the Pareto set. In general, inverse modeling from a low-dimensional objective space to a high-dimensional decision space is difficult. However, good results have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we numerically examine the performance of inverse modeling. For visual examination, we use 2- and 3-objective distance minimization problems with 2 to 1,000 decision variables. Our experimental results show that inverse modeling improves the quality of the final population, which is used as the training data. One interesting observation is that improving fitting accuracy by increasing the neural network complexity does not improve the quality of the model outputs. We also demonstrate that inverse modeling works well even for large-scale multi-objective problems with 1,000 decision variables when high-quality training data are available.},

  abstract  = {Recently, evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been used in various application fields. Whereas many new EMO algorithms are proposed every year, well-known EMO algorithms such as NSGA-II, MOEA/D, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-III have been still frequently used in application papers as shown by their number of citations. Since most EMO algorithms have been designed for and evaluated by artificial test problems such as DTLZ and WFG, they do not always work well on real-world problems. Main difficulties of real-world problems are as follows: (i) their Pareto front shapes are irregular, (ii) some objectives have much larger values than others, (iii) some decision variables have much larger values than others, (iv) some objectives are highly correlated, and (v) solution evaluation is expensive. In this paper, we focus on the first four difficulties (except for expensive solution evaluation). Our goal is to clearly explain problematic search behaviors of NSGA-II, MOEA/D, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-III caused by these difficulties using simple distance minimization problems. We formulate various distance minimization problems with the above-mentioned four difficulties by changing the location of each target point on the map as well as the size and shape of the map. We also suggest simple remedies for performance improvement of each algorithm for real-world applications without changing the algorithm itself.},

However, the effectiveness of swarm algorithms often hinges on the careful tuning of parameters, which can be influenced by varying environmental features. This study investigates the impact of these features on the performance of optimized collective motion in swarm robotics for solving multi-objective coverage problems. Through a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, we evaluate how changes in parameters-such as arena size, number of robots, obstacle density, and obstacle structure-affect swarm performance in solving coverage problems. The analysis focuses on key performance metrics across multiple objectives: coverage percentage, coverage time, robot connectivity, and collision rates. Our findings provide critical insights into the adaptability of swarm algorithms, highlighting the importance of environmental context in optimizing swarm efficacy across competing objectives.

  abstract  = {Dealing with multiple conflicting objectives in a multi-agent system is challenging, as agents’ interactions complicate decision-making, especially when managing multiple Pareto-optimal fronts. In competitive co-evolutionary frameworks, not only do the objectives of each agent conflict with one another, but the agents’ goals are also at odds. One such application domain is wargame strategy optimization, where the strategies of one agent must adapt based on the moves of opposing agents. Despite advancements in modern warfare, strategy analysis and decision-making are still largely manual, leaving room for great application of computational methods to automate different parts of the system. To address this, we propose a co-evolutionary optimization algorithm that integrates strategy search with interactive decision-making, allowing co-evolving populations to collaboratively identify their respective Pareto-optimal strategies. Central to this approach is a progressive-shrinking method that aligns feasible moves with those previously taken, ensuring smoother transitions. Our framework introduces a novel decision-making strategy using opposition front hypervolume improvement, particularly suited for competitive co-evolutionary contexts, combined with Penalty-based Boundary Intersection selection, to optimize strategy selections. We also examine the influence of various decision-making approaches, shrinking techniques, and parameter settings on the final results. This co-evolutionary framework, combining multi-agent interaction, evolutionary multi-objective optimization, and progressive shrinking, is not only effective for wargame strategy optimization but is also adaptable to other multi-agent conflicting systems.},

  abstract  = {In evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), the quality of Pareto front (PF) approximations obtained using various algorithms are benchmarked using set-based unary indicators. Hypervolume (HV) is an indicator that has attracted widespread attention as it attempts to capture both convergence and diversity, is scalable in terms of objectives, and is Pareto-compliant. Even so, HV is not without its limitations, ignoring which may lead to erroneous judgments about algorithm performance, especially for problems with more than three objectives, where visualization of the objective space is not straightforward. Various theoretical studies have therefore been conducted to improve understanding of HV behavior and its implications in EMO benchmarking, including a recent one that focuses on computing HV for some common PF shapes analytically. This paper aims to extend these theoretical results and discussions, by analyzing continuous subsets (symmetric patches) on some common shapes of PFs (linear and quadratic). Towards this end, a simple parametrization scheme is proposed to represent the symmetric patches on linear and quadratic PFs, and their HV is analytically derived. The resulting expressions are used to observe some HV trends with respect to the patch size, reference point specification and number of objectives, to provide related insights for benchmarking.},

Unlike the original model, which assumes a fixed cross-section, the proposed formulation incorporates multiple design concepts, each featuring distinct cross-sectional geometries and corresponding design variables. The formulation is validated through comparison with existing welded beam problem formulations, and an in-depth analysis of the objective space is conducted for both individual concepts and the combined multi-concept case. Baseline results are presented using two evolutionary algorithms—NSGA-II and IDEA—applied to each design concept separately. Their effectiveness on the multi-concept problem was also evaluated by merging the results from each individual concept. Both algorithms successfully identified near-optimal solutions for the individual concepts; however, their performance declined for the multi-concept case, especially under limited computational budgets. These findings highlight the unique complexities inherent in MOMC problems and emphasize the need for more dedicated optimization approaches to address this class of problems.},

Each objective is a voter that evaluates the candidate solutions and assigns each of them a score or ranking depending on the voting method used. Voting identifies the top candidates and they are used to create the next generation of solutions.

To ensure efficient coverage, objectives like path length, overlaps, and traversal time are considered. However, in certain scenarios, a simplistic total coverage approach may not be optimal, necessitating a trade-off strategy. This paper addresses a novel challenge in CPP: the multi-objective weighted coverage path planning problem, where total coverage is not strictly required but balanced against other objectives and constraints. We present an approach to solve this problem using evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with free-form path representations. The focus lies on comparing different path representations, ranging from polygonal chains to Bézier curves and B-splines, to Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBs). Additionally, we incorporate an overlaid rectangular grid for comparison with a graph-based approach.},

However, when solving Many-objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs) with complex PFs, the effectiveness of MaOEAs with a fixed set of weight vectors may deteriorate which will lead to an imbalance between convergence and diversity of the solution set. To address this issue, we propose here an Adaptive Normal-Boundary Intersection Directions Decomposition-based Evolutionary Algorithm (ANBID-DEA), which adaptively updates the Normal-Boundary Intersection (NBI) directions used in MP-DEA. In our work, we assist the selection mechanism by progressively adjusting the NBI directions according to the distribution of the population to uniformly cover all the parts of the complex PFs (i.e., those that are disconnected, strongly convex, degenerate, etc.). Our proposed ANBID-DEA is compared with respect to five state-of-the-art MaOEAs on a variety of unconstrained benchmark problems with up to 15 objectives. Our results indicate that ANBID-DEA has a competitive performance on most of the considered MaOPs.},

Self-adaptation can improve the performance and robustness of the algorithm, however, parameter control mechanisms themselves need to be designed and configured carefully. In this article, we review the cumulative step size adaptation method originally proposed for single-objective optimization over continuous variables and recast it for deployment in multiobjective optimization over unbounded integer space. We contribute a systematic investigation of its hyperparameters which shows that while (1) the very best configurations remain problem-specific, (2) the performance of the algorithm is largely independent of the self-adaptation scheme’s parameterization and initial configuration.},

  abstract  = {In bilevel optimization, an upper level (UL) decision maker seeks to optimize an objective function while considering the optimal solutions of a lower level (LL) optimization problem. This hierarchical structure poses modeling and solution challenges, especially when the LL problem has multiple solutions. In such a case, the UL needs to make assumptions about the LL reaction. In the optimistic approach, the UL assumes that the LL reaction will be favorable, while in the pessimistic approach the opposite is true. In this study, we consider the case of a multiobjective bilevel optimization problem, where the UL has multiple objectives, while the LL has a single objective, but multiple optimal solutions for any given UL decision. Given that the LL can choose any solution from its optimal set, and in case the UL is not aware of the LL choice function, it leads to the possibility of two Pareto-optimal fronts at the UL, i.e. the optimistic and the pessimistic frontiers. To approximate both Pareto-optimal fronts, a $$\delta $$ -perturbation approximation is proposed in this paper, where the LL objective is perturbed by a small $$\delta $$ by utilizing the UL objectives at the LL. The perturbed reformulated bilevel problem is then solved via an extension of m-BLEAQ, an evolutionary bilevel algorithm that can deal with bilevel problems with multiple objectives at the UL and a single objective at the LL. The application of the m-BLEAQ algorithm to the reformulated bilevel problem leads to the identification of the optimistic and pessimistic frontiers for the multiobjective bilevel problem. In this proof-of-concept study, the proposed reformulation strategy is demonstrated on two test problems, showing the effectiveness of the proposal in accurately finding the optimistic and pessimistic frontiers.},

  abstract  = {Real world optimization problems contain multiple complexities that are often not tractable if one completely relies on mathematical programming or metaheuristic approaches, as each approach has unique strengths and limitations in dealing with the complexities in optimization problems. For instance, metaheuristic methods have an edge in tackling non-regularities like discontinuity, non-convexity, and discreteness, given that problem has few decision variables (low dimensionality). Contrary to that, mathematical programming based classical methods can efficiently solve high dimensional problems if the problem encompasses regular functions as constraints and objective function. Thus, non-regular and high-dimensional optimization problems pose challenges to both approaches for getting solved using the method explicitly from any one approach. To excel in this situation, this study proposes a difficulties separation approach that enables to convert a single level optimization problem into bilevel optimization problem and solve the problem synergistically by applying methods from both complementary approaches. We demonstrate the benefits of proposed bilevel based decomposition approach on a wide range of single and multiobjective test problems.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we study a multi-start weights-guided random bit climber (wgRBC). This algorithm selects a random weight from a predefined set, and a simple (1+1) random bit climber uses it to optimize, one bit at a time, the weighted sum of the objective functions of the problem until it reaches a local optimum. A population of non-dominated solutions generated during the climb is kept bounded using the set of weights. The algorithm iterates restarting the climber with a solution chosen randomly from the population of non-dominated solutions and selecting another weight randomly. Thus, the weights are used to provide climbing directions and to maintain a set of non-dominated solutions well-distributed in the reference population. We evaluate the method on subclasses of epistatic problems using MNK-landscapes, varying the number of objectives from 2 to 7 and the number of epistatic interactions from 1 to 20. We show that the simple wgRBC is largely superior to decomposition algorithms like MOEA/D and NSGA-III on this problem class.},

  abstract  = {Twenty-five years on from the original Pareto archived evolution strategy (PAES), we present and investigate an updated version (PAES-25), revisiting the algorithmic components of the mutation operator, acceptance criterion, and archiver, focusing on bit-string represented multi- and many- objective optimization problems. The original PAES, particularly the (1+1)-PAES, was intended as a “baseline” algorithm against which EMO algorithms (emerging at the time) with more parameters and the use of a population might be compared. PAES-25, which remains very simple, may serve similar purposes today, and may also help in developing our understanding of local search dynamics on multi-objective landscapes. Using LOTZ as a benchmark, and introducing three multi/many-objective variants, LITZ, sLITZ and FRITZ (up to 8 objectives here), the best performing PAES-25 configuration emerges as one using the multilevel grid archiver, a 1/n per-bit standard mutation, and original acceptance criterion (which accepts “neutral” search moves). We find no need for the use of hypervolume-based archiving, which is more computationally expensive, and generally recommend against an unbounded archive. Just as the original (1+1)-PAES has proven useful in developing purely Pareto-based hybrid EMO algorithms, as well as Pareto optimization local search algorithms like simulated annealing and tabu search variants, so should PAES-25, while now benefiting from an archiving component suitable for many-objective problems. We publish our functions, code, and results to facilitate future community benchmarking efforts.},

  abstract  = {From among the many techniques currently available to solve multi-objetive optimization problems (MOPs), an alternative is the use of multi-objective artificial immune systems (MOAISs). This sort of metaheuristic emulates immune processes using computational resources, with the aim of solving MOPs. MOAISs have mechanisms such as the clonal selection principle as well as positive and negative selection, that make them powerful search tools. In recent years, there have been proposals of MOAISs that adopt selection schemes that are more appropriate to deal with many-objective problems (i.e., problems having more than 3 objectives), from which decomposition has been a popular choice. We propose here a new MOAIs called “Multi-objective Artificial Immune System based on Decomposition” (MOAISDX). The performance of our proposed approach is compared with respect to that of NSGA-II and MOEA/D, as well as with respect to four recent MOAISs. The results obtained from this comparative study show that MOAISDX outperforms NSGA-II and obtains results similar to those of MOEA/D in most of the adopted test instances. Furthermore, MOAISDX has better performance than that of the other MOAISs compared, particularly as we increase the number of objectives.},

For such problems, for every feasible solution at the upper level, there is a corresponding set of Pareto-optimal solutions at the lower level. In typical bilevel evolutionary algorithms, the upper level solution is evaluated for each of these lower level Pareto solutions during the search. This incurs significant computational expense while searching for the overall (upper level) Pareto optimal front. In this study, we aim to reduce this expense by selectively evaluating the upper level solutions with only some of the lower-level solutions during the search. Towards this end, a direction-based selective evaluation scheme is introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach improves search accuracy and convergence rate, particularly for problems where the initial search starts far from the Pareto front.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of multiobjective and many-objective optimization in the unconstrained, continuous-variable setting. Can modern EAs designed for this setting (such as NSGA-III) that arguably have proven performance be improved by incorporating local search, and can this be achieved in a general way not requiring excessive tuning of parameters? Optimization in this setting is usually found to be increasingly challenging as the number of objectives is increased (albeit some works suggest the contrary) and this is believed to be because of the weakness of selection pressure available from Pareto comparisons, challenges in maintaining diversity and/or, in decomposition-based methods, due to the number of search “directions” that must be managed. To investigate our problem, we propose integrating a many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA) with local-search techniques based on derivative-free BFGS-like algorithms. This is done in two slightly different ways both using achievement scalarizing functions. Our results on well-known benchmark functions suggest a significant improvement is possible with reasonable assumptions about how to choose the base MaOEA parameters and a principled and general approach to choosing the remaining parameters in the hybrid algorithm. Our findings underline the effectiveness of hybrid methods and suggest powerful algorithms from mathematical programming can be used even without gradients.},

  abstract  = {In practice, users are often stuck with an existing solution, despite agreeing on the fact that the solution needs a substantial change. The hesitation might stem from the hefty cost or amount of effort required to adopt a new solution or could just be human apathy to large changes. In this regard, a recent preliminary study proposed a step-constrained based bi-objective optimization approach which attempts to discover a set of acceptable intermediate solutions starting from the current solution to the desired target solution leading to an innovation path (IP). Intermediate solutions, obtained using a multiobjectivization approach, reduce the amount of change required between two successive steps, thereby facilitating multiple gradual changes more acceptable by the users. In this paper, we propose a directed domination concept to make the IP-seeking algorithm more computationally efficient. Results on a number of test and engineering problems reveal that the proposed new approach reaches closer to the target solution and finds closer to optimally trade-off solutions than the previous IP approach.},
