  abstract  = {Recent research using machine decision makers has revealed that some leading interactive evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms do not perform robustly with respect to interactions with preference models (and biases) posited to be representative of human Decision Makers (DMs). In order to model preferences better, we propose an explainable interactive method that uses decision trees to automate (fast) pairwise comparisons based on trade-offs of two given solutions. To cancel out possible biases and errors in estimations, we use the trained tree in holistic comparisons to determine solutions that survive each generation. We test our new method with respect to two different preference models (Tchebychef and Sigmoid) on problems from 2 to 10 objectives, and control both the number of interactions available and various biases. The results suggest the superiority of our method in learning the DM’s preferences and in terms of the utility value of the final solution returned by the algorithm compared with some well-known interactive methods.},

  abstract  = {The knowledge and intuition of experienced users for practical optimization problems are often underutilized in academic research. Such knowledge, formulated as inter-variable relationships, can assist an optimization algorithm in finding good solutions faster. User-provided information can be utilized at the beginning of the optimization, or during the optimization in an interactive fashion. In this paper, we propose IK-EMOViz, a software framework to allow discovery and use of knowledge from and to an EMO algorithm interactively. Key knowledge common to current non-dominated solutions are extracted using rule learning methods and shared with the decision-makers (DMs) through a easy-to-comprehend visualization tool. Learned knowledge are then filtered and vetted by DMs are communicated to the EMO algorithm using the same visualization tool. EMO algorithm then processes the filtered knowledge and integrates them with its search operators. Repeated such interactions have resulted in faster convergence to the final trade-off set on a large-scale engineering design problem. In addition, the effect of asynchronous and synchronous interactivity is also evaluated to make the proposed interactive optimization procedure more pragmatic.},

  abstract  = {In recent decades, the benefits of applying multiobjective optimization (MOO) methods in real-world applications have rapidly increased. The MOO literature mostly focuses on problem-solving, typically assuming the problem has already been correctly formulated. The necessity of verifying the MOO problem and the potential impacts of having an incorrect problem formulation on the optimization results are not emphasized enough in the literature. However, verification is crucial since the optimization results will not be meaningful without an accurate problem formulation, not to mention the resources spent in the optimization process being wasted. In this paper, we focus on the MOO problem structuring, which we believe deserves more attention. The novel contribution is the proposed systematic way of structuring MOO problems that leverages problem structuring approaches from the literature on multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). They are not directly applicable to the formulation of MOO problems since the objective functions in the MOO problem depend on decision variables and constraint functions, whereas MCDA problems have a given set of solution alternatives characterized by criterion values. Therefore, we propose to elicit expert knowledge to identify decision variables and constraint functions, in addition to the objective functions, to construct a MOO problem appropriately. Our approach also enables the verification and validation of the problem before the actual decision making process.},

  abstract  = {Real-world multiobjective optimization problems involve decision makers interested in a subset of solutions that meet their preferences. Decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (or MOEAs) have gained the research community’s attention because of their good performance in problems with many objectives. Some efforts have been made to propose variants of these methods that incorporate the decision maker’s preferences, directing the search toward regions of interest. Typically, such variants adapt the reference vectors according to the decision maker’s preferences. However, most of them can consider a single type of preference, the most common being reference points. Interactive MOEAs aim to let decision-makers provide preference information progressively, allowing them to learn about the trade-offs between objectives in each iteration. In such methods, decision makers can provide preferences in multiple ways, and it is desirable to allow them to select the type of preference for each iteration according to their knowledge. This article compares three interactive versions of NSGA-III utilizing multiple types of preferences. The first version incorporates a mechanism that adapts the reference vectors differently according to the type of preferences. The other two versions convert the preferences from the type selected by the decision maker to reference points, which are then utilized in two different reference vector adaptation techniques that have been used in a priori MOEAs. According to the results, we identify the advantages and drawbacks of the compared methods.},

  abstract  = {Normalization is commonly used in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in order to handle multiobjective optimization problems with differently-scaled objectives. The goal of normalization is to obtain uniformly-distributed solutions over the entire Pareto front. However, in practice, such a uniform solution set may not be a well-distributed solution set for decision making when the desired distribution of solutions is not uniform. To obtain a well-distributed solution set that meets the desired distribution, in this paper, we propose a preference-based nonlinear normalization method that transforms the objective space based on the probability integral transform theorem. As a result, the use of a standard MOEA to search for uniformly-distributed solutions in the transformed objective space leads to a desired well-distributed solution set. The proposed method is incorporated in three different MOEAs (i.e., a Pareto dominance-based MOEA, a decomposition-based MOEA, and an indicator-based MOEA). Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/linjunhe/moea-pn .},

Optimization of neural network weights is performed using the MOEA/D algorithm with the goal of obtaining good trade-offs between the false positive (FP) and true positive (TP) rates. The results show, that neural classifiers optimized on historical data (in this article taken from the years 2017–2019) can be used for making predictions on future data (in this article taken from the year 2020) without a serious degradation of the classification quality. In the experiments, the overall performance of the RNN model was better than that of the LSTM model, however, the LSTM performed slightly better than the RNN in the range of lower FP rates. The results of this study motivate further research on using predictive models for optimizing counter-epidemic measures, for example vaccination campaigns.},

  abstract  = {Airline crew pairing optimization problem (CPOP) aims to find a set of flight sequences (crew pairings) that cover all flights in an airline’s highly constrained flight schedule at minimum cost. Since crew cost is second only to the fuel cost, CPOP solutioning is critically important for an airline. However, CPOP is NP-hard, and tackling it is quite challenging. The literature suggests, that when the CPOP’s scale and complexity is reasonably limited, and an enumeration of all crew pairings is possible, then Metaheuristics are used, predominantly Genetic Algorithms (GAs). Else, Column Generation (CG) based Mixed Integer Programming techniques are used. Notably, as per the literature, a maximum of 45,000 crew pairings have been tackled by GAs. In a significant departure, this paper considers over 800 flights of a US-based large airline (with a monthly network of over 33,000 flights), and tests the efficacy of GAs by enumerating all 400,000+ crew pairings, apriori. Towards it, this paper proposes a domain-knowledge-driven customized-GA. The utility of incorporating domain-knowledge in GA operations, particularly initialization and crossover, is highlighted through suitable experiments. Finally, the proposed GA’s performance is compared with a CG-based approach (developed in-house by the authors). Though the latter is found to perform better in terms of solution’s cost-quality and run time, it is hoped that this paper will help in better understanding the strengths and limitations of domain-knowledge-driven customizations in GAs, for solving combinatorial optimization problems, including CPOPs.},

Since only supportive clinical treatment is available for this endemic disease, the mortality rate due to Dengue hemorrhagic fever is relatively high. In the present work, a disease stage-specific differentially co-expressed gene module identification algorithm is developed to explore the relationship between the virus genomic particle and the host genomic substance for different stages of Dengue infection. The proposed algorithm is applied to a real-life Dengue patient expression dataset. Our algorithm uses a multi-objective framework and simultaneously optimizes topological dissimilarity and biological similarity among the genes for detecting disease stage-specific gene modules. Subsequently, we apply a disease stage-specific marker identification technique and found 16 and 13 potential markers for DF and DHF, respectively. The biological significance of the identified gene modules and stage-specific markers is also established.},

  abstract  = {The first step in drug design is the identification and optimization of lead molecules for therapeutic and diagnostic interventions. The analysis of molecular properties requires high laboratory evaluation costs. Computer-aided drug design provides effective approaches to optimize molecules with two general aims: firstly, the identification of candidate targets with several optimized physiochemical properties. Secondly, lead libraries have to be build with a broad range of compounds revealing a high genetic diversity among themselves with an at most similar behavior in bioactivity. MOEAs are nowadays established in vitro processes for molecular optimization problems with a continuous complexity increase. Therefore, MOEAs solving multi- and many-objective optimization problems with a suitable balance of convergence and genetic dissimilarity are challenging. For this purpose, a MOEA especially evolved for molecular optimization is enhanced by optionally two balancing survival selection strategies: a Pareto-based strategy is applied on a two-dimensional indicator problem consisting of a convergence and genetic diversity measure. The second strategy uses truncation selection based on a ranking measure referring to the convergence and genetic diversity measure. These configurations are compared to the recently proposed ad-MOEA with a specific environmental survival selection for multi- and many-objective optimization on four molecular optimization problems from 3 up to 6 objectives.},

  abstract  = {A building spatial design (BSD) determines external and internal walls and ceilings of a building. The design space has a hierarchical structure, in which decisions on the existence or non-existence of spatial components determine the existence of variables related to these spaces, such as sizing and angles. In the optimization of BSDs it is envisioned to optimize various performance indicators from multiple disciplines in concert, such as structural, functional, thermal, and daylight performance. Existing representations of design spaces suffer from severe limitations, such as only representing orthogonal designs or representing the structures in parametric superstructure, allowing only for limited design variations. This paper proposes prism nets - a new way of representing the search space of BSDs based on triangulations defining space filling collections of triangular prisms that can be combined via coloring parameters to spaces. Prism nets can accommodate for non-orthogonal designs and are flexible in terms of topological variations. We follow the guidelines for representation and operator design proposed in the framework of metric-based evolutionary algorithms. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed discussion of the search space representation and corresponding mutation operators. Moreover, a proof of concept example demonstrates the integration into multi-objective evolutionary algorithms and provides first results on a simple, but reproducible, benchmark problem.},

  abstract  = {Knowledge Discovery (KD) mechanisms (e.g. data mining, neural networks) receive more and more interest over the years. A KD mechanism uses an extraction procedure, namely $$\text {K}_{\text {ext}}$$ , to discover knowledge, and an injection procedure, namely $$\text {K}_{\text {inj}}$$ , to exploit knowledge. However such mechanisms are not often applied to multi-objective combinatorial problems, due to the optimization of many objectives, which can lead to learning conflicting knowledge. The key is to know how the components of the KD mechanism should coexist and interact with the knowledge. In this article, we work with the MOEA/D algorithm, and existing $$\text {K}_{\text {inj}}$$ and $$\text {K}_{\text {ext}}$$ components. We propose different interactions between the components of the KD mechanism, by using different numbers of knowledge groups (dedicated to the storage of the knowledge) and different strategies for the injection component. The variants are evaluated through the bi-objective Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (bVRPTW). Our results show, that using five knowledge groups and an intensification strategy for the injection procedure leads to better results.},

  abstract  = {Pricing is a key lever used by e-commerce companies to achieve “growth with profitability”. Given the huge catalog size in e-commerce, most products have very close substitutes and complements. These complementary/substitute products result in influencing the demand for one another. Moreover, in the context of fashion, the utility of a product is mostly subjective. In categories like electronics, it’s relatively easy to define the utility of a product based on its attributes, but the same is not directly applicable to fashion. Products with similar attributes can have different utilities for the customer and therefore can be priced differently. Taking these things into consideration we base our pricing strategy on the following 3-stage decision-making process: 1) identifying the items which influence each other 2) building demand models that include effects of demand transference 3) joint optimization of the prices to achieve revenue or profit margin targets. We discuss our contributions to building a real-world system that implements these 3 stages in the specific context of fashion e-commerce. Fashion e-commerce has its nuances when it comes to pricing compared to general e-commerce and we explain how we dealt with these difficulties. Moreover, in addition to the formulations, we also describe challenges faced in building working systems that scale to millions of products and hundreds of categories. In addition, we describe a unique approach to quantifying the dollar benefit under scenarios where true A/B testing is not possible for legal reasons. Lastly, we explain how this work has resulted in significant incremental revenue for a large fashion e-commerce company.},

Graph nodes are parameterized by attributes which are known to affect the susceptibility of people to influenza and the disease transmission probability depends on the attributes of the node which can get infected. Instead of directly optimizing the assignment of vaccine doses to graph nodes, in the proposed approach an evolutionary algorithm is used to train a neural network, which is subsequently used to make decisions about vaccinating the nodes of the graph. In the paper, both a classifier and a regression model are used to select graph nodes for vaccination.

  abstract  = {Over the years, several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of non-dominated sorting, which is one of the crucial steps in Pareto dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). However, some of these approaches, even though they are correct, lack an in-depth analysis. In this paper, we focus on an approach known as Efficient Non-dominated Sort using Binary Search (ENS-BS) and show that the best case scenario presented in the paper for ENS-BS is not correct. We show this by providing a counter-example where the number of dominance comparisons is less than that reported in the original paper. This is done by obtaining a generic equation and getting the scenario inspired by this equation.},

  abstract  = {The problem of approximating the Pareto front of a multiobjective optimization problem can be reformulated as the problem of finding a set that maximizes the hypervolume indicator. This paper establishes the analytical expression of the Hessian matrix of the mapping from a (fixed size) collection of n points in the d-dimensional decision space (or m dimensional objective space) to the scalar hypervolume indicator value. To define the Hessian matrix, the input set is vectorized, and the matrix is derived by analytical differentiation of the mapping from a vectorized set to the hypervolume indicator. The Hessian matrix plays a crucial role in second-order methods, such as the Newton-Raphson optimization method, and it can be used for the verification of local optimal sets. So far, the full analytical expression was only established and analyzed for the relatively simple bi-objective case. This paper will derive the full expression for arbitrary dimensions ( $$m\ge 2$$ objective functions). For the practically important three-dimensional case, we also provide an asymptotically efficient algorithm with time complexity in $$O(n\log n)$$ for the exact computation of the Hessian Matrix’ non-zero entries. We establish a sharp bound of $$12m-6$$ for the number of non-zero entries. Also, for the general m-dimensional case, a compact recursive analytical expression is established, and its algorithmic implementation is discussed. Also, for the general case, some sparsity results can be established; these results are implied by the recursive expression. To validate and illustrate the analytically derived algorithms and results, we provide a few numerical examples using Python and Mathematica implementations. Open-source implementations of the algorithms and testing data are made available as a supplement to this paper.},

The main challenge in this type of subset selection is how to efficiently handle a huge candidate solution set, especially when the hypervolume-based subset selection is used for many-objective optimization. In this paper, we propose an efficient two-stage greedy algorithm for hypervolume-based subset selection. In each iteration of the proposed greedy algorithm, a small number of promising candidate solutions are selected in the first stage using the rough hypervolume contribution approximation. In the second stage, a single solution among them is selected using the more precise approximation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is much faster than state-of-the-art hypervolume-based greedy subset selection algorithms at the cost of a slight deterioration of the selected subset quality.},

  abstract  = {Multi-objective optimization problems (MOP) are frequently encountered in practice. In some cases, different computationally expensive analyses may be independently used for computing different objectives of the MOP. Additionally, the analyses may be executed to obtain estimates with different fidelity, typically higher fidelity requiring a longer run-time. For instance, in automotive design, the aerodynamic drag is computed using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis and its crashworthiness/strength is assessed using finite element analysis (FEA). Both the objectives can be independently computed and the underlying fidelity of each analysis can also be controlled using different mesh sizes/thresholds on the residual errors. While there exist a number of generic MOP benchmark problems in the literature, there is scarce work on constructing MOPs with multi-fidelity (MF) analyses to support the development of multi-fidelity, multi-objective optimization algorithms. The existing MF benchmarks are limited to unconstrained, single-objective optimization problems only. Towards addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce a test suite for multi-objective, multi-fidelity optimization (MOMF). The problems are derived by combining existing unconstrained, multi-objective design optimization problems with resolution/stochastic/instability errors that are common manifestations of MF simulations. The method allows for the construction of any number of low-fidelity functions with desired level of correlations for a given high-fidelity objective function. We hope that the test suite would motivate novel algorithmic developments to support optimization involving computationally expensive and independently evaluable objectives.},

Over the years, a variety of performance indicators have been proposed to fulfill this task. One of the most popular performance indicators has been the hypervolume because it can assess both convergence and spread of a set of solutions and it is fully Pareto compliant. However, its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of objectives. A good alternative is the R2 indicator which has a similar behavior but a much lower computational cost. Nevertheless, R2 sometimes is unable to differentiate two sets with different distributions. In this work, we propose a novel performance indicator based on the linear assignment problem called “ILAP”, which offers advantages over R2. To illustrate this, we include an example in which the ILAP can differentiate two sets when the R2 indicator cannot do it. Furthermore, our experimental analysis shows that our proposed indicator correctly ranks solution sets with different distributions and shapes.},

In this paper, we try to find an answer to this question by examining the performance of ten EMO algorithms including both well-known representative algorithms and recently-proposed new algorithms. First, those algorithms are applied to five artificial test suites (DTLZ, WFG, Minus-DTLZ, Minus-WFG and MaF) and three real-world problem suites. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated by the hypervolume indicator. Next, the ranking of the ten EMO algorithms is created for each problem suite. That is, eight different rankings are obtained (each ranking is for each problem suite). Then, the eight different rankings are visually compared to answer our research question. The distance between two rankings is also calculated to support visual comparison results. Our experimental results show that similar rankings of the ten EMO algorithms are obtained for the three real-world problem suites and Minus-WFG. It is also shown that the ranking for each of the three real-world problem suites is clearly different from their ranking for DTLZ.},

Whilst a range of single-objective benchmark problems have been proposed for MDO, there exists only a limited selection of multi-objective benchmarks, with only one of these problems being scalable in the number of disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective MDO test suite, based on the popular ZDT bi-objective benchmark problems, which is scalable in the number of disciplines and design variables. Dependencies between disciplines can be defined directly in the problem formulation, enabling a diverse set of multidisciplinary topologies to be constructed that can resemble more realistic MDO problems. The new problems are solved using a multidisciplinary feasible architecture which combines a conventional multi-objective optimizer (NSGA-II) with a Newton-based multidisciplinary analysis solver. Empirical findings show that it is possible to solve the proposed ZDT-MDO problems but that multimodal problem landscapes can pose a significant challenge to the optimizer. The proposed test suite can help stimulate more research into the neglected but important topic of multi-objective multidisciplinary optimization.},

However, they lack diversity in their landscape properties and do not provide a mechanism for creating multiple distinct problem instances. Other suites, like bi-objective BBOB, possess diverse and challenging landscape properties, but their optima are not well understood and can only be approximated empirically without any guarantees. This work proposes a methodology for creating complex continuous problem landscapes by concatenating single-objective functions from version 2 of the multiple peaks model (MPM2) generator. For the resulting problems, we can determine the distribution of optimal points with arbitrary precision w.r.t. a measure such as the dominated hypervolume. We show how the properties of the MPM2 generator influence the multi-objective problem landscapes and present an experimental proof-of-concept study demonstrating how our approach can drive well-founded benchmarking of MO algorithms.},

However, it was pointed out in some studies that the frequently-used degenerate DTLZ5, DTLZ6 and WFG3 test problems do not have degenerate Pareto fronts. Their Pareto fronts are different from the originally intended degenerate shapes. Actually, they are partially degenerate test problems. Modified formulations of DTLZ5 and DTLZ6 were proposed to remove the non-degenerate parts of their Pareto fronts. However, the original formulations of DTLZ5, DTLZ6 and WFG3 continue to be used as degenerate test problems in many studies whereas they are not degenerate test problems. One issue in their use as degenerate test problems is that reference point sets for IGD calculation are sampled from the originally intended degenerate Pareto fronts whereas they are not the true Pareto fronts. Nevertheless, the original DTLZ5, DTLZ6 and WFG3 formulations are useful for performance evaluation of EMO algorithms since their Pareto front shapes are similar to some real-world problems and much more complicated than other test problems. That is, their use helps us to evaluate the performance of EMO algorithms on a wide variety of test problems including realistic and challenging test problems. In this paper, we clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the original DTLZ5, DTLZ6 and WFG3 formulations.

However, these algorithms are usually examined on test suites with unrealistically simple Pareto sets (e.g., ZDT and DTLZ test suites). Real-world MOPs usually have complicated Pareto sets, such as a vehicle dynamic design problem and a power plant design optimization problem. Such MOPs are challenging to construct reliable surrogates for surrogate-based MOEAs. Constructed surrogates with low accuracy are likely to make incorrect predictions and even mislead the search direction. In this paper, we propose an improved fuzzy classifier-based MOEA by leveraging the accuracy information of the classifier. The proposed algorithm is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on two well-known test suites with complicated Pareto sets and four real-world problems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving realistic MOPs with complicated Pareto sets when only a limited number of function evaluations are available.},

Conventional supervised multi-objective optimization algorithm (SMOA) built the Pareto front and the Pareto set estimation models with a known candidate solution set. SMOA sampled a set of well-distributed estimated points and evaluated them to upconvert the Pareto front resolution. However, depending on the distribution of the known candidate solutions, we could not expect the accuracy of the estimation models and the estimated points from them. The proposed method, the iterative SMOA (I-SMOA), gradually improved the accuracy of the estimation models through their iterative update with evaluated solutions. Experimental results on the DTLZ2 test problem showed that the proposed I-SMOA obtained solutions uniformly distributed more than the one by the conventional SMOA, and the proposed I-SMOA achieved higher robustness on the initially given candidate solutions.},

  abstract  = {Currently, the research on expensive optimization problems mainly focuses on continuous problems and ignores combinatorial problems, which exist in many real-world applications. Since in surrogate model assisted evolution algorithms (SAEAs), the surrogate models from the community of machine learning are usually designed from continuous problems, and they are not suitable from combinatorial problems. For this reason, we propose a convolution relation model for both continuous and combinatorial problems. In the new relation model, a sample representation method of a relation map is proposed in the data preparation, and the convolution neural network is used to learn the relationships between pairs of candidate solutions. The new method is embedded into a basic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm and applied to a set of continuous and combinatorial problems. The experimental results suggest that the relation model with the same settings can solve continuous and combinatorial problems, and it has an advantage in terms of problem scalability.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary Multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms attempt to find a well-converged and well-diversified set close to true Pareto-optimal solutions. However, due to stochasticity involved in EMO algorithms, the uniformity in distribution of solutions cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the follow-up decision-making activities may demand finding more solutions in specific regions on the Pareto-optimal front which may not be well-represented by the obtained EMO solutions. In this paper, we train machine learning algorithms to capture the relationship between pseudo-weight vectors, derived from location of EMO-obtained non-dominated objective vectors, and their respective decision variable vectors. The learnt system can then be utilized to predict the corresponding variable vector for any desired pseudo-weight vector. The proposed methodology is applied to a number of problem instances to demonstrate its working and usefulness in arriving at a desired distribution of near Pareto-optimal solutions. The methodology has the potential to be embedded within an EMO algorithm to produce a better distributed set of solutions, check the validity of apparent gaps in obtained fronts, and also to help find more non-dominated solutions at the preferred regions of the Pareto-optimal front for effective decision-making purposes.},

  abstract  = {Surrogate-assisted optimization algorithms are a commonly used technique to solve expensive-evaluation problems, in which a regression model is built to replace an expensive function. In some acquisition functions, the only requirement for a regression model is the predictions. However, some other acquisition functions also require a regression model to estimate the “uncertainty” of the prediction, instead of merely providing predictions. Unfortunately, very few statistical modeling techniques can achieve this, such as Kriging/Gaussian processes, and recently proposed genetic programming-based (GP-based) symbolic regression with Kriging (GP2). Another method is to use a bootstrapping technique in GP-based symbolic regression to estimate prediction and its corresponding uncertainty. This paper proposes to use GP-based symbolic regression and its variants to solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), which are under the framework of a surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm (SMOA). Kriging and random forest are also compared with GP-based symbolic regression and GP2. Experiment results demonstrate that the surrogate models using the GP2 strategy can improve SMOA’s performance.},

Previous works already showed, that Hyper-Heuristics as selectors of crossover operators improve the performance of a single algorithm used on two opposing problem properties. In this paper, we present different selection mechanisms of Hyper-Heuristics, that are able to handle an expanded selection pool to cover more properties. We solve 20 benchmark problems with NSGA-II using those Hyper-Heuristics. By comparing the learning behaviour and the IGD trends of fixed crossover operator usages, we confirm that a combination of operators could outperform the best fixed operator. From the introduced Hyper-Heuristics in this paper, HHX-A made the best use of this advantage. It selects either all operators or a single operator alternately and learns fast which operators to prioritize to optimize the production. Due to periodic resets of the score, the Hyper-Heuristic is able to adapt fast to changes of the current state of the solving process. Although the pool is bigger and more diverse, we are able to show that HHX-A decides reasonably and fast. Therefore, it works well on a bigger set of problems with different properties.},

  abstract  = {The facility location problems (FLPs) are a typical class of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, which are widely seen in the supply chain and logistics. Many mathematical and heuristic algorithms have been developed for optimizing the FLP. In addition to the transportation cost, there are usually multiple conflicting objectives in realistic applications. It is therefore desirable to design algorithms that approximate a set of Pareto solutions efficiently without enormous search cost. In this paper, we consider the multi-objective facility location problem (MO-FLP) that simultaneously minimizes the overall cost and maximizes the system reliability. We develop a learning-based approach to predicting the distribution probability of the entire Pareto set for a given problem. To this end, the MO-FLP is modeled as a bipartite graph optimization problem and two graph neural networks are constructed to learn the implicit graph representation on nodes and edges. The network outputs are then converted into the probability distribution of the Pareto set, from which a set of non-dominated solutions can be sampled non-autoregressively. Experimental results on MO-FLP instances of different scales show that the proposed approach achieves a comparable performance to a widely used multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in terms of the solution quality while significantly reducing the computational cost for search.},

These studies have shown how learning efficient search directions from the intermittent generations’ solutions, could be utilized to create pro-convergence and pro-diversity offspring, leading to better convergence and diversity, respectively. The entailing steps of data-set preparation, training of ML models, and utilization of these models, have been encapsulated as Innovized Progress operators, namely, IP2 (for convergence improvement) and IP3 (for diversity improvement). Evidently, the focus in these studies has been on proof-of-the-concept, and no exploratory analysis has been done to investigate, if and how drastically the operators’ performance may be impacted, if their underlying ML methods (Random Forest for IP2, and kNN for IP3) are varied. This paper seeks to bridge this gap, through an exploratory analysis for both IP2 and IP3, based on eight different ML methods, tested against an exhaustive test suite comprising of seven multi-objective and 32 many-objective test instances. While the results broadly endorse the robustness of the existing IP2 and IP3 operators, they also reveal interesting tradeoffs across different ML methods, in terms of the Hypervolume (HV) metric and corresponding run-time. Notably, within the gambit of the considered test suite and different ML methods adopted, kNN emerges as a winner for both IP2 and IP3, based on conjunct consideration of HV metric and run-time.},

Despite their successes, recent works have demonstrated their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In particular, image classifiers have shown to be vulnerable to fine-tuned noise that perturb a small number of pixels, known as sparse attacks. To generate such perturbations current works either prioritise query efficiency by allowing the size of the perturbation to be unbounded or the minimization of its size by allowing a large number of pixels to be perturbed. Addressing the drawbacks of both approaches we propose a method of conducting query efficient sparse adversarial attacks that minimizes the number of perturbed pixels by formulating the attack as a constrained bi-objective optimization problem. Within the single objective unbounded query-efficient scenario our method is able to outperform state-of-the-art sparse attack algorithms in terms of success rate and query efficiency. When also minimizing the number of perturbed pixels in the bi-objective setting, the proposed method is able to generate adversarial perturbations that impact a fewer number of pixels than its state-of-the-art competitors.},

Intuitively, building machine learning solutions in such cases would entail providing multiple predictions that span and uniformly cover the Pareto front of all optimal trade-off solutions. We propose a novel approach for multi-objective training of neural networks to approximate the Pareto front during inference. In our approach, we train the neural networks multi-objectively using a dynamic loss function, wherein each network’s losses (corresponding to multiple objectives) are weighted by their hypervolume maximizing gradients. Experiments on different multi-objective problems show that our approach returns well-spread outputs across different trade-offs on the approximated Pareto front without requiring the trade-off vectors to be specified a priori. Further, results of comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches highlight the added value of our proposed approach, especially in cases where the Pareto front is asymmetric.},

This is mainly because the progression of the algorithm along successive generations is based on non-dominance relations that practically do not exist when the number of objectives is high. Also, the existence of many objectives makes the choice of a solution to the problem under study very difficult. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to reduce the number of objectives to use during the optimization process. In the present work, a methodology to reduce the number of objectives is proposed. This method is based on DAMICORE (DAta MIning of COde REpositories), a machine-learning algorithm proposed by the authors. A theoretical comparison with a similar machine learning approach is made, pointing out some advantages of using the proposed algorithm using a benchmark problem designated by DTLZ5.

  abstract  = {The series of non-dominated sorting based genetic algorithms (NSGA-series) has clearly shown their niche in solving multi- and many-objective optimization problems since mid-nineties. Of them, NSGA-III was designed to solve problems having three or more objectives efficiently. It is well established that with an increase in number of objectives, an increasingly large proportion of a random population stays non-dominated, thereby making only a few population members to remain dominated. Thus, in many-objective optimization problems, the need for a non-dominated sorting (NDS) procedure is questionable, except in early generations. In support of this argument, it can also be noted that most other popular evolutionary multi- and many-objective optimization algorithms do not use the NDS procedure. In this paper, we investigate the effect of NDS procedure on the performance of NSGA-III. From simulation results on two to 10-objective problems, it is observed that an elimination of the NDS procedure from NSGA-III must accompany a penalty boundary intersection (PBI) type niching method to indirectly emphasize best non-dominated solutions. Elimination of the NDS procedure from NSGA-III will open up a number of avenues for NSGA-III to be modified for different scenarios, such as, for parallel implementations, surrogate-assisted applications, and others, more easily.},

The current research is mainly developed for problems with a ‘regular’ triangle-like Pareto-optimal front (PF), whereas the performance can significantly deteriorate when the PF consists of disconnected segments. Furthermore, the offspring reproduction in the current data-driven EMO does not fully leverage the latent information of the surrogate model. Bearing these considerations in mind, this paper proposes a data-driven EMO algorithm based on multiple-gradient descent. By leveraging the regularity information provided by the up-to-date surrogate model, it is able to progressively probe a set of well distributed candidate solutions with a convergence guarantee. In addition, its infill criterion recommends a batch of promising candidate solutions to conduct expensive objective function evaluations. Experiments on 33 benchmark test problem instances with disconnected PFs fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method against four selected peer algorithms.},

The essence of the successful implementation of the CC framework is the design of decomposition methods. However, in LSMOPs, variables in different objective functions may have different interactions, and the design of a proper decomposition method for LSMOPs is more difficult than for single objective optimization problems. Our proposed LMM can identify the relatively strong interactions and search the better decomposition iteratively. We evaluate our proposal on 21 benchmark functions of 500-D and 1000-D, and numerical experiments show that our proposal is quite competitive with the current popular decomposition methods.},

In this paper, we propose a modified optimization methodology to avoid converging to theoretical PO solutions having no common structure and converging to a set of near-Pareto solutions having simplistic common principles with regularity where the common principles are extracted from the PO solutions in an automated fashion. After proposing the methodology, we first demonstrate its working principle on a number of constrained and unconstrained multi-objective test problems. Thereafter, we demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed approach to a number of popular engineering design problems. Searching for a set of solutions with regularity-based principles for different platforms is a practically important task.
