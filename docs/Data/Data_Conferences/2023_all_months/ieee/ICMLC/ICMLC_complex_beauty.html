  abstract  = {As a new wireless transmission architecture technology, cSO can effectively reduce the influence of fading channels and provide cSO links for low channel quality. Secondly, in the ultra-large traffic cSO, The fitting of data and the constraint on the model must be considered at the same time. Generally speaking, regularization is the most common method, because in the process of inversion, it is far from enough to only use data fitting terms as constraints. In order to make the inversion results stable, model constraint terms should be added to the objective function on the basis of data fitting terms, and there are usually different model constraint methods for different practical problems. When the physical properties of anomalous body are different from those of surrounding rock, the minimum model constraint can be used. When inversion of the moderocess of EMM-connected state was consistent with the determination of the coverage enhancement level.},

The proposed model uses multi-channel downsampling and fusion overlay technology to train and process complex illustrations, focusing on learning the color and contour lines of the picture respectively, to color complex black and white illustrations. For experimental needs, we prepared a training set with very different styles and complex pictures that we manually screened to broadens the range of applicable works. It can be seen from the results that this method retains the details of the original illustration, and performs color-changing processing on this basis, which has a good subjective evaluation and visual effect.},

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a one-shot learning HAR method that extracts human poses from video data. The study introduces three key techniques: firstly, the PF-ART algorithm is employed to identify the essential poses for each activity. Secondly, a scoring system is designed to provide similarity scores for input activities. Finally, two decision rules are established to distinguish between upper and lower activities. The proposed system is evaluated using the KTH dataset, and the obtained results demonstrate its superior performance compared to previous methods.},

This paper proposes a cross-time zone transfer consumption model for base station group computing tasks based on photovoltaic prediction. The photovoltaic prediction model based on LSTM is used to predict the photo-voltaic power.

Firstly, we enhance the information entropy feature extracted from the video to generate the Video-Momentum-Feature (VMF). The VMF enlarges the difference between the entropy feature of normal and anomalous videos, and allows the network to focus on the most anomalous parts of the video. Moreover, the network employs I3D to extract the RGB and Optical flow characteristics separately. Then, the VMF is fused with these RGB and Optical flow characteristics, respectively. Finally, the fused features are utilized for anomaly detection. Experimental results on the modified UCF -Crime dataset and the offshore ferryboat dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves significant performance.},

For monocular machine vision of 2D images, it is difficult to obtain accurate spatial relationships at some angles. The point cloud obtained by the depth camera has a natural advantage for such objects. However, the object recognition of 3D point cloud is computationally intensive, and the original image recognition accumulated data set is completely abandoned. This paper combines the advantages of image recognition and point cloud, uses the existing model of image recognition to identify objects, and accurately finds the point cloud of the object in the point cloud, and then determines the spatial relationship. This paper first uses the 2D object recognition algorithm to find out the approximate range of each object and then uses the GNG clustering algorithm to remove the background point cloud and identify the corresponding 3D object. This method can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of 3D object recognition. Combining the GroundingDINO and SAM methods, it is possible to recognize and segment the point clouds of various objects in 3D by simply inputting their category names. By finding the centroid of each point cloud cluster after recognition, the accurate spatial relationship between objects can be obtained.},

The recursive gated convolution and the channel-space attention are also embedded in MetaSR to achieve arbitrary-order spatial interactions and feature filtering. The experimental results indicate that MetaSR achieves excellent SR results for satellite cloud images on the NCCI dataset.

This paper proposes a novel framework of orthogonal universal KNMF with total variation regularization (OUKNMF-TV) to address these issues. The model contains three objective functions subject to TV and orthogonal constraints. The optimization problems of the OUKNMF-TV model are solved using the gradient descent method, and its updated rules are the same in the case of using different kernel functions. Convergence of the OUKNMF-TV algorithm is guaranteed using auxiliary function techniques. The experiments on non-noisy and contaminated datasets are implemented, and the results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {With the frequent occurrence of Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) cases in recent years, it has become increasingly important to investigate how to measure heart rate by non-contact methods under low-light conditions and in natural sleeping positions. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact measurement technique that measures the activity of the human heart by detecting the subtle color changes on the surface of skin tissue caused by human blood impulses. In this paper, we propose a method using rPPG to the extract heart rate from infrared video when people sleep with natural postures in low-light environments. Faces in the video image are detected and divided into multiple disjoint areas. With the signal-to-noise ratio information, a new signal is reconstructed by combining all signals extracted from divided areas using a weighted sum. Then, the reconstructed signal is denoised by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Finally, the SNR filtering algorithm is used to reduce the influence of sudden changes and abnormal values in the heart rate sequence. The experimental results show that the heart rate values estimated by our method have minimal error with the true value, which provides the possibility for the realization of non-contact sleep monitoring at home.},

  abstract  = {Understanding internal conditions of humans, such as emotion, concentration, confidence level, and so on, is a challenging topic for human-robot interaction, even recently. In this research, we focus on estimating confidence levels from physiological sensor data, eye gaze and head movement, aiming to offer support for self-study with robots which give learners hints. Previous research recognized confidence levels after obtaining data, which was considered as “offline recognition”. To augment the method from offline to real-time recognition, this paper compared participants&#39; physiological data before/after hearing hints. Additionally, we tried to classify their confidence levels by machine learning. Due to differences in their physiological data, distribution of gaze points when coming up answers tends to be more clustered than that of considering answers. The performance of machine learning was around 60\% of accuracy in estimating confidence levels. The result suggested that we need to focus on individual differences, modify experimental designs, and improve quality of data for future works.},

  abstract  = {The path planning of mobile robots is investigated to minimize energy loss in intelligent manufacturing. To achieve optimal energy consumption planning, this paper proposes a hybrid strategy that enhances the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and the genetic algorithm (GA). The WOA-GA algorithm combines their respective advantages and effectively mitigates premature convergence exhibited by the standard traditional algorithm. To enhance the global and local search capabilities of the standard WOA, we employ adaptive weighting and a Cauchy mutation strategy. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive crossover mutation probability and an elite strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of the genetic algorithm&#39;s evolutionary operation in the late iterations, thereby improving its performance. This paper compares the performance of the standard GA, the standard WOA-GA algorithm, and the enhanced WOA-GA algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced WOA-GA algorithm can achieve optimal energy-efficient path planning using the hybrid strategy. The average energy consumption of the enhanced WOA-GA algorithm can be reduced by 30\%, while the maximum energy consumption can be reduced by 47\%. The results confirm the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method in enhancing the level of green manufacturing.},

Sentiment analysis is a popularly adopted technique that involves applications across domains such as business, healthcare, government and marketing. Traditional sentiment analysis methods mainly focus on text contents. However, recent technological advancements have enabled the expression of opinions through different forms of media, such as images or audios, leading to sentiment analysis using multiple modalities rather than text alone. Multimodal sentiment analysis results in a more comprehensive understanding of the emotions and opinions expressed in a given content by combining information from different modalities. A model of multimodal sentiment analysis involves three main parts, namely, unimodal feature extraction, multimodal fusion and sentiment polarity prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of multimodal fusion methods along with their corresponding model architectures. Moreover, several more recently released models are introduced and the strengths and limitations of these models are discussed comparatively.

  abstract  = {Bias is a common problem in both human cognition and machine learning tasks. However, machines struggle more than humans with bias reduction, mainly because most algorithms rely on the assumption that the training data represent a full population in the real world. This assumption does not hold in most cases, i.e., collecting unbiased or representative data is challenging due to various factors such as sampling errors, human prejudices, and cultural differences. Therefore, bias mitigation has become an essential task in artifical intelligence. In recent years, significant progress has been made in improving the effectivess of debiasing, especially in computer vision. This paper provides a comprehensive review of de-biasing methods for neural networks trained on image data. Firstly, we present a formal defination of the bias mitigation problem and discuss some relevant topics. Moreover, we categorize the existing methods into three main types, namely, data-level methods that aim to balance or augment the training data, model-level methods that aim to modify or regularize the learning algorithms, and adversarial and ensembling approaches that use additional models to capture the biases present in data and to guide the training of the primary model. Finally, we conclude this survey and suggest potential research directions for the future.},

  abstract  = {Binary decomposition of a multi-class classification problem is a widely used method in the field of machine learning, which involves using an ensemble of binary classifiers to undertake multi-class classification tasks. The motivation of binary decomposition lies in two main aspects. Firstly, some learning algorithms such as support vector machine can not achieve directly learning a multi-class classifier. Secondly, in some cases, the adoption of binary decomposition for training an ensemble of binary classifiers can even achieve better performance than the direct learning of a multi-class classifier. There are some existing methods that can be applied in achieving binary decomposition and have been proven to be effective. Some of these methods may also be applied in other tasks beyond classification. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the development and applications of binary decomposition methods. Specifically, these methods are put into two categories, namely, ordered and unordered decomposition, which each is introduced in terms of the essence and strategies of decomposition. These methods are also compared through theoretical analysis of their effectiveness and efficiency. On the basis of the comparative analysis, we suggest some future directions towards achieving further advances in binary decomposition.},

In contrast to homogeneous data like image, audio and text, tabular data is usually heterogeneous and shows a small sample size and weak correlations between features. Besides, tabular data may contain not only numerical features but also categorical ones that can not be handled directly by the majority of those popular learning algorithms. The aforementioned characteristics make decision tree ensemble methods, such as random forests and gradient boosting trees, more suitable for processing tabular data than other models. In this context, it is essential to transform categorical features into numerical ones in the setting of category embedding. This paper surveys embedding methods for handling low-cardinality categorical features in tabular data. Specifically, these methods are put into two categories, namely, supervised and unsupervised encoding, which each is introduced in terms of the strategies of category encoding. Moreover, the characteristics of each method are summarized. On the basis of the summarization, further directions of category embedding are suggested within the setting of representation learning.},

  abstract  = {Multi-label text classification is a special type of natural language processing tasks, which is more complex than traditional single-label classification. Moreover, due to the key strength of pre-trained language models such as BERT in feature embedding at both token and sentence levels, transfer learning driven text classification has become increasingly popular. In this context, it is a commonly used strategy to take the output of the last layer of BERT as sentence embedding for text classification. However, the above-mentioned way of obtaining sentence embedding may not always be suitable for multi-label text classification, i.e., the best layer that leads to the optimal performance of classification may be varied for different labels, especially when a multi-label classification task is transformed into several binary ones. In order to address the aforementioned issue, we set a validation data driven way in this paper to explore the performance of sentence embedding obtained from each layer and adaptively select the best layer to output the sentence vector for each specific label. The experimental results show that using a sentence vector obtained from an intermediate layer may lead to better performance in comparison with simply taking the output of the last layer as the adopted sentence embedding. The results also indicate the effectiveness of the above-mentioned adaptive selection of the best layer in improving the performance of multi-label text classification.},

First, a pulsed laser system using a Quantel Brilliant Neodymium-Doped Yttrium Aluminum Darnet (Nd: YAG) laser with a pulse width of 5–6 ns and an F-theta lens is used to obtain a focused laser beam with a diameter of 0.2 mm. The laser system was employed to drill holes in a 3-mm-thick optical-grade acrylic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plate with high optical density and grade of OD 7+ @950~1085nm. Four major control factors for the laser system include laser pulse energy, focusing position offset, repetition rate, and drill time. Four drilled qualities include Drill roundness, Hillock, Taper, and HAZ. A total of 27 sets of experiments were performed using Taguchi&#39;s orthogonal arrays. After using 27 training data sets including input data and its output qualities, the average error using a back-propagation (BP) neural network was −3.82\% in the training process. The results show that the ANN model has the predictive ability to estimate laser drilling qualities for an Optical Grade PMMA.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the application of machine learning to Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) has emerged as a crucial area of research. While NIDS is critical in safeguarding our networks against cyber-attacks, it still faces limitations in detecting unknown attacks, such as 0-day attacks[1]. Furthermore, current NIDS technologies need high prediction accuracy, high recall rates, and low false alarm rates. However, imbalanced datasets for NIDS have resulted in low recall rates. To address this issue, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm-based mechanism (RLAM) to improve the performance of network-based intrusion detection on imbalanced datasets. We verify the effectiveness of RLAM by applying it to improving the performance of the Neural Network and Decision Tree. Experimental results demonstrated that RLAM significantly improved the recall rate of a critical-and-important (CAI) minor class (U2R) in KDD-CUP99 datasets without sacrificing the performance measures of the other classes. Notably, the enhanced decision tree algorithm outperformed all the existing intrusion detection algorithms in terms of overall accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The shape and orientation of the blade of wind turbines (WTs) play a significant role in energy yield from wind turbines. This work proposes optimizing the aerodynamic design of the blade shape (B_Shape) of the horizontally orientated wind turbines (HOWT) to enhance its annual energy production taking into consideration the available wind resources at Ras Munif, Jordan. The optimized design considers the B_Shape parameters, which include the chord length and twist angle (CL &amp; TA), maximum allowable annual energy production (AEP), and rotor speed. The Weibull probability distribution function (WPDF), and “scale and shape parameters of 2.218 and 6.278 m/s, correspondingly” were utilized as input for the optimized design in addition to the statistical wind conditions. “NREL-20 kW HWT” was used in the experimental study to verify and validate the design&#39;s reliability and effectiveness. The “horizontally oriented rotor performance optimization (HORP_Opt)”, and “National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, CO, USA” were improved with construction indicators relating to “nominal revolving velocity”, “B_Shape, and “pitch angle”. The pitch angle stayed unchanged at 0° whilst increasing wind velocity increases rotational speed to the level of 104.74 rpm at the base speed. According to the optimized WT, the annual energy production achieved was 36011 kWh/yr.},

In recent years, the advancements in deep reinforcement learning have provided new possibilities for solving VRP. This paper proposes a novel approach for solving VRP using a Transformer-based deep reinforcement learning framework with an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder utilizes a Transformer model to encode the VRP problem, while the decoder incorporates the positional information of the nodes that have already been visited as input and generates a sequence of nodes to be visited as the output solution. Finally, the entire model is trained using reinforcement learning. Experimental results demonstrate that that the GAP value of our model in CRP20 has decreased to 0.705\%, which is more stable than other models and has a much faster solving speed than the heuristic model.},

However, existing models often overlook the varying effects of meta-paths on target nodes, even when they share the same relationship type. This limitation makes it difficult to accurately represent heterogeneous structures. To solve this issue, we introduce FHGCN, a novel Fine-tuned Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network that leverages structural information and attribute semantics to enrich the learned node embedding and improve the final performance. The model consists of two parts: A fine-tuned multi-relation aggregation module which automatically learns the weights of heterogeneous relations and further deduces the significance of meta-paths by considering the distinct fluctuation in the impact of meta-paths generated by the same relation. And a multilayer convolutional module which can learn valuable interactions between heterogeneous meta-paths of different lengths to obtain favorable node representation node embedding. Node classification experiments on two heterogeneous graph datasets show that FHGCN has a good predictive ability.},

In this paper, an innovative humanoid robot is designed and evaluated to address specific challenges and assess the ability of children with ASD in affective imitative expression. The robot, with its meticulously designed mechanical and hardware structure, incorporates an assessment protocol for affective imitative expression and algorithms for assessing affective expression abilities. It utilizes several specially designed assessment metrics to generate a uniquely tailored assessment scale for affective imitative expression. A preliminary experiment involving ten neurotypical adults has been conducted to validate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed system.

This study employs the principle of three-way decision to divide all the object granules of a formal context into three parts: positive, negative and boundary regions, then two groups of certainty decision rules are extracted from the positive region and the negative region, and one group of possibility decision rules is induced from the boundary region. The notion of attribute reduction keeping the performance of the decision rules unchanged are proposed.

However, the interpretability of the prediction has become a barrier for the clinical use. To enhance the trustworthiness of ML systems, this paper integrates the trust score framework with the existing ECG classification. At present, the trust score framework is effective for low-dimensional data, but it does not offer significant enhancement over the model confidence for feature spaces with high dimensions. Moreover, the ECG data is a time series data with duration about one or half minute with sampling time about 3 ms. In other words, each signal usually contains several thousand or more sample points. As a result, this paper investigated effect of six popular dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques, including linear and kernel-based principal component analysis (KPCA), independent component analysis (ICA), Autoencoder, uniform manifold Approximation and projection (UMAP), and local linear embedded (LLE). The experimental results showed that UMAP with 2 dimensions can achieve result as well as ICA with 25 dimensions in tracking the model tendency and the other four DR methods has better performance with 25 dimensions.},

  abstract  = {The text-to-SQL task is a realistic and challenging job, which aims to translate natural language questions into corresponding SQL queries. When attempting to generate SQL queries in the text-to-SQL task, prevailing semantic parsing models employ beam search to generate several candidates. Based on our pilot study, we observe that the gold-standard SQL answer may exist in the n-best candidate list produced by the decoder, rather than the first. Hence, we aim to lift the correct answer given several candidates generated by semantic parsing models for text-to-SQL. To this end, we propose a reranking module that reorders the n-best list of candidate SQL queries by pair-wise hinge loss. Meanwhile, a data augmentation module is leveraged to enrich the inadequate training instances for providing candidates with better qualities. These two modules can be easily grafted onto text-to-SQL backbone networks, and extensive experiments on the cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark Spider demonstrate that our method achieves 73.8\% in accuracy on the Spider dataset, surpassing the base model by up to 3.5\%.},

The approach combines the advantages of BERT models and graph convolutional neural networks, incorporating the advantages of large-scale data training and conductive learning to perform natural language processing tasks. The model in this paper compresses the BERT model in the pre-training phase and then fuses it with GCN. The model reduces the model complexity in the pre-training phase and optimizes the problem of resource constraints when dealing with large-scale data. In this paper, four Public benchmark datasets are used to test the model. The model accuracy is higher than the original baseline model.},

We extend a method proposed by Berthier et al. [1] that abstracts the latent representations of a Deep Neural Network as a Bayesian Network (BN). To this end, we first construct a classifier based on the abstract BN by including a new node and some edges from the nodes of the BN to the new node. We then analyse the robustness of the resulting BN prediction models using a test dataset with crafted perturbations. Empirical experiments confirm that traditional BN inference approximates the Deep Neural Network prediction performance while outperforming it in an adversarial setting. Since the created classifiers are abstractions of the original neural network, our results enable the construction of meaningful abstractions with decent accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract  = {The goal of aspect-based multimodal sentiment analysis (ABMSA) is to classify the sentiment associated with aspect words in a given context. Most current ABMSA models focus only on general inter-modal information interactions without considering both intra-modal and inter-modal information interactions and ignoring image noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes an Interactive Attention Mechanism Fusion Network (IAMFN) model. The model first designs an image-text fusion module based on the attention, which applies the attention mechanism to a recurrent neural network to fuse text and images while filtering the noise in the images, and finally adds the fused information to the aspect information step by step to obtain the dynamic inter-modal representation. In addition, this paper proposes an aspect-text fusion module based on the attention, which learns the intra-modal contextual representation by calculating the weights of each aspect word in the context. Finally, this paper stitches the information obtained from the two modules and feeds it into the fully connected softmax layers to predict sentiment polarity. We have conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and the experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

First, the mimicry properties of butterflies make it difficult to detect the butterflies out of the background. Second, the folding or overlapping of their wings make it very demanding to learn features for identifying butterfly species. Third, identifying butterfly species is a fine-grained and multi-class classification problem. To address the aforementioned challenges, the plug and play module referred to MRFB (Multi-Receptive Field Block) is proposed. Subsequently, the MRFB-net is developed by integrating the MRFB module into the RFB net framework. This innovative network demonstrates the capability to simultaneously detect butterflies of varying sizes by leveraging distinct receptive field blocks within MRFB module to learn features of butterflies. As a result, these advancements effectively address the challenges encountered in identifying butterfly species from images captured in field environments. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of the MRFB-net in identifying butterfly species. Comparatively, it outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithm in this specific task, establishing itself as the current leading model for butterfly species identification from field images.},

  abstract  = {Graph Attention Network (GAT) is a popular method for graph embedding as they effectively leverage attention mechanisms to aggregate first-order neighborhood node information. However, they have limitations in their ability to consider high-order neighborhood nodes and structural information. Directly incorporating high-order neighborhood node information into traditional GAT may result in over-smoothing. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a joint attention graph embedding model based on similar networks and structural correlation. secondly, we introduce the concept of structural correlation to the original graph attentional method, and consider not only node content feature but also joint node topological structure feature when calculating the attention score. Finally, the graph attention mechanism module performs feature extraction to generate embedding representations of the nodes. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 85.7\%, 74.30\%, and 84.10\% on the Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets respectively in node classification tasks. This represents an improvement of 2.70\%, 3.94\%, and 2.60\% respectively compared to the traditional graph attention model. It can be seen that the proposed method can obtain a better representation of node embedding.},

We incorporate the structural information of the dataset into the ESN by using the Takagi-Sugeno (TS) models/rules concept. The process of obtaining the structural information in the dataset was fully automated by the unimodal density based membership function, which then acts as the antecedent part. Subsequently, a consequent part composed by ESN was used to replace the affine models commonly used in TS models. The final model predictions are inferred by the fuzzy-weighed mechanism in a new fuzzy rule composed of multiple ESNs. Since our algorithm is fully automatic and does not require any prior knowledge, its use in online learning scenarios is adequately applicable. Lastly, the effectiveness of the algorithm is tested using the HHAR dataset and an accuracy of 42.9\% was obtained. Compared with the performance of recent Autonomous Learning Multi-Model Systems (19.6\%), our algorithm has gained a significant improvement.},

In this work, we first re-evaluate three state-of-the-art adversarial pruning methods, showing that their robustness was indeed overestimated. We then compare pruned and dense versions of the same models, discovering that samples on thin ice, i.e., closer to the unpruned model&#39;s decision boundary, are typically misclassified after pruning. We conclude by discussing how this intuition may lead to designing more effective adversarial pruning methods in future work.},

Road damage detection is critical in intelligent automobile driving and has been developed for a long time. The early detection method is to detect by embedding several sensors in the car. In recent years, deep learning methods have also been gradually applied in the research of pavement damage detection. This paper mainly takes road damage detection based on the YOLOv8 by comparing it to YOLOv5 and multiple pre-train models of YOLOv8. This paper describes the solution using YOLO to detect the various types of road damage in the Crowdsensing-based Road Damage Detection Challenge (CRDDC&#39;2022). The dataset is separated into training, validation, and test sets. The medium and large pre-train models of YOLOv8 have the highest mAP and F1-score at 0.62 and 0.61, respectively. YOLOv8 of the small and medium pre-train model provides better performance than YOLOv5. For comparing YOLOv8, the performance of the large pre-train model is better than the others, but it is not much different from the medium pre-train model. For this reason, the medium pre-train model may be suitable for the real-time problem as it does not take time for training.},

Nevertheless, we argue that the noise introduced by DP mechanisms may inadvertently give rise to a novel poisoning threat, specifically in the context of private knowledge sharing during CMARL, which remains unexplored in the literature. To address this shortcoming, we present an adaptive, privacy-exploiting, and evasion-resilient localized poisoning attack (PeLPA) that capitalizes on the inherent DP-noise to circumvent anomaly detection systems and hinder the optimal convergence of the CMARL model. We rigorously evaluate our proposed PeLPA attack in diverse environments, encompassing both non-adversarial and multiple-adversarial contexts. Our findings reveal that, in a medium-scale environment, the PeLPA attack with attacker ratios of 20\% and 40\% can lead to an increase in average steps to goal by 50.69\% and 64.41\%, respectively. Furthermore, under similar conditions, PeLPA can result in a 1.4x and 1.6x computational time increase in optimal reward attainment and a 1.18x and 1.38x slower convergence for attacker ratios of 20\% and 40\%, respectively.},

This paper starts with an overview of the current state of industrial knowledge graph development and shows how to construct an industrial knowledge graph (IKG). Following that, we provide a thorough and in-depth review of various industrial scenarios supported by knowledge graphs. Furthermore, this paper identifies the current challenges confronting industrial applications and proposes future research directions for IKG.

  abstract  = {Time series forecasting has been used extensively in different fields (e.g., audio signal/real-time video processing, stock price prediction, workload projection). Traditional time series models have difficulties in handling the complexity and non-linearity in high dimensional time-series data. In this work, we combine truncated WaveNet framework with TimeGrad process to provide probabilistic multi-step forecasting for high dimensional time series data. Dilated causal convolutional neural network (DC-CNN), skip connections, and residual networks are the major components of WaveNet framework. DC-CNN and residual networks are used to extract the trend and short-term movement information from time series data and solve the degradation problem, respectively. TimeGrad process functioned as generating probabilistic forecast that provide confidence information of the predictions. The experimental results on six large real-world datasets demonstrate that WaveNet+TimeGrad model performed better (lower CRPSsum value) than the benchmark models and previous WaveNet+ $t$ model. WaveNet+TimeGrad probabilistic model performed especially well (higher accuracy, less memory resource consumption) with “Direct Method” when the dimension of time series data becomes larger.},

Nevertheless, Graph Neural Networks (GNN) tends to lose its efficiency as the depth increases. In this paper we propose a technique to alleviate this problem by building on the existing GNN architecture. In effect, we installed a gating mechanism to overcome the propagation of noise information across the layers and trained the model using a proximal policy optimization (PPO), a policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm. We trained the proposed model on a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) datasets generated on the fly. We used an encoder-decoder framework where the encoder learns the representation of the graph structured CVRP instance and the decoder learns to construct an optimal route based on the reward function designed. According to experiments using randomly generated test instances, the proposed model produces better results than the current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods to solve CVRP. To confirm the performance of our model, we also tested using locally generated real-world data parsed from digital maps. The results affirms that our model performs well in both random instance testing and real-world instance testing.},

This protein impairs certain mechanisms of information processing in the brain, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which play a critical role in the development of the disease. The exact mechanism underlying this effect is not yet known. In this study, a computational model is used to investigate the effect of blocking various potassium channels on the impairment of LTP and LTD during the early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The results suggest that the blockage of specific potassium channels during the early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s disease can lead to a reduction in LTP and an increase in LTD induction in dentate granule cells, which accelerates the development of the disease. These findings have implications for the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.},

In the 2MSLS, two models (subsystems) are contained: the reduction model and the evolution model, which are governed by neural partial differential equations. The information “particles” diffusion process is described by evolution model, hence the evolution model is equivalent to the generative model. And the particles condensate process is described by reduction model, which is equivalent to the inference model. In order to optimize 2MSLS, we propose a novel optimization scheme, named Maxwell&#39;s demon technique (MDT). The MDT is applied to decrease system entropy, and it is a integrated technique which includes Bayesian pseudoinverse learners, pseudoinverse learning algorithm for autoencoders, probabilistic principle component analysis. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed 2MSLS has stronger interpretability with statistical physics image. And the MDT has a great efficiency in optimization compared with Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling methods. This work is of significance in that it presents a clear view of interpretable deep neural networks with statistical physics perspective, and paves the road to physical artificial intelligence.},

In this paper, we choose local neighborhood rough sets as the representative model, and then propose Local Weighted Neighborhood Rough Sets (LWNRS). First, the importance of attributes to decisions is quantified by combining the supervised information of labeled data and the structural information of unlabeled data, and an attribute weighted method based on semi-supervised dynamic optimization is proposed. Meanwhile, the weighted neighborhood relation and neighborhood classes of objects are defined under weakly labeled data, and the WLNRS model is constructed. In addition, the weighted dependency is proposed to measure the data uncertainty, and the relationships among WLNRS and other relevant local and global models are deeply explored. Finally, the efficiency and accuracy of WLNRS in concept approximation are verified by comparison.},

  abstract  = {Accurately estimating population density is a crucial component of policy-making for the development of any country. Traditionally, population density has been estimated through labor-intensive surveys that can be time-consuming and prone to error. Census data, while useful, is only collected once every 10 years or so and can take a long time to process, depending on the geography and population of the region. This makes it difficult for organizations that require up-to-date population density information for instant policy designing. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to estimate population density using satellite imagery. Our method leverages the correlation between car density and population density. Specifically, we validate this assumption by counting cars over Dubai city using a Faster RCNN object detector with a ResNeXt-101 ( $32\times 8d$ )-FP backbone and calculating the correlation between car density and population density. Our results show a significant value of the Pearson correlation coefficient, demonstrating a strong relationship between population density and car density. This innovative approach allows for the rapid estimation of population density, without the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive surveys.},

Specifically, we first construct another view of data through augmentation. Then, the deep subspace clustering networks (DSC-Nets) are used to learn the self-expressive coefficients of data and its augmentation, which further interact with each other by contrastive learning. Moreover, a dissimilarity matrix is formulated based on the latent feature of data to further calibrate the noisy connections in the self-expressive coefficient. And we also utilize the relevant similarity matrix contributing to the multi-positive contrasitve learning, which ameliorates the cluster-collapse problem of representation. Experimental results on several data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

This paper presents an Unsupervised Community Discovery Algorithm based on reconstructed graph neural network (UCDA) to resolve the above issues. To be specific, this paper proposes a framework that learns the representation based on network structure and attribute information. By designing input network features, encoders, decoders, this algorithm uses an unsupervised loss function to train neural networks to extract communities in an integrated way. These designs integrate higher-order modularity information with network features and use variational graph auto-encoders to train data end-to-end under the graph neural network framework. Based on a series of experiments with a wide range of datasets and advanced algorithms, UCDA has achieved superior performance and shows strong competitiveness. Finally, the last section reports the results analysis, t-SNE visualization and hyperparameter analysis, which depicts stable performance and powerful network modularity ability.},

Currently, the field of hydrogen energy safety monitoring is rapidly advancing, yet few researchers have proposed appropriate solutions to address system failures. This challenge arises from the complex and interconnected nature of hydrogen energy systems. Furthermore, unlike other energy sources, hydrogen is highly combustible and explosive, and susceptible to leaks, necessitating the consideration of multiple factors. In this context, reinforcement learning, a machine learning control technology renowned for its robust decision-making abilities, has garnered considerable interest among researchers. To date, however, reinforcement learning has not been applied in the field of hydrogen safety. This paper provides a concise introduction to several commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms, analyzes the various fault types and fault diagnosis modes of hydrogen energy, and highlights the adequacy and necessity of reinforcement learning in the field of hydrogen energy. Furthermore, this paper outlines a new research direction that can pave the way for future developments in hydrogen safety.},

Then the global feature learning is obtained by constructing attention mechanisms from Transformer and local feature learning is captured by convolution and pooling operators, thereby forming the GLConv by fusing these two features to further explore the long-distance dependency of point clouds.

  abstract  = {The opportunity to develop low-cost, accurate and automatic pain recognition systems that utilizes low resolution ECG data to improve pain recognition is vital for healthcare and medical research. Current works on pain analysis use high resolution equipments to collect data and rely on patients&#39; subjective pain sensation. This mostly ignores individuals interoceptive accuracy which can be unreliable and impractical especially when people cannot verbally report on their pain. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that incorporates an artificial denoising auto-encoder-decoder system to automatically generate and select applicable signifiers directly from ECG data. We also extract state of the art statistical, inter-beat interval, heart rate variability, and heart rate features from the data. We then concurrently optimize both manually extracted features and the Deep Artificial Denoising Auto-Encoder-Decoder (DADAED) features and perform a binary classification of pain threshold and pain tolerance. Our work is finally assessed on a BioVid Heat Pain Database (Part B). The simultaneous optimization approach of the deep neural techniques introduces trainable weighted parameters and generates latent representation. This outperforms previously proposed methods on the same database and other related works on pain recognition. Our pain recognition system has the potential to revolutionize the pain management industry, emotion regulation industry, and mental health centers.},

  abstract  = {Recent application of machine learning models have shown great potential in reflectivity inversion of seismic data. However, existing methods usually focus on the framework of network and rarely do systematic analysis of the influences of input data or post-process the network outputs. To address these issues, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with physical constraint modifier model. First, the physical convolution model is used to generate seismic data according to reflectivity. The data size is deliberately controlled to enable efficient processing and effective information preserving. Random noises are added to the synthetic data as well to simulate realistic field data better and test the robustness of the model. Second, a supervised CNN framework is designed to train with these data. The network employs the convolution layer with padding technique such that each layer has equal size. Finally, a physical constraint modifier consisting of a threshold filer and a wavelet modifier is designed to post-process the network output. It exploits the non-sparseness of reflectivity and physical characteristics of wavelet to improve the final prediction accuracy. The experiments demonstrate that the model we proposed has good stability and prediction performance.},

In this study, we propose a novel approach for building extraction called ReUnet, which combines the residual network and U-net image segmentation network. This model utilizes the skeleton of U-net and the residual units of Resnet to address the issue of gradient diffusion during feature extraction in traditional U-net networks. The residual structure of ReUnet simplifies the training of deep networks and promotes information propagation. We evaluate our network using the LEVIR-CD dataset and compare it with three advanced deep learning-based methods for remote sensing building extraction, namely PSnet, U-net, and Resnet. The proposed method outperforms all compared methods in terms of its ability to accurately extract buildings. Overall, our results suggest that ReUnet is a promising approach for building extraction from remote sensing images.},

  abstract  = {With the advent of deep reinforcement learning, we witness the spread of novel autonomous driving agents that learn how to drive safely among humans. However, skilled attackers might steer the decision-making process of these agents through minimal perturbations applied to the readings of their hardware sensors. These force the behavior of the victim agent to change unexpectedly, increasing the likelihood of crashes by inhibiting its braking capability or coercing it into constantly changing lanes. To counter these phenomena, we propose a detector that can be mounted on autonomous driving cars to spot the presence of ongoing attacks. The detector first profiles the agent&#39;s behavior without attacks by looking at the representation learned during training. Once deployed, the detector discards all the decisions that deviate from the regular driving pattern. We empirically highlight the detection capabilities of our work by testing it against unseen attacks deployed with increasing strength.},

Resampling is one of the most commonly used techniques for handling the imbalance issue by preprocessing the multi-label dataset. Previous studies in traditional single-label learning show that the minority samples located at the borderline are easy to be misclassified, thus cloning them can help improving the performance of the classifier. However, the importance of these samples are overlooked in existing multi-label resampling methods. This paper proposes a multi-label oversampling method based on borderline. We provide a delineation of the minority borderline samples based on their nearest neighbors, and propose a dangerous rate to reflect the risk of a borderline sample being misclassified, which is used to determine the frequency of cloning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive, which significantly enhances the classification performance.},

In this paper, we propose a new proactive defense method based on a two-stage training procedure in order to enhance the adversarial robustness of DNNs. The first stage intends to map the input samples into a feature embedding space with high separability, while the second stage fixes the feature generator and learns the parameters only for the last layer for classification. Different from most of the existing state-of-the-art methods, our method neither spends extensive costs to generate adversarial information, nor constructs a complex penalty function to force the model satisfying specific restrictions under subjective assumptions. Instead, our method cuts off the interactions between the parameter updating for the deep feature generator and the classifier, discovers the relationship between adversarial robustness and separability in embedding space, results in a better interpretability. Substantial experiments on various network structures deployed on benchmark data sets including MNIST, FASHION MNIST and CIFAR10 and their adversary from different attacks demonstrate the rationality of our method.},

Most existing algorithms are difficult to guarantee the fidelity of the signal when denoising. In this paper, we design a self-attention progressive seismic data denoising (SAPD) algorithm under the encoding-decoding framework to handle this issue. First, we use residual channel attention blocks (RCABs) to mitigate information loss through feature weighting. Specifically, they are used in three places, namely before the encoder, between convolutional layers and between skip connections. Second, we apply the supervised attention module (SAM) to re-weight local features to achieve information exchange between two stages. Finally, we design a penalty term according to the SNR of the residual. This penalty term balances noise suppression and signal protection. Publicly available synthetic and field data are employed to test the validity of the new algorithm. Three popular algorithms are used for comparison, including f-x deconvolution (FXDECON), wavelet transform, and DnCNN. The results show the advantages of the proposed method in terms of effective signal protection and noise suppression.},

To create rich model diversity, we propose a novel training method for ensemble bilinear models (EBM) for the problem of knowledge graph completion. EBM uses a weighted loss to allow individual KGE models to interact during training. In this way, the relations in the knowledge graph can be automatically modeled by the most appropriate model from the KGE individual ones. The experiments on knowledge graph completion show that EBM has richer diversity and performs better than the single bilinear model and the ensemble methods without interaction.},
