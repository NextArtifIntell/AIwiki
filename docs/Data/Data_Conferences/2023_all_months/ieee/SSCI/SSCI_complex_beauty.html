  abstract  = {Recognising and reacting to change in non-stationary data-streams is a challenging task. The majority of research in this area assumes that the true class label of incoming points are available, either at each time step or intermittently with some latency. In the worse case this latency approaches infinity and we can assume that no labels are available beyond the initial training set. When change is expected and no further training labels are provided the challenge of maintaining a high classification accuracy is very great. The challenge is to propagate the original training information through several timesteps, possibly indefinitely, while adapting to underlying change in the data-stream. In this paper we conduct an initial study into the effectiveness of using an evolving, population-based approach as the mechanism for adapting to change. An ensemble of one-class-classifiers is maintained for each class. Each classifier is considered as an agent in the sub-population and is subject to selection pressure to find interesting areas of the feature space. This selection pressure forces the ensemble to adapt to the underlying change in the data-stream.},

Further, it has been shown that the simplex hyperparameter optimization (SHO) method can also improve neuroevolution (NE) performance by optimizing neural network training hyperparameters while the NE algorithm also trains and designs neural networks. This work provides an extensive examination of combining island repopulation events with five different island-based variations of SHO. These methods are evaluated for the evolution of recurrent neural networks for the challenging problem of multivariate time series forecasting on two real world datasets. We show with statistical significance that adding repopulation to the SHO variants in almost every case improves performance, and for those that does there is no statistical difference. In addition, we find that one variant in particular, multi-island, random island best genome (MIRIB) performs the best across all experiment types.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, there has been a rise in popularity of using evolutionary algorithms (EA&#39;s) in conjunction with artificial neural networks (ANN&#39;s). This approach is commonly known as NeuroEvolution (NE). NeuroEvolutionary approaches typically optimize just the weights of an ANN or optimize the architecture, learning rates, thresholds, and weights together. Algorithms capable of the latter are known as Topological and Weight Evolving ANN (TWEANN). One such TWEANN is Gene Expression Programming for Neural Networks (GEPNN). This paper presents an empirical investigation of the network topologies that arise when GEPNN is used and whether evolved architectures have any relation to state of the art architectures. Results show that GEPNN naturally discovers powerful structural motifs such as shortcut connections and also creates sparse networks. Both these schemas have been shown to be advantageous in deep learning techniques. As an additional contribution from this work, we provide an open source library for developing GEPNN solutions in Python.},

From an optimization standpoint, a NAS task for a given search space can be viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) when considering multiple design criteria simultaneously (e.g., prediction accuracy, architecture complexity, hardware efficiency). However, whether a NAS problem is a multimodal multi-objective optimization problem or not (i.e., whether a single non-dominated solution in the objective space has multiple different neural network architectures or not) has not been examined in the literature. This presents an intriguing research question that merits further investigation. To fill this gap, we examine the multimodal nature of seven multi-objective NAS problems. By doing so, this work aims to help MOP researchers to better understand the characteristics of the multi-objective NAS problems.},

  abstract  = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the creation of Artificial Neural Networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), lessening the reliance on labour-intensive manual design by human experts. A CNN architecture can be decomposed into a micro- and macro-architecture, each influenced by distinct design and optimisation strategies to con-tribute to the overall construction and performance of the CNN. Cellular Encoding (CE), an evolutionary computation technique, has been successfully used to represent diverse network topologies of varying complexities. Recently, CE has been applied to evolve CNN architectures, showing promising results. However, current CE-based NAS approaches focus on evolving either the micro-or macro-architectures without considering the evolution of both in the same algorithm. Evolving the micro- and macro-architecture together can increase the performance of evolved CNN architectures. This research introduces a novel two-stage hybrid approach, combining Genetic Algorithms (GA) and CE to evolve both the micro- and macro-architectures to synthesise CNNs for classification tasks. Candidate macro-architectures are evolved using a CE approach, while a GA approach is used to explore the micro-architecture search space. The proposed algorithm is evaluated across four commonly used datasets and compared against six NAS peer competitors and five state-of-the-art manually designed CNN architectures. The results validate the approach&#39;s high competitiveness, outperforming several peer competitors on image and text classification tasks.},

This platform is based on a mathematical programming formulation and an efficient solution approach. Forwarders are middlemen who procure container capacities from carriers and sell them to shippers to serve their transport requests. However, due to demand uncertainty, they often either over-procure or under-procure capacities. We address this with our proposed platform where forwarders can collaborate and share capacities, allowing one&#39;s transport requests to be potentially shipped on another forwarder&#39;s container. The result is lower total costs for all participating forwarders. The collaboration can be formulated as an integer linear program we call the Freight Forwarders&#39; Collaboration Problem (FFCP). It is a variant of the bin-packing problem, hence it is NP-Hard. In order to solve large-scale FFCP instances efficiently, we propose a two-step approach involving an initial greedy assignment followed by a fine-tuning step. Computational experiments have shown that our approach can offer a significant reduction of run-time between 77\% and 97\%, without any loss of solution quality.},

  abstract  = {There is urgency for electrifying fleet vehicles as a means to reach net-zero emissions and promote sustainability, including at maritime container ports. Ports are exploring the incorporation of electric terminal tractors and supporting infras-tructure in an effort to minimize the environmental effects of their operations while simultaneously improving service performance. The challenges include planning of investments in infrastructure that will meet charging requirements of these terminal tractors while maintaining operational efficiencies. This paper develops an optimization and associated risk register for strategic capacity expansion of electric vehicle fleets at maritime container ports. The approach includes multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and a characterization of enterprise risk as a disruption of system order. A demonstration of schedule optimization uses linear program-ming models for thirty-two combinations of plug-in, wireless, and wireless dynamic charging infrastructure configurations to determine optimal charger locations. In a robust ensemble model, the optimization accompanies a comprehensive risk analysis that disrupts importance orders across seven scenarios: (1) Environ-mental Change, (2) Policy Revision, (3) Technology Innovation, (4) Cyber Attack, (5) Market Shift, (6) Electrical Grid Stress, and (7) Workforce Interruption. The results support the decisions and enterprise risk management for a $1.5 billion strategic plan for port infrastructure. The plan involves selecting charging station locations, determining charging schedules, and selecting charger models while considering multiple performance criteria such as safety, operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. The approach is generally applicable for a variety of complex systems to mitigate schedule and cost risks while improving sustainability. The audience of the paper includes owners and operators of transportation and energy infrastructures, asset managers, logistics service providers, and others.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic Berth Allocation Problem (DBAP) is an essential problem in container terminal operations. Most studies focus on discrete or continuous berths in DBAP. However, affected by the geographical conditions, the mixture of discrete and continuous berths which are called hybrid berths often appear in real port container terminals. Moreover, the arrival time of vessels is often fluctuant due to the influence of environmental factors. To solve such a Dynamic Hybrid Berth Allocation Problem (DHBAP) under vessels&#39; arrival delay, this study develops a proactive-reactive approach. Specifically, we establish a mixed-integer programming model with a buffer as the proactive strategy to obtain a baseline schedule. Then, we propose a hybrid berth reactive strategy (HBRS) to adjust the baseline schedule for vessels that are delayed. To get a better solution in a short time, a genetic algorithm is designed. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed HBRS by comparing it with the most commonly used right-shift strategy. Experimental results show that the longer the buffer is, the better the robustness of the model is, but the total time of the vessel in terminals will also increase. Compared with the right-shift strategy, the proposed HBRS can obtain an allocation plan with similar robustness in a shorter total time of the vessel in terminals.},

  abstract  = {For the truck appointment system in a container terminal, optimizing the configuration of gate lane and yard crane based on the appointment information is the key to shorten the external truck waiting time and reduce the redundancy of terminal resource. A hybrid approach combining deep neural network and optimization model is proposed. The deep neural network is applied to predict the truck waiting time in the yard based on the yard data. The optimization configuration model for gate lane and yard crane is established by combining the predicted result. The average waiting time of trucks, the configuration of gate lanes and yard cranes before and after optimization are compared. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which also provides a new road map for optimizing container terminal resource configuration.},

  abstract  = {In sea-road intermodal container terminals, the integrated scheduling problem for the multi-stage transshipment system (ISP _ MST _ CT) is influenced by factors such as the number of containers, multi-stage interactions, and various types of equipment, making it challenging to construct the model. Additionally, assigning an appropriate number of AGVs to the transshipment tasks can significantly avoid resource waste at the terminals. This paper, for the first time, considers the ISP _MST_CT of quay cranes, AGVs, yard cranes, and external trucks, encompassing four operational stages. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to simultaneously optimize the maximum completion time, total energy consumption of quay cranes and yard cranes, and total waiting time of AGV s. The nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) algorithm is employed to solve this problem. The experiment results validate that NSGAII is capable of efficiently solving ISP _ MST _ CT of different scales and obtaining superior solutions within a short time. Furthermore, a series of experiments with 20 containers demonstrates that 8 AGVs can keep the balance among the three optimization objectives, while reducing the waste of AGVs and providing valuable insights to terminal managers.},

  abstract  = {Despite the significant achievements in the development of automation technologies, the application of autonomous robots to improve the production efficiency of small-scale indus-tries has been largely ignored. While there has been excellent progress in industrial image processing systems implementation, most of the work has focused on a unique aspect of specific objects rather than introducing a general inspection system. Thus, this paper discusses the critical industrial topic of quality control, which develops rapidly through the use of autonomous systems. Given the high cost of implementing automated systems, this paper presents an affordable low-budget solution for the visual inspection system. This method of inspecting screw dimensions consists of four visual inspection parts and a special mechanical supporting structure. The designed system was able to check the overall screw dimensions, including screw head diameter, screw head driven type, screw length, screw thread length, and screw head thickness. It could also separate the qualified screws from the unqualified ones after the inspection process. The accuracy of most inspection cases is 100\%, meaning the error ranges within 0.1mm, which meets all the non-negotiable requirements and most of the target requirements. The visual inspection parts can be further enhanced by building a template matching library that includes different angles of the screw head or by using Hough Transform to identify the defect types of the screw thread.},

  abstract  = {The utilization of computational intelligence, particularly Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for fault detection is of paramount importance as it empowers industries to proactively identify anomalies, leading to improved system reliability, reduced downtime, and enhanced safety. By leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of ANNs, complex data patterns indicative of faults can be accurately identified and analyzed in real-time, enabling early intervention and preventing potential catastrophic failures. Additionally, the importance of fault detection in refrigeration systems lies in its ability to proactively identify and address potential issues, ensuring optimal performance, energy efficiency, and longevity of the system while preventing costly breakdowns and ensuring product safety and quality. The main aim of this study is to create a computational intelligence model that can accurately depict the energy and exergy performance of a GAX hybrid refrigeration system. Moreover, the model aims to identify potential instrument failures occurring at different parts of the system. The primary findings indicate that creating a numerical database using the governing equations of the GAX system enables the identification of anomalies in the instrumental measurements of operating parameters. Subsequent research aims to incorporate experimental data from a broader range of parameters, encompassing additional sections of the GAX system.},

  abstract  = {A complex system that is governed by several smaller sub-systems whose coordinated functionality allows it to work properly over time can be challenging to analyze for faults on real time by an observer; moreover, if such failing system could work with no obvious signs of fault over time until it becomes catastrophic and clearly identifiable. Because the variables involved in such system&#39;s functionality are usually not easily correlated, the different time-series they might generate can be extremely difficult to analyze by conventional means. Lately, 2-dimensional Convoluted Neural Networks (2D-CNN) have been used to introduce artificial intelligence into diagnosis and fault detection with success; however, the systems that so far have benefited from this are mainly those that deal with images, like medical diagnosis using x-ray images, or autonomous driving using real time pictures, although recently, some resent research on robotic sensor fault and signal analysis have been published using 1-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) for time-domain signals. This paper proposes a novel 2D-CNN approach to fault identification of an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear system; by recognizing features that are consistent with a fault in a signal-image of several layers. With such signal-image being an artificial picture created by combining all the system signals in a single high-layered image format that is recognizable by a conventional 2D-CNN. This paper also includes the results of its applicability in a fault identification of a three-phase induction motor in a simulation environment and with measurements of a real motor with injected faults.},

  abstract  = {The current advances in generative artificial intelligence for learning large neural network models with the capability to produce essays, images, music and even 3D assets from text prompts create opportunities for a manifold of disciplines. In the present paper, we study the potential of deep text-to-3D models in the engineering domain and focus on the chances and challenges when integrating and interacting with 3D assets in computational simulation-based design optimization. In contrast to traditional design optimization of 3D geometries that often searches for the optimum designs using numerical representations, e.g. B-Spline surfaces, natural language challenges the optimization framework by requiring a different interpretation of variation operators while at the same time may ease and motivate the human user interaction. Here, we propose and realize a fully automated evolutionary design optimization framework using Shap-E, a recently published text-to-3D asset network by OpenAI, in the context of aerodynamic vehicle optimization. For representing text prompts in the evolutionary optimization, we evaluate (a) a bag-of-words approach based on prompt templates and Wordnet samples, and (b) a tokenisation approach based on prompt templates and the byte pair encoding method from GPT4. In our experiments, we show the text-based representations allow the optimizer to find better performing designs. However, it is important to ensure that the designs generated from prompts are within the object class of application, i.e. diverse and novel designs need to be realistic. Furthermore, more research is required to develop methods where the strength of text prompt variations and the resulting variations of the 3D designs share causal relations to some degree to improve the optimization.},

  abstract  = {Multi-agent systems can be prone to failures during the execution of a mission, depending on different circumstances, such as the harshness of the environment they are deployed in. As a result, initially devised plans for completing a mission may no longer be feasible, and a re-planning process needs to take place to re-allocate any pending tasks. There are two main approaches to solve the re-planning problem (i) global re-planning techniques using a centralized planner that will redo the task allocation with the updated world state and (ii) decentralized approaches that will focus on the local plan reparation, i.e., the re-allocation of those tasks initially assigned to the failed robots, better suited to a dynamic environment and less computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, named GLocal, that combines both strategies to exploit the benefits of both, while limiting their respective drawbacks. GLocal was compared to a planner-only, and an agent-only approach, under different conditions. We show that GLocal produces shorter mission make-spans as the number of tasks and failed agents increases, while also balancing the tradeoff between the number of messages exchanged and the number of requests to the planner.},

However, the design of these networks is often overlooked despite the profound impact it can have on both the task performance of the agents and the emergent phenomena they produce. In this work we aim to illustrate this by investigating whether network centrality impacts the task performance and emergent inequality (unequal distribution of resources) of resource gathering agents. We achieve this by constructing several communication networks with increasing centrality and use them with an Agent-Based Model called GATHER. Our results indicate that as the variance of the population&#39;s centrality increases, the task performance of an agent population will decrease. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simply changing the centrality of the network can produce distinct results and emergent phenomena (inequality or the lack thereof in our case). We then further support this claim by increasing the reciprocity of one of our communication networks which results in a system with greater task performance and significantly lower inequality, further illustrating the impact communication network topology can have on Multi-Agent Systems.},

The existence of stability restricts the weight and size of the matching to be satisfactory. We study the trade-offs in stability, weight and cardinality in a one-to-many capacitated weighted bipartite matching with an edge-weight-oriented preference setting. We establish a stability relaxation framework which is adaptive to the pairing suitability and capacity of the vertices. The purpose of the relaxation is to update the stable matching towards the balance of stability, weight and cardinality in the result. The relaxation preserves fairness by keeping the satisfaction degradation of the vertices with the potential new partner in a desired range. We propose an algorithm to produce a new matching using the stability relaxation framework. Furthermore, we define a novel popularity measurement model of matching based on the edge weight with the multi-voting ability of one-sided vertices. We show the resulting matching is also popular as stable matching. The experimentation performed based on the use case of the homeless placement system complements the claim of improving the weight and cardinality in the matching with marginal and fair relaxation of stability.},

We selected a subset of such signals (heart rate, intervals between successive heartbeats, galvanic skin response, and temperature) from the CogLoad dataset using wearable devices. Structural Equation Modeling techniques were employed to select the predictors to identify the level of cognitive load, for which the ground truth was assessed using subjective tests such as HEXACO that determine the personality traits of the human subjects. Bayesian networks were deployed to investigate the causal relationship and model the inference scenarios. The proposed model is intended to contribute to developing a Computational Intelligence tool for monitoring social health in scenarios of future potential crises such as pandemics and mass migration,},

These crises exacerbate certain elements like cultural barriers and discrimination by amplifying the challenges faced by these affected communities. This paper proposes an innovative approach to address migration crises in the context of crisis management through a combination of modeling and imbalance assessment tools. By employing deep learning for forecasting and integrating causal reasoning via Bayesian networks, this methodology enables the evaluation of imbalances and risks in the socio-technological landscape, providing crucial insights for informed decision-making.

Informed by previous literature, a Support Vector Machine, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and Convolution Neural Network were also developed for comparison. These algorithms were used to predict gender and age group on a single training and testing domain. As a model that works across multiple domains is desirable, each model was also tested on two domains which were independent of the training domain. The results demonstrated that the transfer learning model is superior to the other methods used for comparison in this study. Although applying the transfer learning model to the cross-domain context decreased its performance, it was still able to achieve a higher degree of accuracy on one testing domain than the Support Vector Machine which was trained and tested on that same domain. In addition, some interesting results emerged regarding the transfer of hyperparameter performance between tasks that share a common factor, be that classification task or training domain.},

Taking into account the local density, local spatial distribution, and successful/unsuccessful transmission records, each transmit-ting node can determine the best contention window value for transmitting packets. This scheme effectively mitigates packet collisions, ensuring a high packet delivery ratio and average throughput, along with a low average end-to-end delay for various network scenarios. Simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme and also show that it outperforms the conventional IEEE 802.11p method and other recent protocols.},

Personalized federated learning seeks to provide individualized models for each client to enhance convergence on heterogeneous data. We discovered that initially training the personalized layers, also known as the head, of the model first can alleviate the effects of data heterogeneity. As a result, we propose a simple method named FedLoop. This method uses a loop topology structure, eliminating the need for a central server or data exchanges between participants, thereby safeguarding privacy. Within FedLoop, clients act as nodes in a loop. The training process for each node consists of two phases: an initial phase solely for the personalized layers and a subsequent phase dedicated to the training of all layers. This looping process continues until a set round limit is achieved. Experimental findings reveal that FedLoop outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithm, FedALA. FedLoop effectively addresses challenges posed by data heterogeneity and its rapid convergence significantly cuts down communication overheads in federated learning.},

  abstract  = {Recent studies have demonstrated that active perception can improve the perception abilities of deep learning (DL) models. However, there are challenges associated with using active perception in DL models, including the need for datasets and/or realistic simulations that can support the training process, along with the difficulty of predicting the final target position, which reduces planning efficiency. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology for enhancing the perception abilities of DL models through active perception. The methodology proposes a way to create datasets for active perception by fusing existing large-scale datasets and decomposing the active perception problem into three subtasks for face recognition. The subtasks aim to determine the appropriateness of the current view for face recognition, the direction in which the robot should move for a better viewpoint, and the expected amount of movement required. A novel trial-based approach is introduced to estimate the final target position, making the method platform-agnostic and easily applicable to different robots. The proposed methodology is validated through experiments on two well-known face verification datasets that have been augmented with occlusions, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the perception abilities of DL models through active perception.},

  abstract  = {The inverse problem in electrocardiography is an ill-posed problem where the objective is to reconstruct the electrical activity of the epicardial surface of the heart, given the electrical activity on the thorax’ surface. In the forward problem, the electrical propagation from heart to thorax is modeled by the volume conductor equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the heart&#39;s surface, and null flux coming from the thorax. The inverse problem, however, does not have a unique solution. In order to find solutions for the inverse problem, techniques such as Tikhonov regularization are classically used, but they often deliver unrealistic solutions. As an alternative, we propose a novel approach, where a fixed solution of the volume conductor model with a source in a forward scheme is used to solve the inverse problem. The unknown values for parameters of the fixed solution can be found using optimization techniques. Due to the characteristics of the problem, where each single evaluation of the cost function is expensive, we use a specialized CMA-ES-based Bayesian optimization technique, that can deliver good results even with a reduced number of function evaluations. Experiments show that the proposed approach can deliver improved results for in-silico simulations.},

In this context, EEG signals can be processed via artificial neural networks (NNs) to achieve accurate recognition of users&#39; emotions. Still, NNs are rarely employed in real-world decision-making processes, since their internal model works as a hardly trustable black box. A NN $\mathbf{s}$ reasoning can be explained in a human-comprehensible manner by exploring its latent space to understand if some domain knowledge is actually represented and exploited for the classification. Those approaches assume that a trained NN autonomously organizes its latent space according to some domain concepts to process the data via human-like reasoning. However, there is no guarantee that such an assumption holds, since the latent space is not built for this aim. On the other hand, forcing the organization of the latent space (e.g. via contrastive learning) can result in poor recognition performances due to information loss. To guarantee great recognition performances and provide a domain-knowledge-driven organization of NNs&#39; latent space, we combine the well-known training procedure based on a categorical cross-entropy loss with a supervised contrastive learning approach for continuous values labels. The proposed approach (i) enables the explanation of NN&#39;s reasoning in terms of the importance of high-level domain concepts in the final classification, and (ii) results in a recognition performance comparable to or better than the one achieved via an approach based solely on maximizing recognition. The proposed approach is tested on the publicly available MAHNOB dataset.},

The existing inference methods are however incapable of analyzing time-series of single-cell data because of high cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. This study therefore proposed the new inference method that has an ability to analyze steady-state and pseudo time-series of single-cell gene expression data. The pseudo time-series data are obtained through the pseudo-temporal ordering analysis. As the precise information about the measurement time is unavailable in pseudo time-series data, our method infers a genetic network using the signs of time derivatives of gene expression levels, that can be estimated from the given data.

In particular, interpretable AI methods have been applied in newborn screening aiming to increase analytical specificity and predictive power of screening results. In this study, we apply ensemble and deep learning methods in newborn screening for isovaleric aciduria (IVA) on a data set containing more than 2 million newborns. We show that these methods can reduce the number of newborns falsely classified with IVA by 100\% with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), by 78.94\% with Random Forest (RF), and by 78.94\% with Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) compared to currently applied newborn screening methods. Furthermore, we show how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to interpret these black-box classification results and further apply them for potential biomarker discovery. The XAI methods reveal that besides the biomarker isovaleryl carnitine (C5), the birth year and the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) are influential in reducing the false positive rate. By this, we show that ensemble and deep learning could be highly beneficial in newborn screening and could have a major impact on newborns and their families, as it reduces false positive screening results and guides new directions for future research in this field.},

  abstract  = {In healthcare, building a supervised learning system faces the challenge of access to a large, labeled dataset. To overcome this problem, we propose a deep transfer learning method that addresses imbalanced data problems in healthcare, focusing on structured data. We use publicly available breast cancer datasets to generate a source model and transfer learned concepts to predict high-grade malignant tumors in patients diagnosed with breast cancer at Mayo Clinic. The diabetes dataset is then used to generalize the transfer learning idea. We compare our results with state-of-the-art techniques and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods. Our experiments on breast cancer data under simulated class imbalanced settings further demonstrate the proposed method&#39;s ability to handle different degrees of class imbalance. We conclude that deep transfer learning on structured data can efficiently address imbalanced class and poor performance learning on small dataset problems in clinical research.},

  abstract  = {Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used and proven successful in many real-world tasks. There are many third-party DNN services available for data holders who want to develop custom DNN applications for their data and tasks. To ensure data privacy, it is crucial to safeguard the data holder&#39;s training data. This paper explores a unique attack paradigm where a hostile third-party DNN model supplier subtly obtains training data from the data holder. Prior attacks which can steal training data typically use augmented datasets to memorize the information of the data that the attacker intends to steal. However, these attacks are easily identified since the augmented datasets are visually different from the original dataset and rendered ineffective. In this attack, we generate an augmented dataset by modifying a portion of the training data using the DNN-based image steganography technique. This approach creates an augmented dataset that is visually identical to the original training dataset, making it difficult for humans to detect. Through extensive experiments, we have successfully and quietly accessed the confidential training data of data holders.},

Besides, in complex optimization problems, multiple populations can be used to explore the search space simultaneously. However, one of the main problems is extracting information from the populations and using it to evolve the solutions. This article presents the inequality-based multi-population differential evo-lution (IMDE). This algorithm uses the K-means to generate subpopulations (settlements). Two variables are extracted from the settlements, the diversity and the Gini index, which measure the solutions&#39; distribution and the solutions&#39; inequality regarding fitness. The Gini index and the diversity are used in the IMDE to dynamically modify the scalation factor and the crossover rate. Experiments over a set of benchmark functions with different degrees of complexity validate the performance of the IMDE. Besides comparisons, statistical and ranking average validate the search capabilities of the IMDE.},

  abstract  = {Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) poses a challenging and critical problem in machine learning. Despite the effectiveness of gradient-based learning methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), in training neural networks, they do have several limitations. For instance, they require differentiable activation functions, and cannot optimize a model based on several independent non-differentiable loss functions simultaneously; for example, the F1-score, which is used during testing, can be used during training when a gradient-free optimization algorithm is utilized. Furthermore, the training (i.e., optimization of weights) in any DNN can be possible with a small size of the training dataset. To address these concerns, we propose an efficient version of the gradient-free Coordinate Search (CS) algorithm, an instance of General Pattern Search (GPS) methods, for training (i.e., optimizing) neural networks. The proposed algorithm can be used with non-differentiable activation functions and tailored to multi-objective/multi-loss problems. Finding the optimal values for weights of ANNs is a large-scale optimization problem. Therefore instead of finding the optimal value for each variable, which is the common technique in classical CS, we accelerate optimization and convergence by bundling the variables (i.e., weights). In fact, this strategy is a form of dimension reduction for optimization problems. Based on the experimental results, the proposed method is comparable with the SGD algorithm, and in some cases, it outperforms the gradient-based approach. Particularly, in situations with insufficient labeled training data, the proposed CS method performs better. The performance plots demonstrate a high convergence rate, highlighting the capability of our suggested method to find a reasonable solution with fewer function calls. As of now, the only practical and efficient way of training ANNs with hundreds of thousands of weights is gradient-based algorithms such as SGD or Adam. In this paper we introduce an alternative method for training ANN.},

To overcome this limitation, we applied the EFNN-Gen, a novel approach that integrates a priori knowledge through generalist rules to solve a beer classification problem. These rules are derived from assessing the specificity of Gaussian functions within the first layer neurons of the EFNN. They represent expert knowledge about the classification problem and are aimed at enhancing the network&#39;s performance. Experimental tests conducted on the Beer dataset, a real-world multiclass pattern classification dataset, demonstrate that integrating generalist rules leads to a significant accuracy improvement of 97.14\%.},

We investigate methods of evolving robot swarms in which individuals have heterogeneous behaviours. Two approaches are investigated to create swarm of size $n$ . The first encodes a repertoire of $n$ behaviours on a single individual, and hence evolves the swarm directly. The second approach uses two phases. First, a large repertoire of diverse behaviours is evolved and then another evolutionary algorithm is used to search for an optimal allocation of behaviours to the swarm. Results indicate that the two phase approach of generate then allocate produces significantly more effective collective behaviors (in terms of task accomplishment) than the direct evolution of behaviorally heterogeneous swarms.},

Our interest is rooted in the context of morphologically evolving modular robots, but the question is also relevant in general, for system designers interested in widely applicable solutions. We perform an experimental comparison of three controller-and-learner combinations: one approach where controllers are based on modelling animal locomotion (Central Pattern Generators, CPG) and the learner is an evolutionary algorithm, a completely different method using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a neural network controller architecture, and a combination ‘in-between’ where controllers are neural networks and the learner is an evolutionary algorithm. We apply these three combinations to a test suite of modular robots and compare their efficacy, efficiency, and robustness. Surprisingly, the usual CPG-based and RL-based options are outperformed by the in-between combination that is more robust and efficient than the other two setups.},

Despite its relevance in various practical domains such as engineering, transport, and product design, there have been limited studies on developing computationally efficient algorithms specialized for MCO problems. One of the contributing factors towards this gap is the lack of benchmark problems for MCO that offer diverse challenges for the systematic evaluation and development of advanced algorithms. In this paper, we conduct a brief review of some existing multi-objective test problems in the domain and discuss some of their shortcomings. The key aim is to highlight the need for the development of a more extensive set of benchmark problems that are flexible and tunable in terms of the challenges posed to the solution methodologies. In turn, we hope that this will encourage the development of more advanced algorithms to solve practical MCO problems in the future.},

However, the computation time of the hypervolume calculation increases significantly as the number of objectives increases. To address this issue, an R2-based hypervolume contribution approximation (R2-HVC) method was proposed. Nevertheless, the original R2-HVC generates a large number of vectors and computes the HVC only once. In this study, we propose an ensemble method based on the R2-HVC method. By using a small number of vectors for repetitive computation and majority voting, the ensemble method can reduce the probability of making incorrect choices. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the approximation accuracy while maintaining a similar computation time to the original R2-HVC method.},

Such a larger final solution set increases difficulty in visualization and decision-making. This raises the question: how can we reduce this large solution set to a more manageable size? In this paper, we present a new objective archive management (OAM) strategy that performs post-optimization solution set reduction to help the end-user make an informed decision without requiring expert knowledge of the field of MaOO. We create separate archives for each objective, selecting solutions based on their fitness as well as diversity criteria in both the objective and variable space. We can then look for solutions that belong to more than one archive to create a reduced final solution set. We apply OAM to NSGA-II and compare our approach to environmental selection finding that the obtained solution set has better hypervolume and spread. Furthermore, we compare results found by OAM-NSGA-II to NSGA-III and get competitive results. Additionally, we apply OAM to reduce the solutions found by NSGA-III and find that the selected solutions perform well in terms of overall fitness, successfully reducing the number of solutions.},

It is pragmatic to develop methods that can alleviate some of these issues after the optimization run is complete, without the need for re-optimization or additional solution evaluations. Previously developed methods demonstrated that it is possible to predict Pareto-optimal solutions from pseudo-weight vectors using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models. We extend the GPR-based method to predict new Pareto-optimal solutions using reference vectors as unique identifiers and demonstrate that like the pseudo-weight vectors, reference vectors can also used instead in learning the association between identifiers and corresponding variable vectors. Results on many test problems indicate that the choice of a suitable identifier makes a large impact on the decision-making process, particularly for visualizing the newly created non-dominated (ND) solutions. In this study, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using pseudo-weights and reference vectors as unique identifiers for ND solutions, paving the way to devise further identifiers for predicting new Pareto-optimal solutions.},

However, often when scanning introduces imperfections such as salt-and-pepper or background noise, blurring caused by camera motion, watermarking, coffee stains, wrinkles, or faded text. These imperfections carry significant challenges to current algorithms of text recognition, leading to a decline in their performance. To date, a wide range of methods are aimed at reducing noise. This work compares the performance of a CycleGAN model concerning median filter, Wiener filter, adaptive threshold, morphological filtering, and a CNN-based autoencoder. While the CNN-based autoencoder technique gave us the best results, the CycleGAN model approach provided us with comparable results with only 50 training epochs in contrast to the 700 epochs of the CNN-based autoencoder and was superior to the rest of the other contrasted methods. Likewise, data preparation for the training is much simpler in the CycleGAN model due to its property of requiring only unpaired data for training.},

  abstract  = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have demonstrated successful implementations in various vision tasks, including image classification, segmentation, and image captioning. Despite their achievements, concerns persist regarding the explainability of these models, often referred to as black-box classifiers. While some interpretability papers suggest the existence of object detectors in ConvNets, others refute this notion. In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying such neurons by utilizing Hebbian learning to discover the most associated neurons for a given stimulus. Our method focuses on the VGG19 and ResNet50 networks with the Dogs-vs-Cats dataset. During experimentation, we found that the most associated hidden neurons to the labels are not object detectors. Instead, they seem to encode relevant aspects of the category. By shedding light on these findings, we aim to improve the understanding and interpretability of deep ConvNets for future advancements in the field of computer vision.},

The algorithms&#39; performance is contrasted by contending ACO against the Minimax algorithm, in different setups of Tic-Tac-Toe and Chess. The performance is explained in terms of average time response, correctness of the move choice, and memory used when executing the function. Results reveal a slightly better average performance by the ACO algorithm compared to Minimax. These findings highlight the ability of ACO in decision-making algorithms without requiring knowledge of previous games. Furthermore, the results suggest that the ACO-based path optimization approach can be an effective alternative to improve the efficiency of decisions made by intelligent systems in environments that require rapid response.},

Addressing these challenges through explicit modeling can take much work and effort. For this reason, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained popularity as a feasible strategy for solving this problem. In this context, various value-based methodologies, policies, or combinations have been employed to obtain an optimal learning policy. However, problems such as convergence to local maxima and high variance in training persist. In addition, computational time and cost increase in complex environments, so more robust RL methodologies are required. This paper proposes a Swarm Intelligence Guided Neural Reinforcement Learning (SIGNRL) algorithm, which uses Particle Swarm Optimization as a multi-agent parameter explorer to find the optimal policy. Numerical results obtained in the OpenAI Gym Cart-Pole environment show that SIGNRL, with its gradient-free learning, exhibits good convergence and lower variance in continuous control tasks.},

  abstract  = {Meta-reinforcement learning aims to overcome important limitations in reinforcement learning, like low sample efficiency and poor generalization, by creating agents that adapt to new tasks. The development of intelligent robots would benefit from such agents. Long-standing issues like data collection and generalization to real-world dynamic environments could be mitigated by sample-efficient adaptable algorithms. However, most such algorithms have only been proven to work in low-complexity environments. These provide no guarantee that a near-optimal global policy does not exist, which makes it difficult to evaluate adaptable policies. This hinders the in-depth analysis of an agent&#39;s potential to adapt, while also introducing a gap between controlled experiments and real-world applications. We propose MEWA, a collection of task distributions used as a benchmark for adaptable agents. Our tasks contain a shared structure that an agent can leverage to learn the task-specific structure of new tasks. To ensure our environment is adaptive, we select some of the task parameters using the solution to a constrained optimization problem. Other parameters are randomized, allowing the creation of arbitrary task distributions. We evaluate three state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning algorithms on our benchmark, that were previously shown to adapt to new tasks with a simpler structure. Results show that the algorithms can reach meaningful performance on the task, but cannot yet fully adapt to the task-specific structure. We believe this benchmark will help identify some of the issues that hinder adaptability, ultimately aiding in the design of new algorithms, more suitable for real-world human-robot applications.},

In this paper we propose a method that helps agents know when to retrain their policies via reinforcement learning. The agents detect changes based on the temporal difference. A hierarchical learning model is used to aid in these non- stationary environments. The hierarchical learning model has two levels, the higher-level policy, which we call the learning switch, and the lower-level policy, which tells the agents their suitable action to play the game. The higher-level policy determines when reinforcement learning should be turned on or off based on the temporal differences calculated within a game or episode. Two multi-agent differential games are used as examples. The first two examples tackle the problem in cooperative games, while the last example addresses the competitive game. The results show that the agents can maintain suitable performance by switching on the learning process for a few iterations after environment changes occurs. In this paper we consider the change in environment to be long term occurrence within the dynamics of games; for example the mass of an agent may become heavier.},

  abstract  = {Exploration poses a fundamental challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) with sparse rewards, limiting an agent&#39;s ability to learn optimal decision-making due to a lack of informative feedback signals. Self-Imitation Learning (self-IL) has emerged as a promising approach for exploration, leveraging a replay buffer to store and reproduce successful behaviors. However, traditional self-IL methods, which rely on high-return transitions and assume singleton environments, face challenges in generalization, especially in procedurally-generated (PCG) environments. Therefore, new self-IL methods have been proposed to rank which experiences to persist, but they replay transitions uniformly regardless of their significance, and do not address the diversity of the stored demonstrations. In this work, we propose tailored self-IL sampling strategies by prioritizing transitions in different ways and extending prioritization techniques to PCG environments. We also address diversity loss through modifications to counteract the impact of generalization requirements and bias introduced by prioritization techniques. Our experimental analysis, conducted over three PCG sparse reward environments, including MiniGrid and ProcGen, highlights the benefits of our proposed modifications, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance in the MiniGrid-MultiRoom-N12-S10 environment.},

  abstract  = {The promising results of machine learning in time series classification, along with the rise in sensor data-driven use cases, have led to the increasing deployment of models in IoT environments, on edge devices. Since these devices are typically resource constrained, they cannot always execute large and complex models, so they often offload (part of) their tasks to remotely located models. This synergy however introduces the need to transfer a large amount of sensor data to the cloud, which can be detrimental to bandwidth cost and inference speed of the application, and energy utilization of the device. Although techniques such as early classification can limit the data that has to be transferred, there are still unexplored opportunities when it comes to input filtering. A recent versatile early-exit framework, extending early classification and adapting it to multivariate time series, has investigated this potential. In this work, we propose a variation of this method, creating a more flexible, reinforcement learning-enabled framework that can adapt the input variables (channels) considered for classification across time, aiming for maximizing accuracy while minimizing the input data necessary. Extensive testing on synthetic data and real datasets shows that our method can, in multiple cases, achieve better accuracy for a similar percentage of input filtering, both compared to the baseline framework, as well as to the conventional early classification approach.},

By incorporating this auxiliary information, Newton&#39;s method offers a more efficient strategy for subspace learning in one-class classification as compared to gradient-based optimization.

  abstract  = {Evolutionary algorithm(EA) with knowledge trans-fer is an emerging research topic that has attracted a lot of attention in the EA community. The multiform evolutionary algorithm is a promising algorithm framework concept falling in this direction, but little work has been done so far to design and discuss this new EA framework. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive multiform evolutionary framework, which integrates the idea of transfer optimization and population-based evolutionary algorithms. The main idea is to utilize multiple equivalent or similar formulations to solve the given problem cooperatively. By adaptively adjusting computational resources of different formulations and transferring knowledge among formulations, the search efficiency and the population diversity can be improved. Furthermore, a new multiform algorithm is implemented based on the proposed framework, which utilizes two different coordinate systems, namely the Cartesian and polar coordinate systems, to model the given problem. To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conducted numerical experiments on CEC2013 benchmark test functions, and the experimental results have verified the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Hopfield networks are an attractive choice for solving many types of computational problems because they provide a biologically plausible mechanism. The Self-Optimization (SO) model adds to the Hopfield network (HN) by using a biologically founded Hebbian learning rule, in combination with repeated network resets to arbitrary initial states, for optimizing its own behavior towards some desirable goal state encoded in the network. However, the solutions to the abstract problems used in the literature offer little insight into how HN arrive at solutions or partial solutions. In order to better understand that process, we demonstrate first that the SO model can solve concrete combinatorial satisfiability problems: The Liars problem and the map coloring problem. Based on these solutions, we discuss how under certain conditions critical information might get lost forever with the learned network producing seemingly optimal solutions that are in fact inappropriate for the problem it was tasked to solve. What appears to be an undesirable side-effect of the SO model, can provide insight into its process for solving intractable problems.},

  abstract  = {Gait analysis is becoming increasingly central in various fields such as biomechanics, medicine, and sports. This complex study assesses how individuals walk, weighing in on aspects like bone alignment, joint range of motion, and neuro-muscular activity. Its profound importance emanates from its capability to identify potential walking anomalies at an early stage, which can offset the need for invasive medical interventions and offer valuable insights for clinicians to make well-informed decisions. Inspiration for this in-depth gait analysis research was sourced from previous attempts that employed tools like step mats and cameras to track and analyze movement. Several design imperatives were consolidated within this framework, including the vital need of user safety, assuring comfort throughout usage, preserving system stability, and the undoubtedly significant feature of keeping the insole lightweight. These priorities were not merely for user comfort but were essential for the fidelity of the data being captured. In this paper, it is described the design and optimization processes of an insole for gait analysis following an agile methodology which involves the following stages: requirements, design, implementation and testing. This study delves deeply into the challenges of designing, implementing, and optimizing instrumented insoles for gait analysis. The requirements were successfully achieved by creating a 3mm-thick, flexible insole using TPU 95 material through 3D printing. This insole effectively encapsulates electronic components, ensuring comfort, durability, and safety.},

In line with the Bayesian definition of Real concept drift, NPRDD considers a sample as a drift candidate when the classifier makes an error but is highly confident in its judgment. We evaluate NPRDD on synthetic datasets by varying the noise levels and comparing its performance with other well-established methods.

At the same time, the exploration and exploitation of intrinsic musical structures and sequences, a timeless endeavor, continue to captivate scholars and practitioners alike. In this context, the fusion of computational techniques with music analysis emerges as a natural progression. One of the pivotal crossroads in this convergence is the identification of musical phrase boundaries, pivotal demarcations that underpin the organizational fabric of a musical composition. This article pioneers an inventive approach to address the challenge of detecting these musical phrase boundaries, harnessing the power of artificial neural networks. However, the innovation does not stop there; the pinpointed phrase boundaries undergo a comprehensive dissection utilizing pattern mining techniques. The focus of this analysis is on unveiling recurrent motifs and classifying phrases into coherent clusters, predicated on the repetitions and similarities exposed through these neural network-driven techniques. This exploration was conducted using an extensive repository of folk songs, a treasure trove of foundational musical expressions that indelibly shape the stylistic contours of musical compositions. We claim that the presented approach not only opens avenues for penetrating and nuanced analysis, but also enriches our comprehension of the intricate interplay of musical components and their manifestations inspired by neural networks.},

Some neurons, called interpolating units, have weight vectors that do not model training data, and instead represent boundaries between emergent data clusters. Interpolating units are useful for distinguishing such clusters using SOM visualizations. However, automatic (non-visual) detection of interpolating units would be advantageous for SOM analysis. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, based on inter-neuron distances in weight vector space, for identifying and possibly pruning interpolating units. Existing methods for interpolating unit detection are surveyed, highlighting drawbacks not associated with the proposed algorithm. Focusing on classification task performance, SOMs which are pruned using the proposed algorithm are compared to unpruned SOMs. This analysis demonstrates that interpolating unit pruning does not adversely affect SOM model quality, and suggests that the proposed algorithm warrants further investigation for application in data science.},

However, choosing the most suitable one from the many available can overwhelm even experts. This study implements a methodology that automatically tailors a problem-based metaheuristic through a hyper-heuristic approach. We select the tuning problem of a Proportional Integral Derivative controller as a case study for achieving the best stable features in an Automatic Voltage Regulator system. The numerical results demonstrate the reliability and potential of the implemented methodology in solving control system tuning. Plus, we conduct an in-depth quantitative comparison with recent works in the literature that support those conclusions.},

The generalization ability of classification learning can be enhanced with clustering results. On the contrary, the class information helps in improving the accuracy of clustering learning. Thus, both learning strategy complements each other. To amalgamate the benefits of both learning strategies, therefore in this paper, we proposed a novel robust kernelized Fuzzy c-Means based multi-objective simultaneous learning framework (RKFCM-MSCC) for both clustering and classification. RKFCM-MSCC employs multiple objective functions to compose the clustering and classification problem, respectively. Both the formulated objective functions are simultaneously optimized using the particle swarm optimization approach. Moreover RKFCM-MSCC uses Bayesian theory that make these multiple objective functions dependent on the single parameter i.e., cluster centers that connect both the clustering and classification learning. The Pareto-optimal solution attained with the RKFCM-MSCC approach complements the clustering and the classification learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed RKFCM-MSCC is empirically investigated on four benchmark datasets and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

In this paper, the novel fixed set search (FSS), a population based metaheuristic, is applied on the problem of interest. The FSS adds a learning mechanism to the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) based on elements frequently occurring in high quality solutions. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the simplicity of implementation compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. The conducted computational experiments show that the FSS even when using a simple local search manages to be highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the FSS manages to find two new lower bounds for the standardly used benchmark test instances. Finally, the performed computational experiments show that the learning mechanism of the FSS significantly improves the performance of the underlying GRASP algorithm.},

TTSPs hold significant importance in industries where testing plays a critical role in ensuring product quality. This study outlines the integration of MM-FGA with the Normalized Factor Random Key (NF-RK) encoding scheme, tailored to the discrete nature of TTSPs. Four real-world TTSPs are investigated with the objectives of minimizing makespan and mean workload. Comparative analyses are conducted against other prominent multiobjective algorithms, including NSGA-II, DN-NSGA-II, Tri-MOE-TA&amp;R, MP-MMEA, and MO-Ring-PSO-CD. The results exhibit MM-FGA&#39;s competitive performance, particularly in terms of the diversity of solutions obtained in the decision space. This underscores MM-FGA&#39;s prowess in addressing the multimodality challenges of optimization problems. The study further suggests the prospect of advancing step-size control strategies through meta-optimization, aiming to refine the algorithm&#39;s exploration and exploitation balance for even more potent optimization outcomes. Overall, MM-FGA demonstrates promise in solving multimodal multiobjective discrete problems like TTSPs, while indicating room for future enhancements.},

The use of micromobility vehicles has become widespread due to reasons such as energy saving, reducing carbon footprint and reducing traffic density in urban transportation. Although there are useful applications, this new concept has brought with it some problems. It is clear that new regulations are needed on issues such as accessibility, parking areas, security, charging stations, city planning etc. and the big cities need to adapt. Therefore, the carbon neutral districts have been started to be tested in small areas in many parts of the world and their effects are observed. This study performs Selected Element Reduction Approach (SERA), which is a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) criterion weighting method to determine the weight of the criteria to be used to assess the parking area of e-scooters in carbon neutral areas. SERA is a fuzzy environment MCDM method that aims to give weight to the criterion by the absence effect, which occurs by subtracting the criteria from the general evaluation. In this study, SERA is extended for the first time with single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy sets (SVNFS), which is a three-dimensional fuzzy environment. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the application of NF-SERA with a numerical example. It also assesses the criteria for the e-scooter parking case for the carbon neutral areas that are currently discussed in the sustainable urban transportation literature.},

Inspired by the promise of quantum computing, this paper explores using quantum information representation and processing techniques to enhance the performance of conventional genetic algorithms on classical computers to solve the job-shop scheduling problem. The proposed quantum-inspired genetic algorithm employs a conversion mechanism of quantum representation to code the schedule; and utilizes a rotation angle table to update the population. The effectiveness of the quantum-inspired genetic algorithm is compared to that of a standard genetic algorithm, with experimental results confirming the potential of the proposed approach in tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems.},

  abstract  = {Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) enhance transportation efficiency in different domains such as warehouses, factories, and container ports. Much research has been done into optimal scheduling and routing of multiple AGVs to improve the overall efficiency of the systems. However, more research efforts are required when addressing more complex real-life systems where the mobility of AGVs is highly constrained due to special geometric shapes and dimensions. Focusing on a real-world hospital AGV routing problem, this paper tackles the additional complexity arising from space capacity constraints long narrow corridors and lifts for cross-floor deliveries. A simulation optimisation approach is introduced to accurately model complex interactions of AGVs under conditions like floor switching, charging, and passing narrow corridors. To tackle the underlining vehicle routing problems with pickup and delivery (VRPPD) which is NP-Hard, this paper presents a simulation-based hyper-heuristic optimization approach to minimize the makespan of all tasks. A surrogate model is integrated to expedite the search process, and several experiments are conducted to properly evaluate the performance of our method. Based on the results, our method exhibits great potential in improving efficiency while maintaining the excellent practicality of AGV routing for complex environments like hospitals.},

  abstract  = {Coverage holes are a key problem in wireless sensor networks. Methods that use relative localization techniques to restore the service, or heal the holes, rely on accurate range and bearing measurements. However, high-precision range and bearing sensors are too heavy, expensive, and range-limited for the agents tasked with healing. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel impressionist algorithm, inspired by a recent swarm-based approach, that works with extremely coarse range and bearing information and at low perception frequency, to detect and heal the holes. In the proposed approach, a swarm of agents uses quantized information to navigate a potential field, generated by network nodes, to reach the nearest hole. The swarm adopts a greedy deployment behavior, preventing concurrent placement in close-by locations. After deployment, agents use their coarse perception to update the potential field, leading the rest of the swarm to unhealed area. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves similar or better coverage compared to the state-of-the-art and to a benchmark based on random walk. This is achieved using just three bearing quantization levels and four times lower perception frequency. Overall, our impressionist approach shows faster healing, albeit at the expense of employing slightly more agents.},

In addition, the paper conducts basic evaluations of the framework. Various swarm intelligence optimization algorithms have been proposed so far, but there is a common feature among them. That is that a set of search points in a search space, which are called individuals, move around in the space according to algorithm specific rules using fitness values of the individuals, and the differences among algorithms are in algorithm specific rules. Therefore, under the use of one swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, that is, one particular set of rules, if a fitness function is varied, behaviors of individuals are also varied. Based on this fact, the proposed framework optimizes a parametric fitness function for individuals to behave intelligently for a human. In the basic evaluation of the concrete system, a fitness function of computer program which returns a fitness value calculated with a distribution of individuals is used instead of a human, and it is demonstrated that optimization of a parametric fitness function indeed yields desired behaviors of individuals.},

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence algorithm that finds candidate solutions by iteratively updating the positions of particles in a swarm. PSO performance depends on the use of a suitable control parameter (CP) configuration, which governs the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the swarm. Various methods of adapting or tuning CPs exist, but many result in exploding particle velocities and an unstable search process. Poli&#39;s stability condition ensures convergence in the mathematical limit, and is often used to inform CP configuration. However, this study shows that since it does not place any practical convergence constraints, it cannot be used to guarantee a stable search process. Velocity explosion occurs nonetheless and can lead to floating-point overflow and numerical instability. The investigation into various CP configurations across diverse functions and measurements of particle velocities provides empirical evidence of velocity explosion, and cautions against the assumption that enforcing Poli&#39;s criterion guarantees stability. The findings underline the need for comprehensive understanding of CP tuning and stability conditions in PSO, as well as the crucial role of empirical evidence in evaluating the real-world performance of swarm intelligence algorithms.},

The framework supports model-free methods, e.g., Random Search (RS), as well as model-based methods, such as Bayesian Optimization (BO), with various surrogate models. Due to the generalized and modular structure of the XF-OPTIMETA framework, it can be easily extended to other optimization methods for dif-ferent optimization problems. The second objective is to empir-ically compare the performance of various HPO methods for population-based metaheuristics. For that the XF -OPTIMETA framework is used to apply HPO methods to the Hierarchical Simple Probabilistic Population-Based Optimization (H-SPPBO) metaheuristic for the Dynamic Traveling Salesperson Problem (DTSP) and to calculate high-performing parameter values for H-SPPBO. Promising results are obtained using the parameter values found by BO.

  abstract  = {Controller Area Network bus systems within ve-hicular networks are not equipped with the tools necessary to ward off and protect themselves from modern cyber-security threats. Work has been done on using machine learning methods to detect and report these attacks, but common methods are not robust towards unknown attacks. These methods usually rely on there being a sufficient representation of attack data, which may not be available due to there either not being enough data present to adequately represent its distribution or the distribution itself is too diverse in nature for there to be a sufficient representation of it. With the use of one-class classification methods, this issue can be mitigated as only normal data is required to train a model for the detection of anomalous instances. Research has been done on the efficacy of these methods, most notably One-Class Support Vector Machine and Support Vector Data Description, but many new extensions of these works have been proposed and have yet to be tested for injection attacks in vehicular networks. In this paper, we investigate the performance of various state-of-the-art one-class classification methods for detecting injection attacks on Controller Area Network bus traffic. We investigate the effectiveness of these techniques on attacks launched on Controller Area Network buses from two different vehicles during normal operation and while being attacked. We observe that the Subspace Support Vector Data Description method outperformed all other tested methods with a Gmean of about 85\%.},

  abstract  = {Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while keeping data decentralized. However, system heterogeneity and statistical differences in decentralized data can introduce biases and unfairness. This paper surveys existing bias mitigation techniques in FL across various phases of the training process. We identify sources of bias and present a critical analysis of current fairness-aware FL algorithms, categorizing them as preventive (Pre-processing) or reactive (in-processing and Post-processing) based on when bias mitigation is applied. In addition, this paper reveals open challenges in balancing fairness and efficiency in FL, handling non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, and ensuring privacy. This survey lays out the foundation for developing unbiased and privacy-preserving FL systems without discrimination in the future.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) represents the application of Internet of Things (IoT) within vehicular communication environments. Internet of vehicles refers to a network of interconnected sensors, network layers, and communication systems that enable vehicles to connect with everything (V2X communication). Io V networks face numerous security challenges due to the emergence of modern types of attacks with unusual patterns. Therefore, it is a crucial and demanding task to design intelligent Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for Io V networks. In this paper, we propose an optimized Machine Learning-based IDS to detect attacks in Io V networks. We deploy highly efficient Ma-chine Learning models, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Extra Trees Classifier, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, to detect attacks in the CICDDoS2019 dataset. We apply the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to resolve the issue of imbalanced data distribution of target class. A Correlation-based Feature Selection is conducted to reduce the computational cost by decreasing the number of input variables. In order to enhance the performance of the attack detection, hyperparameters are optimized using the Bayesian Optimization algorithm. The performance evaluation results show that these ML models perform well. Notably, the Extreme Gradient Boosting classifier outperforms other Machine Learning models, and our proposed solution outperforms existing systems in terms of Accuracy score.},

  abstract  = {The growing field of Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) plays an integral role in the diagnosis and treatment plan of numerous diseases, including cancer. However, the effective representation of gigapixel medical images via a large number of extracted features remains a challenging task, crucially influencing other processes in a digital workflow. In this paper, we propose a novel QR code representation strategy to enhance retrieval performance. Unlike the traditional one-dimensional binary representation methods (i.e., barcodes), this 2D approach captures more intricate and informative patterns from the features by differentiating each pair of features resulting in a 2D binary vector. We delve into three distinct QR code generation strategies, namely, the Thresholding QR, the MinMax QR, and the Hybrid QR, each offering unique strengths. Our experiments on representing whole slide images of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset reveal that while the Hybrid QR tends to provide balanced performance, there are instances where the other two methods outshine. Even though this approach requires more memory usage, the considerable enhancement in accuracy justifies this trade-off; obviously, in medical applications, accuracy holds the highest priority. Hence, the findings indicate that QR codes can effectively improve the performance of CBMIR systems by not only accelerating the retrieval process but also increasing the accuracy of image retrieval, leading to potentially more accurate diagnoses and treatment planning.},

  abstract  = {Data augmentations have been shown to improve predictive performance of machine learning models in many domains. Augmentations are typically used to improve classification performance, but augmentations can distort the intrinsic properties of the original data, thus reducing the utility of a model for real-world applications. Because augmentations directly affect the training data, and thus also affect the machine learning models trained with said data, intelligent selection of augmentations is as critical as the selection of input features and other options in the machine learning pipeline. Such an approach will enable greater transferability of trained models from the research lab to products and services. This paper presents two metrics to evaluate the potential and realized impact of data augmentations. The first metric, eff-score, assesses the relative efficacy of prospective data augmentations before model training. To observe augmentation effects on the intrinsic properties of the training data, the second metric, nirvana distance, measures the effect of data augmentations beyond overall predictive performance after model training. These metrics are tested with a well known multi-purpose audio data set and augmentations from the domain of environmental sound scene analysis. The relative eff-scores correlate with classification results from predictive models trained on the augmented data sets, and the distance components of the nirvana distance explain results observed but not previously understood from output confusion matrices. These results demonstrate promise for data-driven, efficient selection of data augmentations whilst exposing previously hidden impacts on machine learning models. Furthermore, since eff-score and nirvana distance are domain-independent, these metrics have widespread applicability.},

Even minor damage to wings, for example, can remove the vehicle&#39;s ability to reliably follow waypoint trails even if that same damage does not result in a catastrophic loss of altitude. One solution to this problem is to adapt the core wing motion scripts (wing gaits) in an attempt to use wing motion to compensate for losses of force and torque generation due to in-service damage or manufacturing faults. This approach presents a number of challenges - especially if it is to be deployed in a resource restricted vehicle in an online mode during an actual mission. Prior to this paper, we had presented only anecdotal treatment of fully unrestricted, 3D flight. In this paper, we will definitively establish the utility of EA adaptation of flight control in unrestricted flight in a pendulum-stable FW-MA V. We will, additionally, introduce mutation and crowding modifications that provide demonstrable utility in a manner amenable to implementation on a resource-restricted micro vehicle.

  abstract  = {Evolutionary approaches to engineering design involve generating populations of candidate solutions that compete via a selection process iteratively, to improve measures of performance over many generations. Although the attractive properties of biological evolutionary systems have motivated researchers to investigate emulating them for engineering design, there has been an emphasis on using encodings of the technical artefacts themselves, rather than encoding a complete bio-inspired system which is capable of producing such artefacts. It is the latter approach which is the subject of this contribution: how might a bio-inspired system be designed that self-organises the process of engineering design and manufacture? To make progress in the application of evolutionary processes to problems in engineering design, the evolutionary model must encompass the complexity of systems engineering. A new theory of evolutionary systems engineering is presented, based on von Neumann&#39;s Universal Constructor Architecture (UCA), drawing from more recent understanding of biology and applying the resulting system to the task of engineering design. It demonstrates how individual bioinspired algorithms fit into a coherent whole, and how they can be combined to drive open-endedness in automated design. The resulting system provides a common language for multidisciplinary applications in generative design, whereby industrial systems engineering approaches can be developed using principles from the UCA for the first time.},

  abstract  = {Engineering design has traditionally involved human engineers manually creating and iterating on designs based on their expertise and knowledge. In Bio-inspired Evolutionary Development (EvoDevo), generative algorithms are used to ex-plore a much larger design space that may not have ever been considered by human engineers. However, for complex systems, the designer is often required to start the EvoDevo process with an initial design (seed) which the development process will optimise. The question is: will a good starting seed yield a good set of design solutions for the given problem? This paper considers this question and suggests that sub-optimal seeds can provide, up to certain limits, better design solutions than relatively more optimal seeds. In addition, this paper highlights the importance of designing the appropriate seed for the appropriate problem. In this paper, the problem analysed is the structural performance of a Warren Truss (bridge-like structure) under a single load. The main conclusion of this paper is that up to a limit sub-optimal seeds provide in general better sets of solutions than more optimal seeds. After this limit, the performance of sub-optimal seed starts to degrade as parts of the phenotype landscape become inaccessible.},

  abstract  = {A key challenge for evolving complex physical ob-jects is to design a representation, that is, to devise suitable genotypes and a good mapping from genotypes to phenotypes (the objects to be evolved). This paper outlines a new approach to address this challenge for evolving robot morphologies and presents a proof-of-concept study to assess its feasibility. The key idea is to design genotype-phenotype mappings using variational autoencoders. This idea is implemented and tested for the evolution of modular robots for a locomotion task. The experiments show the practicability of this idea where the representation is not hand-designed, but algorithmically generated. This indicates a great future potential for the evolution of complex objects where there are no straightforward representations to use.},

Patients require a rehabilitation program to follow their progress, and one of the tools used to do that is the electromyographic (EMG) signals. This article proposes using algorithms to characterize and classify EMG signals during force exercises for the wrist and forearm. Eight healthy subjects participated in this study. They performed seven exercises, making five trials for each one. Signal features were analyzed in different time windows using a genetic algorithm and machine learning techniques to select the window that maximizes the classification. Combining four electrodes, seven exercises, and 14 algorithms achieved a classification accuracy of 92.41\% using the Multilayer Perceptron classifier. The study demonstrates a highly reliable method for classifying forearm and wrist exercises based on EMG signals, useful for exoskeletons or rehabilitation platforms. Future work will focus on implementing EMG signals to enhance motor rehabilitation therapy and provide findings that will help the scientific community investigate the combination of EEG signals for rehabilitation purposes.},

  abstract  = {In biomechanics, the calculation of inertial parameters for the upper and lower limbs is studied for motion analysis or the design of prostheses or exoskeletons. However, the calculation of inertial parameters for the hand is performed without considering that the geometry of this segment can change depending on the posture. This work presents a geometric method based on the kinematic model to estimate the inertial parameters of the hand segment for different hand postures. The resulting inertia tensor is calculated at the center of mass according to the segment axes&#39; International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) designation. It considers the principal moments of inertia and the products of inertia of the hand segment. To demonstrate the use of this tool, six healthy subjects participated. The anthropometric measurements of their hand were obtained, the inertial parameters were calculated with our proposal, and they were compared with two methods, Dumas and De Leva, using the Euclidean and Frobenius norms for the center of mass and the inertia tensor, respectively. The mean difference and SD between the proposed method for the relaxed hand position against the Dumas method is 0.0049 m (SD 0.002) and 0.00016 ·10- 3 kg - m 2 (SD 0.00009) and the De Leva method is 0.011 m (SD 0.0013) and 0.00023 ·10- 3 kg - m 2 (SD 0.00004) for the center of mass and the inertia tensor, respectively. However, our method can be extended to different hand positions. The proposed method can be used in applications such as the analysis of the three-dimensional motion of the upper limb or in the design of biomedical devices such as hand or wrist and forearm exoskeletons.},

  abstract  = {DNA sequencing is the process of reading in-dividual base pairs from a section of DNA. Genes are the name given to parts of the DNA which encode proteins; for example ion channels are proteins that maintain concentrations of ions within cells. The sequencing of these genes can offer insights into factors such as evolution and disease. During the sequencing process, unknown values ‘N’ can be substituted in the sequence where the sequencing machine is unable to identify a nucleotide as Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Thymine (T), or Guanine (G). These gene sequences vary in length; this includes individual genes across the same species. This has led to the use of a process known as k-mer encoding so that a machine learning algorithm can assess these genes without the need for pre-alignment. K-mer encoding works by taking small sections of the sequence and tallying the number of times that such a sequence appears, such as, how many times the k-mer ‘ACCT’ appears in the overall sequence. The unknown ‘N’ value presents a problem in k-mer encoding, as this value increases the size of the k-mer feature vector exponentially as the k-mer length increases. In this paper we research the accuracy and computational impact of including, removing, or ignoring this ‘N’ value for the k-mer lengths 3, 6, and 9 across four Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, and Linear Support Vector Machine.},

Our method employs temporal convolution networks and recurrent neural networks, guided by knowledge distillation, where we use inertial measurement units attached to the body to capture kinematic information such as acceleration, rotation, and flexion of body joints during an action. This information is then analyzed to recognize body actions and patterns. Our proposed network achieves a high paretic detection accuracy of 97.99\%, with an action classification accuracy of 77.69\%, through knowledge sharing. Furthermore, by incorporating causal reasoning, we can gain additional insights into the patient&#39;s condition, such as their Fugl-Meyer assessment score or impairment level based on the machine learning result. Overall, our approach demonstrates the potential of using kinematic data and machine learning for detecting arm paralysis/weakness.

The probability of an M&amp;A transaction&#39;s closure, as perceived by the public, inherently influences the stock price of the target company leading up to the proposed date of the deal. Given the recent advancements in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), we propose an empirical investigation into the correlation between digital dialogue surrounding M&amp;A transactions and consequent movements in the stock prices of involved companies. Utilizing transformer-based encoder-only architectures, we fine tune a stance detection model on an extensive dataset, amassed from digital communication platforms, featuring public discourse related to five historical M&amp;A transactions. Ultimately, we achieved 70\% accuracy on deal-completion stance detection using the Roberta-base model. We subsequently employ the aggregated the public sentiment towards the completion or termination of a proposed M&amp;A transaction to model stock price movement. Utilizing a multitude of time-series based approaches, we achieve a mean absolute error of 2.29 USD for next-day price prediction and 3.40 USD for next-week price prediction. Ultimately, we find an existing but tenuous relationship between online discourse and the price trajectory of target companies, ultimately highlighting the complex social and economic phenomena behind M&amp;A deals.},

  abstract  = {Feature extraction is essential in bioinformatics because it transforms genome sequences into the feature vectors required for data mining activities such as classification and clustering. The data mining activities enable us to classify or cluster the newly sequenced genome to the known families. Nowadays, a variety of feature extraction strategies are available for genome data. Nevertheless, several existing algorithms do not extract context-sensitive key properties, also some approaches extract features, which are unable to distinguish between two non-similar sequences. In addition, the efficacy of existing feature extraction techniques is evaluated on either supervised or unsupervised learning models, but not on both. Thus, an efficient feature extraction technique that extracts significantly relevant features from genome sequences is required. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method is proposed that extracts features based on the length of the sequence, the frequency of nucleotide bases, the modified positional sum of nucleotide bases, the distribution of nucleotide bases, and the entropy of the sequence to generate a 14-dimensional fixed-length numeric vector to describe each genome sequence uniquely. By applying extracted features to both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, the performance of the proposed feature extraction method is assessed. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy for clustering and classifying novel genome sequences into recognized genome classes is highly effective and efficient. The same is proven by comparing the proposed method to the standard state-of-the-art method.},

First, the models cannot adapt to new environments and terrains during deployment, and second, the models cannot be personalized to any given end user without costly involvement of a human expert. Incremental models can alleviate these shortcomings, but they usually are prone to catastrophic forgetting, which can be dangerous during live deployment. In this work, we introduce an incremental model, that can learn human gait from scratch without outside interference, but does not fall prey to catastrophic forgetting.

In this paper, a multiobjective recommendation model that considers different metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty of recommendations is established. Compared with recommendation models that only consider accuracy, this model can recommend more different items with higher diversity and more fresh items with higher novelty to enhance the long-term performance of RSs. Moreover, to efficiently solve this multiobjective recommendation model, a multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA), which follows the multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework, is proposed. As far as we know, it is the first time that the advanced MPMO framework is used in RSs. We conduct comparison experiments on three real-world datasets with three state-of-the-art multiobjective recommendation algorithms and two traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the performance of MPGA is better than all the compared methods.},

To make the estimator more accurate, we propose the doubly robust estimator of MIPS called the Marginalized Doubly Robust (MDR) estimator. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed estimator is unbiased under weaker assumptions than MIPS while maintaining variance reduction against IPS, which was the main advantage of MIPS.

This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) denoted as GCN-ACO, to solve the robot task allocation problems, which are formulated as the Travelling Salesman Problems (TSP) and Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP). The GCN-ACO algorithm comprises two stages. In the first stage, a GCN model is trained to predict a heatmap, which represents the probability of each edge belonging to the optimal route within the graph. In the second stage, we integrate the predicted heatmap into ACO to guide the ant colony to select edges with greater potential during the search process. We evaluate our approach&#39;s performance through testing on standard TSP and VRP datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has a faster convergence rate and a higher quality of solutions compared to the baseline approaches.},

  abstract  = {Currently, lack of interpretability (or explainability) is one of the major drawbacks for artificial intelligence (AI) models. When we intend to build a physical artificial intelligence (PAI) systems, the model interpretability (MI) becomes a crucial problem. To tackle MI problem, we give the explanation of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) from optics theory perspectives in this work. Furthermore, we present a discussion about how to implement optical learning neural network with our developed Optics Theory and Design Methods - OTDMs. With OTDMs, we can better understand the principle behind the good performance of deep neural networks. OTDMs not only give us an alternative explanation of RBM with optics theories, but also provide the guidance on designing a reliable PAI system also. Consequently, OTDMs pave the road to PAI systems, and make it to become possible for realizing all-optical learning neural network.},

  abstract  = {Computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs) that require significant computational resources are commonly encountered in realworld applications. To address the challenges associated with such problems, using computationally inexpensive surrogate models to approximate objectives has emerged as an effective approach to handle EMOPs. However, the current collaboration between evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and surrogate models is limited, relying on static regression or classification methods that do not fully capture the dynamic evolution process of EAs. This study aims to advance the integration of surrogateassisted multiobjective optimization by incorporating time-series prediction models. The target is to track the evolutionary trajectory of an EA and enhance its search capability. Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are embedded into an EA for surrogateassisted optimization (SAO). The role of LSTM networks in SAO is thoroughly investigated through ablation studies. Experimental results on six EMOPs demonstrate the potential of using LSTM networks in SAO. The results are compared with those obtained from four representative surrogateassisted EAs, providing insights into the effectiveness of LSTM-based approaches in addressing EMOPs.},

  abstract  = {Differential Evolution (DE) is widely recognized as an effective, robust, and gradient-free global optimization algorithm. However, the DE algorithm&#39;s search strategy has certain limitations that present opportunities for further improvement. Opposition-based Learning (OBL) as one of the efficient computational concepts provides the optimizer with the capability of exploring the search space in opposite directions. This research paper introduces a novel crossover scheme for the DE algorithm based on OBL concept. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, which primarily focus on utilization of OBL in population level, proposed scheme takes the advantage of OBL in operation level. In proposed scheme, the crossover operator generates two trial vectors in opposite directions, enhancing the exploration capability of the search strategy and taking a cautious approach by regularly examining the opposite directions during crossover. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of experiments are conducted using the CEC-2017 benchmark functions with two different numbers of dimensions: 30 and 50. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance of the DE algorithm through the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic time-linkage optimization problems (DTPs) bring challenges to existing evolutionary algorithms due to the influence of a current decision in the future. Existing methods usually model the rewards of a current decision in the future for prediction. However, these methods often present low prediction accuracy due to the lack of sufficient training data. In addition, they often require a long computational time. To address these issues, the problem of predicting rewards is converted into a simpler binary classification problem, which evaluates whether a current solution can bring positive or negative influence in the future. This paper proposes a clustering-based support vector classifier for solution evaluation. In the proposed method, the density of the time-linkage property is detected first. Historical data are divided using k-means clustering so as to train a support vector classifier for solution evaluation. Good solutions are selected to generate a final decision solution using a crossover operator. Integrating the clustering-based support vector classifier into particle swarm optimization, a new method named CSVC-PSO is put forward. Multiple instances are constructed using a recent DTP test suite with different types of time-linkage patterns and density. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CSVC-PSO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on most instances using a shorter time.},

In the first stage, we use different radial basis function networks models as surrogates and a voting method to select a promising subspace of discrete variable values. In the second stage, we fix the discrete variable values and use a selective ensemble strategy to optimize the continuous variables. We test our algorithm on 30 test problems and compare it with two representative algorithms.

Consequently, the accuracy of these surrogate models depends on the quality of the initial solutions, which in turn directly impacts the performance of surrogate-based MOEAs. Despite the widespread use of Latin hypercube sampling as an initialization method in surrogate-based MOEAs, there is a lack of comprehensive research examining the effectiveness of different initialization methods. Additionally, the impact of the number of initial solutions on the performance of surrogate-based MOEAs remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to bridge these research gaps by comparing the usefulness of two commonly employed initialization methods (i.e., random sampling and Latin hypercube sampling) in surrogate-based MOEAs. Furthermore, it investigates how varying the number of initial solutions influences the performance of surrogate-based MOEAs.},

To solve this issue, this paper selects a classical algorithm for large-scale sparse multi-objective optimization problems and proposes the reference points and adaptive crossover and mutation strategies to the original algorithm, adapting it to the sparse many-objective optimization problem. After a series of experiments, the algorithm with this modification mostly dominates other state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms.

  abstract  = {The Kriging surrogate (KS) has been widely used in surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (SAMOEAs) for solving expensive multiobjective optimization problems (EMOPs). Typically, when tackling an M-objective EMOP, a KS consists of M Kriging models, in which each model is used to approximate one objective function to replace the expensive fitness evaluation. Since such a KS is only efficient in solving low-dimensional EMOPs, the dimension reduction method has been adopted to construct the reduction surrogate (RS) to reduce training costs. However, both KS and RS can only approximate the mapping from variables to different objectives (i.e., objective function) but ignore the potential relationship between objectives. For practical applications, it is necessary to take into account the mapping between different objectives for the reliability of the surrogate. Therefore, we for the first time propose the concept of the conjugate surrogate (CS) and construct a simple CS to realize the approximated mapping from objectives to objectives. Different from KS or RS, all models in CS are conjugate symbiosis. In collaboration with RS, CS can not only benefit the light training cost, but also improve the convergence speed. Compared with five state-of-the-art SAMOEAs, the CS-assisted algorithm shows its effectiveness and competitiveness in solving EMOPs.},

Due to the biases between tasks, relevant tasks are usually selected for knowledge transfer to avoid negative effects. There are two challenging issues, i.e., source task selection and inter-task knowledge transfer. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive geodesic flow kernel transfer method (AGFKTM) for MaTOP. In AGFKTM, multiple source tasks are selected based on both the similarity between tasks and the performance of tasks. In this way, similar and well-performed tasks are selected with a high priority. In addition, an adaptive geodesic flow kernel is constructed to implement knowledge transfer, in which the adopted subspaces along the geodesic flow path are adaptively controlled. Particularly, the transferred solutions are used to generate new ones using mutation operators. Integrating the AGFKTM into differential evolution, a new algorithm named AGFKT-DE is put forward. Experimental results on GECCO20MaTOP benchmark show that the new algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Despite the significant potential of active perception, it poses several challenges, primarily involving significant changes in training pipelines for deep learning models. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic supervised active perception pipeline for object detection that can be trained using existing off-the-shelf object detectors, while also leveraging advances in simulation environments. To this end, the proposed method employs an additional neural network architecture that estimates better viewpoints in cases where the object detector confidence is insufficient.

In this system, a digital space-oriented URDF file parser is designed and implemented for the automatic construction of the robot geometric model. Next, the physical model is constructed from the kinematic equations of the robot and an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed for the inverse kinematic solution. In addition, to adapt to the home environment, functional attributes are used to describe household objects, thus improving the semantic description of the digital space for the real home environment. Finally, through geometric model consistency verification, physical model validity verification and virtual-reality consistency verification, it shows that the digital twin system designed in this paper can construct the robot geometric model accurately and completely, complete the operation of household objects successfully, and the digital twin system is effective and practical.},

  abstract  = {An increasing number of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Ma-chine Learning (ML) algorithms, to distinguish between benign and malicious data and detect cyber attacks. However, using ML algorithms exposes IDSs to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks during the training and test phase. These AML attacks aim to deceive ML algorithms by misclassifying data, posing significant disruptions to the system and its users. Two critical categories of AML attacks are White-box and Black-box attacks, with Black-box attacks being more practical and representative of real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the impact of adversarial examples on supervised ML models in IDSs and proposes an ensemble learning-based detection approach. The study uses a power system dataset and employs Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Decision Tree classifiers to achieve this. During the test phase, adversarial examples are generated using the decision boundary and HopSkipJump attacks, two types of Black-box decision-based attacks. The research applies a deep neural network to the dataset containing the generated adversarial examples to detect these AML attacks, achieving an accuracy of 98\% to 99\%.},

In order to do this, we created a pipeline that can recommend eyeglasses based on the form of the eyes using multiple transfer learning architecture to predict the face shape from a given image. We utilized InceptionV4 [17], InceptionV3[18], Vit Small [12], DenseNet121 [10], ResNet50 [9], and VGG16 [16] to predict the facial shape from the image and achieve a test accuracy of 75\%.

  abstract  = {Protecting Internet of Things (IoT) networks from threats is becoming increasingly important as these devices continue to grow in adoption. Modern and unseen attacks that require the analysis of more complex network traffic data for effective identification and mitigation are becoming more prevalent. Traditional machine learning approaches in current intrusion detection systems (IDS) struggle with these volumes of data, prompting exploration into the feature selection space. One class of such feature selection methods is evolutionary algorithms, in which systems mimicking real-life evolution optimize solutions for some problem. In this paper, we propose bag-of-little-bootstraps genetic algorithm feature selection (BLB-GAFS), a novel variant of the genetic algorithm feature selection method that maintains a global search of the solution space while reducing computational cost. This is accomplished with the bag-of-little-bootstraps method for approximating classifier performance. We test the BLB-GAFS technique on three modern intrusion datasets-CCD-INID-V1, detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT, and CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020-that represent updated network patterns and are highly dimensional. We found that the BLB-GAFS method matches or outperforms embedded feature selection methods on the same datasets. Furthermore, the feature sets selected by BLB-GAFS result in significantly improved multiclass precision, recall, and F1-score. Traditionally expensive wrapper feature selection methods like the genetic algorithm can be used on larger datasets through BLB-GAFS, opening the door to other applications with highly dimensional data.},

A possible representation is the transformation of raw network communication to images to extract valuable information from the unmanageable amount of network traffic by applying representation learning. However, since deep learning models can result in black boxes for users, it is interesting to understand what valuable information is learned from network communication converted into images. This paper elaborates on that question using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to identify network packets that most influence the prediction and verify that packets in a malware communication containing malicious payloads have high influence on the prediction. We inspect the Grad-CAM and visualize the Integrated Gradients of Xception and VGG-19 model and investigate the attention heat maps of our Vision Transformer (ViT) model. In addition, we present a novel transformation of sessions to a new image representation to expand the informativeness of network communication. For multiclass classification, our best model Xception achieves an accuracy of 97.95\%, whereas, for binary classification, Xception and VGG-19 achieve well above 99.50\%. Our ViT model achieves a significantly lower performance with 95.86\% for multiclass and 99.36\% for binary classification. In particular, computing centers could benefit by examining their inbound and outbound traffic to detect malicious behaviors ahead of time.},

This migration process results in an augmented development complexity compared to conventional Multi-Agent Systems. Additionally, the intricacy of this transition arises from uncertainties and dynamic behaviors associated with the agents&#39; changes, necessitating the formulation of techniques to analyze this complexity and comprehend the system&#39;s overall behavior. To address these challenges, we employed Docker, which enables a flexible architecture that accommodates different programming languages and frameworks for the agents. This paper introduces a Docker-based architecture that aids OMAS development, facilitating agent migration between various models operating in heterogeneous hardware and software setups. To validate the proposed approach, we conducted simulations using NetLogo&#39;s Open Sugarscape 2 Constant Growback and JaCaMo&#39;s Gold Miners. These simulations were executed locally, in the cloud, and in a hybrid mode to assess the feasibility of the proposed architecture.},

This paper presents the Federated Self-Supervised Learning (FSSL) framework proposed for IDSs. FSSL combines Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with federated learning to obtain a global model. SSL works at the client level, where only unlabeled data is available, and thus it enables the learning from these data. This knowledge enhances the training of the target model. Therefore, FSSL follows a federated learning approach, where private data from multiple clients help to create a global model. Each client learns an unsupervised model, which is then transmitted to a server and combined into a single model. The communication between clients and the server aims to improve model performance and convergence. Conducted experiments compare FSSL with a baseline approach using limited data and a deep learning model. FSSL utilizes an autoencoder to learn a representational model on unlabeled data and transfers knowledge by initializing deep learning model weights with the encoder layers. Results show that FSSL significantly improves the F1-Score of detection systems across three well-known datasets (NSL-KDD, TonIoT, and BotIoT). Moreover, the proposed model demonstrated a noteworthy capability to detect previously unidentified attacks when compared to the baseline.},

Solving MAPF problems while dealing with topographic terrains involves computing the most cost-effective and safe relief routes for agents with movement constraints. To minimize the overall topographic cost of agents&#39; movement and the need to deviate from other stationary agents, this work considers a MAPF approach that respects real-world agents&#39; movement characteristics, such as the agents&#39; orientation, the limits of the agents&#39; turning angles, and the relief inclinations they can safely navigate. To solve conflicts between agents while navigating uneven terrains, the proposed approach explores the attribution of agents&#39; movement priorities related to the need to execute given missions. Most importantly, other agents without planned movement at the current mission situation, as they are stationary on safe and low-cost routes according to the terrain relief, are minimally displaced to nearby locations to give passage to the mission-critical agents. The MAPF algorithm is evaluated on a comprehensive set of test scenarios, with results analyzed using Generalized Linear Regression models. This analysis provides valuable insights into the MAPF algorithm&#39;s effectiveness in virtually modeling organized agent movement behaviors for developing simulation-based training and instruction activities.},

Our results show that combine optimization of architectures and hyperparameters can significantly improve the accuracy of the neural networks in some problems and that the availability of training data should be taken into account when deciding to apply neural networks over other machine learning methods for building energy prediction problems.},

  abstract  = {As the distributed energy resources (DERs) increasingly penetrate the unbalanced distribution network, it becomes challenging to accommodate such penetration technically and economically. Therefore, this paper tackles an optimal allocation of PV systems (locations and sizes) to maximize the penetration while minimizing voltage violation. It is challenging because the problem is a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-linear and non-convex properties. In addition, the network is unbalanced which brings burdens on solving load flows. Computational intelligent methods, particularly evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have proven its efficiency and robustness in large optimization problems and thus, this paper explores two EAs on the problem with the help of a robust unbalanced load flow algorithm. A comparative study is conducted on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC) based on IEEE 13 and 37 bus systems. Optimal allocation based on peak hour and day-ahead scenarios are considered. After 30 times run, the test cases have shown that both EAs are successful and yet ABC generally converges to better solution and yet with larger statistical deviations on solutions.},

The results reveal that, according to the Wilcoxon test, the top three algorithms demonstrate significant superiority over the other algorithms. In contrast, the Kruskal-Wallis test shows that the top four algorithms belong to the same group based on the ranks resulting from the test.

  abstract  = {We propose the concept of “explainergy”, a new way of including explainability in the metaheuristic performance of algorithms solving problems in the energy domain. To this end, we open the discussion around eXplainable computational Intelligence (XCI), focusing on using metaheuristic optimization for complex energy-related problems. It is well known that computational intelligence applied to optimization cannot guarantee optimality theoretically and also faces issues related to premature convergence, tuning parameters, and variability of the results. These aspects slow the adoption of such methods by energy industry practitioners. Our proposal considers incorporating ideas already applied to the artificial intelligence paradigm, namely those related to eXplainable AI, to motivate current research in this field and provide solutions from metaheuristics with explainability character-istics. Through a case study solving a bidding problem in local electricity markets, we shed light on some ideas that might be advantageous to understanding the metaheuristic performance for energy experts unfamiliar with approximate algorithms. If an XCI framework is successfully developed, it can increase metaheuristic adoption, reliability, and broader success.},

However, the UC problem is a mixed integer optimization problem, which usually has the characteristics of high dimension, non-convex and nonlinear. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) integration into the grid can help improve stability and flexibility of the grid. However, Large-scale PEVs charging demand may put pressure on the grid and may lead to grid overloads. Recently, a competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) is proposed to settle optimization problems, which is considerably challenging in evolutionary computation. In this paper, a binary competitive swarm optimizer (BCSO) is proposed to tackle UC problems integration with PEVs. Finally, comparison experiments on economic problems with dimensionality increasing from 10 to 100 units, which confirm the competitive performance of the proposed optimizer.},

  abstract  = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, with arrhythmias being a significant symptom and risk factor. Advancements in technologies such as low-cost and low-power wearable devices, and machine learning techniques for analyzing big volumes of data offer opportunities to address this issue. However, low-cost devices may have limitations, including reduced data quality due to lower sampling rates, bit depth, and the number of leads recorded. These limitations might produce a significant decrease in machine learning models&#39; performance in detecting arrhythmias. This study investigates the impact of data quality reduction on arrhythmia classification using deep neural network models. High-quality ECG data with 12 leads, 500Hz sampling rate, and 32-bits resolution were transformed into low-quality versions with varying leads (from one to six), 100Hz sampling rate, and 8-bits resolution. Training a state-of-the-art deep learning arrhythmia detection model on both high-quality and low-quality datasets revealed a decrease in performance from 95.3\% to 93.9\% in the worst case, which is concerning given the critical nature of the domain. To mitigate this performance loss, we propose an ensembling method that compensates for 42\% of the loss, achieving an accuracy of 94.5\% even with the low-quality dataset. The analysis also identifies the leads with the most promising classification performances. These results can aid in making better design decisions when creating cost-effective wearable ECG devices.},

  abstract  = {Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are pervasive in the workforce and constitute the single largest category of work-related illness. The root cause for MSDs is complex. However, there is little dispute that MSD morbidity is primarily due to physical and psychosocial risk factors, and these two domains of risk factors share a common upstream determinant. A work organization influences both the physical load patterns and psychosocial features. In this paper, we propose a technology-facilitated intervention program that could lead to an improved safety culture in workplaces. The program is aimed at addressing one of the physical risk factors, i.e., rest breaks, and a psychosocial risk factor, i.e., social support. First, a wearable soft orthosis is used to detect the types of physical activities and load patterns, and to derive an intelligent rest break schedule for each type of activity and load patterns. The orthosis would also remind the participant to take a rest break at appropriate times. Second, a mobile app is developed to cultivate a learning community where the participants could seek and provide social support and increase their awareness of occupational safety. We collected some preliminary app usage data and developed a methodology of identifying app usage patterns using both supervised and unsupervised learning. The feasibility of the method is validated using synthesized data derived from the collected data.},

When fully-trained, algorithms tend to perform better, but the availability of data labels shortly after testing without human intervention is a challenging task in many areas, especially in data stream learning with concept drifts, where data is generated very fast, in real-time, with the possibility of changes in the data distribution. Concept drifts have been addressed in different ways, but using drift detectors with base classifiers in semi-supervised learning is not so common. This article shows how to use state-of-the-art supervised detectors in semi-supervised learning problems, and it also includes an extension to the MOA framework. The Experiments designed to test our proposal used Hoeffding Tree (HT) as base classifier, combined with eight drift detectors and a total of 62 artificial and five real-world datasets, configured with 15\% and 30\% labeled instances. The results indicate that drift detectors designed for supervised learning can also be effectively used in semi-supervised environments. This finding could lead to a change of paradigm for future research, since supervised drift detectors have never been considered as a viable alternative due to the absence of labels shortly after testing in many real-world data streams.},

Thus, accurate multi-variate time series forecasting is of significant importance in guiding practical applications and facilitating these essential tasks. Recently, Transformer-based multi-variate time series forecasting models have demonstrated tremendous potential due to their outstanding performance in long-term time predictions. However, Transformer-based models for multi-variate time series forecasting often come with high time complexity and computational costs. Therefore, we propose a low time complexity model called Fourier U-shaped Network (F-UNet) for multi-variate time series forecasting, which is non-Transformer based. Specifically, F-UNet is composed of low time complexity neural network components, such as Fourier neural operator and feed-forward neural network, arranged in a U-shaped architecture. F-UNet conducts channel and temporal modeling separately for the multi-variate time series. The U-Net constructed based on Fourier neural operators is employed to achieve channel interactions, while linear layers are used to realize temporal interactions. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that F-UNet outperforms existing Transformer-based models with higher efficiency in multi-variate time series forecasting.},

In this context, concept drift is an emerging research area, as they negatively affect the performance of classifiers: after they have been trained with a specific concept, they tend to lose accuracy in the presence of a new concept. Additionally, this problem is often worsened in environments with imbalanced classes, because the identification of changes in the distributions of examples belonging to minority classes is usually more complex, due to their lack of representativeness in the data stream. This work proposes the Features and Classes Drift Detector (FCDD), a new method specially designed to deal with the problem of concept drifts in imbalanced data streams, aiming to maintain the accuracy of detections in minority classes and, in addition, to avoid discarding the knowledge inherent to the classes unaffected by drifts. Experiments conducted in an imbalanced scenario with partial concept drift demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method when compared to the current state of the art detectors.},

Consequently, learning models operating on the data stream might become obsolete, and need costly and difficult adjustments such as retraining or adaptation. Existing methods usually implement a local concept drift adaptation scheme, where either incremental learning of the models is used, or the models are completely retrained when a drift detection mechanism triggers an alarm. This paper proposes an alternative approach in which an unsupervised and model-agnostic concept drift adaptation method at the global level is introduced, based on autoencoders. Specifically, the proposed method aims to “unlearn” the concept drift without having to retrain or adapt any of the learning models operating on the data. An extensive experimental evaluation is conducted in two application domains. We consider a realistic water distribution network with more than 30 models in-place, from which we create 200 simulated data sets / scenarios. We further consider an image-related task to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

We propose PyramidEnsembles, which contain members ranging from small over medium and large, to over-come one major problem in applying neural networks to the automotive domain: the tradeoff between model performance and overconfidence in the uncertainty predictions. PyramidEn-sembles use multiple models of different sizes from the same family in order to combine their strengths: good segmentation performance and well-calibrated uncertainties. We focus our experiments on EfficientNet-based segmentation models applied to the Cityscapes dataset, which is widely used in the field of autonomous driving. We evaluate single models, uniform ensembles (one architecture repeated) and PyramidEnsembles (combination of different model capacities) composed of the EfficientNet model family. Our evaluations show that within the same computational budget, PyramidEnsembles can outperform a single model in terms of segmentation performance while providing better calibrated uncertainties. Scaling over different computational budgets shows that this performance gap increases further. Different uniform ensembles offer a comparable segmentation or uncertainty calibration performance: 3 copies of the EfficientNet-B3 achieve an IoU of 0.7195 while an ensemble of 7 EfficientNet-B0 models yields an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0667. One PyramidEnsemble containing an instance of EfficientNet-B0 through B3 is a close second on either metric at 0.7188 IoU and 0.0698 ECE and offers a better tradeoff between segmentation performance and uncertainty calibration in this computational budget,},

In Pearl&#39;s framework of using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to capture the causal intervention, a Diffusion-based Causal Model (DCM) was proposed incorporating the diffusion model to answer the causal questions more accurately, assuming that all of the confounders are observed. However, unmeasured confounders in practice exist, which hinders DCM from being applicable. To alleviate this limitation of DCM, we propose an extended model called Backdoor Criterion based DCM (BDCM), whose idea is rooted in the Backdoor criterion to find the variables in DAG to be included in the decoding process of the diffusion model so that we can extend DCM to the case with unmeasured confounders. Synthetic data experiment demonstrates that our proposed model captures the counterfactual distribution more precisely than DCM under the unmeasured confounders.},

One-stage Deep Learning (DL)-based object detectors have achieved impressive results, primarily due to large-scale datasets available for training them. However, these approaches rely heavily on abundant labeled data, posing challenges when only a few samples per class are available. To this end, few-shot object detection approaches have been proposed. Among them, fine-tuning the final detection head while keeping the feature extractor/backbone frozen is a commonly used approach for few-shot object detection. This approach effectively utilizes pre-existing knowledge encoded in the backbone, using a small number of samples to learn new object categories. However, in this paper, we argue that fine-tuning only the last layers may limit accuracy and lead to overfitting if the initial layers of the detection head are not adapted for the new task. The data processing inequality, which states that information lost in early network layers cannot be recovered in subsequent ones, supports this argument. To address this issue, we propose a symmetric fine-tuning method that involves both the first and last layers of the detection head, aiming to maintain a fixed trainable parameter budget while strategically selecting parameters for fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach and open up several interesting future research directions.},

However, these approaches sometimes fail to make good prediction because of different factors such small number of keypoints detected, or wrongly detected keypoints. Matching the correct keypoints and filtering the wrong keypoints are other difficult tasks. One reason behind these issues is the parameters used to configure the key point detection algorithm. In this paper, another CMF (copy-move forgery) detection algorithm is proposed, by applying particle swarm optimization to find the best parameters for the algorithm for all different phases. Furthermore, filtering is achieved through two stages to remove most of the wrong keypoints detected. Additionally, triangulation is used as another technique applied to the algorithm in order to increase the detection area. Experimental results shows that the algorithm has good performance.},

This paper presents a novel method for video anomaly detection (VAD) using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed method called VALT-GAN combines two separate branches, one for spatial information and the other for temporal information, to capture relevant features from video data. The framework is utilized to learn the normal features from the training video dataset, enabling the generator to produce realistic samples. However, existing GAN-based methods face challenges in detecting subtle or unseen anomalies. To address this, we introduce latent mining for adversarial training which allows us to train a robust GAN model with high anomaly detection (AD) capability. We exploit the latent space following the continuous nature of the generator using the Iterative Fast Gradient Signed Method (IFGSM) which improves the quality of the generated images. Experimental evaluations show the effectiveness of VALT-GAN as compared to traditional methods on UCSD (University of California, San Diego) Peds2, CUHK (Chinese University of Hong Kong) Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets.},

There are three parameters for decision variables in a target factory. It is necessary to optimize these three parameters at the same time in order to evaluate them. Moreover, IF-PBIL is one of the cooperative metaheuristics and determines integer values based on probability values and generates solutions. Initial integer values are determined by equal probability values, and various solutions are generated. Hence, there is a possibility that it is difficult to search high-quality solutions from initial stages of the search. Furthermore, since the production simulator requires long execution time, the execution number of the production simulator should be reduced as much as possible. In order to tackle the challenge, the proposed method applies two initial probability matrix setting methods. It is confirmed that the proposed method can search high-quality solutions from initial stages of the search and can reduce the production costs with the fewer execution number of the production simulator using actual factory data of a polishing process of an assembly processing factory.},

We base our model on the YOLOv5 algorithm and fine-tune it using transfer learning, which enables us to identify moths in real-time and on embedded hardware. Our evaluation of the algorithm reveals that it achieves an average precision of 98.2\% on a test dataset, which outperforms reference models from previous research. We also assess the model&#39;s ability to handle disturbances such as other insects, varying lighting conditions, and foreign objects.

  abstract  = {Edge computing offers cloud-like services closer to users and IoT devices, providing high speed and accessibility for network users. Edge computing, often called Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), is a distributed paradigm that utilizes heterogeneous computational and storage resources with well-provisioned capabilities rather than relying on the ample resources of the cloud. In addition, edge users usually refer to portable and mobile devices that connect to and disconnect from the network at will. Therefore, scheduling tasks at the appropriate time and allocating the right resources can be modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem in MEC. Moreover, each task has specific requirements, further adding to the complexity of the optimization problem. In this study, we formulate the scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to schedule the tasks. The learning time of the task scheduler is minimized when it faces new users and edge servers. Subsequently, we employ the Q-learning (QL) algorithm from the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm to address the optimization problem and effectively adapt the proposed scheduler to the dynamic nature of MEC. Accordingly, we designed the valid state space, action space, and reward function with appropriate conditions and proper rewards for the proposed QL-based technique. We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the results of the proposed solution, taking into account the inherent randomness of the QL-based technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves the lowest learning time compared to Deep learning-based and Deep RL-based approaches. Furthermore, on average, the proposed technique obtains a 72\% faster runtime compared to previous works, using 58\% fewer computation cycles and 50\% less memory. These improvements make the proposed approach an efficient and lightweight task scheduler for MEC.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes refrigerated showcase fault detection by an autoencoder with coin betting and Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC). In actual situations, showcase data may include outliers which are incorrectly stored data. Radio frequency interference or incorrect sensor setting cause the outliers. When the outliers are included in learning data, the conventional autoencoders using least square error (LSE) may be influenced by the outliers. On the other hand, even when the outliers are included in learning data, autoencoders using MCC can reduce influence from the outliers. Moreover, the conventional artificial neural networks utilize various learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM), adaptive moment estimation (Adam), adaptive gradient algorithm (AdaGrad). These methods have hyperparameters related to a learning rate. Since the hyperparameters affect learning strongly, it is required to tune the hyperparameters appropriately and the tuning requires engineering costs. On the other hand, coin betting can automatically tune a learning rate appropriately while learning. Therefore, the coin betting is expected to reduce the engineering costs for parameter tuning. Practicability of the proposed method is verified by comparison with an autoencoder with SGD and LSE, an autoencoder with SGDM and MCC, an autoencoder with Adam and MCC, and an autoencoder with AdaGrad and MCC. The results are verified by the Friedman test, a post hoc test using the Wilcoxson signed-rank sum test with the Holm correction, and parameter sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract  = {Design space exploration is a crucial aspect of engineering and optimization, focused on identifying optimal design configurations for complex systems with a high degree of freedom in the actor set. It involves systematic exploration while considering various constraints and requirements. One of the key challenges in design space exploration is the need for a control strategy tailored to the particular design. In this context, reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising solution approach for automatically inferring control strategies, thereby enabling efficient comparison of different designs. However, learning the optimal policy is computationally intensive, as the agent determines the optimal policy through trial and error. The focus of this study is on learning a single strategy for a given design and scenario, enabling the evaluation of numerous architectures within a limited time frame. The study also highlights the importance of plant modeling considering different modeling approaches to effectively capture the system complexity on the example of vehicle dynamics. In addition, a careful selection of an appropriate hyperparameter set for the reinforcement learning algorithm is emphasized to improve the overall performance and optimization process.},

This paper introduces Forest Monkey (FM), a toolkit designed to reason the outputs of any AI-based defect detection and/or classification model with data explainability. Implemented as a Python package, FM takes input in the form of dataset folder paths (including original images, ground truth labels, and predicted labels) and provides a set of charts and a text file to illustrate the reasoning results and suggest possible improvements. The FM toolkit consists of processes such as feature extraction from predictions to reasoning targets, feature extraction from images to defect characteristics, and a decision tree-based AI-Reasoner. Additionally, this paper investigates the time performance of the FM toolkit when applied to four AI models with different datasets. Lastly, a tutorial is provided to guide users in performing reasoning tasks using the FM toolkit.},

  abstract  = {To integrate and assist the system and automation design phases of complex marine vessels, this paper proposes a two-level semantically enhanced scheme. At the design level, the system components are described and automatically connected by a developed graph-making tool using semantic “knowledge”. Decisions regarding the system selection are made based on certain Quality of Service Criteria (QoS) and enforced in the final semantic database using a dedicated cognitive agent. The automation level leverages the selected systems semantic information with that of the associated automation components and reuses the graph-making tool to update the connection graph. The resulting knowledge-graph is then used to “reason” for the creation of feasible closed-loop control architectures while a cognitive agent determines which closed-loop architecture to use based on various QoS criteria. The chosen closed-loop architecture can then change in an online manner during the vessel operation in case that system reconfiguration is required either due to malfunctioning components, or aiming to satisfy mission&#39;s goals. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed method are shown using a case study for marine propulsion.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel technique for the ap-proximation of the survival signature for very large systems. In recent years, the survival signature has seen promising applications for the reliability analysis of critical infrastructures. It outperforms traditional techniques by allowing for complex modelling of dependencies, common causes of failures and imprecision. However, as an inherently combinatorial method, the survival signature suffers greatly from the curse of dimension-ality. Computation for very large systems, as needed for critical infrastructures, is mostly infeasible. New advancements have applied Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the signature instead of performing a full evaluation. This allows for significantly larger systems to be considered. Unfortunately, these approaches will also quickly reach their limits with growing network size and complexity. In this work, instead of approximating the full survival signature, we will strategically select key values of the signature to accurately approximate it using a surrogate radial basis function network. This surrogate model is then extended to an interval predictor model (IPM) to account for the uncertainty in the prediction of the remaining unknown values. In contrast to standard models, IPMs return an interval bounding the survival signature entry. The resulting imprecise survival signature is then fed into the reliability analysis, yielding upper and lower bounds on the reliability of the system. This new method provides a significant reduction in numerical effort enabling the analysis of larger systems where the required computational demand was previously prohibitive.},

  abstract  = {The trajectory prediction of heavy heavy trains (HHTs) is crucial for ensuring the safe and automatic operation. It is inevitable to design a train model for predicting train operation trajectory of the HHTs. However, large capacity and the existence of unmodeled dynamics in the operation process caused by air resistance, working condition switching, and external environment make it difficult to establish accurate speed trajectory prediction models (STPMs) using traditional mechanism-driven methods. Most recent research considers using data-driven model to learn information from data, but they have no information about the physical characteristic of the STMP model. This makes it difficult to accurately describe the relationship between the control force and the running speed during the train operation. To overcome these issues, this study combines the mechanism-driven model with the deep learning model to establish a new long and short-term memory mechanism hybrid (LSTMMH) model. Specifically, the mechanism model describes the change of control force, while the LSTM captures the unmodeled dynamics of long time series of running process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated while the performance is compared with the traditional LSTM and mechanism models using the real data.},

Specifically, an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy is proposed to determine the number of solutions in each subpopulation and balance the exploration and exploitation ability of the algorithm, enhancing the convergence speed of aPOCEA. Meanwhile, we propose a parent selection strategy to select high-quality parent solutions, increasing the probability of generating high-quality offspring solutions.

  abstract  = {In evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO), one important issue is to efficiently remove dominated solutions from a large number of solutions examined by an EMO algorithm. An efficient approach to remove dominated solutions from a large solution set is to partition it into small subsets. Dominated solutions are removed from each subset independently. This partition method is fast but cannot guarantee to remove all dominated solutions. To further remove remaining dominated solutions, a simple idea is to iteratively perform this approach. In this paper, we first examine three partition methods (random, objective value-based and cosine similarity-based methods) and their iterative versions through computational experiments on artificial test problems (DTLZ and WFG) and real-world problems. Our results show that the choice of an appropriate partition method is problem dependent. This observation motivates us to use a hybrid approach where different partition methods are used in an iterative manner. The results show that all dominated solutions are removed by the hybrid approach in most cases. Then, we examine the effects of the following factors on the computation time and the removal performance: the number of objectives, the shape of the Pareto front, and the number of subsets in each partition method.},

Most studies have focused on simple Pareto fronts such as triangular and inverted triangular Pareto fronts. There is almost no study which focuses on complex Pareto fronts such as disconnected and partially degenerate Pareto fronts. However, most real-world multi-objective optimization problems have such a complex Pareto front. Thus, it is of great practical significance to study the hypervolume optimal µ-distribution on the complex Pareto fronts. In this paper, we study this issue by empirically showing the hypervolume optimal µ-distributions on the Pareto fronts of some representative artificial and real-world test problems. Our results show that, in general, maximizing the hypervolume indicator does not lead to uniformly distributed solution sets on the complex Pareto fronts. We also give some suggestions related to the use of the hypervolume indicator for performance evaluation of evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms.},

These imaging techniques provide in-depth information about the tumor&#39;s location, size, and morphology, which is pivotal for diagnosing and planning therapeutic interventions. However, the manual interpretation of these imaging modalities is time-intensive and susceptible to human inaccuracies. Moreover, the subtle features of tumors can be easily missed in the manual assessment. Hereby, we propose an ensemble deep learning approach to classify pituitary tumors, based on the weighted average technique that incorporates three base deep learning models: ResNet 152, DenseNet 201, and VGG 16. Moreover, we implement the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to perform segmentation to our dataset and then execute the ensemble model to classify pituitary tumors from normal/healthy brain images. We compare our proposed approach using segmented data and non-segmented data, finding that the segmented data outperforms the non-segmented data by a margin of 1.77\%.},

Our proposed model consists of an ensemble of regressors (EoR) obtained by training different regression algorithms on the training data of measurements and their associated GEs. The predictions of the regressors are aggregated using a weighted combining method to obtain the final GE magnitude prediction. In order to search for optimal weights for combining, we modelled the search problem as an optimisation problem by minimising the difference between GE predictions and corresponding ground truths. We used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for the optimal weights associated with each regressor. The experiments were conducted on synthetic measurement data generated from 4 popular systems from the literature. We first conducted experiments in comparing the performances of the proposed ensemble using GA and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), nature-based optimisation algorithms to search for combining weights to show the better performance of the proposed ensemble with GA. We then compared the performance of the proposed ensemble to those of two well-known weighted ensemble methods (Least Square and BEM) and two ensemble methods for regression problems (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting). The experimental results showed that although the proposed ensemble took higher computational time for the training process than those benchmark algorithms, it performed better than them on all experimental datasets.},

  abstract  = {In an increasingly digitalized commerce landscape, the proliferation of credit card fraud and the evolution of sophisticated fraudulent techniques have led to substantial financial losses. Automating credit card fraud detection is a viable way to accelerate detection, reducing response times and minimizing potential financial losses. However, addressing this challenge is complicated by the highly imbalanced nature of the datasets, where genuine transactions vastly outnumber fraudulent ones. Furthermore, the high number of dimensions within the feature set gives rise to the “curse of dimensionality”. In this paper, we investigate subspace learning-based approaches centered on One-Class Classification (OCC) algorithms, which excel in handling imbalanced data distributions and possess the capability to anticipate and counter the transactions carried out by yet-tobe-invented fraud techniques. The study highlights the potential of subspace learning-based OCC algorithms by investigating the limitations of current fraud detection strategies and the specific challenges of credit card fraud detection. These algorithms integrate subspace learning into the data description; hence, the models transform the data into a lower-dimensional subspace optimized for OCC. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, the study validated that the proposed approach helps tackle the curse of dimensionality and the imbalanced nature of credit card data for automatic fraud detection to mitigate financial losses caused by fraudulent activities.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic portfolio optimization is inherently challenging due to the complexity of asset price dynamics and forecasts. Robust optimization is proposed as an alternative that incorporates return and risk uncertainty in portfolio optimization. Directional change (DC) methods complement the standard, fixed time interval, and asset price data in terms of measuring the relationships and scaling laws between different types of events. DC methods can be extended for portfolio optimization using DC representations of assets and empirical scaling laws which indicate expected price changes and their duration. In this paper, we study a robust DC-based portfolio optimization (RDC) method, for returns maximization. The proposed method uses price signals from the DC representations of multiple assets for portfolio rebalancing and optimization, together with a robust portfolio optimization rule that maximizes portfolio returns under return uncertainty. We empirically study the effect of the robust DC-based portfolio optimization method with an application to 29 exchange-traded funds where each fund is a well-diversified asset with typically low-risk values. We compare the obtained portfolio results with benchmarks. The results indicate that the proposed method performs comparably to several benchmarks, and particularly improves a specific risk measure, maximum drawdown, in comparison to the benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {High frequency trading strategies in the foreign exchange (FX) market often attempt to extract the latent signals in extremely noisy price moves to help inform trading decisions. Due to the fast-paced environments within which these decisions are made, intelligent trading is an impossible task for the human mind. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers human-like intelligence and high speed computation but, due to the noisy nature of the tick data, can be prone to learning sub-optimal policies as a result of misleading feature and reward signals. In this work we use an intrinsic time sampling method referred to as directional changes (DC), which reports information whenever there is a significant change in price. By sampling tick data from nine FX currency pairs for 2250 datasets, we were able to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents using the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm to identify and trade profitable strategies in high frequency FX environments. The resultant models were compared to four benchmarks including buy and hold, moving average crossover, relative strength index and a rule-based DC strategy, across three different metrics (namely returns, maximum drawdown, and Calmar ratio), with the reinforcement learning models outperforming them all.},

This means that changes in the financial market can result in changes to public opinion and changes to public opinion can result in changes to the financial market. Accordingly, it is essential for understanding and interacting with the financial market to gather text content from online sources and process it. As a result of the rapid growth of social media and other online sources, we have seen an exponential rise in data, particularly textual data, in recent years. It can be difficult for a person to read, let alone process, the massive volumes of data generated every day. This indicates that we need automated methods for processing textual data and extracting useful information. Automated text summarization is a method of shortening huge amounts of text without losing essential information. Transformers, which can efficiently manage and analyze textual data, are state-of-the-art text summarization models. However, developing such an automated text summarization model specialized in a domain (e.g. finance) can be challenging since we lack necessary domain-specific summarization datasets. In this work, we propose a pipeline for fully automating the finetuning of a text summarization model in a specific domain, namely cryptocurrency domain, without the involvement of human annotators. To this end, we introduce a novel method for self-improvement of text summarization models which relies on a model assistant which encodes domain knowledge, enabling finetuning text summarization models in specific domains in which we lack specific-domain summarization datasets. The proposed method is evaluated on a cryptocurrency-related text summarization problem and three well-known Large Language Models (LLMs) used for text summarization.},

  abstract  = {Recently there has been a growing interest in constructing portfolios with stocks and cryptocurrencies. As cryptocurrency prices increase over the years, there is a growing interest in investing in cryptocurrencies, along with diversifying portfolios by adding multiple cryptocurrencies to the existing portfolios. Even though investing in cryptocurrency leads to high returns, it also leads to high risk due to the high un-certainty of cryptocurrency price changes. Thus, more robust risk measures have been introduced to capture market risk and avoid investment loss, along with different types of portfolios to mitigate risks. Many portfolio techniques assume asset returns are normally distributed with constant variance. However, these assumptions are violated in many cases. Unlike the existing work, this study investigates the recently proposed data-driven exponentially weighted moving average (DDEWMA) covariance model to estimate the variance-covariance matrix for high frequency (hourly data) cryptocurrency returns in Markowitz portfolio optimization. The experimental results show that for high-frequency data, the DDEWMA approach outperforms the existing portfolio optimization model that uses the empirical variance-covariance matrix. Improvements have been identified in terms of the Sharpe ratio as well as risks (volatility, mean absolute deviation (MAD), Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Expected shortfall (ES)).},

We apply it to predict configurations for the Lin-Kernighan heuristic (LKH) for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) individually for every single instance. To train our PIAC approach, we create a large set of 100 000 TSP instances with 2 000 nodes each - currently the largest benchmark set to the best of our knowledge.

  abstract  = {Recently, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is receiving much research attention due to its ability to decouple the data plane from the control architecture by associating the network switches to one (centralized) or more (distributed) controller(s). Traditionally, switches are assigned to the controllers in a static manner which results in under-utilization of the resources of the controllers and increased response delays to user requests. In this paper, we consider a practical load-balancing and agile scenario by formulating the dynamic associations of switches and controllers as an NP-hard optimization problem to minimize the maximum resource utilization of the controllers. Therefore, we propose an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based algorithm to deal with the aforementioned request satisfiability issue in large SDN systems in polynomial-time. Furthermore, we envision a hybrid deep learning model consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) structures to achieve near-optimal resource utilization for real-time SDN applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our customized CNN-GRU model outperforms the other techniques in terms of resource utilization (15\% - 45\% optimality gap) within a sianlficantly reduced computational running time (≤ 0.1s).},

  abstract  = {Algorithm selection is a critical aspect of continuous black-box optimization, and various methods have been proposed to choose the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem. One commonly used approach involves employing Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) features to represent optimization functions and training a machine-learning meta-model to perform algorithm selections based on these features. However, many meta-models trained on existing benchmarks suffer from limited generalizability. When faced with a new optimization function, these meta-models often struggle to select the most suitable algorithm, restricting their practical application. In this study, we investigate the generalizability of meta-models when tested on previously unseen functions that were not observed during training. Specifically, we train a meta-model on base COmparing Continuous Optimizers (COCO) functions and evaluate its performance on new functions derived as affine combinations between pairs of the base functions. Our findings demonstrate that the task of ranking algorithms becomes substantially more challenging when the functions differ from those encountered during meta-learning training. This indicates that the effectiveness of algorithm selection diminishes when confronted with problem instances that substantially deviate from the training distribution. In such scenarios, meta-models that use ELA features to predict algorithm ranks do not outperform mere predictions of the average algorithm ranks.},

However, recent work has shown that the performance of such models decreases when the training and testing sets contain different problems. In this paper, we examine a recently developed algorithm selection model trained on a set of artificial problems and tested on a well-known set of hand-made benchmark problems. This model performed poorly when it was originally presented. Here, we provide an explanation for its poor performance by analyzing the feature importance of the model using Shapley Additive Explanations. We then compare these results to an alternative algorithm selection model that was both trained and tested on the same set of hand-made benchmark problems and achieved much higher performance. This allows us to determine which features each model considers as most significant for their predictions, and where they differ. We show that the original and the alternative model use different landscape features for their predictions, which explains the difference in their performance. Further, by plotting the SHAP values on a 2D plane, we show that the original model is unable to distinguish between certain types of problems. Finally, we show that regardless of their differences in utilizing the features both the original and the alternative models perform poorly on a specific group of problems.},

  abstract  = {Companies use users&#39; opinions to improve their products and marketing activities. In recent years, the development of Internet technology has made it possible to extract users&#39; opinions from text on the Web. There are many ways for users to post their opinions on the Internet, and Twitter is considered to be a platform that allows users to easily tweet their opinions. However, manually extracting opinions from Twitter is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive due to the relatively low percentage of opinions. Therefore, some companies aim to efficiently extract user opinions from Twitter using machine learning. However, the attempt to create a dataset for building a machine learning system produced an unbalanced dataset that does not extract opinions with sufficient accuracy because the proportion of views on Twitter is small. There are solutions to this problem of insufficient teacher data, such as utilizing knowledge from other domains through transfer learning. Although transfer learning is sometimes used to solve such problems, accuracy cannot be improved if the knowledge domains are far apart before and after the transfer. Therefore, we proposed a new method called OTR, which stands for Opinion classifier Transferred from Review data. OTR transfers knowledge of review submissions that are considered to be close in domain to opinion extraction. However, since the phrasing of review sentences and that of Social Networking Service (SNS) such as Twitter are different, there is a possibility that sufficient knowledge transfer cannot be achieved. In order to address this problem, we proposed an Opinion classifier Transferred from Review data with Pseudo-labels (OTR-P), a method that brings the domains of the source and target tasks closer. Here, the target task discriminated opinions regarding leisure facilities, and the source task estimated review ratings using Rakuten travel review data. And while performing these tasks, we attempted to bring the domains closer by attaching pseudo-labels to the tweet data. This approach improved accuracy compared to the conventional method of shifting Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).},

The Variational Feature Generation Network of the proposed Variational VPIT computes features for target and search regions and the corresponding uncertainties, which are later combined using an uncertainty-aware cross-correlation module in one of two ways: by computing similarity between the corresponding uncertainties and adding it to the regular cross-correlation values, or by penalizing the uncertain feature channels to increase influence of the certain features. In experiments, we show that both methods improve tracking performance, while penalization of uncertain features provides the best uncertainty quality.},

Arabic is considered a resource-poor language, meaning that there are few data sets available, which leads to limited availability of NLP methods. To overcome this limitation, we create a dedicated data set from publicly available resources. Subsequently, transformer-based machine learning models are being trained and evaluated. We find that a language-specific model (AraBERT) performs competitively with state-of-the-art multilingual approaches, when we apply linguistically informed pretraining methods such as Named Entity Recognition (NER).

  abstract  = {Current techniques in Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) estimate camera displacement by comparing image features of consecutive scenes. These algorithms depend on scene continuity, hence requires frequent camera inputs. However, processing images frequently can lead to significant memory usage and computation overhead. In this study, we introduce SemanticSLAM, an end-to-end visual-inertial odometry system that utilizes semantic features extracted from an RGB-D sensor. This approach enables the creation of a semantic map of the environment and ensures reliable camera localization. SemanticSLAM is scene-agnostic, which means it doesn&#39;t require retraining for different environments. It operates effectively in indoor settings, even with infrequent camera input, without prior knowledge. The strength of SemanticSLAM lies in its ability to gradually refine the semantic map and improve pose estimation. This is achieved by a convolutional long-short-term-memory (ConvLSTM) network, trained to correct errors during map construction. Compared to existing VSLAM algorithms, SemanticSLAM improves pose estimation by 17\%. The resulting semantic map provides interpretable information about the environment and can be easily applied to various downstream tasks, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance, and robot navigation.

Therefore, representing vague concepts is not available. Mo-tivated by the recent success in fuzzy systems, we propose a fuzzy rule-based neural network to improve adversarial attack detection accuracy. The pretrained ImageNet model is exploited to extract feature maps from clean and attacked images. Subsequently, the fuzzification network is used to obtain feature maps to produce fuzzy sets of difference degrees between clean and attacked images. The fuzzy rules control the intelligence that determines the detection boundaries. In the defuzzification layer, the fuzzy prediction from the in-telligence is mapped back into the crisp model predictions for images. The loss between the prediction and label controls the rules to train the fuzzy detector. We show that the fuzzy rule-based network learns rich feature information than binary outputs and offers to obtain an overall performance gain. Our experiments, conducted over a wide range of images, show that the proposed method consistently performs better than conventional crisp set training in adversarial attack detection with various fuzzy system-based neural networks.

However, the size of BERT makes application in time-sensitive scenarios challenging. There are lines of research compressing BERT through different techniques and Knowledge Distillation (KD) is the most popular. Nevertheless, more recent studies challenge the effectiveness of KD from an arbitrarily large teacher model. So far, research on the negative impact of the teacher-student gap on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer has been confined mainly to computer vision. Additionally, those researches were limited to distillations between teachers and students with similar model architectures. To fill the gap in the literature, we implemented a teacher assistant (TA) model lying between a fine-tuned BERT model and non-transformer-based machine learning models, including CNN and Bi-LSTM, for sentiment analysis. We have shown that teaching-assistant-facilitated KD outperformed traditional KD while maintaining a competitive inference efficiency. In particular, a well-designed CNN model could retain 97\% of BERT&#39;s performance while being 1410x smaller for sentiment analysis. We have also found that BERT is not necessarily a better teacher model than non-transformer-based neural networks.},

Inspired by biological neuronal systems, neuromorphic sensors efficiently capture and transmit sensory information using event-based communication. Managing the decay of information over time is a critical aspect, and forgetting models play a vital role in this process. Building upon the foundation of an existing popular neuromorphic memory structure, this study introduces and evaluates four advanced forgetting models: ROT, adaptive, emotional memory enhancement, and context-dependent memory forgetting models. Each model incorporates different factors to modulate the rate of decay or forgetting. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, these models are compared with the original ROT forgetting model to assess their effectiveness in retaining relevant information while discarding irrelevant or outdated data. The results provide insights into the strengths, limitations, and potential applications of these advanced forgetting models in the context of neuromorphic memory systems, thereby contributing to the progression of this popular neuromorphic memory structure.},

This allows for high-speed operations with lower energy consumption, making them suitable for applications like autonomous vehicles and embedded robotics. This work introduces the Neuromorphic Event Alarm Time-Series Suppression (NEATS) framework, designed to filter noise and detect outlier behaviours in event data without the need for 2-D transformations. NEATS employs rolling statistics and advanced neuromorphic data structures to minimise noise while identifying changes in scene dynamics. This framework injects attention into scene processing, similar to summarisation frameworks in traditional image processing. A novel event-vision alarm change collection (EACC) database is presented, containing controlled stimuli pattern changes captured using leading neuromorphic imaging devices. This database facilitates future benchmarking of neuromorphic attention frameworks, advancing the development of efficient and accurate artificial vision systems.},

However, histogram equalization cannot uniformly enhance the local contrast of an image, which is its main limitation. In this study, we investigate a contrast enhancement method based on a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid whose parameters can be optimized by metaheuristics. In our study, we investigated the performance of three popular metaheuristics when coupling the proposed hyperbolic tangent sigmoid to find the optimal pixel values that can intensify features of low-contrast images. The proposed method is studied on a public domain image dataset and evaluated using standard performance indicators. Preliminary results show that the proposed hyperbolic tangent sigmoid can improve image contrast and quickly adapt to other metaheuristics.},

It will generally lead to performance degradation of traditional methods if using such imbalanced samples for training.

Specifically, we propose to use a transfer learning strategy to transfer from traditional full-shot learning to few-shot learning.

To address these issues, we formulate crowd counting as a classification problem and leverage least squares model with a novel semi-supervised strategy. Technically, we construct the least squares model based on only two regularization terms: a regression term and a discriminative relaxation term. Moreover, we propose a semi-supervised soft label correcting strategy incorporated in the model. As a result, a fast and accurate crowd counting method is achieved. Experimental results on five small-scale benchmarks demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the other competitors in terms of both regression metrics and consumed time.},

Visual-Semantic Embedding (VSE) networks are deep learning models used for information retrieval, which learn joint representations of textual and visual data, enabling 1) cross-modal search and retrieval tasks, such as image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval; and 2) relation-focused retrieval to capture entity relationships and provide more contextually relevant search results. Although VSE networks have played a significant role in cross-modal information retrieval, their application to painting datasets, such as ArtUK, remains unexplored. This paper introduces BoonArt, a VSE-based cross-modal search engine that allows users to search for images using textual queries, and to obtain textual descriptions along with the corresponding images when using image queries. The performance of BoonArt was evaluated using the ArtUK dataset. Experimental evaluations revealed that BoonArt achieved 97\% Recall@10 for image-to-text retrieval, and 97.4\% Recall@10 for text-to-image Retrieval. By bridging the gap between textual and visual modalities, BoonArt provides a much-improved search performance compared to traditional search engines, such as the one provided by the ArtUK website.

Our investigation is guided by five research questions related to each industry-led project: (1) is the project active? (2) what smart grid applications does the project target? (3) what technical approach does the project take? (4) what is the maturity level of the project? and (5) what we can learn from the success or failure of the project? Our findings show that only a few projects are still active, and many have been terminated when the funding was exhausted. Nevertheless, the few active projects give us hope that sustainable technical approaches in conjunction with sound business models could lead to long-term blockchain-based projects in smart grids. Most of the active projects are targeting energy trading and using custom tokens to incentivize the production of green energy and energy savings. Furthermore, it appears that layer-2 blockchains are becoming the preferred platform for achieving high throughput with low transaction fees while preserving the security and trust of traditional large public blockchains.},

  abstract  = {Accurate load forecasting plays a vital role in numerous sectors, but accurately capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic power systems remains a challenge for traditional statistical models. For these reasons, time-series models (ARIMA) and deep-learning models (ANN, LSTM, GRU, etc.) are commonly deployed and often experience higher success. In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of the recently developed Transformer-based Neural Network model in load forecasting. Transformer models have the potential to improve load forecasting because of their ability to learn long-range dependencies derived from their Attention Mechanism. We apply several metaheuristics namely Differential Evolution to find the optimal hyperparameters of the Transformer-based Neural Network to produce accurate forecasts. Differential Evolution provides scalable, robust, global solutions to non-differentiable, multi-objective, or constrained optimization problems. Our work compares the proposed Transformer-based Neural Network model integrated with different metaheuristic algorithms by their performance in load forecasting based on numerical metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our findings demonstrate the potential of metaheuristic-enhanced Transformer-based Neural Network models in load forecasting accuracy and provide optimal hyperparameters for each model.},

Scenario-based testing offers a potential solution by reducing the homologation effort required for these systems. However, a crucial prerequisite, yet unresolved, is the definition and reduction of the test space to a finite number of scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose an extension to a contrastive learning approach utilizing graphs to construct a meaningful embedding space. Our approach demonstrates the continuous mapping of scenes using scene-specific features and the formation of thematically similar clusters based on the resulting embeddings. Based on the found clusters, similar scenes could be identified in the subsequent test process, which can lead to a reduction in redundant test runs.},

The v2.0 version includes new annotated images from videos recorded during winter and fall in real driving scenarios. Added to the spring and summer images included in the previous v1.1 version, the new dataset contains 752 images covering the four seasons. In this paper, we show the improvements achieved over previously published results obtained on the v1.1 dataset, showcasing the enhanced performance of models trained on the new v2.0 dataset. We also show the progress made in comprehensive scene understanding by experimenting with more capable image segmentation models. These models include new segmentation categories aimed at the identification of essential road safety objects such as the presence of vehicles and road signs, as well as highly vulnerable groups like pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, we provide evidence of the performance and robustness of the models when applied to segmenting HSI video sequences captured in various environments and conditions. Finally, for a correct assessment of the results described in this work, the constraints imposed by the processing platforms that can sensibly be deployed in vehicles for ADS must be taken into account. Thus, and although implementation details are out of the scope of this paper, we focus our research on the development of computationally efficient, lightweight ML models that can eventually operate at high throughput rates.

  abstract  = {To develop robust and secure automated transportation systems, Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition (TSDR) is a key part. It plays a crucial role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), self-driving vehicles and traffic safety. However, the task of TSDR can be challenging due to traffic signs being subject to damages, discoloration, vandalism and occlusion. Even though a lot of progress is made in both research areas of Traffic Sign Detection (TSD) and Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), no study explicitly deals with the problem of qualitative poor traffic signs appearing in real-world scenarios. This can be assigned to the lack of an extensive traffic sign dataset containing flawless signs as well as imperfect signs. Neural networks trained exclusively on untainted data might fail at detecting flawed signs as they occur in real-world scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, a novel traffic sign dataset with condition annotations is proposed, indicating if a sign is good, discolored, vandalized, dirty or occluded. The custom dataset is created with a semi-supervised approach, in which machine learning models are trained to classify traffic signs in the condition categories. The resulting dataset can be used as basis for more precise traffic sign recognition as well as traffic sign condition classification which can be useful for maintenance planning. The dataset includes approx. 20.000 images of 10 sign classes, where 70\% of data is incorporated in the training set, 10\% in the validation set and 20\% in the test set.},

These data were compared with the pedal depression measurements from Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data to discern instances of potentially reduced safety due to cognitive load. We identified locations with high pedal change frequency, even in the absence of any recorded pedal operation in the CAN bus data. This result suggests the existence of unrecorded driver behaviors that could precipitate traffic accidents.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in deep learning methods to forecast the trading volume of stocks using historical volatility as a feature. Unlike the existing work, a novel datadriven log volatility forecast is proposed in this paper as an extra feature to improve trading volume forecasts. Recently, neural networks for volatility and neural nets for electricity demand forecasting, constructed with nnetar function, have shown to be superior. The novelty of this paper is to demonstrate the neural network based on the nnetar function from the forecast package in R for trading volume forecast shows superiority over the other neural network.},

  abstract  = {Human decision theory focuses on the reasoning behind the choices an individual makes. Human decision modelling is developed through mental models and can be modelled in different ways, such as fuzzy logic, deductive logic and probabilistic logic. On the other hand, machine learning techniques use a variety of statistical, probabilistic, and optimization methods to learn and detect useful patterns. In this context, this study investigates the complexities of human and machine randomness, utilizing two distinct datasets: one representing the perceived randomness of humans through the selection of nine numbers and the other encapsulating algorithmically generated random numbers from machines. The comparison of these datasets aims to understand the similarities and divergences between human (brain) randomness and machine randomness, primarily through the lens of fairness, neurocomputational, and decision-making simulations.},

We approach this problem using artificial neural networks and build a modular system estimating gaze from separately cropped eyes, taking advantage of existing well-functioning components for face detection (RetinaFace) and head pose estimation (6DRepNet). Our proposed method does not require any special hardware or infrared filters but uses a standard notebook-builtin RGB camera, as often approached with appearance-based methods. Using the MetaHuman tool, we also generated a large synthetic dataset of more than 57,000 human faces and made it publicly available. The inclusion of this dataset (with eye gaze and head pose information) on top of the standard Columbia Gaze dataset into training the model led to better accuracy with a mean average error below two degrees in eye pitch and yaw directions, which compares favourably to related methods. We also verified the feasibility of our model by its preliminary testing in real-world setting using the builtin 4K camera in NICO semi-humanoid robot&#39;s eye.},

To address this gap, we present FinSenticNet, a concept-level domain-specific lexicon specifically designed for financial sentiment analysis, where over 65\% entries are multi-word expressions. Our construction approach is semi-supervised: the framework consists of a concept parser, a sentiment seeds generation module, and a semantic graph construction module. Each concept (graph node) is subsequently classified in terms of its polarity using the Label Propagation Algorithm and Graph Convolutional Network. Compared to other financial sentiment lexicons, FinSenticNet captures domain-specific language features and has a broader coverage. We demonstrate this with superior evaluation results, i.e., sentiment analysis accuracy and F-scores, on multiple well-received benchmark datasets.},

There have been few machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques used in the literature for the forecasting problem. Transformer Network (TN) architecture is one of newest such techniques proposed. In this work, we utilized this architecture with multi-head attention mechanism for volatility forecasting. To enhance the performance of the TN, we incorporated different variations of the feed forward layer. The performance of three distinct TN models was evaluated by implementing three different deep learning layers (CNN, LSTM, and a hybrid layer (CNN-LSTM)) in the encoder block of TN as the feed forward layer. The results clearly demonstrate that the TN model with the hybrid layer (CNN-LSTM) outperformed the other models, including a recently proposed data-driven approach.},

Investors rely mostly on indicators derived from fundamental (FA) or technical analysis (TA), while sentiment analysis (SA) has also received attention in the last decade. This has led to great financial advantages with algorithms being the main tool to create pre-programmed trading strategies. Although the three analysis types have been mainly considered individually, their combination has not been studied as much. Given the ability of each individual analysis type in identifying profitable trading strategies, we are motivated to investigate if we can increase the profitability of such strategies by combining their indicators. Thus, in this paper we propose a novel Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm that combines the three analysis types and we showcase the advantages of their combination in terms of three financial metrics, namely Sharpe ratio, rate of return and risk. We conduct experiments on 30 companies and based on the results, the combination of the three analysis types statistically and significantly outperforms their individual results, as well as their pairwise combinations. More specifically, the proposed GP algorithm has the highest mean and median values for Sharpe ratio and rate of return, and the lowest (best) mean value for risk. Moreover, we benchmark our GP algorithm against multilayer perceptron and support vector machine, and show that it statistically outperforms both algorithms in terms of Sharpe ratio and risk.},

To this end, some stock exchanges implement a price limit or a circuit breaker, and there has been intensive investigation into which regulation best prevents rapid and large variations in price. In this study, we examine this question using an artificial market model that is an agent-based model for a financial market. Our findings show that the price limit and the circuit breaker basically have the same effect when the parameters, limit price range and limit time range, are the same. However, the price limit is less effective when limit the time range is smaller than the cancel time range. With the price limit, many sell orders are accumulated around the lower limit price, and when the lower limit price is changed before the accumulated sell orders are cancelled, it leads to the accumulation of sell orders of various prices. These accumulated sell orders essentially act as a wall against buy orders, thereby preventing price from rising. Caution should be taken in the sense that these results pertain to a limited situation. Specifically, our finding that the circuit breaker is better than the price limit should be adapted only in cases where the reason for falling prices is erroneous orders and when individual stocks are regulated.},

The distinction between the modest EEG source amplitudes and the pronounced magnitudes of non-EEG physiological signals and environmental interferences complicates the analysis. The coexistence of subtle neural signals and prominent artifacts, both intrinsic and acquired, characterizes EEG signal processing. Various artifact management techniques have been proposed, yet the pursuit of EEG signal quality assessment remains underexplored. This mini-review addresses this gap by emphasizing the vital role of quality assessment in EEG recordings. The article highlights the significance of rigorous signal evaluation, emphasizing reliable EEG data. It also encapsulates evolving quantitative methodologies that bolster signal fidelity assessment.

Concerning the BCI paradigms, motor imagery uses brain signals to decode an imagined movement. However, this is a hard task given the low signal-to-noise ratio. Usually, the main steps in BCI models are pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been gaining relevance in several areas of science due to their feature extraction, translation invariance, and parameter sharing capa-bilities. Another, more recent way of feature extraction is using attention mechanisms, which are layers of neural networks based on human attention and have the ability to highlight important features. A variation of the attention mechanism is the Convolutional Block Attention Module, which combines the CNN structure with the attention mechanism. In this work, we propose a new model that joins the core architecture of EEGNet, a compact CNN widely used in the literature, with the Convolutional Block Attention Module and residual connections. The residual connections were introduced to lower data degradation throughout the model. The results highlight the residual connection&#39;s importance for the performance of the model. The proposed model obtained a kappa result 5.2\% better than the EEGNet with a p-value less than 0.01 on BCI Competition IV dataset 2a, which is a well-known dataset for Motor Imagery.

  abstract  = {Transformer neural network (TNN) has demonstrated its remarkable capacity to analyze and discern complex sequential datasets. This approach has achieved unprecedented success, particularly in the domain of natural language processing (NLP). TNN has since consistently proven to perform remarkably in other fields where long-term dependencies in the data are prevalent. Electroencephalography (EEG) data has historically posed a challenge for even modern deep neural networks to classify as EEG is notably complex and noisy, making training laborious and time-consuming. Though, there has been significant research done recently into the application of TNNs in EEG classification, often the task involved does not infer the TNN&#39;s ability for long-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a TNN-based model for EEG-based driver vigilance monitoring, emphasizing the classification of driver vigilance states. This study utilized the data of 11 subjects taken from a public EEG dataset, focusing solely on single-channel analysis. Results indicate that the proposed TNN model can achieve average accuracies of up to 92.69\% for Single-Subject analysis, 94.09\% for Cross-Subject analysis and 74.74\% for Leave-One-Subject-Out analysis, which surpasses state-of-the-art methods. The proposed TNN model&#39;s potential lies in not only driver vigilance state monitoring but also paving the way for broader applications of biosignal processing.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring in-car VR motion sickness (VRMS) by neurophysiological signals is a formidable challenge due to unavoidable motion artifacts caused by the moving vehicle and necessary physical movements by the user to interact with the VR environment. Therefore, this paper for the first time investigates if resting-state neurophysiological features and self-reports of stress levels collected prior to exposure to a motion-simulated in-car VRMS induction platform could predict final motion sickness ratings. Our results of linear regression modeling show that the traditional EEG power spectrum was the only resting-state feature set that could predict in-car VRMS ratings. Further, the best regression result was achieved by beta power spectrum in the left parietal area with adjusted R2=22.6\% versus 11.6\% in the right. This result not only confirmed the left parietal involvement in motion sickness susceptibility observed in a previous resting-state fMRI study, but also advanced that methodology to mobile neurotechnologies, represented by mobile EEG, referenced by other types of resting-state features. Together, this study may offer a new mobile neurotechnology-based approach to predict passengers&#39; VRMS levels before they start to use VR apps in a moving vehicle.},

  abstract  = {This study proposes a novel approach that com-bines stacking ensemble learning with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs) to enhance the classification accuracy of Motor Imagery (MI) tasks in supporting individuals with injuries or impairments, enabling more effective rehabilitation and assistance. The method integrates both structural and functional connectivity information to leverage the benefits of GCNNs and ensemble learning techniques. The BCI Com-petition IV-2a dataset is used for evaluation. The approach employs a stacked ensemble model consisting of nine baseline models and six combining meta-models, including Logistic Re-gression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Gradient Boosting Machine. By leveraging information from both structural and functional connectivity, the GCNNs extract meaningful features from MI data, leading to improved classification accuracy. The stacking ensemble learning technique combines multiple GCNN models trained on different connectivity aspects, resulting in a robust and accurate classifier. The fusion of structural connectivity (ADJ-CNNM) capturing anatomical connections and functional connectivity (PLV-CNNM) measuring brain activity synchronization enables a comprehensive analysis of MI data. The proposed approach effectively captures both local and global connectivity patterns, addressing the challenges associated with MI data analysis. By considering both types of connectivity, a holistic understanding of the dynamics of the underlying brain network during MI tasks is achieved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy of 86.23\% with K-Nearest Neighbor as the meta-model. Comparisons with state-of-the-art and baseline methods on the same dataset validate the approach&#39;s superiority, emphasizing the importance of GCNNs and stacking ensemble learning for accurate MI task classification.},

  abstract  = {The last decade has seen significant changes in the power grid complexity due to the increased integration of multiple heterogeneous distributed energy resources. Accurate and fast power flow analysis tools have then become essential to guarantee grid stability, reliable operation, strategic planning, and market strategies. State-of-the-art approaches to power flow analysis are based on iterative numerical techniques which exhibit high accuracy but slow-, or even no-, convergence. For this reason, researchers have investigated the use of data-driven techniques that, while exhibiting lower accuracy with respect to iterative numerical ones, have the advantage of being extremely fast. To address the lack of accuracy, physics-informed data-driven techniques, i.e., techniques that leverage both the data and domain knowledge to generate simultaneously fast and accurate models, have been proposed. Nevertheless, these works exhibit two main limitations: i) they do not fully leverage the physical knowledge, and ii) they do not fairly compare the different approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel physics informed data-driven model able to address both limitations by fully leveraging the physical knowledge into the data-driven, i.e., constraining the model and augmenting the available data, and proposing a framework able to fairly compare the different approaches proving the actual effectiveness of the proposal. Results on the IEEE 57 realistic power network will support the proposal.},

This paper proposes an effective algorithm based on neural networks to take advantage of these investment products. The proposed algorithm constructs a portfolio that contains a pair of negatively correlated assets. A deep neural network, which outputs the allocation weight of each asset at a time interval, is trained to maximize the Sharpe ratio. A novel loss term is proposed to regulate the network&#39;s bias towards a specific asset, thus enforcing the network to learn an allocation strategy that is close to a minimum variance strategy. Extensive experiments were conducted using data collected from Binance spanning 19 months to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The backtest results show that the proposed algorithm can produce neural networks that are able to make profits in different market situations.},

  abstract  = {Time series anomaly detection is a binary classification problem with unbalanced data, which aims to identify data that fall outside of the normal behaviors. Since the proportion of the abnormal data is very small, the cost of labeling all data is prohibitively high. Therefore, unsupervised methods are more suitable than supervised methods. With the rapid development of deep learning, various multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on deep learning have been proposed. However, existing methods do not fully capture the spatial-temporal correlations and are not robust to noise. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method called Orthogonal Self-Attention Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Networks (OSVAE-GAN). To fully extract the spatial-temporal correlations, we use an orthogonal self-attention (OS) mechanism. Moreover, to increase the capability to deal with complex multivariate data, we integrate two generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, to reduce the influence of noise, we introduce the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Experiments are conducted on five public datasets, which show that the proposed method is superior to the existing methods.},

The AC2CD uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our ablation study method adheres to the principles of explainable artificial intelligence, focusing on assessing performance factors, including execution time, memory usage, and GPU utilization. We carried out experiments using two real-world datasets: Email-Eu-Core (EC), an email network among members of a European research institution (comprising 1,005 nodes, 25,571 edges, and 42 communities) available through the Stanford Snap Project, and a High School contact and friendship network (HS) in Marseilles, France, from December 2013 (comprising 329 nodes, 45,047 edges, and nine communities), obtainable from the Socio Patterns Website. We evaluated performance while considering three hyperparameters: learn_rate (LR), batch_size (BS), and n_games (NG), varying them at 10\%, 30\%, 50\%, and 70\%. The LR of 70\% yielded optimal results with execution time for both EC and HS datasets. Furthermore, a BS of 70\% indicated an ideal balance between execution time, GPU usage, and memory consumption for the HS dataset.},

Telemetry data of open-access datasets are converted to simulated radar tracks to generate a pool of heterogeneous trajectories and construct three independent datasets to train, validate, and test the proposed architecture. The network is composed of two main components: i) a deep network that predicts the class associated to the input trajectories and ii) a set of deep experts models that learns the extreme bounds of the trajectories in different future time steps. The proposed approach is tested and compared with different deep models to verify its effectiveness under different flight profiles and time-windows.},

  abstract  = {Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder in humans worldwide. While extensive research has focused on machine learning methods for ADHD detection and diagnosis. Most methods rely on high-cost equipment and trained staff for data collection, e.g., Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) machine and Electroencephalography (EEG) patch. Therefore, low-cost sensors-based easy-to-process methods for ADHD detection by exploiting action and behavior symptoms are required. We present that skeleton-based action recognition has the potential to address the application due to the action-focused nature of ADHD. Hence, this work proposes a novel ADHD detection system with a privacy-mitigating skeleton-based action recognition framework by utilizing our new real multi-modal ADHD dataset. Compared to the conventional methods, the proposed method shows cost efficiency and significant performance improvement. This method also outperforms the conventional methods in accuracy and AUC on the real multi-modal dataset. Furthermore, our proposed method based on simple non-wearable sensors is widely applicable for ADHD screening.},
