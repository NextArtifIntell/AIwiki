  abstract  = {Density-based clustering methods such as DBSCAN are known to be robust against outliers in data; however, they are sensitive to user-specified parameters, the selection of which are not trivial. In this paper, the user-defined parameters of DBSCAN are evolved using a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QGA). The quantum-bit or Q-bit representation of a partition is an improvement over the more popular binary label-based representations and real-coded representation of partition cluster centers. A resulting algorithm called DBSCAN-QGA in the relational data space is proposed, and three different fitness functions are devised to evaluate partitions both in terms of cluster compactness and separation, and the relative number of entities classified as noise. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to synthetic and benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository with encouraging results.},

  abstract  = {A novel nanobiosensing framework named “in vivo computation” has been proposed recently, where the challenge of early tumor detection is overcome from an optimization perspective. The biological gradient field (BGF) triggered by the tumor lesion is viewed as the optimizable objective function with the tumor site being the global optimum. The externally manipulable nanorobots playing the role of agents are manipulated in the search space (i.e., the vascular network of high-risk tissue). Several computational strategies have been proposed to realize tumor targeting by overcoming the in vivo constraints which focused on the tumor detection process without any emphasis on the nanorobots aggregation at the tumor. In this paper, we focus on the utilization rate of agents, which means to improve the percentage of nanorobots that detect the tumor site after it has been found by the first arrival agent (i.e., the nanorobot that detects the tumor at the earliest), and the solution set search, which means to find the tumor region as whole as possible. This process is interpreted as the exploitation process of in vivo computation. An exploitation approach named center-aided weak priority evolution strategy (CWP-ES) is developed for the setting of nanorobot moving direction in this paper. In the approach, a direction generated by the center of agents that have found the tumor mixed with the direction generated by the weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) proposed in the previous work is used to steer the motion of nanorobots that have not detected the tumor. Several numerical experiments are performed in a 3D search space to show the effectiveness of this novel computational nanobiosensing approach in three BGF landscapes with different degrees of optimization complexity.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a novel decomposition method: Adjacent Intensity Matrix with Linkage Identification (AIM-LI) for large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) in noisy environments. The most advanced differential grouping (DG)-based methods such as DG2, Recursive DG, and dual DG are environmentally sensitive, and the presence of noise may misguide these methods to identify the originally separable decision variables as non-separable. Although the noise may affect the absolute intensity of interactions, we can detect the intensity between separable and non-separable decision variables with potential relative differences. This difference can help us classify the separability. Based on this hypothesis, we define the interaction intensity of pairwise decision variables and save them to AIM. A significant intensity (SI) is selected from AIM to transform the AIM into the dependency structure matrix (DSM). To verify the feasibility of AIM-LI, we first run the pre-experiments and mathematically analyze the possibility of interaction identification in noisy environments. Furthermore, we implement a decomposition experiment on CEC2013 with different strengths of noise. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposal has great potential to detect and classify the separability of problems in noisy environments.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) is a critical and challenging combinatorial optimisation problem. Genetic programming (GP) has been widely used to learn scheduling heuristics for DFJSS automatically. Ideally, we prefer to have effective and small scheduling heuristics which tend to be easy to be interpreted. However, the effectiveness and the sizes of scheduling heuristics are conflicting, and reducing the rule sizes tends to worsen the effectiveness of scheduling heuristics. This is a typical multi-objective optimisation problem. However, the existing studies in multi-objective DFJSS consider the effectiveness-related objectives only such as minimising max-flowtime and mean-flowtime rather than interpretability-related objectives such as rule size. To fill this gap, this paper aims to propose an interpretability-aware multi-objective GP to learn a well-distributed Pareto-front of scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. This paper first adopts a multi-objective GP algorithm with α-dominance and archive from a routing problem to DFJSS. Then, we propose to use traditional dominance relation based Pareto front for α and archive updating and an objective normalisation based α-dominance sorting strategy to further improve the performance of the adopted multi-objective GP. The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art multi-objective GP algorithms in different DFJSS scenarios.},

In this study, we adapt an existing creative framework, AntsOMG, for composing Second Species Counterpoint in order to conduct an investigation on music style forming and twisting, thereby gaining insights into the crucial mechanisms and essential components of a creation process that leverages the white-box property, potentially enabling machines to incrementally learn complex, multilayered structures from a computational perspective. Step by step, we demonstrate how the target task is accomplished by expanding the base framework and exploiting its white-box property. Our implementation is capable of producing the outcomes that exhibit the desired effect, indicating a promising line of research on investigating into the use of white-box AI methodologies in the field of computational creativity, along with the forming of machines&#39; own styles, perhaps even aesthetics in the future, based on autonomous development of complex knowledge.},

This yields a large variety of puzzles and an enormous state space to be searched through. Recently, the Feature Space Search algorithm has shown great results in Sokoban, which apart from the rule modification shares many similarities to Baba is You. It uses multiple heuristics to guide the search into promising regions of the search space. In this work, we are proposing a similar concept for solving Baba is You based on multiple heuristics that are aggregated for guiding a tree-based search process. However, finding parameters for weighting/prioritizing the different heuristics is a non-trivial task. This process is done, by applying evolutionary algorithms for single- and multi-objective optimization. Specifically, we compare the effects of these different optimization schemes on the agents&#39; general level-solving capabilities. In all cases, the agent was able to adapt well to the training and test set with no significant differences among the optimization schemes. Compared with state-of-the-art Baba is You agents our search-based approach shows an improved performance in terms of the number of levels being solved, as well as a reduction in the average time required to solve a level.},

Due to the characteristics of high-dimensional search space and sparse Pareto optimal solutions, most existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms encounter difficulties in solving this kind of optimization problems. In this paper, a sparsity-guided elitism co-evolutionary framework, namely SGECF, is proposed. At each generation, SGECF first performs k-means clustering on non-dominated solutions to calculate the present best sparsity. Then, SGECF divides the population into a winner subpopulation and two loser subpopulations based on the Pareto dominance relationship and the present best sparsity. In the process of offspring reproduction, the winner subpopulation generates offspring solutions using conventional genetic operators, and the two loser subpopulations reproduce offspring solutions under the guidance of the present best sparsity and decision variable importance. In the experiments, the performance of SGECF is investigated on eight benchmark problems and a real-world application. Experimental results show that SGECF is superior over four state-of-the-art algorithms.},

To deal with expensive multiobjective optimization problems, many extensions of EI have been proposed. Among them, expected Tchebycheff improvement (ETI) is a representative approach. Unfortunately, the calculation of exact ETI values remains a challenging task when leveraging Gaussian process models to model each objective. Therefore, approximation methods are commonly employed. However, the estimation error of these methods cannot be fully determined without the aid of exact formulas. Borrowing the idea of the exact formulas previously developed for the computation of multi-point EI in single-objective BO, this article gives an exact formula for the computation of ETI with any number of objectives. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the performance of our exact formula and a commonly- used approximation method. Considering the similarity of ETI and multi-point EI, we also extend the approximation method designed for ETI to estimate the values of multi-point EI efficiently.},

Typical deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting, in which knowledge of past tasks is drastically lost when learning new tasks, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is no exception. One of the promising methods for continual learning are replay-based methods. However, they are prone to overfitting, harming generalization. Meanwhile, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is an algorithm widely used for combinatorial optimization problems and has been applied to the structural optimization of LSTM. In this study, we propose a continual learning method for LSTM using ACO to reduce catastrophic forgetting. The method iteratively optimizes the internal structure of the LSTM in parallel with the training of the current task, using the model performance as fitness. It also extends the replay-based method and utilizes two kinds of memory buffers to reduce overfitting to the memory. The proposed method was tested on four benchmark problems, and the results indicate its effectiveness, especially in the small memory size scenarios.},

This article presents two variants of the pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm respectively for the stochastic optimizations with and without ISR penalties. Both variants use a repository to maintain the historical individuals with local optima and a multi-strategy evolutionary game mechanism to promote the balances between explorations and exploitations in the corresponding search space. The second variant also uses the repository to reallocate infeasible solutions into feasible regions and motivate the pigeons moving faster to reduce the unneccessary trials during the optimizations. The performances of the first PIO variant have been evaluated on CEC&#39;2017 benchmark functions, while a simple example of vehicular control is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the second variant on the SOP solving with minimal ISR touches.},

These works use task-specific fitness functions rewarding the accomplishment of the respective collective decision-making task. But task-independent rewards, such as for prediction error minimization, may promote the emer-gence of diverse and innovative solutions. We evolve collective decision-making mechanisms using a task-specific fitness function rewarding correct robot opinions, a task-independent reward for prediction accuracy, and a hybrid fitness function combining the two previous. In our simulations, we use the collective perception scenario, that is, robots must collectively determine which of two environmental features is more frequent. We show that evolution successfully optimizes fitness in all three scenarios, but that only the task-specific fitness function and the hybrid fitness function lead to the emergence of collective decision-making behaviors. In benchmark experiments, we show the competitiveness of the evolved decision-making mechanisms to the voter model and the majority rule and analyze the scalability of the decision-making mechanisms with problem difficulty.},

A service function chain, which is made up of a set of ordered virtual network functions, can serve as the network function virtualization equivalent of a service. Allocating resources at servers is one of the most challenging problems in network function virtualization because of resource restrictions and the increasing number of services/requests. This paper considers the path planning for service function chain requests in network function virtualization to maximize the number of accepted requests. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem to find the optimal solution. However, the formulated Mixed Integer Linear Programming becomes complex to solve with increasing decision variables and constraints with increased network size. Since the problem is NP-hard, we propose the genetic programming-based algorithm to obtain near-optimal solutions to the problem efficiently. The links&#39; bandwidth and servers&#39; resources are considered during the service function chain routing. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is very close to the optimum and outperforms existing works concerning the service acceptance ratio.},

These techniques, known as mitigation methods, are aimed at post-processing the quantum outcome without working at quantum hardware level. Among the most error-prone operations on the current quantum devices, there is surely the quantum measurement. Currently, the most popular mitigation method for quantum measurement error consists of computing a so-called mitigation matrix to be applied on the results outputted by a quantum processor to transform them and make them closer to the ideal ones. In this paper, a new measurement error mitigation method based on a competent memetic algorithm is proposed to generate an appropriate mitigation matrix. As shown in the experimental session, the proposed measurement error mitigation method shows better results when compared with the conventional method and the state of the art among the evolutionary approaches.},

  abstract  = {Differential evolution is an efficient and robust optimizer. However, DE still has the problems of evolutionary stagnation and inappropriate generated control parameters. In the search behavior of each individual in the past population, some valuable historical information for future evolution may be hidden, which can help the optimizer solve these problems. Based on the above consideration, we propose a historical information based differential evolution (HIDE). In our algorithm, a new mechanism is established to judge whether an individual is in stagnation, and a new mutation strategy based on discarded parent vectors from different periods is proposed to help the stagnant individuals escape from the local optimum. Meanwhile, we designed a new update method for control parameters based on historical information. Compared with the mainstream schemes, the parameters generated by our method are more suitable for the current function. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we compared HIDE with eight advanced variants on the CEC 2017 test platform. The experimental results show that the quality of the solution provided by HIDE is better than that of other variants.},

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is essential to evolutionary computation algorithms (ECA). The PSO has some drawbacks as premature convergence and stagnation at local minima. Inertia weight is a parameter that controls the global and local exploration and exploitation capability in the PSO by determining the influence of the previous velocity on its current motion. This article proposes using a stagnation counter that verifies the times the PSO is stuck in the same fitness value. In the proposed fuzzy controlled PSO with stagnation coefficient (FCPSO), a fuzzy controller is designed to tune the inertia weight based on the population&#39;s diversity and the search&#39;s stagnation. This modification allows the PSO to escape from suboptimal values enhancing its search capabilities. The FCPSO is tested over 28 benchmark functions in 50 dimensions. Besides, it has been compared with nine optimization algorithms from the state-of-the-art. The experiments and comparisons suggest that the FCPSO is an interesting tool for solving complex optimization problems.},

It uses multi qubits to indicate a bacterium, and uses an adaptive quantum rotation gate to simulate the chemotaxis phenomenon in the classical bacterial algorithm to achieve bacterial state update. It also introduces the bacterial health degree, which is used to record the cumulative sum of fitness of each bacterium. To avoid falling into local optimal solutions, the elimination-dispersal operation is considered. Finally, the quantum bacterial population is collapsed into a ground state population by measurement to get the solution of the optimization problem. The numerical results prove that the proposed scheme outperforms the traditional schemes in pilot assignment and AP selection, and can effectively improve the average downlink throughput of the system.},

  abstract  = {Since we cannot guarantee that the global optimal solution is included within a “pre-determined” search space in unknown problems such as real world problems, this paper addresses the “unbounded” search space exploration in swarm optimization. For this issue, this paper proposes the following three methods that dynamically extend the search area: Dynamic Search Area Exploration based on Gradient (DSAEG), which preferentially searches the area of a high gradient of solution space, Dynamic Search Area Exploration based on Novelty (DSAE-N), which preferentially searches the area where is far from the current search area, and Dynamic Search Area Exploration based on Gradient and Novelty (DSAE-GN), which integrates DSAE-G with DSAE-N. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed three methods, this paper evaluates them in the six multi-modal optimization problems by applying them into Niching Migratory Multi-Swarm Optimiser (NMMSO) based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The intensive comparison of the proposed methods with NMMSO have been revealed the following implications: (1) DSAE-GN quickly finds almost of the global optimal solutions regardless of the shape of the evaluation function while DSAE-G and DSAE-N cannot always find them; and (2) DSAE-GN can find almost of the global optimal solutions even if the search area is not given, while NMMSO cannot find them even if the search area which contains all global optimal solutions is given.},

It is a commonly-used idea that large scale optimization problems are often transformed into small scale optimization problems that can be solved by existing optimization methods. In this paper, we investigate an improved version of MOEA/D with dimensionality reduction for large-scale multiobjective optimization, denoted by LS-MOEA/D-GSD. The major ideas in our proposed method focus on two aspects. On the one hand, the original search space of LSMOPs is transformed into a small-scale MOP on weight variables of several guided search directions via the genetic operators in differential evolution. On the other hand, the computational resources are allocated to both the original search space and reduced search space. Some experiments are conducted to test the performance of our proposed algorithm on the well-known large scale multiobjective test suites, i.e., LSMOP1-9 with up to 1000 variables. Our experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for large scale multiobjective optimization.},

This kind of problem is considered challenging. This work is then on the solution of the Bilevel Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (BiMDVRP), in which multiple depots need to deliver cargo to cover the demand of many retailers subject to the production plants to meet the demand of each depot optimally. A hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the aforementioned bilevel planning problem is proposed in this work. We use the available information on the problem to implement heuristic mechanisms to improve the results reported by state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose a representation based on groups for the feasible configuration of each depot, due to constraints related to a depot being satisfied.

In CCMRO, a contribution-based subcomponent merging strategy is proposed to deal with the decomposition of the large-scale overlapping problem and reduce the interaction of subgroups. In addition, a new computational resource allocation strategy (CCRO) is designed to maintain a balance between the full allocation of computational resources and the stability of search speed.

  abstract  = {Dynamic portfolio optimization is a crucial but complex task due to financial market dynamics and the difficulty of disentangling noise from substantial changes in stock prices. In most existing methods, portfolios are re-optimized, hence re-balanced, at pre-specified time periods, return properties of each asset are dynamically computed, and portfolio weights are optimized according to an objective function. We propose a novel algorithm for dynamic portfolio optimization with a two-step signaling mechanism for re-balancing the portfolio including the optimization of re-balancing points and portfolio weights. The first step signals portfolio re-balancing only if there is a substantial price change in one or more of the portfolio constituents. These substantial price changes are defined according to directional change (DC) methods. DC methods create an intrinsic time series for each asset according to whether or not the change in the asset price exceeds a threshold level, hence removing part of the noise in asset prices. The second signaling mechanism uses genetic algorithms (GA) to assess if re-balancing is indeed profitable at each point indicated by the first signaling mechanism. The genetic algorithm is set up such that it simultaneously optimizes the weights of the re-balanced portfolio. For GA, we input the asset price summaries retrieved from DC methods to ensure that the GA can learn from the relatively less noisy data compared to observed asset prices. We show that the GA fit function can be set up to include several conventional trading strategies. As a first step, we apply the proposed method to a portfolio of 30 assets including 29 Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and one risk-free asset where daily prices are observed during the period between 2 January 2018 and 30 December 2021. Second, we apply the method to 100 individual stocks for the same time period. We compare the obtained portfolio results with benchmarks, such as the simple buy and hold strategy of the S&amp;P 500 index, the naive $1/N$ portfolio, and a minimum variance portfolio in terms of standard portfolio evaluation methods including the Sharpe ratio.},

The grasping formation of UAVs over the payload emerges from the synthetic behaviours in the architecture without any path planning. Experiments show that our proposed design can be successfully applied in searching and coverage of various loads and has been validated in the real world through the use of Crazyflie micro-UAVs. Furthermore, the proposed grasping formation satisfies static equilibrium thereby reducing orientation changes in the load-swarm system during transportation.},

Our goal is simple: to alternate through diverse controllers as the simulation progresses. To this end, we consider some simple sequence-based selection HHs and test them across 13 scenarios. Instead of the customary low-level heuristics, we use predefined controllers that were previously tuned through a Genetic Algorithm. For the most part, at least one of the proposed models outperforms the best available controller.

The aim is to use ISA to determine how these features affect the performance of the algorithms and how they can be used for automated algorithm selection. We also consider algorithm selection using multinomial logistic regression models with $l_{1}-\mathbf{penalty}$ for comparison. Different algorithm performance metrics are considered and we found that the choice of these metrics affected whether the use of ISA was worthwhile.

Here, we consider a more general model that allows multiple weighted thresholds, and propose three novel trading strategies built within the DC paradigm. To optimize the weights of the thresholds, we use a genetic algorithm and manage to find strategies that outperform previously known single-threshold strategies under the common efficiency metrics. Furthermore, our method manages to create profitable trading strategies that outperform some traditional ones, such as buy-and-hold, MACD, and RSI.},

This paper considers a constructive online learning HH with an agent population selection and control strategy for each heuristic with a reward-punishment approach based on a mean absolute deviation criterion and exploitation-exploration stages to optimize these phases in the optimization process. We compare our proposal, denominated Hyper-heuristic based on the mean absolute deviation metric and the exploration-exploitation stages for the population management (HH-MAD) using uni-modal, multi-modal, composite, and shifted benchmark functions among different optimization algorithms.

  abstract  = {Directional changes (DC) have been shown to form an effective approach in algorithmic trading by converting fixed time series into event-based series and focusing on key events. Previous work has focused on forecasting the inflection point in the market and proposing new indicators under the DC framework, with just a handful of papers concerned with training and using DC indicators through machine learning. Earlier research has shown that genetic programming (GP) combining DC and physical time indicators could achieve positive returns with low risk. However, the fitness function used in that work is simply a risk-adjusted return. In this paper, we investigate whether a multi-objective optimisation approach could improve the performance of GP-based strategies in the market. We evaluate the cumulative return, risk, and rate of return of the proposed approach under 110 datasets from 10 different markets. Furthermore, we compare the proposed strategy against GP-based single objective optimisation (SOO) and buy-and-hold strategies. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the cumulative return compared to SOO, from 14.29\% to 62.04\%, while also outperforming the buy-and-hold strategy.},

  abstract  = {The constrained multiobjective optimization problem (CMOP) is common in the real-world applications that need to simultaneously optimize conflicting objectives under certain constraints. In the past two decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to designing constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) for solving the CMOP. However, as the constraints become more complex, CMOEAs encounter a significant challenge of finding a set of well-distributed Pareto optimal solutions. The infeasible regions caused by the constraints become a major challenge in solving the CMOP since they hinder the population from moving toward the constrained Pareto front. The landscape of infeasible regions plays a significant role in the CMOP but is not well-studied. The present study aims to explore the influences of different landscapes of infeasible regions on the difficulty in solving a CMOP. To this end, we propose an approach to adjusting the landscapes through weights and present the MOEA/D-WSCV that enables the adjustment accordingly. The experimental results show that the inverted generation distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV) obtained from MOEA/D-WSCV vary with weights, indicating the influences of infeasible regions upon the difficulty in solving CMOPs.},

Reinforcement learning aims to find a policy capable of pursuing high return through policy optimization. Evolutionary multitasking is an emerging technique in evolutionary computation field, and it has been proved to be effective in handling multiple complicated optimization problems. This study proposes a novel policy search method: the symbiosis in biocoenosis optimization for reinforcement learning (SBO-RL). The SBO-RL is composed of three main features. First, the SBO-RL copes with multiple RL problems concurrently. Second, the SBO-RL integrates evolutionary-based policy optimization with policy gradient into symbiosis in biocoenosis optimization. Third, the SBO-RL transfers actors across domains by a simple domain adaptation strategy. The present study conducts experiments to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show the SBO-RL can improve the quality and convergence of advanced policy-gradient and policy-search based deep reinforcement learning methods. Results also discover that the SBO-RL is capable of saving 50.06\% and 31.15\% computational cost for advanced deep reinforcement learning methods.},

However, the recombination operator in the existing multi-objective optimization algorithm is difficult to find the local optimal solution and the global optimal solution in the huge decision space due to the low search efficiency. To get the best trade-off between exploration and exploitation during the evolutionary search process, this paper proposes an elite-guided evolutionary algorithm for large-scale multi-objective optimization. The proposed algorithm adopts a recombination operator with a novel search strategy that explicitly utilizes local similarity neighborhood property between the population in the decision space and the objective space to guide the individuals to generate a diversity approximation of the Pareto front, which can highly promote the search efficiency. The experimental results on a variety of general large-scale benchmark problems demonstrate the competitiveness and effectiveness of the developed algorithm over several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

This paper is focused on selecting a subset from excess non-dominated solutions for evolutionary or the final output. However, traditional selection methods in classical MOEAs encounter difficulties when dealing with candidate solutions that possess irregular topologies. Although the distance-based subset selection methods are not sensitive to the topologies of the candidate points, they have significant room for reducing computational complexity. In order to address the above issues, a subspace selection method is proposed in this paper. It partitions the objective space into multiple subspaces that have comparable volumes and shapes. The maximal minimum distance of each solution is considered to ensure that the sparsest solution is always chosen first. To save computational costs, only the solutions in the neighboring subspaces are taken into account. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed subspace selection method outperforms classical selection methods in solving problems with various shapes of the Pareto front.},

However, existing methods usually require millions of fitness evaluations to construct good approximations. Within the evolutionary computation and machine learning communities, the use of surrogates has shown to decrease the number of fitness evaluations while achieving state-of-the-art results. Despite the gained traction of surrogate-assisted algorithms, their use within the computational art community is nonexistent. To address this, we extend the previous work of Bayesian Optimization by density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the image approximation task. By estimating the probability of improvement acquisition function using a convolutional probabilistic classifier, we search for solutions that maximize the acquisition function using an evolutionary strategy. By conducting experiments on six different styled target images, we demonstrate the superior performance achieved with the use of surrogate assistance.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) have brought great challenges to the traditional evolutionary optimization algorithms because of their constantly changing Pareto set(PS) and Pareto front(PF). In order to track the change of PS and PF quickly and keep the diversity of population, prediction-based methods have shown great prospects. However, most of the current methods utilize linear models to predict the changing PS. When the PS between different environments has nonlinear relationship, this kind of method can not accurately predict the PS at a new environment. In this paper, a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm based on long short-term memory network (LSTM) prediction is proposed. In this algorithm, The first step is to calculate the center point of the obtained PS. The center points at different time form a time series. Then the LSTM model is trained by using the time series as training samples. Moreover, the center of the new PS are predicted by the obtained model. Because LSTM can make full use of historical information and fit the nonlinear relationship between the PS, the prediction accuracy can be guaranteed. Finally, a population generation strategy is used to generate an initialized population with both convergence and diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested on DF benchmark function. Experiments results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively handle DMOPs and has shown its superiorityin comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.},

This task contains different variations and is the object of attention of many researchers. However, the existing formulation of practical optimization tasks in industrial production processes significantly exceeds the limits of classical RSPCP formulation, academic frameworks like PSPLib and datasets like RG300. It is expressed in the presence of additional parameters (degrees of freedom), uncertainty in the actual data of parameters of the solving task and the dimensionality of the problems themselves. A striking example of such production processes is the capital construction of complex facilities, such as capital projects (construction of capital assets) or airport operation, where activities can exceed tens of thousands, have fuzzy connections, form sub-sets of tasks, and be performed by complex teams that have different types of resources in their disposal. The formulation of such problems not only opens up the opportunities to develop new modifications of existing algorithms but also allows us to evaluate the practical feasibility of using such algorithms on dimensions orders of times higher than the generally accepted test sets. In the current research, we introduce problem extension MLRCPSP - multi-resource-constrained project scheduling problem and a new generalized algorithm that can take into account the features of actual production processes and demonstrates how effective it could be in application to synthetically generated data from real practical applications, using an extended state-of-the-art implementation of the genetic algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Quantum machine learning is a research area that explores the interplay of ideas from quantum computing and machine learning to speed up the time it takes to train or evaluate a machine learning model. Variational quantum classifiers are among the most widely used quantum models for supervised machine learning and base their operation on learning free parameters through conventional optimization algorithms. In spite of their potential benefits, there is a design issue making quantum variational classifiers not fully operative: the existence of exponentially vanishing gradients, known as “barren plateau landscapes”. A barren plateau is a trainability problem that occurs in optimization algorithms for quantum machine learning when the problem-solving space turns flat as the algorithm is run. In that situation, the algorithm cannot find the downward slope in what appears to be a featureless landscape and there&#39;s no clear path to the optimum of the cost function. In this challenging scenario, evolutionary optimization techniques can be a viable choice in solving the problem because of their gradient independence. This paper introduces a comparative study involving different evolutionary algorithms to assess their suitability in acting as optimizer for a specific quantum machine learning method, known as variational quantum classifier.},

The primary constraint to increasing airport capacity is the required separation minima between pairs of aircraft arriving through the same approach routes. RECAT-EU is a revised global wake separation minima scheme released by EUROCONTROL in 2018. This suggested a reduction in separation minima between certain aircraft pairs while maintaining safety levels. However, it increases in separation minima scheme complexity by doubling the number of non-minimum radar separation (MRS) values. In this work, a Meta-Heuristic based optimization model is proposed to sequence arrival flights based on the RECAT-EU separation scheme, which can provide an optimized vectoring to ensure flights absorb their assigned delays before reaching the final approach fix. Findings show that the proposed model is able to generate an optimized landing sequence for 50 arrival flights in a computation time of 16 seconds. It also suggests that the proposed algorithm&#39;s computational time increases linearly with increasing the number of flights. Furthermore, trajectory vectoring results demonstrate that 85\% of the assigned delays could be absorbed by flying the proposed vectored trajectories.},

  abstract  = {In order to solve huge-scale optimization problems, many evolutionary algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce Block Differential Evolution (BDE) algorithm. The BDE can be categorized into the class of memory-efficient optimization algorithms. The main contribution is to solve large and huge-scale problems effectively and efficiently by reducing the problem dimension by utilizing a dimension-blocking scheme. With respect to the block size times reduced memory usage, furthermore, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient because DE operations (i.e., mutation, crossover, and selection) are performed on much smaller vector sizes. In fact, the employed blocking approach helps us to map the higher-dimensional problems into a lower-dimensional one which is more convenient to process during the optimization steps. There is a great demanding potential for the proposed approach to be utilized in embedded systems with low computational resources as a compressed optimization algorithm. This strategy is instantiated and evaluated on some well-known benchmark problems and compared with the baseline classic DE algorithm; the reported results are promising and encouraging for conducting further investigations. To the best of our knowledge, that is the first time a variable blocking scheme has been used in any meta-heuristic algorithm. A detailed explanation of the geometrical behavior of the proposed blocking approach is provided which explains how in a higher search space, a blocking approach is meaningful and applicable to accelerate convergence rate while the memory saving is huge. The reported results in this paper show the experiments on Large-Scale Global Optimization Problems proposed in CEC-2013 benchmark suite with 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 dimensions and clearly are evidence of the possibility of satisfying two conflicting objectives, namely, efficiency and effectiveness, simultaneously. In order to utilize CEC-2013 benchmark problems for the huge dimensions 10,000D and 100,000D, some modifications and expansions have been done. The proposed approach can be utilized in another population-based optimization algorithm (swarm or evolutionary), and it is not restricted to the DE algorithm. In this paper, DE has been used as a parent algorithm for our conducted case study.},

  abstract  = {The research on expensive multiobjective optimization has attracted particular attention in the area of multiobjective evolutionary computation. Many existing multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are only suited for small-scale expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) with less than ten decision variables. The main reason lies in the fact that some optimization techniques used in expensive MOEAs, such as Gaussian Process (GP), are not applicable for exploring high-dimensional search space. The naive way to overcome this difficulty is to convert a high-dimensional expensive MOP into a low-dimensional MOP, which can be solved by existing expensive MOEAs efficiently. In this paper, we investigate the combination of MOEA/D with a weighted optimization framework (WOF) and GP, denoted by MOEA/D-WOFGP, for solving high-dimensional expensive MOPs, where the WOF converts a high-dimensional MOP into a low-dimensional search space of weight variables, and the GP-based learning method is used to predict high-quality solutions within a limited number of function evaluations. Some experiments are conducted to compare the performance of MOEA/D-WOFGP with other expensive MOEAs assisted by variable grouping. Our experimental results show that MOEA/D-WOFGP is advantageous when dealing with high-dimensional expensive MOPs.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection is a frequent task in machine learning problems. Typically, many features are available, but only a subset is relevant, while others can be redundant or even destructive to classification accuracy. Therefore, removing these additional features is essential to reduce the dimensionality, improve classification accuracy and select discriminating features for the treated problem is essential. Filter feature selection methods use statistical tests to evaluate the “relevance” of features and are usually fast, while wrapper methods require a learning algorithm to evaluate a subset of features. Consequently, they are slower than filter methods. Naturally, the choice of the feature subset plays a crucial role, but testing all combinations for problems containing many features is impractical. Therefore, feature selection can be treated as an optimization problem to select the best feature subset that maximizes the learning algorithm&#39;s accuracy. Meta-heuristic algorithms have achieved great attention in solving innumerable optimization problems, including feature selection. Here we propose a new wrapper feature selection method that explores filter-based feature ranking algorithms, Differential Evolution, and multi-objective optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed method improved the base classifiers&#39; performance with fewer selected features and outperformed the state-of-art algorithms for almost all evaluated datasets.},

  abstract  = {The nuclear shell model is one of the most adopted many-body methods for the description of atomic nuclei whose main ingredient is the effective Hamiltonian. One of the approaches widely used to derive it is of phenomenological type, where its matrix elements are considered parameters to be fixed to reproduce the experimental data. However, the number of parameters as well as the number of experimental data dramatically increases with the mass of the nuclei under investigation and the commonly adopted procedures such as least-square fitting become computationally prohibitive. Therefore, there is a strong emergence in finding alternative approaches to construct effective Hamiltonians for heavy nuclei. To pave the way in this direction, the proposed work exploits for the very first time Genetic Algorithms. Indeed, their ability to simultaneously examine and manipulate sets of possible solutions could be crucial to deal with the above issues. The suitability of Genetic Algorithms in computing effective Hamiltonians is evaluated experimentally for the p - shell interaction, where the obtained results, without any physical constraint on the parameters, outperform the current widely-adopted description represented by the Cohen and Kurath solution.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection is an important data processing technique, aiming to reduce the redundant and irrelevant features of data. However, as the number of features increases, feature selection algorithms based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) face the challenges of low search efficiency and huge computational consumption due to the enormous search space. A recently proposed bi-directional feature fixation (BDFF) framework for PSO has shown its effectiveness in solving high-dimensional feature selection problems, but it may mislead the particles to search in the wrong direction and requires a long time to find a small feature subset. Utilizing the prior knowledge of feature selection is expected to further enhance the performance of BDFF. Therefore, this paper first designs two tasks to introduce the prior knowledge of feature selection into BDFF while retaining its global search ability. Then, the multitasking bi-directional PSO (MBDPSO) is proposed by combining BDFF and the evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) technique, which can help transfer knowledge between the two tasks effectively. Experimental results on 10 public classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed MBDPSO has an excellent performance on high-dimensional feature selection problems.},

The polymerization process is one of the crucial processes in carbon fiber production. In order to improve the quality of precursor fiber and save costs, the optimization of process parameters is one of the important links. Considering the complexity of process parameter optimization, we improved an optimization method based on multi-fidelity model to solve the problem, which combined the advantages of multi-objective mechanism model and data-driven model of carbon fiber production polymerization process. On the basis of modified ordinal transformation and optimal sampling framework, we embedded a heuristic algorithm to search solution space and combined the clustering algorithm for grouping. The experimental results show that the improved multi-fidelity optimization method outperforms other multi-fidelity optimization methods.

  abstract  = {The multi-dimensional archive of phenotypic elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm is a popular evolutionary algorithm which returns a highly diverse set of elite solutions. The population is separated into a grid-like feature space defined by user-specified feature dimensions where each cell of the grid corresponds to a unique behaviour combination. The algorithm is conceptually simple and effective at producing high-quality, diverse solutions, but it comes with a major limitation on its exploratory capabilities. With every added feature, the set of solutions grows exponentially, making high-dimensional feature spaces infeasible. This work proposes a way of increasing features with the novel Age-Layered MAP-Elites (ALME) algorithm where the population is separated into age-layers and each layer has its own feature space. By using different features in the layers, the population migrates up through the layers experiencing selective pressure towards different features. This algorithm is applied to a simulated intelligent agent environment where agents are controlled by genetic programming (GP) trees to observe interesting emergent behaviours in underexplored regions of the feature space. It is observed that ALME is capable of producing a high-quality and diverse set of solutions that is competitive with traditional MAP-Elites without the combinatorial explosion in the resulting number of solutions.},

Especially within an e-commerce environment, order picking activities depend largely on the partitioning of individual customer orders into groups of orders that will be picked within a single pick tour, i.e., the order batching problem. The goal of this paper is to examine the optimization choices of the greedy seed-based batching algorithm. This algorithm follows a constructive, myopic approach in which batches are created consecutively by adding orders to the partial batch. It is widely used in different forms, but the reasons for its performance and the quality of its solution have not yet been addressed in the literature. We present a simulation study to investigate the properties of the individual pick tours that result from applying the seed-based batching algorithm. More specifically, we assess the optimality of the batching algorithm&#39;s myopic choices by comparing the myopic picking cost of orders that were the second best choice with their actual picking costs. Furthermore, we use this solution as a starting point for the variable neighborhood search algorithm to compare the cost of the myopic solutions. The results show that the decisions related to the choices of seed order, the constructive criterion to select orders to batch, and the storage policies all play major roles in the performance of the greedy seed-based algorithm.},

It measures the amount of improvement the candidates are expected to gain compared with the current best solution, based on which the best individuals will be picked for expensive evaluations. Since all the candidate individuals are measured by the current best solution when calculating the EI values, the population moves gradually towards the current best solution, which will decrease the diversity of the population. In this work, we propose a new anisotropic expected improvement (AEI) criterion to resolve this issue. Instead of comparing all the individuals with the current best solution, the proposed AEI compares the individuals with their corresponding parent solutions. By measuring the candidate individuals with different solutions, the AEI is able to bring more directions for the population to evolve, thus increase the diversity of the population. Numerical experiments show that the proposed AEI criterion performs significantly better than four state-of-the-art Kriging-based infill criteria.

  abstract  = {Recently, there has been a focus on using transfer learning to reduce the sample complexity in reinforcement learning. One component that enables transfer is an intertask mapping that relates a pair of tasks. Automatic methods attempt to learn task relationships either by evaluating all possible mappings in a brute force manner, or by using techniques such as neural networks to represent the mapping. However, brute force methods do not scale well in problems since there is an exponential number of possible mappings, and automatic methods that use complex representations generate mappings that are not always interpretable. In this paper, we describe a population-based algorithm that generates intertask mappings in a tractable amount of time. The idea is to use an explicit representation of an intertask mapping, and to combine an evolutionary algorithm with an offline evaluation scheme to search for the optimal mapping. Experiments on two transfer learning problems show that our approach is capable of finding highly-fit mappings and searching a space that is infeasible for a brute force approach. Furthermore, agents that learn using the mappings found by our approach are able to reach a performance target faster than agents that learn without transfer.},

  abstract  = {The ability to swiftly and precisely reach any user-specified target location is necessary for a robotic arm that can be used in real-world scenarios. To date, many evolutionary optimization algorithms have been used to design controllers for robotic arms. However, when designing a robotic arm to reach multiple targets, most existing methods need to evolve the control strategy from scratch for each target, rather than trying to reuse existing experience. Therefore, computational resources are repeatedly and meaninglessly consumed. To this end, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm based on knowledge transfer (GAKT) dedicated to reusing existing knowledge to optimize a new robotic arm control task. Specifically, the knowledge transfer process can be summarized into the following two steps. First, through sequential transfer, GAKT initializes the population with the help of a knowledge base constructed by a quality diversity algorithm. Second, underperforming individuals are encouraged to acquire knowledge from excellent individuals in the same generation during the optimization process. We tested the effectiveness of GAKT and investigated its average performance by selecting multiple target points in different dimensions. The results show that GAKT can find the most advantageous arrival strategy (that is, make the end of the manipulator the closest to the target) on most of the selected targets. Moreover, we conducted ablation experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness of the knowledge transfer processes.},

We then propose the modified robust optimization over time (mROOT) to solve it and optimize the process parameters, which aims to maximize PAN modulus and minimize energy consumption while decreasing the average switching cost of solutions by reducing the switching times of solutions, hoping to provide some theoretical guidance for the pre-oxidation process of carbon fiber in practical production. The experimental results show that compared with TMO and RPOOT, the solutions obtained by mROOT have longer average survival time and lower average switching cost, and compared with traditional time series prediction models, the combination of online predictor proposed in this article and mROOT is a more practical and effective method for solving the model.},

  abstract  = {Bilevel optimization problem (BLOP) refers to a class of problems with a hierarchical structure, wherein a lower level optimization problem acts as a constraint for an upper level optimization problem. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been commonly used to solve BLOPs where underlying functions are black-box or do not conform to certain mathematical properties. One of the downsides of using EAs, especially in a nested format, is the significant computational expense (number of function evaluations); and a number of strategies have been proposed to mitigate this. However, most of the existing studies in the domain of evolutionary bilevel optimization are directed towards problems with single-objective at both levels, while very few have explored BLOPs with multiple objectives at one or both levels (BLMOPs). In this study, we investigate the potential benefits of utilizing knowledge transfer by seeding initial population from neighboring solutions for solving BLMOPs. Towards this end, we construct two simple strategies, referred to as full population transfer and selective population transfer, and study their potential to improve the performance over the baseline nested EA for BLMOPs. Experimental results show that the selective transfer strategy has more reliable and competitive performance compared to baseline. Empirical analysis is presented to highlight the relevant factors that lead to the observed performance trends.},

  abstract  = {Neural architecture search (NAS) is a field that automates the architecture design of neural networks. NAS can be modeled as an optimization problem. It describes a space of possible architectures and looks for the most performing one. NAS, however, is not limited to finding the most task-accurate neural network. It can consider other objectives during the search to meet different demands and requirements (model size, latency, energy consumption, etc.). Several methods were proposed for multi-objective NAS. Most of them are either based on the scalarization of objectives, or use a Pareto-based approach. Methods based on scalarization require preference weighting between objectives and can suffer from suboptimality, while the Pareto-based methods found in NAS usually require complex operators and many parameters to tune. The goal of our work is to offer an alternative Pareto-based method that solves the above issues. In this paper, we first present a formulation of the NAS problem as a multi-objective optimization (MO) problem. We then design a dominance-based multi-objective local search (DMLS) to solve it. Unlike other NAS methods, our work uses a simple encoding, few parameters, and does not require preference weighting of objectives. To assess its performance, we evaluate this algorithm on a specialized multi-objective NAS benchmark to optimize both accuracy and network complexity. We compare it to state-of-the-art MO methods of this benchmark. Results show that our method finds significantly more Pareto optimal solutions than NGSA-II and overpasses single-objective local search for the same evaluation budget. We conclude that DMLS provides a more practical MO approach for NAS while providing superior performances.},

For each sub-problem, efficient crossover and local search heuristics are adopted to generate and improve new solutions. We design two new strategies to decrease the number of vehicles, a population management method with infeasible solutions and a multi-split strategy. Experimental studies are carried out on the well-known Solomon&#39;s dataset. Results suggest that our proposed algorithm is very competitive compared to two state-of-the-art algorithms.

  abstract  = {Recently, a number of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been proposed for large-scale multiobjective optimization. Among them, due to the high efficiency, the problem reformulation-based large-scale multiobjective optimization framework (LSMOF) has shown to be promising. By associating the weight variables with a set of specific bi-directional vectors representing search directions, LSMOF reformulates the original large-scale multiobjective optimization problem (LSMOP) into a low-dimensional single-objective optimization problem (SOP). For the reformulated SOP, the weight variables are as the decision vector and the hypervolume is as the objective. In many recently proposed competitive EAs for large-scale multiobjective optimization, the promising search directions are also specified similar to the bi-directional vectors of LSMOF. The aim of this paper is to point out some challenges in the construction of bi-directional vectors in LSMOF. We first verify that the lower and upper boundary points from which the bi-directional vectors are generated are crucial to the good performance of LSMOF on the LSMOP test suite. Then, for demonstrating how LSMOF performs when the Pareto set (PS) is changed, a new test suite is designed. The experimental results show that the performance of LSMOF will deteriorate rapidly on the problems with the new PS.},

Modeling of the deconstruction sector by a bi-level problem hinging on a weighted flexible job shop problem (FJSP) evaluated by a non-regular criterion is propounded. A hybrid resolution method based on a genetic algorithm is introduced. A new encoding, taking account of machine idle times, and its associated genetic operators are proposed.

However, the performance of a single decomposition method may degrade in high-dimensional objective space due to the immutable contour lines. To address this problem, this paper investigates the hybrid version of the decomposition methods, i.e., the penalty-based boundary intersection decomposition and the family of $L_{p}$ scalarization. These two kinds of methods are applied in different evolutionary stages to achieve an appropriate balance between convergence and diversity. The $p$ value in the $L_{p}$ scalarization method is dynamically updated online to adapt various evolutionary status. Moreover, a shift-based density estimation-aided mating selection strategy and a cosine distance-based offspring arrange mechanism are designed to cooperate with the decomposition method for generating more promising solutions.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which is inspired by the foraging behavior of ant species, is a popular and powerful search algorithm for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. However, EMT has seldom been integrated with the ACO. Inspired by the remarkable success of multitasking evolutionary algorithms in numerous research fields, this paper proposes a multitasking ant colony optimization framework (MTACO). The proposed framework enables ants to exploit the pheromones of ant colonies with similar tasks through certain conditions to improve the efficiency and the quality of results of ACO when processing multiple similar tasks dynamically. Furthermore, a multitasking ACS (MTACS) is implemented based on the proposed MTACO framework to solve dynamic vehicle path planning problems (DVPP). The experimental results on DVPP have verified that MTACO can improve the performance of ACO in terms of both algorithm efficiency and quality of results, when ACO is handling multiple tasks simultaneously.},

LOPO is a very challenging task even for state-of-the-art approaches. Models that work well in the easier leave-one-instance-out scenario often fail to generalize well to the LOPO setting. To address the LOPO problem, recent work suggested enriching standard random forest (RF) performance regression models with a weighted average of algorithms&#39; performance on training problems that are considered similar to a test problem. More precisely, in this RF+clust approach, the weights are chosen proportionally to the distances of the problems in some feature space. Here in this work, we extend the RF+clust approach by adjusting the distance-based weights with the importance of the features for performance regression. That is, instead of considering cosine distance in the feature space, we consider a weighted distance measure, with weights depending on the relevance of the feature for the regression model. Our empirical evaluation of the modified RF+clust approach on the CEC 2014 benchmark suite confirms its advantages over the naive distance measure. However, we also observe room for improvement, in particular with respect to more expressive feature portfolios.},

The application consists of a ball mill pulverizing system to pulverize coal and maximize fuel efficiency. MRFO and its applications have the task of finding the optimal controller variable values to control the system&#39;s temperature and pressure. The MRFO is a metaheuristic based on the behavior of manta rays, and although it shows efficient performance it may be improved through the use of techniques which generate new variants of the algorithm. Two techniques were used in the de-velopment of new variants: Quantum mechanics and opposition-based learning. The three different versions of MRFO were used to minimize a custom fitness function which is a combination of the integral time squared error (ITSE) and the overshoot of the system response. Simulations were carried using Simulink and Matlab softwares. For analyzing the performances, statistical measures such as minimum, maximum, best, mean, median, and standard deviation of the fitness function over 50 runs were used. Additionally, the different variants were also compared for minimizing 10 benchmark functions. The results show that the use of the previously mentioned techniques improve the performance of the original MRFO in optimizing the FOPID to control the ball mill pulverizing system.},

  abstract  = {A number of real-world problems involve optimization of multiple conflicting criteria assessed using expensive evaluations. In practice, such expensive multi/many-objective optimization problems (EMOPs) need to be solved using small number of design evaluations. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are commonly used to solve EMOPs and broadly follow either a generational or a steady-state form, both having their characteristic advantages. The generational forms involve evaluation of multiple solutions in each generation, and are more suitable for scenarios where the parallelization of the evaluations is possible. The steady-state forms evaluate one solution at a time, therefore incorporating the additional information more frequently, but are more suited to non-parallelizable scenarios. Although it is possible to run the generational algorithms in a steady-state manner through certain parameter settings, we show in this study that such settings have a negative impact on their search performance. This leads to an inference that existing methods are not able to seamlessly switch between generational and steady-state forms based on the application at hand. In this study, we address this gap by extending a recently proposed steady-state framework (SASSEA) to a generalized form (GSAEA) which can be run in both steady-state or generational form by simply prescribing the number of true evaluations per generation. Numerical experiments are conducted using low evaluation budgets on a range of MOPs with up to 7 objectives and diverse types of Pareto-optimal fronts. The results indicate that the proposed framework shows competitive or better performance relative to the state-of-the-art methods, both in generational and steady-state setting.},

  abstract  = {Hyper-heuristics are a broad topic that has drawn increasing attention because of its flexibility. This, however, implies that there are diverse models, including selection hyper-heuristics, where the idea is to derive a model that learns when to use each available solver. Nonetheless, such a learning procedure usually proves difficult and leads to non-ideal selections. Hence, in this work, we propose a recursive hyper-heuristic model allowing more complexity within the selection models. Our idea is straightforward: to have a selection hyper-heuristic to select low-level heuristics and lower-level hyper-heuristics. In doing so, one can merge the combined decisions of existing solvers. We test the feasibility of such a model through experiments on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem that cover small and large datasets of previously tailored instances. We found that increasing the order of the model leads to more stable and better-performing approaches. For example, migrating from a second-order hyper-heuristic to a fourth-order hyper-heuristic reduced the makespan by over 6\%. Thus, the proposed model seems feasible and should be further tested under more varied scenarios and conditions.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various fields, leading to an increasing demand for automatic design of high-quality network architectures instead of manual design. Neural architecture search offers a solution to automatic tuning of network architectures and associated hyperparameters. Early work on NAS assumes that all the training data is stored centrally on a single device, which is unrealistic in many real-world applications. In recent years, there has been a surge in research on federated neural architecture search due to the growing amount of data on edge devices and the increasing concerns over security and privacy protection. It allows several parties to collaboratively search for an optimal model without leaking the privacy of the data. However, existing work on federated NAS transmits the entire weight parameters of the candidate architectures between the clients and the server, leading to high communication costs and potential risks of leaking raw data. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a federated Bayesian optimization NAS approach called FL-BONAS. Instead of uploading the original weight values to the server during each round, the clients cooperatively train an ensemble surrogate model as the neural predictor, and each client searches for its own architectures via Bayesian optimization without revealing either the local raw data or the architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to train an ensemble model in Bayesian optimization for NAS under federated learning scenarios. FL-BONAS significantly improves the data efficiency while protecting privacy. The experimental results show that the proposed FL-BONAS can achieve better performance and protect raw data compared with centralized NAS.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new sequential state and parameter estimation method for nonlinear state-space mod-els, named Robust PF/SNES, taking account of ensembles not covering true states. PF/SNES is one of the most promising methods for sequential estimation of states and parameters and reportedly showed better performance than the augmented particle filter (Augmented PF) and the augmented Merging PF (Augmented MPF) that are widely used. Augmented PF and Augmented MPF are the extended versions of PF and MPF that handle parameters as states. PF/SNES sequentially estimates states and parameters by updating a probability distribution of parameters (a parameter distribution) using the Separable Natural Evolution Strategies (SNES) and an ensemble using PF at each time step. However, once an ensemble does not cover the true state, the subsequent estimation performance of PF/SNES deteriorates. In order to remedy the problem of PF/SNES, if the accuracy of the ensemble is judged to be low before SNES updates the parameter distribution at each time step, Robust PF/SNES searches for a high-accuracy ensemble by DX-NES-IC, which maximizes a likelihood with respect to an observation at the previous time step, taking account of the incomplete observation and the multimodality of the likelihood space. We compare the estimation performance of Robust PF/SNES with that of PF/SNES, Augmented PF, and Augmented MPF in terms of state MSE (Mean Squared Error) and parameter MSE on some benchmark problems with initial ensembles that do not cover the true states. The benchmark problems are the 2-state, 4-parameter estimation problem of the Van der Pol model, the 40-state, 41-parameter estimation problem of the Lorenz96 model, and the 10-state, 1-parameter estimation problems with an unobservable state or a bi-modal likelihood space. As a result, Robust PF/SNES showed the best performance on all the benchmark problems. Robust PF/SNES improved the accuracy by about 51.34 - 34760.94 times in terms of state MSE and 14.96 - 760.34 times in terms of parameter MSE, compared to PF/SNES.},

In the last three years, China has taken a series of effective measures to prevent the spread of the virus, where a core measure is the stay-home quarantine imposed in infected communities. The quarantine can effectively reduce physical contacts and transmission risk, however, it encounters several difficulties especially the guarantee of living materials. In order to ensure the quantity and freshness of living materials such as vegetables and fruits, it is necessary to construct multi-level logistics distribution centers, where the selection of locations for these centers becomes a vital issue. Such facility location problems are challenging in terms of both modeling and optimization, especially when facing the millions of residents and thousands of communities in a city commonly existing in China. In this study, we build a large-scale multi-objective optimization model for the distribution center location problem, and solve it via state-of-the-art sparse evolutionary algorithms.

The primary issue with current malware detection approaches is their inability to identify novel attacks and obfuscated malware, as they rely on static bases of malware examples, making them susceptible to new unseen malware behaviors. To address this, we propose a new method for malware recognition, which consists of two processes: the first process creates new instances of malware using a memetic algorithm, and the second process detects these new instances of attacks through solid detectors produced by an artificial immune system-based algorithm. Our new malware recognition method has proven its merits through thorough experiments on widely used datasets and evaluation metrics, and has been compared to prominent state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {The primary task of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) is to find the globally best Pareto-optimal front. However, often decision makers (DMs) are not interested in obtaining the global frontier. Instead, they prefer a set of solutions for which there is no significant change in objective values within a small neighborhood of each decision variable vector, resulting in a set of robust solutions. The corresponding objective vectors are said to lie on the robust front. In practical applications, such as in engineering designs, designers are interested in robust designs which are less sensitive to the perturbation in the design variables and parameters, caused by the manufacturing process tolerances, material non-uniformity, uncertainties in supply-chain process, and by many other practical matters. An earlier robust EMO study proposed two different robustness measures and used the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA-II) to find respective robust fronts. However, the limitation of NSGA-II in generating well-distributed and diverse set solutions for many-objective optimization, the robust optimization concept must be extended with evolutionary many-objective optimization (EMaO) algorithms to investigate the efficacy in more than three-objective problems. This study proposes an extension of test problems for robust many-objective optimization tasks and demonstrates the performance of updated NSGA-III procedure to two to eight-objective test and real-world problems.},

  abstract  = {Innovization is a task for analyzing multiple Pareto-optimal solutions obtained by an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm to extract common features in the decision variables, leading to design rules or solution principles. The principles derived from innovized principles can provide valuable insights to the users about “how to create an optimal solution?”. Manual or automated machine learning-based innovization methods were proposed in the literature to extract innovized principles in a problem. Although different problems may demand different structures of the rules, the innovized rules can also be utilized to improve the performance of the subsequent iterations of the optimization algorithm or help in executing an efficient re-optimization of the same problem. In this paper, we consider a large-scale and multi-objective complex optimization task of minimizing cost and nitrogen loading in certain counties within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) and find multiple trade-off solutions using the NSGA-III approach applied to the CBW&#39;s real evaluator tool (The Chesapeake Assessment Scenario Tool–CAST). 205 Best Management Practices (BMPs) are considered to be implemented at each land-river segment within a county, leading to as many as 65,260 variables for the resulting multi-objective optimization procedure. First, hundreds of trade-off solutions found by the CAST-NSGA-III procedure are analyzed manually to find the top-most BMPs used in them. After that, a re-optimization of CAST-NSGA-III is run with a few critical BMPs (resulting in a decrease of the variable to a range between 3\% and 33\%) found to commonly appear in the trade-off solution set of the previous runs. Interestingly, the resulting trade-off front with reduced BMPs is similar to the original run achieved with tens of thousands of variables. The findings are intriguing and demonstrate the efficacy of innovation in addressing intricate, real-world issues at a significant scale.},

Therefore, this article proposes a PSO with a Diversity-aware Inertia and Velocity Control (PSOIVC) algorithm to improve the PSO performance.

How to utilize multiple different kinds of similarities among many tasks for knowledge transfer (KT) is a challenging issue in solving MaTOP. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-view transfer (MVT)-based differential evolution (MVTDE) for effectively transferring knowledge in solving MaTOP. In particular, a perspective of task alignment is regarded as a view of performing KT. By combining different views including marginal and conditional distribution alignment, MVT can better fully utilize various task similarities from different aspects to solve MaTOP efficiently. This paper is with two contributions. First, we propose the MVT method that incorporates multiple KT methods from the views of marginal and conditional distribution alignment to enhance the search efficiency on the target tasks. Second, we propose to control the occurrence of different KT methods in MVT according to probability parameters and propose a parameter update strategy to adaptively adjust the probability parameters according to the feedback of different KT methods. In the experimental study, we carry out comparative experiments on three widely used MaTOP benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of MVTDE. The results show that MVTDE obtains competitive performance compared to several state-of-the-art many-task optimization algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Feature construction represents a crucial data preprocessing technique in machine learning applications because it ensures the creation of new informative features from the original ones. This fact leads to the improvement of the classification performance and the reduction of the problem dimensionality. Since many feature construction methods require discrete data, it is important to perform discretization in order to transform the constructed features given in continuous values into their corresponding discrete versions. To deal with this situation, the aim of this paper is to jointly perform feature construction and feature discretization in a synchronous manner in order to benefit from the advantages of each process. Thus, we propose here to model the discretization-based feature construction task as a bi-level optimization problem in which the constructed features are evaluated based on their optimized sequence of cut-points. The resulting algorithm is termed Discretization-Based Feature Construction (Bi-DFC) where the proposed model is solved using an improved version of an existing co-evolutionary algorithm, named I-CEMBA that ensures the variation of concatenation trees. Bi-DFC performs the selection of original attributes at the upper level and ensures the creation and the evaluation of constructed features at the upper level based on their optimal corresponding sequence of cut-points. The obtained experimental results on ten high-dimensional datasets illustrate the ability of Bi-DFC in outperforming relevant state-of-the-art approaches in terms of classification results.},

Moreover, it is computationally infeasible to train separate controllers for all possible different morphologies of agents to identify the optimal ones and is difficult to obtain the accurate cumulative reward of an agent to estimate the performance of the morphologies. To address these issues, we use a morphology comparator as a surrogate model to estimate the probability of one morphology being better than the other, instead of directly predicting the performance of each morphology. A set of surrogate models based on a radial basis function network are developed before evolution to make full use of the data to guide the search. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is able to efficiently find out optimal morphologies to achieve better performance than the default morphology.},

  abstract  = {The Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem is one of the most studied problems in the specialized literature. Since it was put forth for the first time, there have been multiple variants and constraints proposed in addition to the classic implementation. As an NP-Hard problem, the best way to solve the FJSP is through heuristic algorithms. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in solving NP-Hard problems by using Genetic Algorithms and the Flexible Job-Shop Problem is not an exception. There are different approaches based on a GA for solving the FJSP. This paper revisits the research on solution representation and, aiming to solve the FJSP, proposes a new encoding scheme that represents each solution as a sequencing paired list. The proposed scheme aims to improve the performance of a genetic algorithm toward better solutions within the search space. The encoding was tested on benchmarks commonly found in the literature. The experimental results show that this encoding scheme fulfills its objective and can be used as an alternative to other widespread encodings such as MSOS (Machine Selection and Operation Sequence).},

  abstract  = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) are one of the most challenging optimization problems in the real world, which need to locate multiple global optima with high accuracy, simultaneously. Although many niching techniques, such as crowding and species have been widely used for solving MMOPs, how to reduce the influence of introduced niching parameters and how to deal with the individuals trapped into local optima are still challenges for the existing multimodal algorithms. In this paper, a novel reachability-distance based differential evolution with individual transfer (RDDE-IT) is proposed to better deal with MMOPs, which includes the following three contributions. Firstly, a reachability-distance based prim (RDP) niching strategy without sensitive parameters is proposed to divide the population, which can adaptively adjust the number of niches as evolution progress. Secondly, an individual state-based mutation (ISM) strategy is proposed to help each individual select a suitable mutation operator. Thirdly, an adaptive individual transfer (AIT) strategy is proposed to deal with the individuals trapped into local optima and determines the probability of new individuals being generated within each niche. The performance of RDDE-IT is compared with 13 state-of-the-art algorithms on CEC&#39;2013 and the experimental results show that RDDE-IT achieves significant advantages on high-dimension problems.},

For an algorithm to obtain desirable performance, its control parameter values must be chosen based on the current problem. Despite being necessary for optimal performance, selecting appropriate control parameter values is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and challenging. To predict the performance of control parameter configurations in unseen environments, this paper crafts a general framework leveraging machine learning classification and quantitative characteristics of the problem landscape. The proposed framework is extensively explored by training 84 high-accuracy classifiers comprised of multiple sampling methods, fitness types, and binning strategies. Furthermore, a new parameter-reduced particle swarm optimization variant is constructed using the framework to eliminate the computational cost of parameter tuning and yields competitive performance amongst other leading methodologies across 60 unseen benchmark functions.},

Each network edge is divided into two segments, each assigned to its closest open facility. Finding the best combination for establishing facilities and using them as a basis for decomposing network edges form the main decision variables. Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, a Genetic Algorithm is used as the optimization method. This algorithm is known as one of the best metaheuristics for solving this problem. To accelerate the optimization process considering the computationally expensive fitness evaluation of the edge-based location problems, an extreme learning machine is hybridized with the implemented genetic algorithm to serve as a surrogate model for approximating the fitness of the majority of individuals.

The necessity for compact and efficient NN representations has been recognized by research, which has provided specialized compression techniques for various applications.

To this end, three main criteria were taken into account: filters error approximation using fractional differentiation, NNs accuracy and the Compression ratio. The results obtained on LeNet5 model demonstrated that there is no loss in terms of accuracy with 50\% compression ratio in MNIST, 18\% in CIFAR10, and 9\% in CIFAR100.

  abstract  = {Critical node detection is an important task to analyze network vulnerability and measure network security. Most existing methods either focus on non-cascading scenario from the perspective of network static properties or focus on cascading scenario from the perspective of network dynamic behavior. The problem of critical node detection is unexplored in both scenarios simultaneously. To this end, we formalize the critical node detection problem into a multi-objective problem in the two scenarios at the same time. Then, a multi-objective critical node detection algorithm named MOBSCND is proposed to effectively solve the transformed problem, which can provide multiple critical node solutions for decision-makers in both cascading and non-cascading scenarios. In MOBSCND, we design an effective initialization strategy, which can produce better initial individuals while ensuring population diversity. In addition, a local search strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the population and improve the quality of population individuals. The experimental results on 12 datasets show that the convergence and diversity of the solution set obtained by the proposed method are all superior to the baseline algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (MMOPs) have recently received considerable attention since they emerge in many real-world applications (e.g., in multiobjective knapsack problems and flow shop scheduling). However, MMOPs constitute a very particular class of problem. Indeed, looking for an adequate Pareto front (PF) representation is insufficient. MMOPs contain multiple subsets within the Pareto optimal Set, each independently mapping to the same Pareto Front. So, traditional multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are inappropriate for solving MMOPs. This has motivated the design of algorithms which are suitable for addressing MMOPs. This paper proposes modifying MMOEA/DC, which is an algorithm specifically designed for solving MMOPs, that adopts a dual clustering method in both decision and objective space. Particularly, we were interested in using clustering in decision space, which allows classifying solutions into multiple local clusters. Our proposed approach modifies the neighborhood definition in order to provide more robustness to the algorithm as well as to improve the clustering process in decision space and to reduce the influence of the control parameters. The efficiency of the proposed framework is validated by comparing its performance on test instances of two test suites (MMF and MMMPO) with respect to the original MMOEA/DC and other state-of-the-art algorithms designed for solving MMOPs.},

As global economies affect each other, investing in global markets is the best way to address systematic risk for effective financial management. Selecting an appropriate portfolio across global markets involves a substantial solution space; thus, an efficient and effective evolutionary computation is proposed. The novel entanglement-enhanced quantum-inspired optimization technique is proposed as an efficient mechanism to search for the relationship between stocks with high-dependency solutions. The novel indicator trend ratio aims to evaluate the investor-desired portfolio with a stable uptrend under a perfect balance between return and risk. Therefore, this study is the first attempt to evaluate the major global markets in the Group of Seven (G7) countries to expand the generality of trend ratio usage. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed novel approach has better and more precise searchability than other state-of-the-art optimization. The proposed intelligent model outperforms the Sharpe ratio, benchmark strategy, and index performance regarding the trend ratio, risk, maximum drawdown, and profit factor. The results reveal that risk dispersion substantially improves investment performance. Under the evaluation of the trend ratio, the proposed system integrates G7 markets as an expansion of a prospective avenue for global asset management,},

Therefore, some GP variants have been proposed for this type of problem, such as multi-stage GP (MSGP).

However, its application for GP is overlooked due to GP&#39;s capability to operate as a wrapper-based feature selection while trying to find an optimal expression of the target variable via a functional combination of predictors. The effectiveness of wrapper- and filer-based feature selection approaches in machine learning has been the subject of a long-standing debate in the literature. This study aims to introduce an efficient feature selection approach and couple it with MSGP in order to handle high-dimensional problems. In addition, the stages of the GP are systematically ordered based on the variables&#39; information. The proposed approach is tested against five real high-dimensional datasets. The results show that GP&#39;s inherent wrapper feature selection ability can be advanced further by using a filter-based feature selection approach to shrink the search space, which results in improving computational costs, expression complexity and the accuracy of MSGP.},

Many excellent CNNs have been carefully designed by algorithm researchers; however, the design process is limited by the inherent knowledge of the researchers. Inspired by the existing successful block-based neural architecture search, we develop a collaboratively automatically evolutionary CNNs algorithm (CAE-CNN), which employs a surrogate-assisted genetic algorithm to search for a satisfactory CNN architecture by collaboratively optimizing the basic blocks in ResNet and DenseNet and their topologies. The encoding space of CAE-CNN consists of three basic units (pooling, ResNet, and DenseNet units) and a connection topology with a variable size. To effectively evolve the population, we design a double-module crossover operation and a multi-type mutation operation to collaboratively evolve the units and the topology. To address the problem of a rapidly increasing search space caused by the topological search, we use a random forest as the surrogate model to estimate the fitness of an individual to accelerate the search. CAE-CNN is a completely automatic algorithm in which a satisfactory CNN architecture can be obtained without any manual intervention. Experimental results show that CAE-CNN could archive competitive performance in terms of classification accuracy on four image classification datasets, and it consumes fewer computing resources than many algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Many real-world optimization problems can be modelled with several competing objectives. Most of the time, such optimization problems fall under the category of expensive problems. These are problems in which each fitness evaluation is time-consuming, for example, one fitness call could take hours or even days to compute. The time-consuming process of evaluating the function values or gradient of the objective functions may degrade the running speed of many optimization algorithms. The coordinate search (CS) approach is introduced as a single-objective gradient-free method for addressing large-scale, non-convex, and costly optimization problems. Due to the low computation and memory requirements of the CS algorithm, it can also be efficiently extended to address multi-objective optimization problems. The subject of this study is to develop a CS-based algorithm aimed at computationally expensive multi-objective optimization problems. In order to generate a set of non-dominated solutions, a population is created to apply the CS algorithm on each individual and finally reach an optimized interval. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multi-objective CS method by comparing it with NSGA-II and MOEA/D as one of the well-known multi-objective algorithms on ZDT benchmark functions. Promising results are reported with the assumption of a limited number of fitness evaluations (NFF) which is desired during tackling complex and expensive optimization problems. Another major advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it provides regions of the Pareto front, that using sampling can generate as many Pareto front solutions as needed unlike other common optimization algorithms including NSGA-II.},

  abstract  = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are hybrid approaches between classical and quantum computation, where a classical optimizer proposes parameter configurations for a quantum parametric circuit which is iteratively sampled. The overall performance of the algorithm depends on how the classical optimizer tunes the parameters of the quantum circuit. Several gradient-free and gradient-based approaches have been proposed in the literature to face this task. Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a type of evolutionary algorithms where a probabilistic model is updated and sampled at each generation to optimize a cost function. EDAs have shown to be able to achieve good solutions in a reasonable computation time for different optimization problems, and thus, we believe that this algorithm can be a good option to overcome VQAs challenges such as the Barren plateaus phenomenon. In this paper, we study the use of three different EDAs, characterized by different probabilistic model complexities, to tune the parameters of two different VQAs to solver the Max Cut problem and to a VQA to simulate the behaviour of a molecule. Three EDA variants are compared to some state-of-the-art optimizers widely used for this task. Our results show statistical significant improvement of the EDA variants compared to different optimizers, and identify the VQAs characteristics that best fit to each EDA type. We also perform an analysis of the main EDAs hyper-parameters.},

  abstract  = {Many Real-world optimisation tasks are increasingly large-scale optimisation (LSO) problems. Cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms (CoEAs), which involve more than two populations and utilise the divide-and-conquer approach, have been introduced to solve LSO problems more efficiently. However, the behaviour of cooperative CoEAs is not fully understood because the interactions between two or more populations make analysis challenging. Runtime analysis has improved the under-standing of traditional EAs. We argue that using runtime analysis of CoEAs could provide helpful insights, e.g., how their expected runtime depends on alaorithmic design decisions. In this paper, we show that the expected optimisation time of the basic cooperative co-evolutionary (1+1) EA (CC-(1+1) EA) on linear functions is $\Theta(n\log n)$ . This solves an open conjecture by (Jansen and Wiegand, 2004). Moreover, empirical analysis is conducted on two more complicated problems: NK − LANDSCAPE and $k$ -MAXSAT problems. Our results show that the CC-(1+1) EA perform similarly to the (1+1) EA on these problems. However, adjusting block length allows us to optimise its performance on the NK − LANDSCAPE problem. Our results provide a more precise bound for the expected runtime of CC-(1+1) EA and a more detailed empirical analysis of its behaviour on more complicated inseparable problems.},

  abstract  = {Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has drawn wide attention since a bunch of real-world complex scenes can be abstracted as Multi-Agent Systems. In order to solve the non-local training objective problem in shared reward environments, value-decomposition-based methods were proposed. Most of them introduce priori Individual-Global-Max (IGM) and value-decomposition constraints. Some attempts tune the value-decomposition constraints to achieve a better performance. However, IGM constraint, the fundamental assumption of value-decomposition methods, is adopted in most value-decomposition methods, which may lead to poor exploration in some situations. To deal with this problem, a novel algorithm called Mutual-guided Multi-agent Actor-Critic (MugAC) is proposed in this paper. MugAC, inspired by the core idea of evolutionary computation, imposes a joint-action pool, from which a joint-action is selected by the critic to interact with the environment and as a training objective of the actor. The training paradigm of MugAC provides an off-policy training for actor-critic, making the sample efficiency higher than that of traditional actor-critic methods in MARL. We evaluate our method against the state-of-the-art methods in StarCraft micromanagement. Experimental results show that MugAC outperforms other methods in various scenarios of widely adopted StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC).},

This paper introduces a setup for benchmarking algorithms for submodular optimization problems with the aim to provide researchers with a framework to enhance and compare the performance of new algorithms for submodular problems. The focus is on the development of iterative search algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms with the implementation provided and integrated into IOHprofiler which allows for tracking and comparing the progress and performance of iterative search algorithms.

  abstract  = {Solving real-world optimization problems often requires collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In air traffic flow management, for example, airlines must work together to prioritize individual flights in cases of reduced capacity in the air traffic network. However, when diverse parties are required to share sensitive information to collaboratively conduct optimization, trust becomes an issue. To alleviate those issues, privacy-preserving computation can be utilized to protect the confidential information of participants, which comes with a trade-off in terms of runtime performance. In time-critical contexts, privacy-preserving implementations of deterministic optimization algorithms may not be able to produce a result before the deadline. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using variants of local search algorithms for the search of solutions to an optimization problem in conjunction with multi-party computation for the evaluation of those solutions. We argue that the proposed method using local search algorithms achieves good results in terms of the quality of the found solution while considerably reducing the run time with respect to a privacy-preserving deterministic solution.},

The required collection and exchange of domain information is an important but tedious task in real-world projects involving several experts from different areas of expertise (e.g. the domain and the optimisation area). This paper presents a structured approach that allows the experts to systematically provide their knowledge using domain-specific languages. The presented approach defines a different language for the involved experts that enables them to add their knowledge and use the information provided by other experts. The languages are extensible, allowing the addition of new optimisation aspects without changing the actual language. These languages are the front-end to a versatile open-source optimisation tool, that we built, enabling the actual execution of the optimisation. It additionally provides features for surrogate models as well as data generation and different benchmarks for evaluation. Conducting a user study, we show that the language is suitable to express the domain knowledge and domain experts can use the language to describe their domain knowledge after a short introduction. This way, the approach reduces the effort for domain experts in providing their information. As a side effect, the complete configuration of the optimisation execution through these languages allows an easy and reliable reproduction.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous robots can solve different issues of delivery services, by guaranteeing less traffic congestion, less pollution, and lower operational costs. Designing such type of delivery system based on autonomous robots requires the collaboration of different stakeholders, having different concerns: the store utilising the delivery service that is interested in costs and customer satisfaction, the municipality where the service is operated that is interested in the safety of the service, and the robotic company providing the service that is interested in all previous concerns. Our industrial partner from the robotic domain is designing this type of service in a smart town, and using a simulator for assessing different configurations providing different levels of performance. Since manually designing the configurations is time consuming for engineers, in this paper, we propose a search-based approach (All) that is able to explore the space of service configurations and find the optimal ones that show the tradeoff existing among the different concerns, so that stakeholders can make an informed decision. Since assessing one configuration requires to simulate the service multiple times over different types of customer requests, the approach suffers from scalability issues. Therefore, we propose two improvements of the approach that reduce the number of required simulations (IncrSim), and the duration of the simulation (IncrTime). Ex-periments on different settings show that IncrSim and IncrTime can find results as good as those of All in less time, and better than versions of All executed for the same budget.},

During early stage feasibility, available mineral resources can only be estimated based on limited sampling of ore grades from sparse drilling, leading to large uncertainty in under-sampled parts of the deposit. Planning the extraction schedule of ore over the life of a mine is crucial for its economic viability. We introduce a new approach for determining an “optimal schedule under uncertainty” that provides probabilistic bounds on the profits obtained in each period. This treatment of uncertainty within an economic framework reduces previously difficult-to-use models of variability into actionable insights. The new method discounts profits based on uncertainty within an evolutionary algorithm, sacrificing economic optimality of a single geological model for improving the downside risk over an ensemble of equally likely models. We provide experimental studies using Maptek&#39;s mine planning software Evolution. Our results show that our new approach is successful for effectively making use of uncertainty information in the mine planning process.},

Recently, negatively correlated search (NCS) has been shown to be powerful for real-world multimodal optimization problems (MMOP). However, there has been few works on utilizing NCS to solve COPs. In this paper, we present a novel constrained optimization evolutionary algorithm (COEA) named NCS-E which combined NCS with a new CHT ensemble method to deal with COPs. It integrates three complementary CHTs as voters, and individuals are first voted by each voter, then the individual with more weighted votes is considered better. In addition, the negative correlation information of the voted individuals is utilized to adaptively adjust the voting weights. To demonstrate the performance of NCS-E, NCS-E is compared with four NCS-based COEAs and two state-of-the-art methods, ∊MAgES and MAgES-VMCH, on 57 real-world COPs. The statistical results show that NCS-E exhibits the best performance among the compared methods. Moreover, NCS-E was applied to solve the Deep Neural Network pruning problem and compared with the state-of-the-art pruning method OLMP on three reference models. Empirical results show that the proposed method improves the performance of OLMP on all three DNN pruning tasks.},

This paper looks at the impact of using different MGPSO swarm topologies to determine which is the best choice when using MGPSO to solve DMOPs. A benchmark set of 29 dynamic benchmark functions were used to evaluate the performance of each topology. Six performance measures were used for comparison. The results indicate that the ring topology is best suited to the dynamic environments tested here in general, especially Type I and Type II DMOPs.

In this work, starting from a Pareto front identified by an optimization strategy, we exploit Local Bubble Dilation Functions (LBDFs) to manipulate a locally bounded region of the search space containing non-dominated solutions. We tested our approach on the benchmark functions included in the DTLZ and WFG suites, showing that the Pareto front obtained after the application of LBDFs is most of the time characterized by an increased hyper-volume value. Our results confirm that LBDFs are an effective means to identify additional non-dominated solutions that can improve the quality of the Pareto front.},

Our findings reveal that better configurations exist, and notably, these configurations are simpler than the original method. This indicates that the state-of-the-art method can be outperformed by simpler methods that involve fewer algorithms.

  abstract  = {As machine learning solutions become increasingly more ubiquitous in medical diagnosis, researchers are becoming equally more aware of the possibility of confounded predictions being produced by these same models. This realization derives, for example, from the observation that sample-wise crossvalidation leads to highly underestimated error predictors when compared to subject-wise cross validation. However, without a reliable approach to remove spurious, confounding factors such as age, gender, or even the type/brand of equipment used, these same machine learning solutions will be fated to produce poor results despite the metrics for error estimation employed. In this research, we propose an optimization approach, using genetic algorithms, to adapt the feature vectors in order to maximize the prediction accuracy of a given classifiers, while minimizing the correlation between the features and the potential confounding factors. Our results, when applied to the diagnostic of vocal fatigue, have shown great improvement in terms of the generalization capability of the chosen SVM classifier.

  abstract  = {The increase in medical imaging and, consequently, the growing workload of radiologists requires workflow optimization. The interaction between radiologists and artificial intelligence is a promising area because it can improve radiologist productivity and reduce diagnostic errors. In this study, we describe an eye-tracking experiment with four practicing radiologists who cumulatively examined 1,000 unique chest X-ray images that included samples with multiple pathologies. We demonstrate the feasibility of a self-supervised approach for gazebased data for problems with a small amount of labeled data. We achieve an accuracy of 64.7\% for binary classification of radiologist diagnostic error with 218 samples per label. The proposed approach can be used in the system for assessing the need for a second opinion to improve the quality of diagnostics.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a transposition point optimization method for voltage unbalance mitigation in electric power distribution systems by integer form of population-based incremental learning. In power distribution systems, since voltage unbalance has become a problem due to the recent penetration of large amounts of low-voltage photovoltaic, a method for voltage unbalance mitigation is required. Transposition is one of the methods for voltage unbalance mitigation. It is necessary to determine how and at which points transposition should be performed in order to apply transposition. The problem can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. Since the number of combinations in the combinatorial optimization problem increases exponentially as the system size expands, it is difficult to obtain an optimal solution in practical time. However, no research has been conducted on the problem until now. Evolutionary computation can be applied to the problem. The proposed integer form of population-based incremental learning based method is applied to a real-scale distribution model system based on a JST-CREST126 distribution line model. Effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing it with the tabu search based method and the Mann–;Whitney U test.},

  abstract  = {Gaussian Adaptation (GaA) is a black box op-timization algorithm that shares a similar evolution process with the well-studied Simulated Annealing (SA) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). To improve the convergence properties of GaA in optimization, this paper presents a variant of GaA that degenerates during its evolution process into algorithms with well-proven convergence properties. Specifically, the proposed GaA variant termed A w GaA employs an adaptive weighting of the covariance matrix update of the standard GaA. Consequently, as the evolution process progresses the algorithm degenerates into a variant of SA or (1+1)-CMA-ES. The performance of the proposed A w GaA is evaluated on 30 functions from the IEEE 2014 benchmark suite and compared favorably with the original GaA as well as 6 other leading algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In real-world applications, there are some constrained multi-objective problems where the evaluation of objectives is expensive and the evaluation of constraints is cheap. Currently, few studies have focused on solving expensive constrained multi-objective optimization problems (ECMOPs), and they usually assume that the constraints of ECMOPs are also expensive. In this paper, we propose a surrogate-ensemble assisted coevolutionary algorithm (SEACoEA) for ECMOPs with inexpensive constraint evaluation. First, a feasible sampling strategy is designed to initialize the population in the feasible regions. Next, two populations are set to optimize the original ECMOP and the problem without considering constraints, respectively. To improve the search efficiency, we redesigned the objective function of the surrogate-ensemble model. Finally, a new infill strategy is proposed to select candidate individuals from each population for real evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs significantly better on most MW problems compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {The present study utilizes neural network to perform heuristic selection in selection hyper-heuristics. Selection hyper-heuristics are problem-independent solvers, preferably benefited for tackling a wide range of search and optimization problems. Unlike traditional algorithms, selection hyper-heuristics operate across a heuristic set to solve a given problem instance rather than directly solving it. The idea, in that sense, is to manage a particular heuristic set provided for a specific problem. One critical component to properly utilize a heuristic set is a heuristic selection method. This method, essentially, identifies one or more heuristics to use at each decision step. The goal is to solve a given problem instance cooperatively by taking advantage of the underlying heuristics&#39; strengths. Accommodating a learning-based selection approach is quite common since a heuristic selection policy appropriate for one case might be inferior for other cases. This work employs neural network to realize heuristic selection. Namely, two architectures of a single hidden-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a deep Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) have been used to realize the selection task, formed as a sequence prediction problem. The training process of those architectures is achieved by using heuristic sequences derived from 20 existing selection hyper-heuristics. The resulting models are combined with a simple move acceptance criterion and tested on the 1-dimensional Bin Packing problem. The corresponding empirical analysis revealed that neural network is able to capture the heuristic selection decisions coming from different selection hyper-heuristics, under a single selection system.},
