  abstract  = {In practice, fetal 3D ultrasound can have difficulty in accurately detecting labels for auxiliary standard cut plane localization because of mass loss. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new segmentation-based reinforcement learning framework for automatically localizing the standard plane of the face: in 3D fetal ultrasound, the initial plane is localized based on anatomical landmarks of mass and geometric relationships, agents navigate through visual segmentation to automatically localize the standard plane, and bound ultrasound views are presented to show the resultant plane. This study was extensively validated on an in-house large dataset. The accuracy of this automatic localization of 3D ultrasound standard planes with sonographer-calibrated median sagittal views of the face, horizontal transverse views of both eyeballs, and coronal views of the nasolabial was 6.64 °/5.65mm, 7.04°/3.58mm, and 5.14 ° 14.26mm, respectively, with success rates of 66.67\%, 78.38\%, and 80.41\%, respectively. The experimental results verify that this system can effectively improve navigation performance.},

There has been reported cases of mental health problems caused by continuous consumption of negative articles, besides recommendation algorithms has a problem of over-recommendation which may induce continuous consumption of negative articles. Although research on the relationship between negative news article consumption and mental health has been conducted via small-scale user interviews, large-scale behavioral research on user engagement with recommended news articles has not been carried out. Therefore, we comprehensively investigated how the emotional polarity of articles affects each indicator of user attention by assigning emotional labels to news articles using crowdsourcing and analyzing about 1 million user behavior logs that viewed these articles. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first publicly available studies to analyze the impact of negative articles on users&#39; news consumption behavior on an online news platform. The findings indicated that negative articles, irrespective of their category, were more likely to be clicked on, were read for longer durations, and had lower bounce rates. Furthermore, users showed greater interest in negative news related to entertainment and sports. These findings can be used as a first step for news platforms to build safer recommendation algorithms that consider the psychological impact on users.},

However, understanding interior-style scenes is challenging because of the complex interplay of various objects that must be correctly interpreted. To properly understand interior-style scenes, extracting appropriate image features and providing visual explanations for the objects that determine the style is necessary. This study proposed a model that can simultaneously extract image features at multiple scales and provide visual explanations for the objects that characterize each class. Specifically, we adopted a hierarchical attention branch network (ABN) for visual explanations and applied atrous convolution to the feature extractor. We hypothesized that atrous convolution could extract various specific objects of each class that differ in size because its algorithm extracts features at an arbitrary resolution. Our evaluation results show that a conventional hierarchical ABN could not extract interior objects accurately, and our proposed model can detect specific objects by incorporating atrous convolution.},

  abstract  = {Embodied AI, where the agent learns to accomplish tasks through interaction with its surrounding environment, is drawing increasing attention in the community. As a challenging Embodied AI task, visual room rearrangement aims to restore the initially misplaced objects in a room to the target state. Existing approaches usually use a single policy to learn a mapping from visual observation to action. Those methods may be capable of accomplishing tasks with simple goals such as visual navigation. However, the agent in the rearrangement task has to explore various types of interaction for a long time. Only considering a single policy may easily get stuck in local optimum. In this paper, we propose a Phase Discriminated Multi-Policy (PDMP) model, decomposing the task into specific phases and tackling them with customized policies. In particular, we first introduce the graph representation of object relationships providing scene layout knowledge, which is discriminated to task phases. Then based on the knowledge a hierarchical actor-critic module is proposed to dynamically call the policies capable of navigation or object interaction. Each policy is trained with narrowed action space and dense rewards so that they can better converge and cooperate to reach long-term goals. Comprehensive experiments based on the AI2-THOR platform, show that the proposed model achieves better performance than baselines.},

To support operators with the task of setting the proper level of autonomy, we present a novel approach to realise a Model Predictive Controller that determines the optimal LoA for each tessellation in the robot&#39;s path plan based on the estimated performance degradation due environmental adversities. We also report on an experimental evaluation of a mixed-initiative system where both the operator and the Model Predictive Controller are in charge of dynamically adjusting the level of autonomy cooperatively while performing a challenging navigational task with a mobile ground robot in a high-fidelity simulation. To this end, we conducted a user study with 15 participants comparing the performance and user experience of the model predictive system with a state-of-the-art system. The results show significant benefits of the model predictive system in terms of a reduction of conflicts for control and an improved user experience. Additionally, there are indications of benefits in terms of robot health and, consequently, performance for the model predictive system.},

To address this issue, in this study, a systematic analysis of 178 literatures and related cases on waste management conflicts published between 1992 and 2023 was conducted from the life cycle perspective, by using VOSviewer software in bibliometric. The analysis focused on examining different types of conflicts in waste management, conflicts at different stages in waste management processes, and methods for resolving conflicts. The results show that: ⅰ) Research on conflicts in waste management has experienced rapid growth since 2014, and relevant research efforts are distributed in different disciplines; ⅱ) More and more researches in the literature focus on optimizing the entire waste management supply chain, rather than the siting of a single facility; and ⅲ) Waste classification has been added between waste generation and waste collection, which improves the whole process of waste management. However, conflicts caused by unclear rights and responsibilities of waste classification have not been well studied, so that there are no solutions to such conflicts.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a strategy to calibrate computational models according to uncertain input-output data. To this end, uncertainty in the data is first characterized using adversarial data sets. Samples drawn from such sets are then mapped from the input-output space to the parameter space using an inverse mapping. This mapping minimizes the collective output spread of an ensemble of point predictions while satisfying a set of individual data-matching requirements. The distribution of the resulting parameter points, which often exhibits strong parameter dependencies, is then modeled using Sliced Normal distributions. The chance-constrained formulation used to learn this distribution enables the analyst to trade-off a greater likelihood for most of the data against a lower likelihood for some of the data, thereby relaxing the conservatism of the calibrated model. This formulation neglects the worst-performing quantiles of each adversarial distribution and eliminates the detrimental effects that outliers have on the resulting model. This calibration approach not only has a considerably lower computational cost than the standard forward approach but it also allows for the identification of suitable distribution classes, which in turn yield better calibrated models.},

The new age of computer vision transformers could further increase their value, although domain-specific limitations and adaptations should be studied first. Here we show that with the new adoption of the set prediction paradigm in transformer-based object detection, the Hungarian loss&#39; applicability to medical imaging could benefit from specialized modifications. A new dataset of 50,000 chest radiographs was used to study the Hungarian set matching&#39;s ability to model the detection of 17 classes of pathologies. Consequently, five new targeted matching schemes were derived accordingly. The proposed strategies increased the overall mean average precision (mAP) score from 47.17 to 50.82 (+3.65). A subsequent reader study involving four radiologists showed the physician&#39;s mean overall sensitivity improved by 6.9 ± 7.1\% (95\% CI, P = 0.008) while the specificity remained non-inferior (P &lt; 0.001) when assisted by the AI model in the diagnosis of 200 patients.

Also, Parkinson&#39;s patients require medical treatment due to falling each year. However, the reasons for the changed walking style still remain unknown. The goal of this study is the evaluation of possible reasons for the changed walking pattern in Parkinson&#39;s disease. A pilot study is conducted, which includes patient experiments, data analysis, and biomechanical modeling. Differences between Parkinsonian and healthy gait are detected and replicated by the model. The model represents simplified body dynamics and is optimized for healthy and Parkinsonian gait, respectively. Comparison measures are ground reaction forces, joint torques, and the virtual pivot point (VPP) location. The VPP is the intersection point of all forces throughout the gait cycle and is closely correlated to human balancing and stability. Parkinsonian gait showed different force and torque curves compared to healthy walking and a VPP below the center of mass location (negative VPP). The model represents healthy walking well. Specific Parkinsonian behavior can be explained by the changed modulation of the model. However, a negative VPP location turns the model unstable as, after two steps, the trunk tilts more than 90 degrees forward. Our modeling with negative VPP shows instability effects observed in Parkinson&#39;s patients walking who struggle with frequent stumbles and falls. Such modeling approaches could be used for developing new rehabilitation techniques and gait assistance devices.},

The adaptive auxiliary dynamics are incorporated into the distributed coincident errors to reduce velocity and acceleration saturation, which improves the overall transient results and stability range. The adaptive saturation extended observer in the substrate dynamics is conceived to simultaneously estimate the lumped disturbances and suppress undesired peaks, smoothly enhancing the robustness of wheel velocity control.

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a stochastic dominant cognitive experience-guided learning framework for particle swarm optimization (SDCEGPSO) to enhance its search ability in complex environment. Specifically, different from classical PSOs, SDCEGPSO randomly selects dominant cognitive experiences to guide the learning of particles. To this end, the cognitive experiences of all particles, namely their personal best positions, are sorted from the best to the worst. Then, each particle randomly chooses a personal best position better than its own to learn. For the cognitive experience selection, this paper designs three selection methods, namely the random selection, the roulette wheel selection, and the tournament selection. With this learning framework, particles have diverse guiding exemplars to learn from and thus high search diversity is expectedly maintained. Experiments conducted on the 50-D and 100-D CEC2014 problem suite have verified the effectiveness of SDCEGPSO. Compared with the classical global PSO (GPSO) and local PSO (LPSO), SDCEGPSO with the three selection schemes achieve significantly better performance. Besides, among the three selection schemes, the binary tournament selection is the most effective one to help SDCEGPSO solve optimization problems.},

However, most existing CCEAs use low-dimensional EAs to optimize the decomposed sub-problems. Such utilization of low-dimensional EAs may limit the effectiveness of CCEAs because some of the decomposed sub-problems may still be high-dimensional. Since there exist many non-decomposition based large-scale EAs, it is interesting to investigate the optimization effectiveness of CCEAs by using these non-decomposition based large-scale EAs to solve the decomposed sub-problems. To this end, this paper incorporates two state-of-the-art large-scale swarm optimizers into CCEAs with five state-of-the-art decomposition strategies to solve LSOPs. Experiments conducted on the CEC&#39;2010 and CEC&#39;2013 LSOP benchmark sets have shown that the two large-scale swarm optimizers help CCEAs with the five decomposition strategies achieve much better performance than the most widely used low-dimensional EA.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates a swarm shepherding problem which aims to herd multiple sub-swarm of robot agents (sheep) in a large-scale cluttered environment to a specific goal area using multiple distance-constrained robots (sheepdogs) located at different depots. We propose to formulate this challenging problem as a Multi-depot, Distance-constrained Close-Open Mixed Vehicle Routing Problem (MDCOMVRP). We also design a Two-phase Ant Colony Optimisation to address it by decomposing MDCOMVRP into a Multi-depot Open Vehicle Routing Problem (MOVRP) and a split problem. In the first phase, the Max-Min Ant System algorithm is employed to find open routes for all robots by transforming the MOVRP into a standard Travelling Salesman Problem using the proposed transformation method. In the second phase, a Modified Split algorithm is presented to construct a set of close or open distance-constrained routes, which are further optimised by the 2-opt local search method to generate the optimised sequence for each sheepdog robot to collect/drive sheep sub-swarms. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can solve MDCOMVRP successfully and assist the robots to complete the swarm shepherding mission efficiently.},

  abstract  = {The shepherding problem refers to guiding a group of agents (called sheep) to a specific destination using an external agent with repulsive forces (called shepherd). Although various movement algorithms for the shepherd have been explored in the literature, there is a scarcity of methodologies for selective guidance, which is a key technology for precise swarm control. Therefore, this study investigates the problem of guiding a single target sheep within a swarm to a given destination using a shepherd. We first present our model of the dynamics of sheep agents and the interaction between sheep and shepherd agents. The model is shown to be well-defined with no collision if the interaction magnitude between sheep and shepherd is reasonably limited. Based on the analysis with Lyapunov stability principles, we design a shepherd control law to guide the target sheep to the origin while avoiding collisions among sheep agents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in guiding the target sheep in both small and large scale swarms.},

  abstract  = {Nonparametric mixture models are a powerful and flexible approach to data clustering; they account for uncertainty by using Bayesian inference to obtain a posterior distribution over the model&#39;s parameters and a better fit to the data. Additionally, nonparametric mixture models can adaptively adjust the number of components to fit the data. Incorporating asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution (AGGD) within the mixture framework extends the capabilities of the widely used Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by adding parameters that control the shape and the skewness of the per-component distribution, which enables the model to capture diverse and complex data patterns. Furthermore, we incorporate explainability within our proposed infinite asymmetric generalized Gaussian mixture model (IAGGMM) to provide interpretable insights into the clustering results, enhancing the model&#39;s practicality and transparency. This integration facilitates a deeper understanding of the underlying data structures and the rationale behind the model&#39;s decisions, fostering trust and promoting the adoption of our approach in various real-world scenarios. In this study, we explore the application of occupancy estimation for optimizing energy efficiency and facility management in smart buildings. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in modelling complex and asymmetric data distributions, resulting in improved accuracy and adaptability for occupancy level estimation. Therefore, we achieve the optimal trade-off between model complexity and accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Water quality prediction provides timely management to solve possible water environmental problems, which is of great importance. However, the following challenges exist: 1) The existence of noise in the water quality time series can lead to overfitting of nonlinear models; 2) It is difficult to capture temporal dependencies in complex time series data; 3) Long-term forecasting is difficult to achieve. To address the above difficulties, this work proposes a multi-step water quality prediction model, called SG-Autoformer, which combines the Savitzky-Golay filter, the inner series decomposition, and an auto-correlation mechanism. First, SG-Autoformer performs noise reduction on the water quality time series to suppress overfitting of nonlinear models. Second, it embeds series decomposition inside the encoder and decoder, which obtains more predictable components from complex time series for long-term prediction. Third, SG-Autoformer utilizes the auto-correlation mechanism to capture the time dependence and improve information utilization. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets show that SG-Autoformer outperforms other advanced prediction methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of activity detection using an individual smart meter dataset. However, research on the effectiveness of using multiple smart meter datasets is limited. This paper proposes a model for Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) detection using multiple smart meter datasets (i.e., gas and electricity). To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a case study was conducted with 47 households for one month, collecting electricity data, gas data, and ground truth data about ADLs.

  abstract  = {In this paper, a new method is proposed to minimize network losses in active distribution networks (ADNs). In recent years, studies on ADNs have been prevalent because of the emergence of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as Photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind power generation, etc. One of the challenges is how to handle the uncertainties of such renewables affected by weather conditions. This paper proposes an Evolutionary-Computation (EC)-based Robust Optimization (RO) method for minimizing the network losses in ADN s. This paper aims at reducing the risks of the obtained solutions in ADNs with parameter uncertainties in nonlinear combinatorial optimization problems. RO evaluates feasible solutions by considering the worst scenario through data sampling while EC works to evaluate better solutions that escape from local minima. As a method of EC, this paper makes use of Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) to obtain better solutions. It plays a key role to separate solution candidates into several clusters to evaluate better solutions by selecting one of four rules randomly. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in the IEEE 69-node distribution network.},

The analysed scheme ladders on classical hypothesis testing methods to estimate where the local dynamics of the local variables are evolving towards. In this approach, we utilized cumulative sum (CUSUM) to detect the average growth in the evolution of local parameters. This enables establishing mechanisms for changing dynamically the local step-sizes so to simultaneously avoid divergence but also increase convergence speed when necessary. We thus evaluate the performance of the novel method using a dedicated Monte Carlo analysis that compares it against oracle-based selectors, i.e., against situations where the network employs the best possible fixed step-size. The results show that the proposed method can sometimes lead to faster convergence than such optimal fixed step-sizes, often have comparable performance against them, and in any case guarantee convergence.},

Robotaxi could be another potential application in the near future. This work studies a robotaxi dispatch problem during the pandemic time. It proposes a multi-objective optimization model to minimize the number, waiting time, and driving distance of the robotaxis. Besides, a dispatch strategy is innovatively designed according to a defined severity degree of the pandemic. A virus infection rate can be decreased by reducing contact among passengers. A two-stage nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-TS) is proposed to solve the problem. Three operations are used to generate offspring solutions, which can ensure the diversity of the population and speed up the convergence of the algorithm. The effectiveness of NSGA-TS is verified compared with two popular multi-objective optimization algorithms, i.e., multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Experimental results show that the proposed model performs well on the studied problem. It can reduce the virus infection rate by decreasing contact among passengers at different risk levels of the pandemic while accomplishing passenger orders.

Humans&#39; cognitive states (like trust, mental workload, and situation awareness) change as they work in demanding environments with autonomous systems. Providing adaptive autonomous systems with information about human teammates&#39; cognitive states is a current gap in human-autonomy teaming research. In this paper we present results from a human-autonomy teaming experiment in which participants completed a spaceflight-relevant task in a supervisory, “on-the-loop” role. To complete the task, participants worked with an autonomous system that had five distinct modes of autonomy. Our experiment results show that unobtrusive measures (based on actions participants take and eye tracking data) could inform statistical models that accurately predicted three different subjectively reported cognitive states at the same time (RMSE from 11\% to 14\% of questionnaires&#39; ranges). Our work builds upon previous research and demonstrates that our model-building approach can extend to different human-autonomy teaming scenarios. This also represents the first time that three cognitive states were predicted using unobtrusive measures from the same supervisory human-autonomy teaming task. Our research enables future experiments investigating an autonomous system which adapts according to cognitive state predictions.},

The distance between the estimated point-of-gaze and the visual axis can be used as an error metric; however, horizontal errors cannot be evaluated, and an additional error metric is required to assess the reliability of the estimated point-of-gaze. Therefore, we propose a novel error metric using the correlation between binocular corneal images. We hypothesize that binocular corneal images extracted around the reflection of the estimated point-of-gaze exhibit a high correlation when the 3D point-of-gaze is correctly estimated. The two approaches were implemented using the corneal images extracted directly and generated based on binocular corneal imaging, and these approaches were evaluated through comparative experiments.

  abstract  = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies have potential for the behavioral screening of autistic children but how to design a tool and analyse behavior reliably is challenging. Based on psychophysiological computation, this paper proposes an interactive behavior perception analytical model for autism screening. We presented the multi-scenario reactive behavior paradigms that designed based on the atypical characteristics of autistic children. We recorded the eye movement data and facial data of 91 participants, and performed multi-modal feature extraction, used machine learning to train classification model. We conducted comparative experiments, and the experimental results verified the advantages of multi-scenario paradigms and multi-modal feature groups, which indicates that our analysis methods and screening models are effective and reliable and have real research significance.},

  abstract  = {The pupil center and glints have been used in conventional eye-gaze estimations, and the optical axis and point-of-gaze are calculated using these as keys. However, the pupil center used as a basis gets shifted when the diameter of the pupil varies, and the variance in illumination condition leads to degradation of accuracy. Therefore, we propose a semi-automated annotation for iris detection and a model-based gaze estimation method that uses an iris center. The iris area was extracted using segmentation trained with annotated data. The optical axis is determined using the iris center, which does not shift, and is therefore implemented instead of the pupil center. We evaluated the robustness of the proposed gaze estimation through an experiment under changing illumination conditions and confirmed the effectiveness of the iris-based estimation.},

Therefore, rehabilitation using real stairs is difficult. Therefore, stair training on a flat surface using motor imagery is expected to be a new rehabilitation training method that eliminates the fear of falling. This paper proposes a new rehabilitation training method that simultaneously provides a visual presentation using virtual reality (VR) and a force sensation to the muscular senses using a pneumatic gel muscle (PGM). The system is designed to allow users to perceive the sensation of descending stairs. To verify the effectiveness of the system, we confirmed the muscle activity of the quadriceps muscle using electromyography (EMG) and evaluated the presence of the sensation of descending stairs using a psychological evaluation.},

Brain activity can often only be associated with observed behavioral outcomes. In other words, it is difficult to speculate on unmanifested behavior due to factors such as “hesitation” in humans. When a prediction model can predict mice behavior, if brain activity is observed in a specific brain region during incorrect predictions, that would be strong evidence of unmanifest behavior. In this study, we developed a trajectory prediction model to predict the walking trajectory of mice as a prelude to the behavior prediction model. The prediction model was applied to the behavioral analysis of mice administered an anxiolytic drug (diazepam) or saline, revealing significantly different outcomes.},

To better to develop the potential for CNN tutors, this research configures a public data set for CNN teaching as an enlightenment textbook to guide Transformer&#39;s training and avoid falling into local optimization prematurely. The distillation process then employs a “learn-digest-self-distillation” learning strategy to enable the Transformer to assimilate CNN knowledge in a structured manner. Sufficient experiments show that the proposed method is significantly better than the direct training Transformer under the condition of limited data sets. Moreover, in order to show the practical application value, this research contributed a practical data set for the classification of smoking and calling.

However, recent evidence suggests that variations in domains resulting from differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each imaging facility can overshadow pathological attributes. In this study, we propose a novel approach known as multidecoder adversarial domain adaptation (MD-ADA) to obtain low-dimensional representations of brain MR images that preserve pathological features while mitigating domain differences. This method combines adversarial domain adaptation techniques with convolutional autoencoders that have distinct decoders for each domain and employs adversarial learning to prevent domain discrimination from the produced low-dimensional representations. Experimental evaluations on two datasets, ADNI and PPMI, comprising 4,168 brain images demonstrate that the proposed MD-ADA significantly reduces domain differences between datasets without compromising the recoverability of brain images or the accuracy of disease classification.},

Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving performance of GNNs.

One of the possible solutions to this problem is Neural Network (NN) compression, which is a process of obtaining a derived model serving the same task with a smaller number of parameters or with parameters of lower precision. The most common NN compression techniques include pruning, sparse representation, quantization, and knowledge transfer. In this article, the compression of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using fractional differentiation is investigated. A for-mulation of this task as a large-scale continuous optimization problem is then proposed, and its resolution is performed through a new optimization algorithm, called the Improved Fractal Decomposition Algorithm (IFDA), based on space geometric fractal decomposition. The results obtained show that MobileNetV3, for instance, is compressed by 18.5\% with only a 2.5\% decrease in accuracy. Additionally, the proposed IFDA algorithm outperforms all other competing metaheuristics in solving this problem.},

Constraint Handling Technique (CHT) is needed to extend DE to constrained optimization. Feasibility Rule (FR) is one of the typical CHT. FR addresses constraints by using a simple rule that considers the objective function and constraint violation when comparing search individuals. However, since the solutions with small constraint violation, i.e., feasible solutions, are preferentially selected, the set of search individuals may be biased toward feasible regions and the improvement of the objective function value may stagnate. This paper overcomes this challenge by proposing a DE that uses a superior infeasible solution in an external archive. The external archive in the proposed DE stores search individuals that are superior in both objective function value and constraint violation and utilize them to generate mutant individuals. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method using a benchmark problem where the feasible region is a convex set.},

However, SMDs have limited computing resources and battery energy and cannot execute all tasks of the above applications in a real-time manner. Cloud computing provides enormous computing resources and energy that can easily execute tasks offloaded from SMDs. However, could data centers (CDCs) are often located in remote sites, which leads to long transmission time. Small base stations (SBSs) offer high-bandwidth and low-latency services for SMDs, which solves the problem of cloud computing. However, it becomes a challenge to achieve the lowest cost in such a heterogeneous architecture including multiple SMDs, SBSs, and the CDC while meeting delay requirements of tasks. This work proposes a cost-minimized computation offloading strategy to minimize the total cost of the system. A constrained optimization problem is first formulated based on the hybrid architecture. Afterward, a two-stage optimization algorithm called a Lévy flights and Simulated Annealing-based Grey wolf optimizer (LSAG) is developed to optimize the total cost of the system. In the first stage, the optimal edge selection policy is determined given multiple available SBSs. In the second stage, task offloading and resource allocation among SMDs, SBSs, and the cloud are determined. Experiments with real-life tasks prove that LSAG significantly achieves lower cost with faster convergence speed than state-of-the-art peers.},

Most prior works introduce delicate designs on either local feature aggregators or global geometric architecture, but few combine two scales effectively. Therefore, to better incorporate the advantages of both local and global processing, we propose DS-Point, a dual-scale 3D framework for point cloud understanding. DS-Point firstly disentangles 3D features from channel dimension for concurrent dual-scale modeling, i.e., point-wise convolution for local fine-grained geometry parsing, and voxel-wise attention for global long-range spatial exploration. Upon that, an HF-fusion module is proposed to enhance the cross-modal interaction and thoroughly blend the dual-scale features. Then, with task-specific heads for different downstream tasks, DS-Point serves as an effective 3D framework for feature extraction. By the dual-scale paradigm, DS-Point achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks, e.g., 93.8\% for shape classification on ModelNet40, 84.9\% on ScanObjectNN, and 84.3\% on ShapeNetPart.},

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are dominant in the field of machine learning. However, because DNN models have large computational complexity, implementation of DNN models on resource-limited equipment is challenging. Therefore, techniques of compressing DNN models without degrading their accuracy is desired. Pruning is one such technique that removes unimportant neurons (or channels). In this paper, we present Pruning with Output Error Minimization (POEM), a method that performs not only pruning but also reconstruction to compensate the error caused by pruning. The strength of POEM lies in its consistent criteria for neuron selection and reconstruction based on output error of the activation function, whereas the previous methods use ad hoc criteria or relax the problem to minimize error before the activation function. The experiments with the well-known DNN models (VGG-16, ResNet-18, MobileNet) and image recognition datasets (ImageNet, CUB-200-2011) were conducted.

  abstract  = {Emotion detection has become an increasingly important area of research in recent years, as it has numerous applications in fields such as psychology, marketing, and human-computer interaction. Deep learning has shown success in emotion recognition due to the availability of large amounts of data and the ability to learn complex patterns in facial expressions, speech, and physiological signals when recognizing emotions. However, there are challenges associated with variations in lighting, pose, and facial expressions. This study introduces a novel deep-learning approach for emotion detection, leveraging the power of VGGFace2 to classify six emotional poses in children. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in the field, achieving a success rate of 96.3\% on the CAFE dataset. A comprehensive evaluation of the findings and a detailed discussion of their potential implications is offered as part of the study. Facial Emotion Recognition (FER), VGGFace2, emotion detection},

  abstract  = {As one of the highly used components in the power system, digital relays are employed to use the phasor measurement units&#39;, voltage, and current signals, to decide whether a fault has occurred in the system or not. The major difference between digital relays and traditional ones is that the former receives the mentioned signals mostly by wireless communication paths, instead of using measurement transformers. While the wireless signals used as the input of digital relays are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, a proper cybersecurity solution for digital relays is demanding. Due to the pervasive use of AI-based techniques in cybersecurity, one of the most vital features of a cybersecurity method is its training data volume. Hence, we employed a modified generative adversarial network that is able to generate attacked data by itself, meaning that there is no need to train the neural network with the cyber-attacked data. Additionally, a feature selection method called extra tree classifier is used to reduce the dimension of our input data. The discriminator sector of the generative adversarial network is then used as the classifier to detect false data injection, civil attacks, and faults which is preventing the digital relay from tripping falsely. The two mentioned cyber-attacks, false data injection and civil-attack, are used to evaluate the performance of our proposed method in 29 different scenarios. The IEEE 39-bus transmission network is employed as our test system. The proposed cyber-attack detection method was able to classify the faults and mentioned cyber-attacks in most scenarios with more than 97 percent of accuracy, f1 score, and more than 96 percent of sensitivity. We also examined the proposed modified GAN-based method by giving it only the voltage signal as input for training, and the method scored at least 90 percent of accuracy, 87 percent of sensitivity, and 88 percent of f1 score in harsh scenarios which is almost as accurately as before when both voltage and current signals were used for the relay as inputs, making the proposed technique universal and suitable for other types of relays.},

  abstract  = {By using an autoencoder as a dimension reduction tool, an Autoencoder-embedded Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (ATLBO) has been proved to be effective in solving high-dimensional computationally expensive problems through several widely used function problems. However, the following two crucial issues have not been resolved, 1) ATLBO should be verified by solving real-life optimization problems; and 2) how autoencoder parameters and structures impact AEO&#39;s performance. In this work, ATLBO is verified by an energy consumption minimization problem (ECM) in mobile edge computing systems. To design an effective autoencoder for ATLBO, this work proposes a parameter tuning optimization strategy for autoencoders. By using the proposed Autoencoder Parameter Tuning (APT) strategy, ATLBO can enjoy higher robustness than those without it. The experimental results show that it is three to six times better than state-of-the-art methods in solving ECM. We consider the strategy-induced overhead and take the execution time as the primary criterion to evaluate them. In addition, the experimental results show that, against the conventional wisdom that higher-accuracy auto encoders bring higher system performance, lower-accuracy ones can actually assist ATLBO in locating the best solutions. This work promotes a novel application of autoencoders in optimization theory and practice.},

The addressed problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. In this paper, we decompose the MINLP and the optimal computing resource allocation policy under a deterministic offloading strategy obtained by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

The adaptive large neighborhood search and the variable neighborhood descent stages are jointly employed in HALNS. The proposed algorithm, an improved simulated annealing algorithm, and a modified variable neighborhood search algorithm are executed to evaluate their performances.

This work proposes a hybrid spatio-temporal neural network with attention named CTGA to effectively identify anomalous traffic. CTGA combines a Convolutional neural network (CNN), a Temporal convolutional network (TCN), a bidirectional Gated recurrent unit network (BiGRU), and a self-Attention mechanism. It automatically extracts temporal and spatial features of sequences from raw data by sliding window preprocessing followed by CNN, TCN, BiGRU, and the self-attention mechanism to detect anomalous data. CNN is used to extract spatial features of time sequences and reduce the loss of spatial information. In the sequence, TCN obtains short-term features. Long-term dependencies in the data are captured by BiGRU, and the self-attention mechanism obtains important information in the sequence. Finally, experiments with the real-life Yahoo S5 dataset prove that CTGA outperforms other approaches substantially.},

Vehicles cannot compute all tasks locally due to their limited computing power and battery capacity. Thus, it is a useful way to offload some tasks of vehicles to other resource-rich servers. However, due to the high mobility of vehicles, there may be a failure of returning computing results. Thus, it is a challenge to minimize the latency of tasks while meeting the constraint of energy consumption. This work proposes a vehicle-fog offloading system that offloads tasks to fog servers or idle vehicles which is a probabilistic offloading problem. So this work proposes an improved optimization algorithm called an adaptive Lévy flight-based Whale optimization algorithm with Hierarchical learning (LWH) to solve this problem. Simulation experiments show that LWH has strong global search capability and outperforms its five typical and widely used algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Edge computing is a new architectural model that aims to offer computing, storage, and networking resources to support Internet of Things. Its primary strategy involves transferring computational tasks to the edge of network, which is closer to end-users. This paradigm facilitates offloading of computation, resulting in reduced latency and improved system performance. However, nodes located at the network edge have restricted energy and resources. As a result, running tasks entirely at the edge leads to higher energy consumption. This work proposes a novel three-tier offloading framework comprising of multiple mobile vehicles (MVs), a base station (BS), and a cloud data center (CDC). It jointly optimizes offloading rates of tasks, CPU computation rates of MVs, BS, and CDC, and the allocation of wireless bandwidth resources at MVs during partial computation offloading of tasks. It also considers limits of maximum computational resources and maximum delay of task execution. To further reduce the total system energy consumption, this work actively caches execution codes of tasks in MEC servers to reduce data transmission energy of MVs, which minimizes the total system energy consumption. This work develops a mixed integer nonlinear program and designs a mixed meta-heuristic algorithm with a multi-strategy adaptive particle swarm optimizer. Simulation results demonstrate that it outperforms various state-of-the-art algorithms by achieving lower energy consumption in fewer iterations.},

  abstract  = {Semantic segmentation of bone structures requires pixel-wise classification and high accuracy to build a precise bone model capable of diagnoses. Various segmentation methods have been developed, and state-of-the-art models, such as DeepLabv3+, are generally based on a Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN). A CNN requires many images for training, and high performance is not expected when few training images are available. In general, it is costly to obtain training images, known as ground truth for bone segmentation, because ground truth images are usually handcrafted by experts. Considering the lack of training images, we aim to develop a robust method in an environment with few images. U-Net is a well-known CNN and is often adopted for medical image segmentation because it can train with very few images compared to other models, thanks to its U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture. However, it is reported that U-Net cannot capture complex shapes in spine images. In this paper, we propose combing the advantages of both U-Net and DeepLabv3+. Specifically, we incorporate atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP), which is used in DeepLabv3+, into U-Net to adopt varying-sized convolutions to capture precise bone structure. Because applying ASPP to all convolution layers of U-Net would be computationally expensive, it was applied after the encoder as the first step. It is known that the last convolution layer before the fully connected layer expresses visual features in a classification model; therefore, we hypothesized that the layer after the encoder would provide more inherent specific features than other layers in U-Net. Moreover, the Gaussian conditional random field (CRF) was utilized to refine the output semantic segmentation map. We evaluated the proposed model on spine and femur image datasets from Cancer Imaging Archive. We confirmed that the proposed method outperforms U-Net, and observed that both ASPP and CRF are effective for the performance improvement of U-Net.},

In this work, we transplant the connectome of the fruit fly lateral horn to a reservoir computer (RC), and investigate the extent to which this ‘fruit fly RC’ (FFRC) exhibits multifunctionality using the ‘seeing double’ problem as a benchmark test. We furthermore explore the dynamics of how this FFRC achieves multifunctionality while varying the network&#39;s spectral radius. Compared to the widely-used Erdös-Renyi Reservoir Computer (ERRC), we report that the FFRC exhibits a greater capacity for multifunctionality; is multifunctional across a broader hyperparameter range; and solves the seeing double problem far beyond the previously observed spectral radius limit, wherein the ERRC&#39;s dynamics become chaotic.},

Graph representation learning aims at generating lower-dimensional representations from higher-dimensional graph data, which is a crucial step that facilitates the follow-up tasks, such as node and graph classifications. In this paper, we present a simple but effective graph representation learning method, namely the pyramid pooling-based local profile (PPLP), which enables local nodal profiles to be transformed into a graph representation, with multi-scale features extracted. PPLP can be either embedded into a graph neural network as the readout layer, or perform independently as a graph embedding algorithm. The resultant representations of PPLP are for graph-level tasks. PPLP is experimentally tested by performing graph classification tasks on ten representative datasets, either as the readout layer of different graph neural networks, or as an independent graph embedding algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1) when embedded into graph neural networks, PPLP outperforms the widely-used global pooling-based readout methods; 2) as an independent graph embedding algorithm, PPLP performs fairly good, especially on the social network datasets. The investigation confirms PPLP as a simple but promising method for graph-level tasks.},

Currently, Zerobot is operated remotely, and the next goal is to perform automatic needle puncture surgery. There is a challenge that automatic detection of puncture needle from CT images for first step of automatic puncture surgery. Because there is the case that the form of puncture needle is curved, it is necessary to detect the needle from CT image instead of estimating the needle position from arm of Zerobot. First, the method detects ROI with ResNet. Next, difference of the CT value is calculated for each pixel in the ROI, and a linear approximation is performed for to detect the needle shape. Images from animal experiments were used to evaluate the learner and image processing. We confirmed that the proposed method can detect needles in a single image and in multiple images.},

  abstract  = {Depth information is useful to surgeons and surgical assistance systems. However, it is a challenging task to estimate the depth of various surgical scenes based on a monocular endoscope. We propose a depth estimation approach for a monocular endoscope with a stereo matching algorithm. The monocular endoscope is moved horizontally by a robotic endoscope holder to simulate a stereo vision system. The main challenge is how to obtain a proper baseline for better depth information generation as the depth range of a surgical scene is unknown beforehand. We design a baseline evaluation and selection algorithm to search for suitable baselines for surgical scenes with different depth ranges. Experimental results show that our approach improves the average accuracy of different depth scenarios by 10.8\% when the error range is 2mm.},

  abstract  = {Edge Detectors are one of the most fundamental tools used in Computer Vision applications. Using deep learning, state-of-the-art (SOTA) models are able to produce sharp, fine edges, mirroring human-level performance. However, most of these SOTA models are trained solely on color images. We experimentally determined that this skewed data severely hinders performance on images from other domain spaces. In this paper, we propose a way to adapt SOTA models to single-channel inputs from other domains with minimal overhead, using small-scale feed-forward networks. Our model, which serves as an additional layer to existing SOTA models, greatly boosts their performance on out-of-domain data, allowing the edge detector to generalize to new domain spaces without undergoing extensive, resource-or data-heavy retraining. Using a single off-the-shelf GPU and a small 30-image dataset, we were able to train this low-complexity (less than 13k parameters) model in half an hour to boost the F-score of the produced edgemaps for chest x-rays by over 0.2.},

It is very important for early and correct diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we focus on detecting four diagnoses of treatable retinal diseases in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. The fuzzy medical image retrieval model (FMIR) is applied to transfer images to fuzzy signatures organized in Fuzzy S-tree, as it was previously successfully used for breast cancer detection and COVID-19 chest X-ray detection. The paper examines and compares the performance of the FMIR method on 4-class and binary classification models built on an OCT dataset and compares the impact of two metrics, Euclidean and Hamming fuzzy distances. The experiments show a clear dominance of Hamming fuzzy distance. The best accuracy is achieved for binary classification (61.16 - 93.8\%), while the performance of the 4-class model is worse (51.7\%). The distribution of signature space and classification performance are analyzed in detail.},

  abstract  = {An Undirected Weighted Network (UWN) is frequently encountered in a big-data-related application concerning the complex interactions among numerous nodes. A Symmetric High-Dimensional and Incomplete (SHDI) matrix can smoothly illustrate such a UWN, which contains rich knowledge like node interaction behaviors and local complexes. To extract desired knowledge from an SHDI matrix, an analysis model should carefully consider its topology for describing a UWN&#39;s intrinsic symmetry precisely. Representation learning to a UWN borrows the success of a pyramid of symmetry-aware models like a Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) model whose objective function utilizes a sole Latent Factor (LF) matrix for representing SHDI&#39;s symmetry precisely. However, they suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) their computational complexity is high; and 2) their modeling strategy narrows their representation features, making them suffer from low learning ability. Aiming at addressing the above critical issues, this paper proposes a Multi-constrained Symmetric Nonnegative Latent-factor-analysis (MSNL) model with two-fold ideas: 1) introducing multi-constraints composed of multiple LF matrices, i.e., inequality and equality ones into a data-density-oriented objective function for precisely representing the intrinsic symmetry of an SHDI matrix with broadened feature space; and 2) implementing an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-incorporated learning scheme for efficiently solving such a multi-constrained model. Empirical studies on three SHDI matrices from a real bioinformatics or industrial application demonstrate that the proposed MSNL model achieves higher representation accuracy than state-of-the-art models do, as well as promising computational efficiency.},

One challenge is that haptic information, which is a significant part of guide-dog training, is difficult to explain and visualize. Virtual reality (VR) systems have attracted attention owing to their ability to support high-level immersive interactions with the presence of multisensory experiences. A haptic-enabled VR system could address the limitations of the conventional method and support novice trainers in practicing in an immersive and remote transmission manner. This study presents a handle-based sensing setup for recording haptic experiences of trainers during guide dog training for use in a VR system. Considering trainers perceive and apply forces via handle to obtain and control dog motion status, the applied forces are decoded as haptic information and recorded using corresponding sensors. While accuracy of proposed setup for collecting required data is checked to be high(average errors of validating forces and yaw angles are 0.4N and 0.93° respectively), we believe that the proposed recording system is able to measure haptic experiences for further haptic experience re-establishments in proposed VR guide-dog training system and could finally facilitate the education of a large number of dog trainers.},

  abstract  = {Many attempts have been made at estimating discrete emotions (calmness, anxiety, boredom, surprise, anger) and continuous emotional measures commonly used in psychology, namely ‘valence’ (The pleasantness of the emotion being displayed) and ‘arousal’ (The intensity of the emotion being displayed). Existing methods to estimate arousal and valence rely on learning from data sets, where an expert annotator labels every image frame. Access to an expert annotator is not always possible, and the annotation can also be tedious. Hence it is more practical to obtain self-reported arousal and valence values directly from the human in a real-time Human-Robot collaborative setting. Hence this paper provides an emotion data set (HRI-AVC) obtained while conducting a human-robot interaction (HRI) task. The self-reported pair of labels in this data set is associated with a set of image frames. This paper also proposes a spatial and temporal attention-based network to estimate arousal and valence from this set of image frames. The results show that an attention-based network can estimate valence and arousal on the HRI-AVC data set even when Arousal and Valence values are unavailable per frame.},

Participants are granted extensive autonomy to determine their strategy as they navigate an immersive environment to pursue their objective of locating and defusing improvised explosive devices. We use Granger causality methods to identify when a participant&#39;s behaviors are predictive of their teammate&#39;s behaviors, which we refer to in this study as Granger leadership. Participants that did the most leading in their team were identified as leaders while their teammates were identified as followers. Results indicated better task performance for teams that more evenly shared leadership responsibilities. We also found that gaze fixation rates increased and blink rates decreased with increasing Granger leadership values. This indicates that Granger leadership may be a surrogate for task engagement, and that interventions aimed at improving team performance should attempt to encourage engagement of the followers within a group.},

To support this endeavour, the Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Toronto Research Centre (TRC) has led a research effort &#39;Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for SRT in the CAF’ since 2019. In the first research phase, key stakeholders within the Department of National Defence (DND) and CAF were engaged in a series of meetings and interviews to help identify future SRT concepts across a broad range of missions and operational environments. During the stakeholder analysis, five SRT use cases were developed and validated for the CAF to capture the intended SRT CONOPS, operational priorities, operational contexts, functionality, interactions, and expected mission performance, and to support Land Operations at section and platoon levels. To further facilitate SRT concept development and experimentation activities at DRDC TRC, a synthetic modeling and simulation environment was proposed and developed, in support of future SRT effectiveness research on team communication, coordination, collaboration and trust. In the meantime, this effort can also support studies on human-machine interface and human-systems integration, as well as help carry out SRT human-in-the-loop experiments and trials, for the CAF needs of reducing soldier workload and improving team performance and effectiveness in future SRT operations.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel and compact Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for hand gesture recognition using High-Density surface Electromyogram (HD-sEMG) signals. Capitalizing on their ability to extract spatiotemporal features of HD-sEMG signals along with their proven strength in imitating human brain&#39;s neural activity using event-driven data processing, we used SNNs as the main building block of our proposed hand gesture recognition model. We show that our proposed model can efficiently differentiate 14 hand movements by considering each sample of the HD-sEMG data as a single time step for the SNN architecture. Moreover, we show that the proposed SNN model does not require huge pre-processing, spike encoding and feature extraction tasks and works effectively on Min-Max normalized continuous-value sEMG signals. We evaluate our SNN model using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme and categorize different participants based on the range of classification accuracy we obtained for them. The following results are acquired by segmenting HD-sEMG signals into windows of size 62.5ms with no overlap. The proposed method led to 6 out of 19 subjects achieving average classification accuracy of ≥ 80\% with maximum accuracy of 98\% associated with 3 rd session of the sEMG dataset as the test set.},

  abstract  = {Action Recognition in videos is a topic of interest in the area of computer vision, due to potential applications such as multimedia indexing and surveillance in public areas. In this research, we first propose spatial and temporal Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), based on transfer learning using ResNetl0l, GoogleNet and VGG16, for undertaking human action recognition. Besides that, hybrid networks such as CNN-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models are also exploited as encoder-decoder architectures for video action classification. In particular, different types of RNNs such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional-LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional-GRU (BiGRU), are exploited as the decoders for action recognition. To further enhance performance, diverse aggregation networks of CNN and CNN-RNN models are implemented. Specifically, an Average Fusion method is used to integrate spatial and temporal CNN s trained on images, as well as CNN - RNN trained on videos, where the final classification is formed by combining Softmax scores of these models via a late fusion. A total of 22 models (1 motion CNN, 3 spatial CNNs, 12 CNN-RNNs and 6 fusion networks) are implemented which are evaluated using UCF11, UCFSO, and UCF10l datasets for performance comparison. The empirical results indicate the significant efficiency of Average Fusion of multiple Spatial-CNNs with one Motion-CNN, and ResNet101-BiGRU, among all the networks for undertaking realistic video action recognition.},

Our previously developed novel interface allows a user to operate a robot intuitively because the user manipulates this interface according to the Cartesian coordinate system. However, interference between the axes in the interface causes unintended input by the user and reduces operability. In this study, we develop a model that identifies whether each input is the user&#39;s intended or unintended input. We obtained the displacement and angle of the interface&#39;s grip in each direction and investigated the interference relationships between axes. As a result, the large interferences were in the pairs of pitch and Z-axis, and yaw and Y-axis. Finally, we constructed an identification model using a recurrent neural network. The models for all axes achieved F1 scores above 0.97.},

Using significantly different GUIs may also increase the risk of human error, since the GUIs may have different rules or mechanisms that operators should follow. To improve the design consistency across different machine manufacturers and third-party suppliers, there is a need for a design system that crane manufacturers and third-party suppliers can use when developing their own GUIs.

However, force feedback methods that involve a reaction force often require bulky equipment. Instead, our study has utilized force feedback using vibrotactile stimulation. Although the modulation method of force information to vibrotactile stimulation has previously been demonstrated in magnitude (AM) and frequency (FM), we propose a method called AFM that uses amplitude and frequency modulation simultaneously to improve performance. In particular, we adjusted the amplitude using the sensation level and used logarithmized frequency for the AFM. First, the vibrotactile detection threshold of participants was measured to determine the amplitude to be equivalent in the same sensation level among participants. Then, the performance of discrimination was evaluated through stair-case psychophysical experiments. The results showed that our proposal AFM method significantly improved the discrimination sensitivity for the force information as compared with AM and FM methods.},

  abstract  = {The application of self-driving technology to personal mobility vehicles (PMVs) is being investigated. Passengers of self-driving PMVs will likely be engaged in activities with visual processing, such as operating smartphones. Thus, self-driving PMVs need to consider the possibility that passengers will perform these activities and the ease of performing these activities. However, little research has considered such passengers&#39; convenience when using self-driving PMVs as a service. It is known that visual information is particularly dominant among input information to human beings. As was observed in previous works, changes in the surrounding environment due to moving may negatively impact the passenger&#39;s main activities with visual information processing. The traveling speed affects these changes in the surrounding, and it is a parameter of self-driving methods. Therefore, this paper aims to grasp the effect of traveling speed on passengers&#39; visual processing during self-driving of PMVs to realize self-driving PMVs on which passengers can easily process information. The effect of the traveling speed of self-driving PMV on task performance and mental workload of passengers&#39; visual processing was investigated by conducting a simulator experiment. The results showed that although the task performance is maintained, the mental workload of visual processing increases when the PMV moves compared to the stopping condition. Moreover, it was suggested that the visual input of the changing environment and the passenger&#39;s gaze behavior influence the increase in mental workload.},

To address this issue, a runway exit prediction decision aid, with explainability, was developed with the trait of providing explanations involving the top three contributing features to its predictions. To evaluate the influence of the intelligent decision aid&#39;s explanations on ATCO Trust, the decision aid was used in a human-in-the-loop study during off-nominal runway exits, utilizing 12 participants and a total of 67 trials. A multi modal approach was adopted with three types of data (questionnaire, behavioural, physiological) being collected in this study to ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of explainability on ATCO trust. The results indicated that higher levels of perceived transparency led to an increase in trust levels, with an accompanied increase in cognitive load and complacency, even with low prediction accuracy by the intelligent decision aid. As such, these effects must be accounted for in designing XAI decision aids, which are defined as decision aids that rationalize their recommendations, for off-nominal events, when attempting to enhance trust levels by increasing transparency.},

Its focus is on understanding how human cognition contributes to a more secure and harmonious coexistence between humans and machines in industrial scenarios, employing solutions that prioritize fundamental worker demands while preserving or enhancing industrial productivity. In this context, the ability to assess fatigue objectively is crucial for occupational health and safety because it can reduce cognitive and motor function, ultimately lowering productivity and raising the risk of harm to human operators. To this end, wearable systems provide a promising solution for continuous, non-intrusive, and long-term monitoring of biological signals for fatigue detection. However, the adoption of these devices presents unique challenges, such as inter-individual variability that renders traditional one-size-fits-all machine learning models unsuitable. This paper provides an analysis of the current state-of-the-art for wearable device monitoring, including ongoing issues and current knowledge gaps. In addition, an experimental analysis is presented, employing a pattern discovery pipeline based on unsupervised learning on a real-world dataset. Our analysis provides experimental evidence of the limitations of one of the classical approaches to fatigue assessment, thus highlighting the need for more advanced models.},

These datasets have been used in studies that investigate variability in human driving behavior, for example for scenario-based validation of autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior, modeling driver behavior, or validating driver models. Thus far, these studies focused on the variability on an operational level (e.g., velocity profiles during a lane change), not on a tactical level (i.e., to change lanes or not). Investigating the variability on both levels is necessary to develop driver models and AV s that include multiple tactical behaviors. To expose multi-level variability, the human responses to the same traffic scene could be investigated. However, no method exists to automatically extract similar scenes from datasets. Here, we present a four-step extraction method that uses the Hausdorff distance, a mathematical distance metric for sets. We performed a case study on the highD dataset that showed that the method is practically applicable. The human responses to the selected scenes exposed the variability on both the tactical and operational levels. With this new method, the variability in operational and tactical human behavior can be investigated, without the need for costly and time-consuming driving-simulator experiments.},

Similar challenges are well known in the analysis of turbulent flows, which exhibit complex space-time correlations resulting from large-scale structures. The similarities motivated us to conduct this feasibility work of applying analytic methods of fluid dynamics – i.e., a scheme combining spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) and spherical harmonics as basis functions – to EEG data for identifying features representing mental states. Based on EEG data of an existing BCI Hackathon, the scheme yielded some relevant features across subjects and sessions by relying only on a Fourier transform in time and the basis functions in space. The features were then classified by employing a conventional support vector machine algorithm to produce an accuracy comparable to those reported in a previous study on the same EEG data. This performance comparability indicates the scheme&#39;s potential for analyzing EEG data in BCI applications. Nevertheless, future work is needed to select specific features as general indicators of mental workload.},

  abstract  = {The detection of an individual&#39;s attentional state via a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) holds significant promise, offering a multitude of possibilities, including enhancing the usability of applications and enabling timely alerts in hazardous situations. However, the variability of EEG data between individuals and the dynamic nature of recordings pose practical challenges for achieving reliable results with BCIs. Thus, conventional methods often require the collection of each person&#39;s training data prior to usage, which is then used to train an individual model for detection. Such training data collection, makes it difficult to achieve practical use. To overcome this challenge, we propose a self-improving online learning system that personalizes a person-independent model for detecting attentional state in real-time during runtime. This eliminates the need for collecting individual training data prior to usage and instead generates the necessary labels for adaptation using automatically detected error-related potentials. The system was developed based on pre-trained models of two classifiers and used to evaluate different strategies of adaptation and label generation. A statistically significant accuracy improvement of 0.088 was achieved across all available subjects, based on simulations with pre-recorded data. These results suggest that person-dependent models for attentional state detection could in the future be substituted by self-improving classifiers that do not require a dedicated training data collection.},

Previously, acoustic, articulatory, and textual representations of speech have been decoded from neural recordings. Semantic representations of speech could add additional information about the content of the produced speech. In this study, we show that semantic embeddings for individual words, as extracted by a word2vec-model, can be used to reconstruct neural activity during speech production across wide-spread cortical and subcortical areas. We elucidate the temporal dynamics of reconstruction quality and show that a slight right hemisphere preference exists.

Non-invasive neuroimaging modalities lack either the spatial or temporal resolution to reveal the nuances of neural processes involved in perception of musical rhythms. Intracranial recordings of electrophysiological activity such as electrocorticography (ECoG) can jointly provide spatial and temporal resolution for improved characterization and modeling of the underlying processes. The present study examines anticipatory and perceptual models that use ECoG recordings to estimate simple perceived and imagined musical rhythms in human participants. The resulting models are characterized and compared across participants. The results show that the anticipatory and perceptual models can reconstruct the auditory stimulus envelope with statistically-significant correlations when trained and tested on independent listening data. However, these models are unable to reliably reconstruct the expected rhythm pattern when trained on listening data and applied to imagining data. This suggests, similar to recent findings in overt and imagined speech decoding using intracranial signals, that there are likely distinct neural substrates activated during listening and imagining of musical rhythms.},

In this work, we applied five different feature importance approaches to three different datasets focused on internally and externally directed attention. The methods used were: Random Forest Importance, Mutual Information, Permutation Importance, Shapley Additive Explanations, and an Ablation Study. We determined the importance of EEG channels, compared the results among the algorithms through correlation analysis, and evaluated the classification performance using different subsets of channels to validate the importance rankings. The results indicate that, in line with the existing literature, electrodes located on the right parietal cortex with the alpha frequency band appear to be the most important, followed by several channels covering the left parietal and frontal lobes. For the first dataset, we were able to reduce the number of channels from 32 to 2 while increasing the accuracy from approximately 60\% to 62\%. In the second dataset, we reduced the number of channels from 12 to 1 while improving the accuracy from approximately 59.5\% to 64\%. In the third dataset, we reduced the number of channels from 19 to 1 while only slightly decreasing the accuracy from approximately 60\% to 58.5\%. The results of the individual feature importance methods generally exhibit positive correlations with each other. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the rankings of channels between subjects are largely positively correlated, suggesting the presence of shared patterns of neural activity across subjects. The substantial reduction in EEG channels, identification of crucial brain regions and application of channel feature importance methods to internal/external attention data, collectively advance the development of cost-effective and efficient Brain-Computer Interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in the field.},

  abstract  = {Electroencephalography (EEG) signals capture the electrical activity of the brain and have traditionally been used in clinical settings. More recently, with the development of mobile, wearable EEG devices their use has been explored for other applications, including emotion recognition, quality of experience monitoring, or fatigue detection, just to name a few. EEG signals are known to have a 1/f-noise like structure and are very low amplitude, thus making them highly susceptible to artefacts, such as power line interference, muscle movement, and eye blinks. Moreover, prototyping and development of new devices to record EEG signals may introduce additional sources of artefacts generated by different instrumentation settings. As such, automated quantification of the quality of the EEG signals has become important and the focus of recent research. Here, we propose a new quality metric based on the 1/f-noise structure of the EEG signal. Experimental results show the proposed metric classifying clean versus noisy EEG segments in a subject-independent setting with an accuracy of 86.0\% for the AF7 electrode location and 64.6\% for AF8, two electrode locations known to be highly degraded by artefacts. Additionally, the proposed metrics are shown to generalize well to unseen electrode locations. For example, a quality model trained on AF7 noisy EEG data achieved an accuracy of 61.4\% when tested on data collected from the AF8 location. EEG, quality, fooof, prototyping},

We used representational similarity analysis for brain states predicted through encoding models based on feature representations at each layer of the CNN, and applied the PageRank algorithm to matrices converted from the generated representational dissimilarity matrices to capture the hub characteristics of brain region-related systems. This succeeded in capturing changes in the hubness of interregional brain coordination during hierarchical information processing in the human cerebral cortex in visual processing. Specifically, we found that the hubness of the occipital visual cortex increased in the early phase of visual processing, and that the hubness of the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe increased in the late phase of visual processing. From the above, we found that our proposed method allows us to capture hierarchical changes in the hubness of interregional coordination.},

  abstract  = {Emerging research has shown that interbrain synchronization can occur when individuals interact on a shared task or receive shared stimuli. While the mechanisms producing such effects are not fully understood, interbrain synchronization has been observed in multiple contexts. Analyses of such synchrony, however, are often limited to individual, bottom-up features such as activity at individual cortical sites and frequency bands, or cross-projections of the data into a common space that maximizes correlation. It is an open question whether synchronization can also be observed using more top-down notions of latent state composed of multiple, simultaneous features that are not fit to the individual or task at hand? Here, we investigate whether latent state estimation methods, borrowed from the domain generalization toolboxes of the brain-computer interface community can be used to assess interbrain synchrony. Domain generalization methods learn models of neural activity that transfer from one domain to another without the need for participant- or task-specific training data. We use data from single individuals in a controlled task to train a domain-generalized model to detect latent state changes previously described as relating to alertness or vigilance. We apply the model to a novel, target domain in which teams of two worked together to locate and defuse simulated improvised explosive devices. Our results revealed significantly greater correlation between the latent states of dyadic partners compared to randomly paired individuals, establishing that interbrain synchronization can be observed using top-down methods that are not fit to the individuals, or task, in question.},

Such signals are excellent candidates for automated pattern recognition through machine learning algorithms. The importance of these patterns can be highlighted through feature extraction techniques. However, the signal variability due to non-stationarity is ignored while extracting features, and which features to use can be challenging to figure out by visual inspection. In this study, we introduce the signal split parameter to account for the variability of the signal and increase the accuracy of the machine learning classifier. We use genetic selection, which allows the selection of the optimal combination of features from a pool of 8 different feature sets. Genetic selection of features increases accuracy and reduces the BCI prediction time. Along with Genetic selection, we also use a reduced signal length, which leads to a higher Information Transfer Rate. Thus this approach enables the design of a fast and accurate motor-related EcoG BCI system.},

  abstract  = {The rapid increase in the elderly and disabled population has been identified as a growing socioeconomic problem. Due to reasons such as a lack of reliable caretakers and the need to empower the elderly and disabled population, it is important to have assistive devices. The interactive capabilities of these devices should match the nature of the interaction that prospective users would have with their companions. Humans communicate with each other in many modalities, such as speech, hand gestures, head gestures, gaze, etc. Hand gestures have been a popular modality that has been used in these interactive devices for speech and mobility-impaired wheelchair users. There have been many gesture models that have been developed recently for hand gesture-controlled wheelchair navigation. Natural hand gestures that are used in human-human interactions include both static and dynamic gestures. Therefore, it was logical to include both of these gestures in a navigational gesture model or hand gesture-controlled navigational system. However, hand tremors that are prevalent among the elderly and disabled community could affect the nature of the hand gesture. These tremors can vary from person to person, and hence the fixed ranges cannot be used for hand features. Hand features such as palm velocity, fingertip velocity, and others will have different ranges from person to person. Due to these reasons, a static hand gesture intended by the human user could be identified as a dynamic gesture. Further, this could lead to the misrecognition of gestures defined in gesture models. Therefore, a system is proposed in this paper to validate the gestures by considering the activity of hand features in 3D regions defined for the gesture. The accuracies of the improved system for static and dynamic gestures were 0.9849 and 0.9840, which were improvements from the accuracies of 0.8994 and 0.8479.},

  abstract  = {The choice of input image size can have a significant impact on the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms. We can always customize the algorithms by training and fine-tuning them on our datasets, but it is time consuming. Nowadays there is a trend to use foundation models but in our application of monitoring patients, both hand detection, object detection and hand-object interaction detection resulted in mediocre performance. This study aimed to investigate the significance of input size for detecting hand-object interaction in two datasets: the patient dataset (captured by super view mode) and the EpicKitchen dataset (captured by normal view mode). The results showed that using different input sizes with the same foundation model can lead to a significant improvement in performance. In the patient dataset, using frames with input sizes of 300 × 300 pixels (px) and 256 × 256 px after cropping and resizing the original images led to more successful hand detection results. Furthermore, using video processing tools like FFmpeg for resizing frames instead of passing the original images to the MediaPipe model for resizing resulted in a 33\% improvement. In the EpicKitchen dataset with normal view mode, successful hand detection results were obtained by resizing frames into a rectangle of 256 px and 300 px after padding and cropping the original images. Overall, the study emphasizes the significance of input size for detecting hand-object interaction detection for the purpose of monitoring patients with upper-limb impairment. The combination analysis within each dataset showed that the most effective combination in hand-object interaction detection is achieved by applying the MediaPipe model to an input image size of 300 × 300 px (for super view mode) or 256 × 256 px (for normal view mode) along with the result of YOLOv7 model with an input image size of 1920 × 1920 px. By using this combination, a 100\% success rate was achieved for both datasets.},

In this study, we examined the effects on prediction error of varying the combination of acceleration measurement sites used for learning and the prediction horizon, which is the target time to be predicted. Prediction errors under certain conditions enabled the prediction of each subject&#39;s average gait speed with an accuracy of 3-5\%. Overall, the prediction error increased with longer prediction horizon but temporarily decreased at 0.4 s. Although prediction is possible using only one site on the lower body, we believe that prediction using multiple sites will reduce the error due to noise.},

To allow patients with hand paralysis to perform gripping motions, it is necessary to assist finger motion and provide sensory information about the gripping force and posture at the residual sensory area. We previously developed a wearable finger-motion assist system that assists finger motion and measures the gripping force necessary to present sensory information. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose and develop a wearable system that provides multiple types of sensory information based on gripping force and finger posture estimated by finger-motion assist system, and to confirm the basic performance of the system through experiments. We developed a band-type sensory feedback system that tightens the forearm in response to gripping force using tendon-driven wires. A vibrator is installed in it, and the intensity of vibration changes in response to finger posture. As basic experiments, identification of gripping force and finger posture using band squeezing and vibration was tested. The results showed the overall identification rate for the combination of gripping force and finger posture that were both correct was 75.6\%. The identification rates for gripping force and finger posture when stimulations were presented simultaneously were 93.3\% and 80.9\%, respectively. In conclusion, we confirmed the feasibility of this system that presents multiple types of sensory information.},

  abstract  = {Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are increasingly important in improving driving safety and comfort, with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) being one of the most widely used. However, pre-defined ACC settings may not always align with driver&#39;s preferences and habits, leading to discomfort and potential safety issues. Personalized ACC (P-ACC) has been proposed to address this problem, but most existing research uses historical driving data to imitate behaviors that conform to driver preferences, neglecting real-time driver feedback. To bridge this gap, we propose a cloud-vehicle collaborative P-ACC framework that incorporates driver feedback adaptation in real time. The framework is divided into offline and online parts. The offline component records the driver&#39;s naturalistic car-following trajectory and uses inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to train the model on the cloud. In the online component, driver feedback is used to update the driving gap preference in real time. The model is then retrained on the cloud with driver&#39;s takeover trajectories, achieving incremental learning to better match driver&#39;s preference. Human-in-the-loop (HuiL) simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces driver intervention in automatic control systems by up to 62.8\%. By incorporating real-time driver feedback, our approach enhances the comfort and safety of P-ACC, providing a personalized and adaptable driving experience.},

Various methods for examining metamorphopsia have been suggested in the current literature, with the most advanced techniques demonstrating the ability to yield quantitative measurements.

In this study, our objective is to enhance the time efficiency of the inspection process and alleviate the burden placed on the user. We propose a novel user-friendly quantitative inspection system which utilizes interactive reinforcement learning. Instead of having users directly operate the system, we ask them to evaluate the stimuli generated by the system. Based on their evaluations, the system gradually refines the deformation map representing the distortion perceived by the user. The reinforcement learning scheme is implemented using relevance feedback approach based on optimum-path forest classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, subjective evaluation experiments involving simulated and real metamorphopsia participants were conducted in this study. The experimental findings reveal that, when compared to the state-of-the-art method, our proposed system yields comparable inspection out-comes while significantly reducing both the inspection duration and the mental workload.},

  abstract  = {While there has been renewed interest in the use of myoelectric control for general-purpose applications, the burden of training and maintaining robust models still limits its real-world viability. Online unsupervised adaptation has been proposed to solve this issue by updating the model using predicted pseudo-labels in real time during regular device use. Until now, however, these unsupervised strategies have been limited as they rely on the very classifier outputs they are adapting, making them ill-suited when there is a drastic shift in the input space (e.g., after donning and doffing a device) or there is insufficient training data. In such situations, leveraging context (i.e., task-specific information that can help understand or assess a circumstance) could provide additional guidance for adaptation and improve its robustness. Although difficult to extract in traditional prosthesis control use cases without additional sensors, context may be more readily available in other general-purpose applications, such as in human-computer interaction. In this study, we explore leveraging context, both positive (i.e., reinforcing correct actions) and negative (i.e., correcting poor actions), for conditioning pseudo-label predictions within an adaptive gamified target acquisition setting. The results show that leveraging this additional con-text significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art high-confidence unsupervised adaptation (p&lt;0.05) using both offline and online performance metrics. This pilot work contributes novel findings and contextual approaches that do not rely on additional sensors, and thus outlines a promising direction of study for myoelectric control as a reliable and effective interaction technique.},

However, current research on detecting malicious Office documents has not covered all document formats and various types of malicious attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Static Multi-class Malicious Office document Detection Method (SM 2 0DM) for multiple versions of Office documents. The focus of this research is to design a unified static feature representation method for multiple versions of Office documents via multi-feature fusion, including VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code keywords, DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) instructions, embedded files, OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects, external links, and other relevant features. In addition, this research identifies eight new types of malicious features and embedding locations. Then, this paper proposes a multi-class detection method for malicious Office documents that can detect five common types of malicious documents. Through analyzing 20,000 samples provided by Topsec Technologies Group, the proposed SM 2 ODM achieves high accuracy in multi-classification detection and identifies 185 malicious Office samples that common antivirus software failed to detect.},

This study proposes a multimodal (image and text) model for surface damage detection in bridge structures by combining the CLIP model with the YOLOv8 model. By conducting tests on the composite concrete bridge of the Jiaozhou Bay Bridge, Qingdao, the effectiveness of bridge detection using drones is validated, and the common issue of false positive detections in traditional object detection models is successfully addressed.},

  abstract  = {Numerous studies suggest that learning related but different tasks prior to a new task makes it easier, possibly because of our brain&#39;s neural pattern alignment mechanism. Specifically, the neural patterns in the new task align with those in the learned task, enabling the reuse of knowledge from the previous task to aid learning in the new task. Brain-machine interface (BMI) is an excellent tool for analyzing the dynamics of neural population patterns during new task learning by directly recording neural signals from the brain. If we can repeat the process of aligning neural pattern using a point registration algorithm with the recorded neural signals, it would provide a computational tool to help us understand the brain mechanism during task learning. Additionally, the pre-trained decoder parameters from the old task can be reused to expedite learning in the new task. However, the existing Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method easily fails as it is sensitive to neural data distribution. This paper proposes a pair-wise Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence optimizing framework for stable neural pattern alignment. The KL divergence measures the difference between the data distribution of the previous task and the aligned new task. The alignment process is formulated as an optimization problem by minimizing the KL divergence. The proposed algorithm is tested in a simulated experiment where a rat learns a two-lever discrimination task from a one-lever pressing task. Three scenarios are designed to test the feasibility of our algorithm, including non-Gaussian neural pattern shapes, noisy neural data, and different alignment angles. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust than ICP, indicating its potential to discover the brain&#39;s alignment mechanism more accurately.},

From a safety and control perspective, it is imperative to measure finger joint angles during motion support provided by a soft robotic wearable system. However, embedding sensors into these devices can be inconvenient as it may lead to bulkiness or structural difficulties. This study aims to develop a machine learning model for estimating finger joint angles from images utilizing data created with computer graphics (CG), and to validate the feasibility of this method through basic experiments. The three-dimensional CG (3DCG) hand model includes bones corresponding to the major joints of the fingers, and a wearable system of the index finger imported from a computer-aided design software was attached to the 3DCG hand model. After rendering the integrated motion between the hand model and the wearable system for finger flexion and extension, images in conjunction with the finger joint angles were recorded as the training data. The finger joint angle estimator was based on a pre-trained vision transformer model and was learned using the created 3DCG training dataset. The basic experiments showed that the developed machine learning model enabled the estimation of finger joint angles with reproducibility for four types of hand postures with the wearable system. Furthermore, the differences between the joint angles measured in the real world and those estimated by the developed model were smaller than those for an existing hand pose estimation model. The developed machine learning model, which utilizes 3DCG, has the potential to estimate finger joint angles with the wearable system using image videos.},

This study presents a novel approach that combines adaptive machine learning and nonlinear regression to accurately predict the quality of highly customized end products using limited supply-chain data through digital transformation. The research was conducted in collaboration with a major power transformer manufacturer and its supply chain partners. The adaptive model was trained and validated using real datasets from key components provided by the supply chain, resulting in accurate predictions of end-product quality. The model incorporates the core loss parameter, obtained from the power transformer&#39;s key component, as an input dataset for training and testing. The proposed approach, called AdaBoost-Regression, combines adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and Regression machine learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the AdaBoost-Regression model outperforms simple AdaBoost and Regression models in predicting transformer quality. The model also exhibits superior performance in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) during real-data verification. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce overall production costs by accurately predicting the quality of complex, expensive, and highly customized industrial products.

These people are at risk of vasovagal syncope, a condition in which the patient faints during the injection. To help overcome this response to the perceived pain of injections, this paper proposes a diffuse noxious inhibitory control effect that can be applied through Augmented Reality (AR) smartphone applications. Furthermore, we confirm that presenting ARs that evoke noxious stimulation in participants can influence pain perception. We investigate the pain perception and negative affect when presented with noxious ARs and a distraction AR. The results show that pain thresholds are significantly increased in each AR condition when a painful stimulation is presented to participants. However, no difference in pain reduction between the noxious and distraction ARs is observed. One reason for this result may come from a manipulation problem: exposure to ARs does not make all participants feel pain. For the group of participants who felt pain when exposed to the ARs, the magnitude of pain tended to be smaller in a noxious AR (fire) condition than in the distraction condition. There was no significant increase in negative affect in the fire AR condition compared with the other conditions. These results may imply that the proposed method could reduce pain through diffuse noxious inhibitory control without producing any extra discomfort.},

These correlations were between presence and neural biomarkers in the frontal-central and central regions (for the beta and delta bands) and between VR sickness and brain biomarkers in the occipital region (for the alpha and beta bands) and the mean temperature. This work revealed significant correlations to support some biomarkers as predictors of the trend of presence and VR sickness in simulated teleoperated social tasks. These biomarkers might also be valid to predict the trend of telepresence and motion sickness in teleoperated social tasks in a remote environment.},

  abstract  = {As Computer Mediated Communications (CMCs) advance, businesses have sought alternatives to face-to-face (F2F) meetings to increase productivity for geographically dispersed teams while saving time and money. However, critical differences between CMCs and F2F impact multiple aspects of communication performance. In order to investigate these variations, the current research investigated the communication effectiveness in three distinct scenarios: video conferencing (VC), virtual reality (VR), and face-to-face (F2F). The study involved an electrical circuit repair task and the administration of multiple surveys to gather data from a total of 104 participants, focusing on four dependent variables: shared situational awareness, usability, mental workload, and performance confidence. For all the variables, results showed significantly better scores in VR and F2F conditions than in VC, but there was no significant difference between the VR and F2F conditions. These findings can inform technology developers in improving communication performance in computer mediated contexts, especially by using VR.},

However, it has not yet been widely implemented or rigorously evaluated for use in private residences, where it has potential for significant impact on quality of life for both PwD and their family caregivers. This paper describes results from the VRx@Home Pilot study, which is among the first to explore the potential benefits of immersive VR experiences delivered through a head-mounted display when compared to a standard two-dimensional display (handheld tablet). This was a prospective mixed methods study involving seven PwD-caregiver dyads (n=14) who took part in a four-week home-based intervention (two weeks VR, two weeks Tablet-Only). We evaluated the feasibility, usability, and impact of 360-degree videos on the quality of life of PwD and their caregivers. These outcomes were assessed through in-app metrics, questionnaires, observations, and interviews conducted at a) baseline, b) after each phase of the intervention, and c) at the end of the study. Results revealed that the VR and Tablet-Only conditions were comparable in terms of ease-of-use, session length, and frequency. Both conditions appeared to positively affect in-the-moment mood and quality of life of PwD and their caregivers. Improvements to VR-content, system navigation, and evaluation measures were identified as factors that will increase the likelihood of VR-therapy being adopted in the home setting by PwD and their caregivers.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound image segmentation is crucial for early disease detection and treatment planning but remains a challenging task due to the low contrast of organ boundaries and varying image quality. Current methods often require manual intervention or have limited accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines an automatic option polygon segment (AOPS) algorithm and a distributed- and memory-based evolution (DME) algorithm for precise ultrasound organ segmentation. Our pipeline consists of two cascaded stages: (1) a coarse segmentation step using the AOPS algorithm, which determines the number of vertices/clusters without human intervention, and (2) a refinement step using the DME algorithm to hunt for the optimal neural network, which is then used to represent a smooth, explainable mathematical expression of the organ boundary. We employ the fractional backpropagation learning network with L2 regularization (FBLN) for training and use the scaled exponential linear unit (SELU) activation function to address the vanishing gradient problem. This is a new attempt such a hybrid framework is applied to ultrasound organ segmentation tasks, and it demonstrates significant contributions in terms of accuracy, smoothness, and computational efficiency.},

In this paper, a novel generation framework based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model is presented and proposed for scenario generation of wind power. This method can overcome the limitations of traditional methods and learn the distribution of real data to generate reliable wind power scenarios.

This paper presents a self-supervised pipeline for adapting hand pose estimation to specific use cases with minimal human interaction. This enables cheap and robust hand pose-based activity recognition. The pipeline consists of a general machine learning model for hand pose estimation trained on a generalized dataset, spatial and temporal filtering to account for anatomical constraints of the hand, and a retraining step to improve the model. Different parameter combinations are evaluated on a publicly available and annotated dataset. The best parameter and model combination is then applied to unlabeled videos from a manual assembly scenario. The effectiveness of the pipeline is demonstrated by training an activity recognition as a downstream task in the manual assembly scenario.},

When acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) occurs, the frequency and severity of malignant attacks are highly correlated with the mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to use wearable devices to collect the physiological parameters of patients for early warning and prevention of complications of possible AECOPD attacks in the future. The subjects used wearable devices to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV) at home. Physiological data and health assessment scales of 13 COPD patients were collected during the 6-month study period. According to the scale responses, the severity of the condition was classified into mild AE and no AE. If the subject needed emergency medical treatment due to COPD, it was classified as AE. With the scale classification method, a machine-learning Random Forest (RF) algorithm is used to predict the occurrence of AECOPD in the next 7 days, so as to prevent the deterioration of the disease in advance. The results of the study show that the accuracy of the model is more than 92\% according to different classification methods, and using the mixed-parameter model as a feature for the prediction can improve the sensitivity of the original warning mechanism. In order to provide predictive results to the nursing staff at any time, the user interface of our system would transmit a warning message to remind the nursing staff to ensure early medical intervention for patients to avoid the occurrence of AECOPD.},

In this paper, we focus on the chest X-ray classification task and proposed an interpretable instrumental variable (IV) learning framework, to eliminate the spurious association and obtain accurate causal representation. Specifically, we first construct a structural causal model (SCM) for our task and learn the confounders and the preliminary representations of IV, we then leverage electronic health record (EHR) as auxiliary information and we fuse the above feature with our transformer-based semantic fusion module, so the IV has the medical semantic. Meanwhile, the reliability of IV is further guaranteed via the constraints of mutual information between related causal variables. Finally, our approach&#39;s performance is demonstrated using the MIMIC-CXR, NIH ChestX-ray 14, and CheXpert datasets, and we achieve competitive results.},

Clinicians evaluate clinical symptoms based on scale and experience, but mild tremors do not have significant characteristics and are difficult to observe with the naked eye. Implementing an intelligent and objective method to identify PD patients with early tremor symptoms and healthy controls (HC) is necessary. This study used wearable sensors to collect 9-axis inertial signals and 2-channel sEMG signals at the wrists of 13 HC and 24 PD patients from Dalian Municipal Central Hospital. Based on a Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), an attention mechanism, and a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), we develop a model to classify and recognize data from PD patients. Compared the proposed method with several classification methods, the results showed that the proposed method achieved higher classification accuracy (91.78\%), precision (100\%), recall (87.50\%), and F1-score (93.33\%) of PD class than Support Vector Machine, FCN, and LSTM. The computing time of the proposed method is approximately 1 second. The proposed method identifies early PD patients by pre-clinical assessment of mild upper limb tremors, which is valuable for early treatment and rehabilitation.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous transportation systems such as road vehicles or vessels require the consideration of the static and dynamic environment to dislocate without collision. Anticipating the behavior of an agent in a given situation is required to adequately react to it in time. Developing deep learning-based models has become the dominant approach to motion prediction recently. The social environment is often considered through a CNN-LSTM-based sub-module processing a social tensor that includes information of the past trajectory of surrounding agents. For the proposed transformer-based trajectory prediction model, an alternative, computationally more efficient social tensor definition and processing is suggested. It considers the interdependencies between target and surrounding agents at each time step directly instead of relying on information of last hidden LSTM states of individually processed agents. A transformer-based sub-module, the Social Tensor Transformer, is integrated into the overall prediction model. It is responsible for enriching the target agent&#39;s dislocation features with social interaction information obtained from the social tensor. For the awareness of spatial limitations, dislocation features are defined in relation to the navigable area. This replaces additional, computationally expensive map processing sub-modules. An ablation study shows, that for longer prediction horizons, the deviation of the predicted trajectory from the ground truth is lower compared to a spatially and socially agnostic model. Even if the performance gain from a spatial-only to a spatial and social context-sensitive model is small in terms of common error measures, by visualizing the results it can be shown that the proposed model in fact is able to predict reactions to surrounding agents and explicitely allows an interpretable behavior.},

Previous studies have shown that the human emotion mediates the cross-modal correspondences. Therefore, this study focuses on the complexity and order of shapes, which is said to influence human emotion, and aims to examine the cross-modal correspondences induced by its sensation. First, indices of complexity and order are selected. Next, shapes are selected based on each index. Finally, an experiment was conducted to investigate the correspondence between shapes and sound pitches. As a result, the correspondence between the complexity of shapes and higher pitches were found. On the other hand, the correspondence between the order of shape and lower pitches were not found.},

The emergence of advanced algorithms, particularly the Diffusion Model, has made it possible to synthesize attractive images using AI. However, the existing diffusion models are mostly used to generate entire images and lack control over specific objects for object display. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we pioneers to extend the application of the diffusion model to synthesize novel images for specific objects. By encoding the input images of objects into NeRF representation and synthesizing the desired backgrounds using diffusion models with the input of rendered object images and text prompts, our method can generate 3D aware object display images at arbitrary angles and arbitrary backgrounds. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is capable of generating high-quality and photo-realistic images, which are &gt; 6 times faster than the conventional photomontage approach. Moreover, our generated images have higher compositional scores, image quality scores, and aesthetics scores in our user experiments. By significantly reducing the need for human effort and producing higher quality generated images, our approach opens up exciting possibilities for creating versatile novel images of specific objects.},

  abstract  = {Inspired by the Transformer&#39;s adaptive capability in natural language processing and computer vision domains, and supported by CLIP&#39;s strong semantic prior knowledge, we propose a novel generative model named STMotionFormer based on improved Transformer block and CLIP for language-guided 3D skeleton-based human motion synthesis. The skeleton sequence, as a kind of spatial temporal dynamic data, not only contains temporal information but also consists of a natural graph structure by different body parts. We focus on this, propose Temporal Transformer block (T-Former) applies attention mechanism along the temporal dimension to capture the long-term relationship, and propose spatial Transformer block (S-Former) applies attention mechanism in the spatial dimension to aggregate and update joints&#39; spatial features. Therefore, our approach can automatically explore both spatial and temporal information, which can generate skeleton sequence with reasonable graph structure as well as global time relationship. Moreover, powerful semantic prior knowledge of CLIP are injected into our motion-language joint manifold. We evaluate our method on the public KIT motion language dataset that contains manually annotated 3D pose sequences. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of APE and AVE respectively. Qualitative visualization results indicate that our model can generate human motions that are more compatible with semantic information even than the GroundTruth.},

This digital legacy must be handled and legally abide by the owners&#39; wishes, which may vary from inheritance to deletion. By carrying out a literature review on the subject, the authors noticed there is a lack of user studies on these issues. We, therefore, conducted a focus group with technology users of different profiles to understand the volunteers&#39; acceptability of this topic. During the group discussions, an unexpected factor was raised: to what extent might a user&#39;s fame influence their digital immortalization? This study aims to discuss digital immortality in terms of its acceptability among users and to contribute to the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with important insights on death in the digital world. In our findings regarding acceptability, users can feel some comfort in interacting with their deceased loved ones. Regarding fame, while influential individuals may not need digital immortality, there are concerns regarding the utilitarian nature of their legacies.},

One of the latest and perceptually accurate video quality metrics is the Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF) method. However, VMAF considers the temporal nature of video using basic average temporal pooling, an approach that falls short from human perception. In this paper, we introduce a new no-reference video quality metric that uses deep learning to extract spatial features and a unique temporal pooling approach to accurately predict the visual quality score. To this end, first we created a video quality dataset that consists of high-resolution, 20s-long test video clips compressed at several different bitrates. These videos were labeled based on subjective evaluations and were used to determine the perceptual importance of frames in our temporal pooling scheme. Evaluations showed that our proposed approach achieved correlation of 90.55\% with human perception and outperformed the state-of-the-art VMAF approach by 15.63\% accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising method for users to interact with machines using brain signals, primarily electroencephalography (EEG). Motor imagery (MI)-BCI, which decodes EEG signals induced by the user&#39;s imagination of moving body parts, has gained great attention due to its applicability in various fields such as robotics and rehabilitation. MI - EEG signals exhibit class-discriminative patterns such as event-related de/synchronization across spectral-spatio-temporal (SST) domains. Numerous studies adopted deep learning framework, especially convolutional neural network (CNN), for learning SST feature representations automatically in a data-driven manner. In particular, most of the CNN-based methods adopted temporal convolution to learn the spectral information, as it can act as a band-pass filter. In this paper, we propose SAT-Net, a SincNet-based attentive temporal convolutional network for motor imagery classification. The proposed method utilizes Sinc convolution from SincNet for explicit extraction of spectral information from the input EEG signals with high interpretability. Moreover, we adopt an attentive temporal convolutional network to effectively learn SST feature representations while making full use of temporal information. We evaluate our proposed SAT-Net on the public BCI Competition IV-2a dataset, comparing it not only to conventional CNN-based approaches but also to the state-of-the-art method. The experimental results, supported by statistical analysis, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the competing methods.},

  abstract  = {The Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) is a robust paradigm used to build a high-speed Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). This technology can benefit disabled subjects, allowing them to interact with their surroundings without using their peripheral nerves. However, one challenge to address is reducing the time calibration of BCI for a new subject (target subject) because of the high brain EEG variability among subjects and within subjects in different sessions. This constraint restricts the application of SSVEP-based BCI in natural environments; thus, some approaches to endeavor this constraint propose a linear transformation of existing subjects over some trials of the target subject. In this paper, we propose an approach to a nonlinear transformation (NLT) using an Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder (ELM-AE) of SSVEP trials to improve a cross-subject classification reducing the calibration time for the target subject. Our results reported that the recognition accuracy improved by 6.58\% for all subjects using NLT. Also, these results exhibit the feasibility of NLT that using a few templates from the target subject can enhance the recognition accuracy over cross-subject classification without NLT.},

Endogenous BCI is the imagined-based BCI and it has the advantage that the fatigue level of the body, especially the eyes, is relatively low and no additional equipment for offering stimulation is required. When conducting imagined speech, one of the endogenous BCI paradigms, the users imagine the pronunciation as if actually speaking. In contrast, overt speech is that the users directly pronounce the words. We proposed the transfer learning-based method from overt speech- to imagined speech-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals (TOINet). The proposed method utilizes an encoder to extract the feature vector of imagined speech from EEG signals, which is subsequently reconstructed into overt speech signals using the decoder. Through this process, the model can identify the significant and common features present in EEG signals for both overt and imagined speech, facilitating the classification of EEG signals associated with imagined speech. Eight subjects participated in the experiment. The average accuracy of the TOINet was 0.4841 for classifying four words and the EEG features of overt speech improved the performance by 0.0742. Hence, we demonstrated that EEG features of overt speech could improve the decoding performance of imagined speech.},

We propose a fine-tuning approach for neural networks that serves a dual purpose; first, to minimize calibration times through requiring considerably less data - up to one-sixth - from the target subject than training from scratch, and second, to alleviate cases of user illiteracy by providing a substantial performance boost of over 11\% in absolute accuracy from the features learned from other subjects. Ultimately, our adaptation method surpasses standard within-subject performance by a large margin in all subjects. We present ablation studies across three datasets, in which we demonstrate that fine-tuning outperforms other adaptation methods for BCI systems and that what matters most is the quantity of pre-training subjects, rather than their BCI-ability, achieving over 8\% absolute increase in classification accuracy when scaling up the order of magnitude. Finally, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art in EEG-based motor imagery and find it comparable, if not superior, to methods employing far more complex neural networks, obtaining 82.60\% and 85.64\% within-subject accuracy in the four-class BCIC IV-2a and binary MMI datasets respectively.},

Recent studies have proposed analytical frameworks for the assessment of scalp EEG quality and identification of artifacts using rule based methods. These methods are typically used in an offline processing manner, employed before signal analysis when abundant data is available. With the advent of wearable devices, it is important to build techniques that work on short term signals giving us the ability of intervention based on the signal quality. Further, ear-EEG is a new modality that requires assessment and calibration with short term signals. To support this new modality we conducted a detailed study of scalp and ear-EEG data from the perspective of different measures as well as time duration. An algorithm is developed to identify the epochs with EOG and EMG artifacts in the ear-EEG using a set of metrics based on the characteristics of EEG. Thresholds of these metrics are determined by training on a dataset containing synchronous ear and scalp EEG with good results. The algorithm obtained an accuracy of 76.7\% and 76.84\% in classifying artifact EEG for scalp referenced ear-EEG and re-referenced ear-EEG, respectively.},

We hypothesize that: 1) motorsports fans or racing game players (GP) have a correct mental model of automated counter-steering, while 2) ordinary drivers (Non-GP) do not, and 3) Non-GP incorrectly estimate rotation direction as being always consistent between the steering wheel and vehicle. We first propose a method to examine the accuracy of a driver&#39;s steering mental model. The method measures the participants&#39; ability to estimate steering wheel rotation from a video only showing vehicle rotation and vice versa. We compared the performance of GP and Non-GP using videos with and without counter-steering. The results only support hypothesis 2. This indicates that automated counter-steering likely confuses most drivers no matter their prior knowledge, which makes the improvement of driver-vehicle communication critical.},

In addition to enhancing independent mobility, it is important to ensure safety for wheelchair users and those around them. To date, previous studies have mostly focused on (semi-)autonomous navigation or obstacle avoidance. By contrast, in this study, we tackle the challenging, but important problem of safely docking to tables. We propose a robotic navigation assistance, applied to electric powered wheelchairs using Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors to facilitate table-docking for users. To meet this objective, we designed a low-cost sensor system that was integrated into our smart wheelchair prototype, which can detect a table and accurately estimate its height. We then developed a robust algorithm to deliver the manoeuvring assistance. First, we simulated the smart wheelchair system within Unity3D to find the best positions for the ToF sensors and evaluate the accuracy of the docking system, employing different table styles. Then, we experimentally validate the system on our physical wheelchair, using varying angles of approach, which demonstrate its feasibility.},

While state-of-the-art work in shared control has demonstrated its capability in improving safety, human-machine interaction and reduce confusion, it is still challenging to use shared control in dynamic, crowded scenarios, in a way that is acceptable to users. Learning from recent advances in robot navigation, we present a reinforcement learning based framework, which allows navigation to be achieved in a user-specific shared controlled way. Our approach was trained and tested in a Unity3D based simulator. It achieved 33\% fewer collisions, similar high user agreement (≤ 85\%) and 27\% less completion time when compared with our previous model-based method.},

An experience measure that rates how well a work or interaction state is perceived by a user is psychological flow. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to assess flow in human-machine interaction by game-theoretically modeling the interaction. To validate our approach, we perform a user study with 30 participant with a study design that allows for the manipulation of the user&#39;s experience through three experience modes. The results both validate our study design and provide indications that our approach to assess flow is promising to be developed further.},

From the results of comparison with Genetic Algorithm (GA), it is confirmed that SSE has a fast convergence speed. In addition, it is found that the higher the mutation rate of SSE, the more converged to the global optimal solution without falling into the local solution.},

QOL is a comprehensive indicator that includes physical, mental, and social aspects, and gerontechnology aims to improve the autonomy and QOL of older adults. In recent years, utilizing robots to address the shortage of caregivers has been increasingly studied. We developed a counseling robot that estimates the QOL of older adults in real time, and generates appropriate and empathetic responses according to the estimated QOL. The results obtained from a one-week interaction experiment with a counseling robot targeted toward older adults indicated a significant improvement in the mental aspect of QOL, and the use of cognitive behavioral therapy and empathetic responses was inferred to facilitate self-disclosure and enhance the effectiveness of counseling. Additionally, advice based on the QOL estimation results contributed to organizing the thoughts of older adults and further improved their mental health. This study not only contributes to improving the QOL of older adults but also suggests that robots that understand and appropriately respond to individuals can facilitate continuous relationship building. This study may also serve as a guide for promoting the introduction of information and communication technology into welfare facilities.},

This paper reports on a gait measurement system using carbon insoles with attached piezoelectric film sensors and FSRs, and the estimation of three components of GRF using the system. Outputs of piezoelectric film sensors reflect the force that deforms the carbon insole in the mediolateral and anteroposterior directions.

Therefore, in this study, we estimated the wearer&#39;s state using a device called THINKLET, which can acquire image information and inertial information at the same time. By acquiring the pose of the hand from the image information, we were able to estimate the work. More detailed information can be obtained by calculating the position at the same time. By integrating image information with inertial information, it becomes possible to measure the position and posture of the wearer in the working environment.

The purpose of the present study is to propose an innovative approach to fall prevention naturally embedded in the environment. We first suggest new methods for simplifying and understanding the relationship between falls and everyday life, and describe this relationship as a knowledge graph using emergency transport data on falls among the aged. As a result of a cluster analysis using knowledge graphs, we identified whole-body balance as a key factor and living environmental determinant of falls. We then propose the concept of a homeostatic spatial system and discuss our development of seven homeostatic products as a proof of concept. Finally, we develop an evaluation system to visualize specific locations in a defined area where people maintain whole-body balance using their hands or other body parts. Our findings confirm that the system is useful for evaluating how people change their behaviors to maintain whole-body balance based on homeostatic products and the living environment as a whole.},

The Brazilian judiciary wants to make the technology available to magistrates with little or no knowledge of the field of PM. Problem: The usability and comprehensibility of the available tools prevent their adoption by laypeople. In fact, these are two of the eleven challenges proposed by the IEEE Task Force on PM that are still little explored in the context of non-specialists. Methodology: Applied qualitative research, using User Centered Design (UCD) principles to guide the construction of the JuMP tool, conceived considering anthropological and sociological aspects of the Brazilian judiciary. For a year and six months, a team of PM specialists worked with representatives of the judiciary sector to produce, evaluate and evolve the new product. An experiment was performed to evaluate the usability and understandability of JuMP. Results: The study demonstrated that the use of a PM tool oriented to the application domain is fundamental for domain experts with little or no knowledge in PM to be able to make good use of it. Contribution: Demonstration that, unlike the prevailing practice in the area of PM, which prioritizes the provision of general purpose tools, the design of tools oriented to the application domain are prerequisites to improve usability and comprehensibility attributes. Finally, the work proposes a generic and adaptable methodology for developing specific-purpose PM tools and the experience of its implications to the design of the JuMP tool.},

In addition, with the rapid development of mega-cities, more obstacles such as steps and Braille blocks have been introduced, making outdoor mobility even more challenging for wheelchair users. Although electric wheelchairs have been developed for use in various environments, they are costly and not accessible for all users. To address this issue, the authors focused on developing an affordable wheel that can be used in various driving environments, including flat ground, steps, and rough terrain. They designed a wheel that utilizes a slider-crank mechanism, which can be adjusted by the wheelchair user using a central disc. In this paper, the design of the wheel is presented, and its performance was evaluated through experiments involving step climbing and rough terrain simulations. The results showed a reduction in the force required to overcome steps, improved stability when navigating steps, and enhanced driving performance on rough terrain after deploying the new wheel.},

Agents in the group hide their honest opinions because of the group pressure, and each agent has a private and expressed opinion. The liberating effect is divided into two stages. In the first stage, one agent in the group is the first to liberate when the number of times it feels pressure exceeds a specific limit and the cumulative pressure is the maximum. The liberating agent will express its opinion authentically, with private opinion consistent with the expressed opinion. In the second stage, the other agents in the group are influenced by the liberating neighbors and also liberate until the group evolution reaches a stable state. Through simulations, we study the effects of confidence level and pressure threshold on group opinion evolution. The experimental results show that both confidence level and pressure threshold are critical. All agents liberate when they are smaller than the critical value; when they are greater than the critical value, the liberating effect disappears. We also find that the liberating effect can accelerate the group opinion evolution.},

A robotic elbow exoskeleton can provide ongoing therapeutic treatment to retrain arm movement functionality to perform activities of daily living. Providing an accessible, lightweight robotic exoskeleton is an ongoing challenge for wearable devices. Our proposed elbow exoskeleton introduces a cable-driven design using a bidirectional, dual pulley system mated with a high torque motor and a custom 17.5:1 planetary gearbox manufactured using high strength engineering stereolithography resin material. The cable-driven dual pulley system transfers the rotary motion to actuate an arm brace for elbow joint flexion and extension. Benchtop experiments demonstrated a maximum output torque of 26 Nm while lifting a 1 kg object. Results exceeded the minimum joint torque and velocity requirement to carry out day-to-day lifting activities. The designed actuation system provided a transmission mass reduction of 39\% compared to conventional actuators, lowered overall cost by applying rapid fabrication techniques, and provided formability for a compact elbow exoskeleton design. In all, the system weighs less than 8.5 kg that can translate the unit to an in-home rehabilitation device.},

However, going to a hospital and being diagnosed by a doctor is burdensome for elderly people. This paper designs a Vision Transformer(ViT)-based gait diagnosis with micro-Doppler radar to diagnose dementia without burden for elderly people. The ViT is optimized by proposed Vertical Rectangle Patching and Adaptive Thresholding, which improve the Attention of Vi&#39;I. The micro-Doppler radar collects the signal of elderly people, and the signal is transformed into two kinds of signal-analyzed images by two signal-analysis methods (Short-term Fourier Transform: STFT, and Continuous Wavelet Transform: CWT) for diagnosing by optimized ViI. Experiments compare eight kinds of CNN models, and current ViTs with the optimized ViT to evaluate the proposal&#39;s performance. The experimental results show that STFT is suitable for analyzing micro-Doppler radar signals, and ViT-56x4s+th, which uses Vertical Rectangle Patching and Adaptive Thresholding, achieves high scores such as an accuracy of 88.9\%. Another proposed model ViT-224xl allows for faster learning convergence for time series data and improved accuracy without fine-tuning. In summary, the possibility of diagnosing dementia by optimized ViT has been provided. The experimentation of Adaptive thresholding also proves there are some unimportant patches and brings an idea for reducing the unimportant computations to achieve a compact ViT as future work.},

  abstract  = {The new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology will play an important role in promoting the digitalization, informatization and intelligence of the future power grid due to its high-dimensional state intelligent perception and rapid decision-making capabilities. However, its inherent shortcomings such as poor interpretability and fragility also limit the further application of AI technology in power systems. This paper first introduces hybrid-augmented intelligence (HAI) technology and its application development in the fields of autonomous driving and industrial robots. Combining the characteristics of the power system and AI technology, the requirements of the power system for HAI are analyzed and summarized. Secondly, the key technologies involved in human-machine collaborative HAI are analyzed in terms of data processing, model training and model application. On this basis, the application of HAI technology in typical scenarios such as power flow section regulation is designed and analyzed, which provides reference for subsequent engineering applications. Finally, the challenges faced by the application of HAI in power systems are analyzed and prospected, aiming to promote and enrich the development of basic theories and key technologies of hybrid intelligence in power systems.},

  abstract  = {The rapid advancement of intelligence and connectivity technology (ICT) has enhanced the efficiency and safety of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, this also increases the complexity of the transportation systems, especially the social complexity, and poses new challenges for their management. This paper discusses the emergence of social transportation, as part of natural evolutionary adaptation to new traffic conditions and technology, which is a paradigm shift from engineering-centered technical systems to society-centered ecosystems. In social transportation systems, all participants including administrators, individual travelers and other stakeholders play a more proactive role in the operation and management of transportation systems. Therefore, we propose to employ a decen-tralized autonomous organization (DAO) as a model for the social transportation system that allows participants to collaborate and coordinate without relying on a central authority. To meet the challenges brought by this transition, we propose to apply ACP-based parallel system theory to restructure the methodology of transportation management. Finally, we present a case study of personal carbon trading system where economic incentives are used to manage traffic demand, affecting others&#39; travel behaviors, and reduce carbon emissions. In the conclusive remarks, we provide our visions and future directions of social transportation systems.},

  abstract  = {Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) have been gaining popularity in recent years due to their promise of realizing the decentralized Web 3.0. However, most DAOs rely heavily on token-centric value systems as well as allocate decision-making authority and yield-sharing rights according to the held tokens, which often lead to monopolization of power and rights. To address this issue, this paper contributes to propose a truly democratic organization model, named True Autonomous Organizations and Operations (TAOs), that does not count upon tokens and is guided by principles of contribution-based and on-demand allocation. We first discuss the design of TAOs, including their infrastructures, power structures, and value systems, and then provide a technical roadmap for implementing TAOs in the DeSci context. This research can provide a valuable guidance for the construction and application of TAOs.},

Although there have been many studies on free viewpoint video generation for large-scale spaces, they have focused on generating video for the entire wide-area space. For this reason, challenges still remain in terms of reproduction of object details and real-time video performance of image generation. In this study, for the purpose of developing a system which enables immersion into a moving miniature world, a method to generate high-definition free viewpoint video for small-scale spaces in real time was realized and evaluated. It can generate high-definition free viewpoint images by combining free viewpoint depth images applying noise reduction processing and the corresponding color images considering occlusion and the normal direction of the object&#39;s surface. The free viewpoint images generated by the proposed system was evaluated. The results confirmed that consideration of occlusion and the normal direction of the object&#39;s surface improved the quality of the generated images. In addition, the realized methods were able to generate clear free viewpoint images even when the free viewpoint approached the object.},

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) that codify clinical Best Practice Guidelines (BPGs) and provide situation-specific advice to physicians CDSSs have shown effectiveness in reducing adverse patient outcomes during clinical evaluations. However, representing both the BPG and the associated physical processes in software is complex and tedious, making CDSSs prone to bugs. This can be mitigated using a modular software architecture that encapsulates computational representation of physical processes for finer-grained development and verification leading to improved comprehensibility, shareability and maintainability. This paper discusses the sources of complexity in CDSSs, and proposes a software architecture that consists of an encoding of the BPG&#39;s medical knowledge into executable representations comprising of a patient digital twin, diagnosis and treatment workflows, an adherence monitor, a User Interface (UI) and a middleware for seamless integration with existing Hospital Information Systems. We developed a CDSS for Pediatric Sepsis Management co-designed by physicians using our approach. We use the Fluid Resuscitation therapy of this CDSS as a case study to illustrate the development process.},

In this study, two calibration methods, the intersection method and the P4P method, which use the directions of radio waves from radio sources mounted on each camera to measure the positions of the hidden background cameras, are proposed. The intersection method measures the direction from several different points to the hidden background cameras and estimate the 3D position of the hidden background camera as the intersection of the measured directions. The P4P method measures the relative pose between multiple hidden background cameras in advance and uses it as a constraint to estimate the 3D poses of the hidden background cameras. The results showed that the P4P method was more accurate than the intersection method, and able to calibrate the camera with a position error of less than 100 mm.},

Specifically, we first design the temporal encoding with a multi-headed attention mechanism, which captures the global and local temporal context relations of motion to retain more dynamic motion features for improving mesh recovery accuracy. We also propose a probabilistic generative model consisting of a conditional variational autoencoder, which learns the distribution of pose changes in each frame, and solves temporal inconsistency of the body movement. Compared with existing approaches, SLMR can take full advantage of inter-frame motion contexts. Experiments validated the effectiveness and smoothness of the proposed approach for human mesh recovery in the wild.},

Additionally, emerging approaches such as Deep Learning come short to give insights into decoding taste because their need of big amounts of data.

However, KMI is a complex task to perform, mainly due to the absence of sensory and kinesthetic feedback. To address this issue, sensory neurofeedback solutions have been proposed. One of them is tactile vibration, which has been used in BCI paradigms, but the optimal design choices of the vibration remain unclear. In this study, we present a novel bimodal stimulus that combines a vibrotactile device for the upper limb with a visual animation of a hand grasping a bottle. We aimed to investigate the effects of four different vibration patterns and four stimulation intensities to study the effects of the stimuli on the electroencephalography (EEG) signals of 17 healthy subjects without performing KMI. Our findings revealed EEG activity in the alpha, beta, and delta frequency bands within the somatosensory cortex during the sensory stimulation. While we did not observe significant differences in brain activity among the vibration patterns, we did observe statistically significant variations based on the vibration intensity. We observed central activity in both brain hemispheres, with stronger activity occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. Additionally, EEG activity seemed to involve the contralateral occipital areas. Based on these results, it is worth considering the delivery of feedback after participants have completed KMI tasks to differentiate and comprehensively study the brain activity resulting from the mental and sensory stimulation tasks.},

  abstract  = {Individuals suffering from a progressive neurodegenerative disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), will lose muscle function over time and become completely paralysed. For some time, people with ALS may retain functional tongue movement, despite losing mobility below the neck. These individuals can benefit from using an inductive tongue control interface (ITCI) to control computers or assistive robotic devices to gain independence in their daily lives. Eventually, when the individual can no longer use their tongue, they can rely on a brain computer interface (BCI). However, these require a lot of data to calibrate and function properly. Recording this data while the individual can still use the ITCI can potentially speed up the training process, allowing for an easier transition between interface technologies. This study investigates whether it is possible to create a background data collector for a BCI based on attempted tongue movement by analyzing brain patterns of two individuals with ALS while using an ITCI. The participants used an inductive ITCI in simple cued movement trials while electroencephalogram (EEG) was collected from the motor cortex. The EEG signal indicated that movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) were generated after the cued movements. After synchronising the signal to the activations recorded on the ITCI, the MRCP became even more apparent. Therefore, it is concluded that it is possible to record MRCPs from individuals with ALS performing tongue movements, that the ITCI can assist in better extracting synchronized MRCP epochs, and that a background data collector for a tongue movement intention-based BCI is very feasible.},

  abstract  = {Precise image segmentation is one of the dominant factors in disease diagnosis. A typical application is the segmentation of breast ultrasound images, allowing radiologists to suggest what to do next. After emerging deep learning technology especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the image segmentation model achieved state-of-the-art performance in various medical applications such as cancer detection and classification, lung node segmentation, cell segmentation and so on. However, despite these successes, a big question arises: to what extent is the model certain about the predicted result? Generally, most deep learning models focus on high accuracy but not on uncertainty of predicted results, which is not enough to make a critical real-life decision such as a disease diagnosis, where a wrong decision can be life-threatening. Hence for making a crucial decision, it is essential that the predicted result will provide not only accuracy but also estimate model uncertainty. Our contribution to this research is to build a system that predicts pixel-wise semantic segmentation and provides uncertainty estimation of the predicted results. It is achieved by adding a dropout layer during training and using Monte Carlo dropout in inference. We evaluate our model with the breast ultrasound image dataset (BUSI) and compare the results with a few other state-of-the-art methods where our method outperforms others in terms of IoU.},

We propose a leader follower approach for two mobile manipulators collaboratively transporting an object along specified desired trajectories. The proposed approach treats the mobile manipulation system as two independent subsystems: a mobile platform and a manipulator arm and uses their kinematics model for trajectory tracking. In this work we considered that the mobile platform is subject to non-holonomic constraints, with a manipulator carrying a rigid load. The desired trajectories of the end points of the load are obtained from Probabilistic RoadMap-based planning approach. Our method combines Proportional Navigation Guidance-based approach with a proposed Stop-and-Sync algorithm to reach sufficiently close to the desired trajectory; the deviation due to the non-holonomic constraints being compensated by the manipulator arm. Concurrently, a leader follower approach for computing inverse kinematics solution for the position of the end-effector of the manipulator arm is proposed to maintain the load rigidity. Further, we compare the proposed approach with other approaches to analyse the efficacy of our algorithm.},

Existing methods have focused on the interaction between aspects, text, and images, achieving significant progress through cross-modal transformers. However, they still suffer from three problems: (1) Ignoring the dependency relationships between objects within the image modality; (2) Failing to consider the role of syntactic dependency relationships within the text modality in capturing aspect-related opinion words; (3) Neglecting the inherent dependency relationships between modalities. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained cross-modal graph convolutional network model (FCGCN). Specifically, we construct intra-modality dependency relationships using syntactic and spatial relationships and fuse the two modalities through semantic similarity calculation. We then design a GCN-Attention layer to capture richer multimodal fusion information. Additionally, an aspect-oriented transformer module is introduced to capture aspect features interactively. Experimental results on the Twitter datasets show that our FCGCN model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

First, an efficient kinesthetic teaching method is devised based on the weighted least-norm (WLN) inverse kinematics solution and an admittance controller, which facilitates human users to guide the mobile manipulator to perform tasks. Second, we propose a whole-body LfD framework through Gaussian Process, which endows the mobile manipulator&#39;s skill learning process with features of large-scale convergence, coordination working and disturbance rejection, after just a few human demonstrations. The proposed learning framework also allows for human-in-the-loop correction when the whole-body is conducting a task. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified via two simulations and a pick-and-place experiment.

  abstract  = {Accurate COVID-19 lesion segmentation is vital for diagnosing lung infections. Experiment results suggest that a great teacher may not produce a brilliant student due to the huge gap in contextual semantics. Also studying from a single knowledge domain does not improve the student&#39;s learning ability. To help student understand knowledge in a rational manner and solve the aforementioned issues we creatively design a multi-teacher distillation framework based on the CNN-Transformer. Our proposed framework has three main benefits 1) We design GMDiff (Generate Medical Diffusion Model) to solve the scarcity problem of high-quality COVID-19 medical images to adapt few-shot learning. 2) The DWD (Dynamic Weight Distribution) can adaptively adjusts the weight of a weak teacher to reduce incorrect guidance on student learning. When the weak teacher has enough confidence in their decisions the students can achieve satisfactory results. 3)To bridge the semantic gap between the student and multi-teacher and facilitate interaction we propose the MSL (Multi-Scale Loss) AGL (Attention Gradient Loss) and EPL (Edge Pixel Loss) strategies to supervise student learning. Before utilizing the above strategies we adopt IPM (Information Processing Module) to standardize the feature representation shared by student and teachers. Finally we fine-tune on local details. Extensive experiments show that our proposed distillation framework achieves a state-of-the-art segmentation result on the multi-modality dataset. It may be regarded as a novel baseline for future researches.},

There are multiple possible trajectories based on the same historical locations. Our key insight is that humans are intention-driven, the future trajectories can be effectively captured by a set of intention proposals. This leads to our Hybrid Intention-proposal trajectory prediction (HyIntent) framework. HyIntent is a hybrid network architecture that acts solely on historically observed locations. We use LSTM as our recurrent backbone to memorize the sequential feature and a transformer decoder to capture the long-term dependency with intention. Given some orthogonal learned intention proposals, HyIntent reasons about the relations of intention proposals and the historical observations to tailor generate the multiple predictions in parallel. HyIntent demonstrates improved performance on public datasets (i.e. ETH/UCY, SDD) and outperforms state-of-the-art while minimizing the complexity.},

  abstract  = {Online streaming feature selection (OSFS) is an effective approach to addressing high-dimensional data. In real big data-related applications, streaming features commonly have massive missing data due to various uncertain factors. The missing data may cause some uncertain relationships between sparse features and labels. However, existing OSFS methods tend to select sparse streaming features based on certain relevance and redundancy analysis, which may erroneously discard some weak relevant but irredundant features. As a result, some essential information is discarded. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Decision- Risk-incorporated OSFS (DRO) algorithm. Its main idea is two-fold: 1) the missing data of sparse streaming features are pre-estimated by using the Latent Factor Analysis (LFA), and 2) the decision risk of relevance and redundancy analysis is minimized on the estimated complete streaming features via the three-way decision (3WD). Extensive empirical studies are conducted on eight real-world datasets. The results show that DRO significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors.},

However, deep models for skin lesion classification still face the challenges of intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, as well as data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a balanced supervised contrastive learning (BSCL) approach for the skin lesion classification task. Our model consists of two branches for supervised contrastive learning and classification, respectively. The introduced supervised contrastive learning branch helps the network to learn more discriminative representations. Moreover, we design both a category -averaging strategy which averages the instances of every class in a mini-batch, and a category-complement strategy which makes all categories to appear in each mini-batch, to balance the influence from different skin lesion categories. Besides, we introduce a multi-weighted classification loss to learn a balanced classifier. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is able to learn strong feature representations and achieve state-of-the-art skin lesion classification performance.},

  abstract  = {A supervised feature selection method selects an appropriate but concise set of features to differentiate classes, which is highly expensive for large-scale datasets. Therefore, feature selection should aim at both minimizing the number of selected features and maximizing the accuracy of classification, or any other task. However, this crucial task is computationally highly demanding on many real-world datasets and requires a very efficient algorithm to reach a set of optimal features with a limited number of fitness evaluations. For this purpose, we have proposed the binary multi-objective coordinate search (MOCS) algorithm to solve large-scale feature selection problems. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm in this paper is the first multi-objective coordinate search algorithm. In this method, we generate new individuals by flipping a variable of the candidate solutions on the Pareto front. This enables us to investigate the effectiveness of each feature in the corresponding subset. In fact, this strategy can play the role of crossover and mutation operators to generate distinct subsets of features. The reported results indicate the significant superiority of our method over NSGA-II, on five real-world large-scale datasets, particularly when the computing budget is limited. Moreover, this simple hyper-parameter-free algorithm can solve feature selection much faster and more efficiently than NSGA-II.},

  abstract  = {Generally speaking, labeled data is difficult and expensive to provide for applications in machine learning and data mining. One of the earliest approaches to tackle this problem is semi-supervised self-training to take advantages of labeled and unlabeled data to create pseudo-labeled data. However, reaching a high level of confidence to predict the unseen data by a classifier with a limited number of labeled samples is a challenging task. Generating pseudo-labeled data can collaboratively improve the self-training to increase its confidence for further predictions. This paper proposes a collaborative framework between augmentation and self-training to accurately train a model with very limited labeled data. Our framework includes two components where the first component is an unsupervised technique to augment labeled data and feed to the second component which is self-training. The first component uses a custom variational autoencoder architecture (VAE) to generate new samples by adding randomly generated noise to encoded latent representation. As a result, the augmentation component can generate the unique and unexplored images with respect to limited input data distribution. We evaluated the proposed framework on handwritten MNIST image dataset. The conducted experiment shows that the generative component can be helpful in overcoming the problem of inaccurate self-training prediction when sufficient labeled data is not accessible.},

However, previous research works showed the performance of classic NSGA-II is degraded when solving problems with many objectives (M ≥ 5). In this work, we aim to take advantage of center-based sampling scheme to increase the exploration and exploitation capability of NSGA-II algorithm. This sampling strategy has demonstrated promising results on several single-objective evolutionary algorithms such as GA, DE, and PSO. Recently, a novel clustering center-based strategy has been proposed, which motivated us to utilize center-based sampling scheme in NSGA-II to solve multi-objective optimization problems. The outcomes confirm that the proposed clustering center-based NSGA-II is able to effectively solve CEC-2017 multi-objective benchmark problems with 2, 3, 5, 10, and 15 objectives.},

However, the effect of the different signal sources on the functional corticomuscular coupling remains unclear. In this study, four different signal source combinations were constructed by EEG and high-density surface EMG (HD-sEMG) signals as well as their reconstructed source signals to analyze the corticomuscular coupling during isometric index finger contraction tasks at different levels of maximum voluntary contraction. A nonparametric coupling model was used to study the effect of deep source signals on changing the coherence magnitude indicators of corticomuscular coupling related to hand movements. The results showed that the reconstruction of EEG and HD-sEMG signals significantly improved the coherence peak and coherence strength under low-level force. However, as the force level increased, only the reconstructed brain source signals demonstrated a more substantial effect. In addition, the coherence peak was positively correlated with the finger force level. This study demonstrated the importance and positive impact of the reconstructed EEG and EMG signals for estimating corticomuscular coherence.},

  abstract  = {A mechanical phase variable represents human gait progression that can parameterize the joint kinematic trajectories for lower-limb prostheses control. Current phase variables uses unactuated states, such as the human thigh angle and its derivative or integral, to compute the thigh phase angle to estimate gait phase during stride. With time-dependent states, the phase variable can potentially produce abnormal behavior for the prosthesis controller when the user instantaneously changes speed or inclination. We propose a probabilistic-based approach that uses a maximum likelihood estimation technique from only the thigh angle to derive a holonomic phase variable for a continuous gait phase estimation. Since it does not depend on a time-wise parameter (either derivative or integral), the phase variable can respond to instantaneous changes (e.g., unwanted disturbances) during locomotion. We evaluated the proposed phase variable algorithm across various walking speeds using able-bodied subject datasets, and introduced start and stop transitions to evaluate robustness for non-rhythmic behaviors. The analysis demonstrates a probabilistic adaptation for correcting gait phase abnormalities that can drive locomotion progression for lower-limb prostheses control.},

Specifically, the developed system allows an operator to select an object from a cluttered heap and effortlessly grasp it, with the system assisting in selecting the best grasp and guiding the operator to reach it. To this end, we propose an object pose estimation scheme, a dynamic grasp re-ranking strategy, and a reach-to-grasp hybrid force/position trajectory guidance controller. We integrate them, along with our previous Spect-G RASP grasp planner, into a classical bilateral teleoperation system that allows to control the robot using a haptic device while providing force feedback to the operator. For a user-selected object, our system first identifies the object in the heap and estimates its full six degrees of freedom (DoF) pose. Then, SpectGRASP generates a set of ordered, collision-free grasps for this object. Based on the current location of the robot gripper, the proposed grasp re-ranking strategy dynamically updates the best grasp. In assisted mode, the hybrid controller generates a zero force-torque path along the reach-to-grasp trajectory while automatically controlling the orientation of the robot. We conducted real-world experiments using a haptic device and a 7-DoF cobot with a 2-finger gripper to validate individual components of our telemanipulation system and its overall functionality. Obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in assisting humans to clear cluttered scenes.},

  abstract  = {Emotion recognition is a topic of significant interest in assistive robotics due to the need to equip robots with the ability to comprehend human behavior, facilitating their effective interaction in our society. Consequently, efficient and dependable emotion recognition systems supporting optimal human-machine communication are required. Multi-modality (including speech, audio, text, images, and videos) is typically exploited in emotion recognition tasks. Much relevant research is based on merging multiple data modalities and training deep learning models utilizing low-level data representations. However, most existing emotion databases are not large (or complex) enough to allow machine learning approaches to learn detailed representations. This paper explores modality-specific pre-trained transformer frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech and text representations for data-efficient emotion recognition while achieving state-of-the-art performance in recognizing emotions. This model applies feature-level fusion using nonverbal cue data points from motion capture to provide multimodal speech emotion recognition. The model was trained using the publicly available IEMOCAP dataset, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.58\% for four emotions, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches},

However, few studies investigated the effects of levels of body representation (full-body, lower-body and viewpoint) on locomotion experience in terms of spatial awareness, self-presence and spatial presence during virtual locomotion. Understanding such effects is essential for building new virtual locomotion systems with better locomotion experience. In the present study, we first built a walking-in-place (WIP) virtual locomotion system that can represent users using avatars at three levels (full-body, lower-body and viewpoint) and is capable of rendering walking animations during in-place walking of a user. We then conducted a virtual locomotion experiment using three levels of representation to investigate the effects of body representation on spatial awareness, self-presence and spatial presence during virtual locomotion. Experimental results showed that the full-body representation provided better virtual locomotion experience in these three factors compared to that of the lower-body representation and the viewpoint representation. The lower-body representation also provided better experience than the viewpoint representation. These results suggest that self-representation of users in virtual environments using a full-body avatar is critical for providing better locomotion experience. Using full-body avatars for self-representation of users should be considered when building new virtual locomotion systems and applications.},

The users are asked to determine whether the AI is satisfying a set of constraints to best serve the affected population. Users are also asked to provide an overall score for the AI performance in resource placement.

However, during the collaboration process, programmers are not able to compile and debug the source code with syntactic errors as it is being continuously edited by other collaborators. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named Reversion of Error-free Code with Workspace Isolation (RECON) and contribute supporting techniques with prototype implementation. In this approach, the system continuously monitors the files being collaboratively edited, detects source code without syntactic error, and maintains additional Error-free source code copies. Whenever a programmer attempts to compile and debug the code, the system creates a temporary isolated workspace and replaces the source code files with the latest Error-free copies. The proposed approach and solution have been implemented in a prototype system named CoIDEA, which has indicated the feasibility of the scheme and techniques.},

In this context, we are interested in how the natural self-regulatory capabilities of humans can be enhanced by engineered robot swarms over different applications. We formulated a grid world survival game as an experimental framework that has implications for search and rescue, in which a human must be stabilized against environmental disturbances such as falling objects. Building upon the abstract survival game, controllable swarm behaviours based on virtual pheromones that protect the human from environmental disturbances are proposed. Here, human and swarm are treated as part of the same hybrid superorganism in which the swarm acts as an extended and controllable body of the human. We evaluated basic protective behaviours in the context of the survival game and used the results to synthesize a hybrid superorganism design.},

  abstract  = {Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) has become crucial in various communication services. It encompasses a broad range of fields, including Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where precise network latency prediction analysis is required to ensure reliability. However, current network latency forecasting models are insufficient in capturing the temporal periodicity and statistical features of network latency. Therefore, we propose a Patching-based Method for Network Latency Forecasting (PatchNF) in the URLLC scenarios. Specifically, to preserve local semantic information, we segment the latency sequence into subsequence-level patches that are used as input tokens for the encoder. Next, we employ dilated convolutions to capture different characteristics of network delay periodicity by utilizing varying receptive fields. To make full use of features with different network delay semantics and improve prediction performance, we introduce a hierarchical approach that exploits network delay semantics at different levels before the execution of the fully-connected mapping. Experimental results on real datasets collected in a URLLC scenario indicate that the proposed method outperforms TS2Vec by 55.2\% and Informer by 181.9\% in terms of mean squared error (MSE). These results confirm the significant advantage of PatchNF in network latency forecasting.},

However, current approaches mainly focus on machine learning or pure convolutions algorithms for example k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Despite their success, their localization ability is mainly derived from the development of model learning ability without in-depth study of the physical meaning of Channel State Information (CSI), such as the varying degrees of correlation and interference between subcarriers of antennas located at different locations in a wireless communication system. In particular, we develop a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based method to embed subcarriers from different antennas at different positions of the CSI as nodes and connect them to K-nearest neighbours (KNNs) to obtain a cohesive graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a dilated KNN to perform graph-level learning using graph convolution, effectively modeling the correlation and interference between subcarriers. Finally, to prevent the degradation of positioning performance caused by reduced node feature diversity, we introduce a feedforward neural network (FFN) module for node feature transformation. Experimental results on real datasets indicate that our method achieves an average localization error of 0.17m, which is almost 39.3\% better than the existing optimal baseline.},

Recent studies have shown that Transformer-based models can be effective in solving correlation problems in time-series data, but they also introduce issues of quadratic time and memory complexity, which make them unsuitable for LSTF problems. As a response, we investigate the impact of the long-tail distribution of attention scores on prediction accuracy and propose a Bis-Attention mechanism based on the mean measurement to bi-directionally sparse the self-attention matrix as a way to enhance the differentiation of attention scores and to reduce the complexity of the Transformer-based models from $O(L^{2})$ to $O((logL)^{2})$ . Moreover, we reduce memory consumption and optimize the model architecture through the use of a shared-QK method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by theoretical analysis and visualisation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including an average reduction of 19.2\% in MSE and 12\% in MAE compared to Informer.},

Intermolecular-contact features are fast-to-generate and can be efficiently handled by deep-learning models, while they are oversimplified to characterize the binding between a ligand and its target protein. In this work, we have developed the HybridNet model that profiles multi-range intermolecular contacts and deals with the heterogeneous channels of such features using a hybrid deep-learning architecture. The intermolecular-contact profiles keep the simplicity of original features but describe the interactions more deeply. Besides, compared to individual learning architectures and classical scoring models, HybridNet performed more favorably in protein-ligand scoring tasks.

The facial attention module can help backbone network extract more useful features. Residual in residual dense block and vision transformer can further get more detailed features.

To this end, this paper proposes EgoFormer, a Transformer-based model, to learn the motion context from egocentric videos. Moreover, dynamic features commonly used to characterize first-person video do not provide sufficient temporal information to remove the ambiguity inherent in such videos.

With the consideration of applying LLM technology in developing the Internet Hospital, a conversational-AI-enhanced intelligent diagnostic process framework is proposed in this paper. By hierarchically decomposing the online diagnostic service into three layers, namely the AI doctor, the rotating doctor, and the expert doctor, the diagnostic process is capable of providing instant treatments with a lower misdiagnosis rate, meanwhile relieving the workload of human doctors. In addition, a case study of the Internet Hospital operated by Jiangsu Provincial Hospital is conducted, which reveals the importance of boosting the diagnostic progress by the proposed framework. Further, the proposed framework is examined by a numerical experiment based on statistical data.

  abstract  = {Long-term forecasting is widely used in meteorology, hydrology, and finance. However, non-stationary time series make it hard to make accurate long-term predictions because of their complicated multi-period local-global temporal dynamic patterns. Currently, state-of-the-art methods use transformers or temporal convolutions to obtain global and local temporal dynamic patterns. Nevertheless, the former suffers from the computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms despite having a global temporal receptive field. Despite being able to catch local temporal patterns, the latter requires additional layers to capture global temporal patterns. Moreover, the present research disregards integrating multi-period patterns into longterm forecasting. In this paper, we propose MLGNet to tackle the mentioned challenges, which integrates local and global temporal dynamic patterns with multiple periods for longterm forecasting. In particular, we suggest using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) as a multi-period decoupling method to decompose non-stationary time series and apply it for the first time to long-term forecasting. In addition, we suggest a multi-scale encoder-decoder framework to capture and fuse local-global temporal dynamic patterns in each decomposed period. Inception dilated causal convolutions-based encoder and a lightweight MLP-based decoder in the framework capture local and global temporal dynamic patterns in series while avoiding the high computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms. Lastly, we suggest time-separable convolutions for aggregating information on temporal dynamic patterns among multiple periods. The above method helps MLGNet better balance the representation ability of time series in 1D and 2D space. Evaluation of five benchmark datasets shows that MLGNet outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art methods, with relative improvements of 13.8\% and 21.9\% for multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Heuristic approaches are often used to efficiently find solutions to complex engineering problems such as 3D chip layout design. When considering numerous constraints, multiple evaluation functions can be used. It is not straightforward how to combine these various functions to obtain a satisfying solution. This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm as a method of finding the right blending for a given set of heuristics. Such an approach not only modifies some parameters, but redefines the entire design process by defining it as a game. The designer plays the role of the game master who proposes heuristic evaluation functions. Design components are autonomous intelligent agents moving in a virtual world. The PSO algorithm develops blending factors for given functions to find a universal design strategy for a given design problem. A case study of a 3D chip layout design is presented and discussed. The consequences and benefits of such an approach are also shown.},

However, the decision maker (DM) may only be interested in a small portion of the front, referred to as the region of interest (ROI). Bearing this in mind, this paper develops a preference-based MOEA with local Pareto Front (PF) estimation to address the above issues. We first modify the r-dominance relation, which is not affected by the position of the user reference point. The modified non-r-dominated solutions are then used as training data during the optimization process to model the PF of the ROI. The estimated local front can be used to drive the search toward the preferred PF region. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a variety of benchmark problems with different kinds of PFs.},

The action of the glia is simulated by two parameters referring to its trophic action in restoring neuronal energy levels after firing and to its scavenging action at the synaptic level affecting the probability that an impulse is transmitted. It is shown that only glial trophic support within a limited range allows ordinate cyclic functioning of the circuit. It is also shown that changes in local action at the synapse determine changes in the frequency of the cycling.

  abstract  = {Optimization problems widely arise in various science and engineering fields and can be computationally expensive in many real-world applications. Evaluation of the fitness function to assess a candidate solution is the main operation in all optimization procedures which can be heavily compute-intensive. Machine learning-based surrogate models can contribute to learning the specific pattern among the decision variables and objective values to consequently reduce the computation time of fitness evaluation. In this study, we have proposed a novel pairwise surrogate model to identify the superiority between candidate solutions in a pairwise comparison despite the fact that most of the surrogate models try to predict the exact fitness value. The proposed idea can significantly help the optimizer to reach better results in a shorter period of time. It seems comparing two candidate solutions for a greedy selection is much easier than approximating fitness values for both. We demonstrated Graph Neural Network (GNN) for this purpose to be trained on a limited number of pairwise ranks and then utilized to compare a pair of candidate solutions. In order to examine the efficacy of our model, we utilized different well-known single-objective optimization benchmarks in dimensions 10,20, and 30. Moreover, the results of the learning-based evaluation are compared with the results from the real fitness evaluation. The results, assessed in terms of the number of fitness calls and the best-found solution, showed that the proposed method is able to decrease the computing cost of fitness evaluation significantly while we achieve a comparable solution. Our model can be tested with any optimization algorithm which employs a comparison-based mechanism among its candidate solutions.},

However, OCT images are not easy to obtain and are time-consuming and laborious. In addition, the size of biomarkers varies widely. Past deep learning-based methods can hardly solve the above problems well. Thus, to overcome the above challenges, we propose a weakly semi-supervised method called PO-Net for the detection of retinal biomarkers in OCT images. In the proposed method, we utilize a small set containing images with bounding box labels and a large set of weakly annotated images with only one point annotation per biomarker. The training of the net is composed of several steps. In the first step, we use the weakly annotated images to train a point-to-box regression network. In the second step, the point-annotated images are used to generate pseudo-bounding boxes. In the third step, the images with bounding box annotations and the generated images with pseudo-bounding box labels are used as inputs to the detection network. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion module to deal with the problem of biomarker appearance changes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on a local dataset, and the state-of-the-art performance of our method is achieved in all datasets with different percentages of bounding box annotations.},

Therefore, accurate segmentation of CNV is crucial for ophthalmologists to effectively treat patients with CNV. However, due to the complex pathological features of CNV, there exist significant variations in the size and shape of different CNV lesions. As a result, the challenge of segmenting CNV in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network with Feature Enhancement (GCFE-Net) for CNV segmentation. Our approach introduces a Graph Attention Module (GAM) on top of the encoder to extract pixel characteristics and enhance the model&#39;s space utilization. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Fusion Module (DFM) in the decoder to address the issue of semantic misalignment when the CNV scale undergoes substantial changes.

  abstract  = {Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is an innovative imaging technique that employs microbubbles (MBs) to improve the spatial resolution of ultrasound (US) imaging. Accurately extracting the MB signals from the original ultrasound data is essential for successful ULM. Traditional MB filtering methods, such as SVD, have high complexity and computational intensity. Due to the sensitivity to spatiotemporal information, 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) have been utilized in MB filtering. However, the large number of parameters in 3D convolutional layers and complex network architectures affect the real-time performance of ULM. To optimize the network structure of 3D CNN and reduce parameters, this study proposes a novel MB filtering method based on 3D CNN and U-Net3+ named 3D U-Net3+. It adopts full-scale connection strategy to reduce network parameters, while combining low-level semantics and high-level semantics to capture fine-grained semantics and coarse-grained semantics at full scale. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MB filtering method can effectively preserve the spatiotemporal information of MBs in ultrasound sequence images. The SSIM and PSNR values of the MB image processed by the proposed method achieve 0.9141 and 30.881 dB, respectively. The obtained ULM image shows the microvessels as small as 20μm,},

Accurate segmentation and detection of pulmonary nodules from CT scans are essential for proper assessment of patient prognosis. However, this task remains challenging due to various factors, such as class imbalance and the need for detailed characterization of lung nodule segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a novel network, CPR-Net (Convolutional Pyramid Residuals-Net), that combines segmentation and benign-malignant classification for CT images of lung nodules. Our approach utilizes a PBMM module to expand the perception field and enhance the representation capability of the model, allowing it to learn more detailed information. We evaluate the classification performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and the segmentation performance using the Dice coefficient. Experiments on both publicly available datasets and self-constructed datasets demonstrate that our proposed method in this paper outperforms other methods in terms of classification and segmentation performance under limited labeled data conditions. Moreover, Our results suggest that this model has great potential for improving lung nodule diagnosis in radiology for heterogeneous intranodal images.},

  abstract  = {As an effective measure to capture the object of interest in video sequence, video salient object detection (VSOD) requires the processing of information from spatial-motion modalities, although plenty of traditional VSOD models were dedicated to developing efficient spatial and motion features to obtain salient objects of global consistency, the highly redundant spatial information brought by consecutive identical objects will inevitably reduce the generalization ability of these VSOD model. Although exploring the integration of spatial and motion information can improve the inter-frame correlation of salient objects to some extent, previous models tend to focus only on simple spatio-temporal fusion, which can also lead to the generation of redundant information, resulting in poor detection performance. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on effectively fusing the feature information of different modalities to eliminate the effect of redundant information. In this research, we proposed a self-attentive multilayer cross-stacking fusion based VSOD model, which productively extracts the multimodal features for two-way information transfer, fully utilizes the spatial and temporal knowledge to complement each other, and refines the cross-stacking of the interacted information and spatial features for local and global saliency optimization. As a result, the redundant spatial information can be largely eliminated, reducing the misidentification of salient objects due to blurred backgrounds or moving objects, and adaptively activating more weights of the salient object to achieve globally consistent saliency. Comprehensive experiments on four publicly available VSOD datasets demonstrated that the model had superior performance compared to the latest multiple VSOD models.},

Then, the planning and control problem is formulated as a multiple-constraint model predictive control (MPC) problem to achieve optimal decisions within the predictive horizon. A control barrier function (CBF) is designed as a constraint for the optimization problem to achieve safety-critical obstacle avoidance.

However, CLC involves multiple fields, stakeholders, and complex socio-economic environments, which make it challenging to grasp the main points and difficulties in understanding CLC, resulting in insufficient scientific and targeted work. Therefore, identifying the key influencing factors (KIFs) of CLC is crucial for its successful implementation. This study adopts a multivariate system theory perspective and identifies 43 factors that can be categorized into three groups: consolidation subject, consolidation element, and consolidation system and environment. Furthermore, the Hamming distance optimization traditional fuzzy best and worst method (FBWM) is introduced to identify eight KIFs, including A6 comprehensive quality of professionals, A7 importance of local government, B9 financial support, B18 land use planning, B20 comprehensive consolidation cost, C2 benefit distribution mechanism, C5 whole process supervision and control mechanism, and C8 multi-departmental coordination mechanism. This study provides a new theoretical framework and methodology for research on the influencing factors of CLC, and helps policy makers and decision makers understand the interrelationships and influences of different factors in the complex consolidation work, clarifying the management priorities for CLC implementation. This can lead to the formulation of more scientific and reasonable policies and measures to promote the sustainable use and comprehensive management of land resources. Moreover, the introduction of Hamming distance optimization to the traditional FBWM enhances the reliability and scientific rigor of the research results, and can serve as a reference for similar studies.},

  abstract  = {The existing evaluation system for the construction of first-class disciplines is mostly focused on the disciplinary output indicators such as personnel training, scientific research and social services, and does not fully consider the impact of the disciplinary foundation and process management and other related indicators. In this paper, a solid literature study was conducted to filter the set of three-level evaluation indicators. The reliability and validity tests have verified that process management and disciplinary foundation are two important evaluation dimensions in the effectiveness of the construction of first-class engineering disciplines in Chinese universities, thus enriching the existing research on relevant evaluation theories. The entropy weighting method is used to assign weights to all indicators, and a complete three-level progressive evaluation system for the effectiveness of the construction of first-class engineering disciplines in Chinese universities is constructed. The results of the study verify the scientific validity of the constructed evaluation system and expand the scope of the existing research on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the construction of first-class disciplines.},

  abstract  = {As an organic whole that consists of multiple links and subjects coupled and coordinated, the introduction of the platform economy with network synergy is of great significance to the upgrading of the agricultural industry chain, so it is important to investigate the key influencing factors (KIFs) of the platform economy to enhance the value of the whole agricultural industry chain. Through literature research, meta-analysis and expert interviews, this study identifies 34 initial influencing factors for the value enhancement of the whole agricultural industry chain enabled by the platform economy, and divides the initial influencing factors into three dimensions based on the general system theory idea, namely, industry chain link elements, industry chain participating subjects, and industry chain system and environment. After that, we constructed the key influencing factors identification model based on Fuzzy-AHP and Fuzzy-DEMATEL methods and finally identified seven key influencing factors, which are intelligent management of production, organization of agricultural production, digital literacy and skills of agricultural subjects, cooperation willingness and synergy ability of various subjects, rural digital infrastructure construction, agricultural data and information sharing system, and Legal regulations and policy support, and corresponding policy suggestions are put forward accordingly. This study not only enriches the theory of platform economy development in agriculture, but also provides management decision-makers with corresponding practical basis.},

The Automotive industry development has continuously evolved the scenario of adding more integration to networked vehicles or semi-autonomous vehicles. The end product of such manufacturing practices is a vehicle becoming a networked computer on wheels. In spite of providing numerous advantages, these developments in the automotive industry are also bringing more challenges in terms of security. Hence, the industry has been forced to emphasise the principle of Security by Design. Efforts in this direction have resulted in the formulation of the ISO/SAE 21434 standard. In this work, we focus on summarising the ISO/SAE 21434 standard and analysing its relevance for automotive architecture development. Related works in the standard&#39;s approach of Security by Design are summarised. Additionally, we propose an application work of the standard in the context of automotive Architecture development as future work.},

  abstract  = {Time-varying Quality-of-Services (QoS) data describes the non-functional characteristics of Web service, which plays a key role in service selection. Whereas, QoS data is often high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) due to the impossibility for users to request all services. A Latent Factorization of Tensors (LFT)-based QoS predictor proves to be efficient in predicting time-varying QoS data. However, current LFT models mostly use $L_{2}$ -norm-oriented Loss. Yet $L_{2}$ norm is sensitive to outlier data, resulting model robustness not being guaranteed. Moreover, although $L$ , norm has intrinsically robustness, it is less sensitive to error. To address the above problems, this study proposes a Double-norm Aggregated Latent factorization of tensors (DAL) model. Its main idea is to aggregate $L_{2}$ -norm and smooth $L_{1}$ -norm to form its Loss, making it have both high accuracy and strong robustness in predicting the unobserved time-varying QoS data. Empirical studies on two time-varying QoS datasets shows that the proposed model has higher prediction accuracy and better convergence rate than state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an improved Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm for robot navigation in crowds using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO). The original ORCA algorithm allows the robot to compute escape velocities to escape from collisions with humans and then gets a set of collision-free velocities based on the reciprocal assumption. But humans usually don&#39;t follow the assumption, and thus ORCA performs badly. In this paper, we propose a MAPPO-based method to explore the optimal escape velocity for the robot to each human and use an estimation module to decide the effect of each escape velocity on the robot&#39;s new velocity. The proposed method is evaluated in simulated crowds of humans, and the original ORCA algorithm with different configurations are used as baselines. Simulation results show the proposed method achieves a significantly higher navigating success rate with almost the same time consumption compared with the original ORCA algorithm in robot navigation among crowds.},

  abstract  = {In recommender systems, a mainstream bias (MS bias) exists, which degrades the fairness of recommender systems and may decrease user satisfaction. In other words, the recommendation quality for users who prefer mainstream items is higher than that for users who prefer niche items. The MS bias degrades fairness in the recommender system and might decrease user satisfaction. To address the MS bias, we first need to quantify the degree of bias. However, the mainstreamness of users (the MS score) is difficult to measure properly, and we reveal that previous MS scores are greatly confounded by the number of user interactions that are irrelevant to mainstreamness. To address this issue, we propose a novel MS score that is unaffected by the number of interactions. Specifically, we introduce a new similarity metric that differs from the conventional Jaccard similarity measure to eliminate the effect of interaction numbers. We confirm the validity of our proposed MS score through a simulation study that discriminates mainstream users from niche users under varying numbers of user interactions. The proposed unconfounded MS score enables the proper evaluation of MS biases and the selection of a recommendation model with less MS bias. We evaluate the MS biases of two popular recommendation models using seven real-world datasets. We demonstrate that MS biases exist in all datasets and that a better model differs depending on the datasets. Furthermore, we confirm that the previous MS scores fail to select recommendation models with small biases. The results show the effectiveness of our new MS score in improving recommendations for fairness among users.},

  abstract  = {Airport baggage transport is a key aspect of airport ground handling which involves transporting passenger baggage between the baggage handling center and aircraft stands. Typically, tractors and trailers are used to implement the baggage transport service under the drop-and-pull mode in practice. Efficient airport baggage transport service is essential to reduce flight delays, save airport ground handling costs, and guarantee aviation safety. However, the existing methods for scheduling tractors and trailers perform poorly when dealing with high flight volumes at busy hub airports, leading to delayed responses for baggage transport demands. Besides, few works have explored the significance of the drop-and-pull mode in improving airport baggage transport service equality. Thus, to enhance the efficiency of airport baggage transport service and reduce airport ground handling costs, this paper presents an integrated tractor and trailer scheduling problem under the drop-and-pull mode. Then, an improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed to solve this problem. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm.},

However, in large-scale systems with massive agents and strategies, these methods are not time feasible. Therefore, a two-stage population-based multi-agent evaluation algorithm is proposed to solve voltage control problem in large-scale power grid systems. For stage one, a population is first established for each agent. And then, individuals in the populations randomly combined to form joint strategies. Base on the max and mean reward from the interaction between joint strategies and the environment, populations evolve to a near-optimal joint strategy. Stage two takes the above near-optimal joint strategy as the starting point, and uses a strategy search algorithm with maximum transfer possibility to find the Markov-Conley chain in the system. Finally, the above two-stage method is simulated in 10 and 32-agent power grid systems to verify the effectiveness.},

An analysis of the manufacturing system based on mathematical derivation and statistical analysis confirms the phenomenon of self-organized criticality.

  abstract  = {Feature selection is an expensive challenging task in machine learning and data mining aimed at removing irrelevant and redundant features. This contributes to an improvement in classification accuracy, as well as the budget and memory requirements for classification, or any other post-processing task conducted after feature selection. In this regard, we define feature selection as a multi-objective binary optimization task with the objectives of maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing the number of selected features. In order to select optimal features, we have proposed a binary Compact NSGA-II (CNSGA-II) algorithm. Compactness represents the population as a probability distribution to enhance evolutionary algorithms not only to be more memory-efficient but also to reduce the number of fitness evaluations. Instead of holding two populations during the optimization process, our proposed method uses several Probability Vectors (PVs) to generate new individuals. Each PV efficiently explores a region of the search space to find non-dominated solutions instead of generating candidate solutions from a small population as is the common approach in most evolutionary algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first compact multi-objective algorithm proposed for feature selection. The reported results for expensive optimization cases with a limited budget on five datasets show that the CNSGA-II performs more efficiently than the well-known NSGA-II method in terms of the hypervolume (HV) performance metric requiring less memory. The proposed method and experimental results are explained and analyzed in detail.},

In this paper, we develop MAdam as a multi-objective extension of the well-known Adam optimization algorithm. MAdam is a classical population-based approach that uses the gradient information of multiple objectives to accelerate population convergence toward an optimal minimum. The method applied a non-dominated sorting algorithm to keep selective population members and improve the diversity across the landscape. The performance of MAdam is evaluated on the standard ZDT test functions as the proof of concept.

  abstract  = {Market making is an important research topic in quantitative finance. Market makers need to continuously optimize their ask and bid prices to provide liquidity and make profits, which can be viewed as a continuous control problem. Reinforcement learning is a common method for solving sequential decision-making problems, in which an agent learns from reward signals through interactions with the environment to maximize the cumulative return. However, traditional online reinforcement learning methods can be inefficient in practice as they require the agent to interact with the environment to collect training data, which could be unstable. Additionally, exploration in financial trading can be very expensive. To address these issues, we apply offline reinforcement learning methods which use historical experience to train agents. In this paper, we present ORL4MM (Offline Reinforcement Learning for Market Making), a novel market making agent using offline training and online fine-tuning to mitigate potential losses and instabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments, where our agent outperforms all baseline models, including traditional models and online RL agents. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the application of offline reinforcement learning in market-making tasks, and we provide valuable practical experience for the deployment of reinforcement learning in financial scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Path planning and collision avoidance are critical components of UAV control algorithms that play a crucial role in executing UAV missions. As scenarios become increasingly complex, the traditional control methods just ain&#39;t cutting it to meet the requirements. Reinforcement learning is an emerging decision-making control algorithm that attempts to address these issues as an alternative to traditional methods and has made significant advances. Unfortunately, standard RL approaches only aim to maximize rewards, however balancing task performance and safety in completing UAV tasks poses a challenge since these two objectives sometimes conflict, leading to a trade-off often difficult to manage. This paper proposes three techniques to address this problem. First, we model the path planning and collision avoidance issue in a constrained RL framework, eliminating the need for complex reward engineering. Second, we expand our previous work in the UAV setting and introduce an exact penalty optimization (EPO) algorithm to provide stricter constraint guarantees. We also propose a novel spatial information representation method for the UAV scenario to help UAVs better understand environmental information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the EPO and spatial representation modules proposed in this paper, through a significant reduction in collisions as well as a strong improvement in the rate of reaching the destination.},

  abstract  = {Trip planning service can save the time and energy of tourists for preparing a trip and provide a more comfortable and satisfying travel experience. This paper particularly considers the planning of transportation mode between point of interests (POI) and formulates a multiobjective trip planning model to simultaneously maximize the visit time in POIs, minimize the travel time between POIs, and minimize the travel fare needed for the trip. To simulate the real-world environment, the formulated model incorporates the real-world POI and transportation data crawled from Tripadvisor and Baidu Map API, respectively. To obtain efficient trip planning schemes, a multipopulation ant colony system algorithm for trip planning, abbreviated as MACS-TP, is proposed. First, MACS-TP uses two colonies to optimize the time-related objective and fare-related objective respectively, which enhances the search efficiency. Second, an archive is employed to store the nondominated solutions found by both colonies and a new pheromone global update rule is designed based on the archive to help colonies optimize their corresponding objective sufficiently. Third, an elite learning strategy is proposed to further enhance the quality of solutions in the archive. Experimental results on a real-world dataset of Guangzhou, China illustrate the effectiveness of MACS-TP.},

Nevertheless, it does not interfere with daily activity. Prevalence in epidemiological and population-based studies ranges from 3\% to 19\% in adults older than 65 years. A very interesting approach in this area is related to the identification of an Artificial Intelligence (Al)-based model and a subset of relevant features to predict the MCI clinical outcome. In our study, we propose a Pareto-optimality-based approach to identify the best model for predicting MCI. In fact, the best model achieves an Accuracy and Recall on Yes MCI of 71\% and 80\% respectively. With this approach, it is possible to select the best model in order to predict Yes MCI (highest risk class). Our study presents a new best model selection approach that can be applied in identifying the best model that can be applied in various disease classification problems.},

In this paper, we propose a handful of novel features to capture the effect of smile on faces. With the new feature set, we then apply several machine learning algorithms on the data set that includes a comprehensive set of both smiling and neutral facial images of people with different gender, ethnicity and age groups. Our experimental result suggests that smiling faces produce high discriminating power that can be used effectively by the machine-learning algorithms to improve their accuracy and fairness.},

  abstract  = {Although deep neural networks exhibit high performance on several specific tasks, they suffer from a severe issue of catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks incrementally. Several incremental learning methods have been recently proposed to address this problem, some of which rely on storing data or constructing generative models to enhance the performance of incremental models. However, storing old data from previous tasks may be limited by memory or privacy issues, and generative models may often be unstable and inefficient during model training. In this study, we present a non-exemplar-based class-incremental learning method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning when saving old class samples is not possible, while distinguishing between old and new classes. We tackle the problem of representation bias and classifier bias that are inherent in class-incremental learning. Specifically, we introduce class enhancement, which enables the model to encounter more classes during training to acquire transferable and diverse representation features, mitigating representation bias. Furthermore, we use backtracking transfer, which employs semantic mapping to limit inter-class relationships by learning class-level semantic relationships across two tasks, to preserve discriminative old knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting due to classifier bias. We perform comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.},

Subsequently, multiple features were generated from the acquired EEG data, and differential evaluations between two types of features were conducted in all six cases.

In the identification of videos with difficult topics explained poorly and videos with easy topics explained well, a maximum accuracy of 71\% (21\% above the chance level) was recorded. Furthermore, although the identification accuracy between videos with difficult topics explained well and videos with easy topics explained poorly was approximately 60\%, applying network analysis to the generated features improved the accuracy up to a maximum of 70\%.

In recent years, advancements in deep learning techniques, such as the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have enabled the use of MI classification. Despite their success, CNNs and RNNs are not capable of effectively extracting brain spatial and temporal information necessary for MI classification. Additionally, differences in individual subjects further complicate the classification process. To address these limitations, a novel Spatial-Temporal Transformer based on Domain Generalization (ST-DG) has been proposed for MI classification using EEG signals. This framework utilizes a spatial-temporal transformer architecture to capture essential spatiotemporal characteristics of the brain, while also employing Domain Generalization techniques to account for cross-subject variability and improve the model&#39;s generalization performance. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art classification performance.},

Firstly, by segmenting the image into patches during the sampling procedure, we can dehaze images of arbitrary size. Then we compress the image into the latent space via the auto-encoder model and conduct the diffusion operation in the latent space, significantly decreasing the computational complexity associated with the task while exhibiting negligible effects on the perceptual fidelity of the resultant images. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and the superior performance of DehazeDM in image dehazing.},

This paper presents a moisture content prediction model based on the deep long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders with stochastic sensitivity (DLASS) to extract a hidden representation of input data. The DLASS uses multiple LSTM encoders to learn more informative hidden representations from unseen samples, which are then decoded using multiple LSTM decoders. The DLASS is trained by minimizing the perturbed error from historical moisture content data. Furthermore, a nonlinear fully connected feedforward neural network as a regression layer is applied to predict moisture content using hidden representations learned by the DLASS. The DLASS is applied to real-world industrial data of Sugi wood processed by a drying kiln made by SECEA from August 4 to 19, 2008. Multiple test cases and comparisons with existing classical and state-of-the-art models show that the DLASS model yields more accurate moisture content prediction results and has high generalization capability. To be specific, the DLASS yields the lowest MAE (0.026), MAPE (0.280), and RMSE (0.058) for predicting moisture content during the wood drying process.},

To overcome those problems, a generative adversarial network with Swin Transformer (StGAN) is proposed and applied to symbolic imagery signal decomposition and semantic segmentation tasks. In addition, a realistic image dataset taken in complex lighting conditions is proposed for symbolic imagery signal decomposition, which have complex lighting environments and edge information loss, we name it the MLT dataset. We demonstrate StGAN brings significant improvements in performance than some existing methods in the accuracy of symbolic imagery signal decomposition on MLT datasets. Further experiments on Sky and Facades datasets prove that StGAN works well in other tasks, especially when fewer data is involved in training, but it can still ensure good accuracy.},

This study introduces an EEG-based BCI system designed to decode anticipated gait direction, thereby enabling command of a self-balancing, overground exoskeleton. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system safely and effectively, we utilized a dynamic simulator (or a digital twin) of the physical exoskeleton, developed commercially for individuals with limited or no walking ability. Six healthy participants, wearing an EEG device, were instructed to initiate gait movements toward the direction indicated by on-screen arrow triggers (forward, backward, left, and right). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), operating on an 80\%-20\% Train-Test Ratio, was used to evaluate the system. The results demonstrated low error rates for the exoskeleton simulator, and an overall system accuracy of 0.75, reflecting the performance of the EEG-based BCI. Notably, the system had an average delay of 5 minutes in a real-time control setting, primarily attributed to its signal processing step.},

  abstract  = {Brain-to-speech systems, which enable communication through neural activity, have gathered significant attention as potential neuroprosthesis for patients and as novel communication tools for broader individuals. To date, most non-invasive brain-to-speech research has focused on word-level decoding, while sentence-level reconstruction remains challenging. In this study, we introduce a sentence reconstruction method using a restricted range of 16 unique words and compare two different approaches: word-in-sentence reconstruction and natural sentence generation. The focus is on efficiently generating sentences by utilizing the temporal convolutional network model to extract features from EEG signals and create word embeddings that considers the contextual relevance between words. The language model and keyword density measuring are applied to evaluate the sentence reconstruction performance for each approach. The results show that the word-in-sentence approach with language model leads to a significant reduction in the word error rate of $31.58\pm 18.58\%$ for spoken speech and $56.01\pm 7.57\%$ for imagined speech. The natural sentence generation approach significantly improved the words per minute performance, enabling more natural mode of brain-to-speech. We conducted an online demo to verify the potential of the proposed approaches, generating audible speech from brain signals in real-time. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of natural brain-to-speech systems by considering the contextual relevance, allowing users to freely communicate natural sentences in real life.},

  abstract  = {Electroencephalography (EEG) related research faces a significant challenge of subject independence due to the variation in brain signals and responses among individuals. While deep learning models hold promise in addressing this challenge, their effectiveness depends on large datasets for training and generalization across participants. To overcome this limitation, we propose a solution to the above limitation by increasing the size and quality of training data for subject-independent auditory attention decoding (AAD) using EEG with deep learning. Specifically, our method employs a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to generate synthetic data, with Pearson correlation filtering the most realistic samples. We evaluated this method on a publicly available dataset of selective auditory attention experiments and showed superior performance in subject-independent AAD performance. The mixed training set, consisting of both real and artificial data generated by the WGAN+Pearson Correlation Coefficient, demonstrated approximately 4\% improvement in AAD accuracy for a 1-second window. These results demonstrate that deep learning remains a viable approach to overcoming data scarcity in subject-independent AAD tasks based on EEG. Moreover, the proposed method has the potential to improve the generalization and reliability of EEG classification tasks.},

We assessed 22 DOC patients admitted to the acute rehabilitation unit after a brain lesion over one or more sessions. We extracted EEG sensorimotor rhythms and performed a standard open-loop BCI pipeline evaluation, classifying motor attempt against resting-state trials. We validate this approach by correlating classification accuracy with the established clinical scale Coma Recovery Scale Revised. We employ a machine learning (ML)-inspired diagnostic criterion based on confidence intervals over chance-level classification accuracy and show that it yields more conservative and, arguably, reliable inference of Cognitive Motor Dissociation (CMD) by means of command-following, neuroimaging-based tools, compared to diagnoses based on clinical assessments or criteria examining the statistical significance of brain features across different mental states.},

However, existing clinical studies of ARDS prognosis face severe challenges due to the redundancy of multiple sources of heterogeneous data in current healthcare datasets, the high dimensionality of patient features, and the wide variation in the importance of each feature. In this paper, we propose a holistic ARDS prognostic framework for assessing ARDS prognosis through a standardized data governance process and an integrated feature selection approach based on embedded algorithms. Specifically, we extract ARDS patient data from medical data sources by various criteria and normalize the features. Then we apply multiple embedded feature selection methods to obtain a decision matrix based on the data-governed dataset. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of our proposed framework. The experimental results show that our proposed framework performs well in both data governance and feature selection and has wide clinical application potential.},

  abstract  = {Many Computer-Generated (CG) images are spreading widely on the Internet, which may deliberately misinform or deceive the public. Therefore, distinguishing CG images from natural photographic (PG) has become a frontier research topic in the field of image forensics. Although many algorithms have been proposed, it is still very challenging to detect CG images generated by the recent cutting-edge generative methods. Besides, most existing algorithms tend to generalize poorly when facing different unseen multimodal generative models. To address this issue, a novel method based on amplified texture differences learning is proposed to tackle this problem. We first design a deep texture enhancement module for discriminative texture amplification. Specifically, a semantic segmentation module is utilized to generate semantic segmentation map for the affine transformation operation guidance, which can be further used to recover the texture in different regions of the input image. Then, the combination of the original image and the high-frequency components of the original and enhanced images are fed into a hybrid neural network equipped with attention mechanisms, which refines intermediate features and facilitates trace exploration in spatial and channel dimensions respectively. By verifying on several commonly used benchmark datasets and a newly constructed dataset 1 1 The benchmark is available at https://github.com/191578010/DSGCG. with more realistic and diverse images, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms some existing methods.},

A prevailing issue in this domain is that the direct combination of neural implicit surface and volume rendering typically considers only photometric consistency loss, leading to an under-constrained surface problem. To address this problem, we develop a double-supervised approach and an integrated network for implicit surface and volume rendering, enabling the generation of a 3D surface model of an object from a set of multi-view images. In our approach, the object surface is represented by a signed distance function, and a 3D surface reconstruction model is jointly trained with photometric consistency constraints and geometry constraints. Experiments demonstrate that by enhancing prior geometry supervision and integrating the double-supervised network architecture into neural implicit 3D reconstruction, we can achieve accurate and high-quality 3D reconstruction.},

  abstract  = {Most colorectal cancers originate from adenomatous polyps, which start as single asymptomatic polyps and develop into malignant tumors. In clinical practice, colonoscopy is an extremely effective method for detecting polyps, and it provides important visual information for the accurate identification and removal of polyps. However, it is highly challenging to achieve accurate segmentation of various polyps due to the complex and variable size, shape, color, number, and growth background of polyps at different periods. To address these dilemmas, we propose a multi-distance feature dissimilarity-guided encoder-decoder network for automatic polyp segmentation, mainly consisting of the Multi-Distance Differential Module (MDDM) and the Hybrid Loss Module (HLM). The former mainly utilizes the multilayer feature subtraction (MLFS) operations to extract the difference information between short-distance adjacent layer features and short-distance and long-distance cross-layer features. Given this, the pyramid-inspired MDDM obtains discriminative features continuously between adjacent/cross layers, enhancing complementary features between different layers. The latter supervises the feature maps extracted at each network level to achieve finer predictions. Experiments on four challenge datasets confirm that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in six evaluation metrics while yielding reasonably accurate segmentation results.},

However, their performance degrades severely when confronted with out-of-domain (OOD) samples. To solve this issue, recent papers investigate the strategy that a CM can opt for abstention when it is not confident about the decision. In this paper, we develop an effective approach to enhance the performance of CMs with abstention. Specifically, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to group samples into known classes more tightly and employ data augmentation to enhance the diversity of known samples. The experiments are conducted on ASV spoof 2019 logical access corpus and another test set consisting of different OOD samples from other databases. With our scheme, CMs with abstention can achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 1.84\% on the LA test set and 0.86\% on the other test set. These results demonstrate that CMs trained with our approach show better OOD detection performance and can make more confident decisions.},

  abstract  = {The real-time query of surveillance video plays a significant role in many fields such as public safety, smart city, and abnormality monitoring. However, with the exponential growth of surveillance video data, traditional cloud-based intelligent video processing faces significant challenges in terms of latency and bandwidth, while the pure edge computing approach is deficient in query accuracy due to its lack of computational power. Existing edge cloud collaboration approaches, such as SurveilEdge, focus on real-time target queries within a single video stream and do not show promising results during target queries across multiple video streams. For this reason, this paper proposes Query Edge, an edge-cloud collaborative real-time query system for multiple video streams. Specifically, we design a real-time query system based on an edge-cloud collaboration framework to achieve highly accurate and low-latency target query services in multiple video streams. In addition, we introduce a prioritization mechanism and a load-balancing strategy in the query task scheduling process to further improve query efficiency. The evaluation proves that QueryEdge has a significant improvement in query latency and bandwidth consumption compared with pure cloud computing, pure edge computing, and SurveilEdge.},

  abstract  = {In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring public safety relies heavily on the real-time detection of anomalies in monitoring systems. Thus, video anomaly analysis has garnered significant attention. We propose a collaborative anomaly analysis system(RACCS) that leverages cloud-edge-end computing. The system receives real-time video packets generated by cameras through edge gateways and utilizes load balancing algorithms to determine the destination node, reducing system latency. Using the MQTT protocol of the IoT, the video packets are transmitted to edge nodes or the cloud for inference. To prevent highly confident video packets from being transmitted to the cloud for secondary inference, we deploy a lightweight model on the edge nodes for initial inference, thereby reducing bandwidth consumption and latency. To achieve this goal, we adopt specific quantization methods for both the input video packets and complex cloud model parameters. This converts the complex cloud model into a lightweight model, reducing model storage and improving inference speed. We also propose a joint optimization framework for compressive sensing and anomaly classification that meets both high compression rates for video packets and high accuracy for anomaly classification. We further conduct a series of experiments to determine the optimal configuration and compare our approach with other mainstream methods, demonstrating the superiority of our system.},

  abstract  = {Video analysis typically requires a significant amount of computing resources and energy. Traditional cloud-based video analysis relies on concentrating computing resources in the cloud, which puts a tremendous load on network bandwidth and introduces poor user experience due to latency. Edge computing offers a solution by offloading a portion of the video analysis tasks to the edge, significantly reducing the pressure on bandwidth and latency. However, the fixed video configurations (resolution, frame rate, etc.) uploaded to the edge may not be optimal for specific situations. Moreover, using a low video configuration makes it difficult for edge video analysis systems to recognize environmental changes, while using a high video configuration poses challenges to latency and bandwidth. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the MACEdge-an edge video analysis framework by leveraging the multi-access capability of the edge gateway to enhance edge perception by accessing heterogeneous sensors. We offer an algorithm based on Q Learning for dynamic adaptive adjustment of sensor threshold and video configurations. In experiments using real-world data, our collaborative solution improved accuracy and reduced high bandwidth costs compared to other video configuration adjustment benchmarks.},

Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in detecting and mitigating these threats, making them an increasingly popular choice in IDS design. However, evaluating the performance of deep learning-based IDSs can be challenging due to the complexity of the models and the lack of standardized evaluation metrics. This review paper presents an overview of the most common evaluation metrics used in deep learning-based IDSs, including precision, confusion metrics, accuracy, F1 score, Area Under Curve (AUC), and recall. Several studies have applied machine-learning classic algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and others, but for this paper, we used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that would be independent of the features in the dataset. The studied papers did not provide AUC and none of them balanced the dataset based on the feature&#39;s proportion. The dataset utilized in this study is the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset, which underwent meticulous cleansing and normalization procedures to ensure the inclusion of legitimate and useful data. Furthermore, a weighting mechanism was introduced to balance the dataset and mitigate the potential for bias in the Machine Learning process.},

Piezoelectric ceramic sensor array (PCSA) with the merit of easily embedding into a mattress is a quite promising tool to monitor OSA events at home. Previous efforts achieved promising results for OSA detection based on PCSA, however, there are two major challenges still on open: (1) how to screen out the high-quality PCSA signals; (2) how to alleviate the difference among PCSA signals from different individuals. To address these challenges, we propose a cross-domain deep neural network for OSA event detection named CDDNNet. To obtain the high-quality PCSA signals, we propose a new dynamic channel-selection algorithm with maximizing energy minimizing variance of PCSA signals. To make CDDNNet with the cross-domain learning ability, we employ the gradient reverse learning (GRL) technique to alleviate the difference among PCSA signals from different individuals. What&#39;s more, we conduct a pilot study to collect overnight PCSA signals from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Experiment results show that CDDNNet can achieve competitive results of 54.20\% sensitivity, 90.30\% specificity, and 84.68\% accuracy for OSA event detection.},

  abstract  = {Monocular single-frame 3D human pose estimation (HPE) has garnered significant interest, particularly in the domains of human-computer interaction and human action recognition. Several remarkable works have achieved excellent results in obtaining accurate 2D human poses. Building upon the foundation laid by previous advancements, this paper focuses on 2D-3D lifting. The proposed 2D-3D lifting algorithm in this paper is a Transformer-based model, which demonstrates its unique advantages in processing sequential data. The self-attention mechanism in the Transformer can handle global information without being limited by the receptive field. The Transformer&#39;s superior ability to process global information enables it to adaptively learn the relationships between human joints across different human behaviors. However, directly estimating 3D human pose from a single 2D image is a complex task due to depth ambiguity and joint occlusion. This ill-posed problem arises from the limited information available in a 2D image, making it challenging to determine the precise 3D pose. Additionally, occlusions further complicate the accurate estimation of joint positions. This article introduces a Transformer-based network that enhances the algorithm&#39;s robustness by utilizing multi-layer dual-stream blocks. One path concatenates the 2D coordinates and the focal length of the camera as input, while the other path takes the difference between the 2D coordinates as input. The two paths undergo an information fusion process at the front end of the block. Experiments conducted on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks. Our code will be made publicly available on GitHub.},

  abstract  = {Early diagnosis of breast cancer is challenging because in the most common mammogram images, the tumor usually occupies only a very small part of the entire image, which often makes deep learning models lose attention to the tumor area. In previous work, most models solved this problem by using ROI labeling to train models, which was expensive and difficult to widely apply. Some recent ROI-free methods use multi-scale features or multi-stage training, which gets rid of the model&#39;s dependence on ROI but greatly increases the computational complexity and deployment difficulty, limiting the potential of deep neural networks. Therefore, a deep positional-representation-based local information retention networks (PR-LIR) was proposed. PR-LIR is a lightweight, end-to-end mammogram classification model, which uses positional representation (PR) and multi-scale regional pooling (MRP) modules to locate tumor regions and retain regional semantic information of small target tumors at different scales, without ROI labeling and multi-stage training, and almost no increasement in parameters and computational complexity. In particular, the proposed PR and MRP modules have good generalization performance, which can be applied to most CNN models and improve the classification accuracy of mammography images. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that PR-LIR achieves the best AUC and satisfactory accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art mammogram classification method.},

The selected lifting functions are used to project the original nonlinear state space into a higher-dimensional linear function space, in which Koopman-based linear models may be constructed for the underlying nonlinear process. To address the potential issue of a significant increase in the dimensionality of the resulting full-order Koopman models caused by the use of lifting functions, we propose a reduced-order Koopman modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition. A computationally efficient linear robust predictive control scheme is established based on the reduced-order Koopman model. A case study on a benchmark chemical process is conducted to illustrate the proposed framework.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes an integrated software-hardware approach for automated bathymetry mapping using low-cost unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The solution takes inspiration from adaptive sampling, aiming to minimize the time, hardware, and training costs compared to traditional coverage path planning (CPP) methods. The proposed approach implements a scalable Markov Decision Process (MDP)-based model and a planning method based on multi-agent approximate dynamic programming (ADP), which prescribes USVs to seek the most informative samples in bandwidth-limited environments with uncertain and incomplete prior map information. The control structure offloads surrogate model updates and path planning to the control station and ensures mission completion even with communication dropouts. Computer simulation results on both real-world and computer-generated bathymetry data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of predictive accuracy and efficiency. The proposed solution has the potential to significantly aid coastal development by streamlining access to accurate models of near-shore bathymetry.},

Mass customization is a production strategy that manufactures produce products to meet diverse customer demands while maintaining production efficiency close to mass production. Modular production is one of the production methods to achieve mass customization, and products are manufactured by combining modules. This production method allows a manufacturer to increase its total profit by manufacturing products suited to individual customers while reducing costs. In actual production planning, production costs and customer demands are uncertain. By considering these uncertainties, robust production planning can be achieved. Various robust production planning methods have been proposed in previous studies, however, no previous studies have reported cases of modular production that reflect customer decisions. Therefore, in this study, the production planning problem is formulated as a bilevel production planning problem consisting of customers and a manufacturer, and robust optimization is applied. Finally, we verify the usefulness of the proposed method for customer demand uncertainty by comparing the conventional model with the robust optimization model.},

One such industry is the recycling of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) materials, in which electric devices are disassembled and readied for the recovery of raw materials. Since devices may contain hazardous materials and their disassembly involves heavy manual labor, robotic disassembly is a promising venue. However, since devices may be damaged, dirty and unidentified, robotic disassembly is challenging since object models are unavailable or cannot be relied upon. This case study explores grasping strategies for industrial robotic disassembly of WEEE devices with uncertain vision data. We propose three grippers and appropriate tactile strategies for force-based manipulation that improves grasping robustness. For each proposed gripper, we develop corresponding strategies that can perform effectively in different grasping tasks and leverage the grippers design and unique strengths. Through experiments conducted in lab and factory settings for four different WEEE devices, we demonstrate how object uncertainty may be overcome by tactile sensing and compliant techniques, significantly increasing grasping success rates.},

In this article, we introduce a novel technique for accurate indoor vehicular positioning. The first step in our proposed system is localization based on received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints of 5G New Radio (NR) downlink signals. Furthermore, to compensate for the high susceptibility of RSS fingerprinting techniques in varying environments, we propose a real-time collaborative localization scheme based on 5G sidelink device-to-device (D2D) communication. We develop extensive test campaigns to assess the efficacy of our proposed two-step scheme. According to test results, our proposed algorithm outperforms scenarios that rely solely on 5G RSS fingerprints.},

However, existing research on UAV trajectory planning often employs the cascade process method that involves high-precision maps, real-time positioning and path planning. These methods have limitations such as high computational complexity and time delay, which hinder the efficiency of trajectory planning. End-to-end trajectory planning methods offer a promising solution to this problem. As the core of these end-to-end methods, perception-end plays a decisive role in trajectory planning. But current multimodal fusion of perception is only post-fusion, lacks intermediate feature-level fusion and lacks attention to global visuospatial information. To solve these problems, we propose a new network architecture called FlyTransformer, which fuses the proprioceptive state and visual perception in feature-level for end-to-end trajectory planning. And the key visuospatial information can be attentioned in this architecture. We evaluate our method in forest and cuboid scenarios and their corresponding outdoor scenarios. The results show that FlyTransformer outperforms other baseline algorithms in terms of efficiency and performance.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles, commonly known as self-driving cars, are rapidly gaining popularity due to their numerous advantages, such as reducing traffic, pollution, and emissions while increasing safety, convenience, and transportation connectivity. In order to accurately track the motion signal, these vehicles are now utilising advanced control techniques, such as model predictive control (MPC). However, the efficiency of MPCs heavily relies on properly tuning their weights. The primary function of the MPC is to recalculate the optimal values for the vehicle control commands, such as desired speed, steering angle, etc., while considering the dynamic model of the autonomous vehicle. The existing linear MPC models cannot reach higher efficiency because of using fixed weights without considering the error. This paper introduces a novel approach for developing an MPC model with a time-varying weights algorithm for autonomous vehicles. The study aims to minimise motion tracking errors such as lateral position and yaw angle errors. Relevant MPC weights are calculated online using fuzzy logic-based units considering the lateral position and yaw angle errors. The proposed linear time-varying MPC was designed and developed using MATLAB software, resulting in improved motion tracking performance with 31.62\% and 20.89\% reduction of the root means square error of lateral position and yaw angle.},

  abstract  = {Modern vehicles are equipped with a growing amount of advanced driver assistance functions (ADAS), such as adaptive cruise control or collision avoidance systems. These functions heavily rely on the current state of the vehicle. Particularly for lateral vehicle dynamics functions, the state of the tires has a crucial influence. For moderate driving scenarios, the vehicle lateral tire forces are mainly described by the tire cornering stiffnesses, which give a linear relation between tire slip angles and the resulting lateral tire forces. However, the tire cornering stiffnesses heavily depend on the type of tire and on many parameters, most significantly the tire vertical load, the tire wear and the tire pressure. As such changes in tire cornering stiffness can lead to a completely different vehicle behavior, it is essential to obtain current cornering stiffness estimates for the application of ADAS. Thus, this paper proposes a combined beta-less approach for vehicle cornering stiffness and road-friction coefficient estimation based on a nonlinear tire model, which solely makes use of typical vehicle in-series sensors. Vehicle measurements on dry road as well as on ice show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of adding a new node or repositioning a current node in the network while optimizing a given network parameter such as network reliability. Although there are infinitely many locations to place the new node in space, there are only finitely many possible changes to the communication network. We provide an algorithm that enumerates all possible network changes in time O( $n$ 2 log n) or O( $n$ 3 log n), for networks in 2- or 3-dimensional Euclidean space, respectively.

  abstract  = {Localization is crucial for various automation systems to provide awareness of the robot&#39;s position and orientation. Additionally, a localization system that offers portability, flexibility, and low computational and economic costs is required by a variety of robotics applications. However, no existing system can offer all the aforementioned features suitable for motion capture tasks involving ground swarm robots. In this study, we propose MoCArU, a novel Motion Capture system based on odometry and ArUco, robustly recognized through image data with low computational cost. We have evaluated the system&#39;s performance by comparing it with the ground truth trajectory and adopting different numbers of cameras. The results show that MoCArU can achieve a root mean square error of 0.1345±0.0065 m using ten cameras. Our findings add to previous knowledge by presenting a robust and cost-effective alternative to existing localization methods. Here, we show that MoCArU&#39;s use of lightweight camera stands and wireless communication ensures ease of installation, portability, and low computational cost, making it suitable for tracking swarm ground robot systems. We anticipate this system to be used in various applications, such as robot position control, navigation, and obstacle avoidance control. Overall, MoCArU provides a reliable and cost-effective solution for the real-time localization of robots, so its wider applicability in various environments is a significant advantage in robotics. An open-source implementation of MoCArU, as well as its related details, is open for public use at https://www.rm.is.tohoku.ac.jp/MoCArU.},

However, there are still many areas for improvement in the management and communication of heterogeneous robot swarms, including the need for different connection interfaces for heterogeneous robots and the use of heterogeneous robot action logs to identify possible bottlenecks in the production line or record unplanned behaviors, whether malicious or not. In order to better manage heterogeneous robot swarms, this paper introduces the Heterogeneous Robots Chain (HR-Chain), a blockchain-based solution that can manage different types of robots and prevent unnecessary changes in robot operation logs to help improve production efficiency or other management requirements. HR-Chain is a Tezos-based blockchain project that securely stores robot logs in the blockchain using smart contracts. Finally, this paper conducts experimental research on HR-Chain, the real experimental results show that the robot system based on HR-Chain has better response speed and execution force, showing its potential application prospects in the industrial and consumer fields.},

  abstract  = {Human action recognition (HAR) is a crucial research field that necessitates the implementation of advanced mathematical concepts to recognize human activities from sequences of observations. This paper presents a novel framework employing a mixture-based Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that capitalizes on the advantages of asymmetric modeling, bounded support, and robustness in sensor-based HAR. To accommodate variations in observations within each human activity class, we propose an asymmetric generalized Gaussian mixture model (AGGM) to model the emission probabilities. Subsequently, we propose incorporating the bounded asymmetric generalized Gaussian mixture model (BAGGM) to address the constraints inherent in real-life data. The parameters of the corresponding HMM are estimated using the Baum-Welch algorithm, and the most probable sequence of hidden states is inferred using the Viterbi algorithm. We validate our proposed framework using four datasets for human activities. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms all state-of-the-art HAR models that are HMM-based, thereby emphasizing the superiority of our proposed frameworks in HAR systems to understand behaviours, predict potential actions, and facilitate sports applications for the general population and independent living applications for vulnerable populations.},

The missing measurement and possible inaccuracy in the measurement of the vehicle&#39;s yaw rate are considered by using a random variable distributed over [0, 1]. Norm-bounded uncertainties are considered in the vehicle&#39;s tire cornering stiffness. Next, the Lyapunov stability theory is used to design a sideslip angle estimator such that the filtering error dynamics is stochastically stable and the $H_{\infty}$ performance criterion is met. The desired parameters of the proposed $H_{\infty}$ sideslip angle estimator are gained by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. Simulation results show that the proposed novel estimator can efficiently estimate the sideslip angle while it demonstrates robust performance to uncertainties and fading measurements.},

  abstract  = {Cities have undergone significant changes due to the rapid increase in urban population, heightened demand for resources, and growing concerns over climate change. To address these challenges, digital transformation has become a necessity. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sensing techniques, such as synthetic sensing, can elevate Digital Twins (DTs) from digital copies of physical objects to effective and efficient platforms for data collection and in-situ processing. In such a scenario, this paper presents a compre-hensive approach for developing a Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) based on Edge Intelligence (EI), specifically designed for smart cities. Our approach prioritizes the placement of intelligence as close as possible to data sources, and leverages an “opportunistic” interpretation of DT (ODT), resulting in a novel and interdisciplinary strategy to re-engineering large-scale distributed smart systems. The preliminary results of the proposed system have shown that moving computation to the edge of the network provides several benefits, including (i) enhanced inference performance, (ii) reduced bandwidth and power consumption, (iii) and decreased latencies with respect to the classic cloud -centric approach.},

Thanks to the flexibility of multivariate Beta in fitting the data compared to other conventional distributions such as the Dirichlet distribution, we approximate the softmax vector by this general form of the Beta distribution to construct the normality scores. Moreover, we use the Maximum Likelihood to estimate the parameters of the proposed distribution. To show the power and the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments of detecting anomalies in various public datasets.

  abstract  = {Anomaly detection aims to detect data that do not conform to regular patterns, and such data is also called outliers. The anomalies to be detected are often tiny in proportion, containing crucial information, and are suitable for application scenes like intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault diagnosis, e-commerce platforms, et al. However, in many realistic scenarios, only the samples following normal behavior are observed, while we can hardly obtain any anomaly information. To address such problem, we propose an anomaly detection method GALDetector which is combined of global and local information based on observed normal samples. The proposed method can be divided into a three-stage method. Firstly, the global similar normal scores and the local sparsity scores of unlabeled samples are computed separately. Secondly, potential anomaly samples are separated from the unlabeled samples corresponding to these two scores and corresponding weights are assigned to the selected samples. Finally, a weighted anomaly detector is trained by loads of samples, then the detector is utilized to identify else anomalies. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three categories of real-world datasets from diverse domains, and experimental results show that our method achieves better performance when compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {Injuries during the practice of sports in gymnasiums have been reported, and one of the causes of injuries is due to environmental factors as tiny wood splinters on the gymnasium floor. Although it is important to regularly inspect gymnasium floors, it is difficult for humans to inspect the entire gymnasium floor, as it is done manually and visually, and requires a lot of time and manpower. We have developed an automatic inspection system to detect tiny splinters on the gymnasium floor. The system attaches cotton to tiny splinters and detects the attached cotton by using an image processing technique. Using this system, the entire gymnasium floor can be inspected automatically by using simply creating a 2D map. After the inspection, the system can show where splinters are located on the map. In this paper, the method for detecting splinters attached to cotton using deep learning object detection-YOLO was proposed. The detection ratio of the proposed method was improved by 25.0\% compared to the conventional method of threshold color segmentation process. In an inspection of an entire gymnasium, the proposed method detected 33 markers and was able to detect splinters that could cause injury.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes an automatic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based bird droppings detection, localization, and cleaning method on large PV power plant. An automated flight route is first created, and use an UAV to fly over the solar farm to capture images of the solar panels. The captured images are then stitched together to create a high-resolution orthomosaic image of the solar farm, which enables to precisely locate the bird droppings on the solar farm. An improved YOLOv7-based model is proposed to detect the bird droppings because they are quite small in comparison to the stitched image. Then, using the ground sample distance, we calculate the distance between each of the bird droppings and the drone&#39;s takeoff point, which is used to clean the bird droppings from the solar panel. Last, the proposed model is verified by high-resolution orthomosaic images and the experimental outcomes unequivocally show that it is successful for detecting and cleaning of bird droppings on PV farms.},

However, deriving controller parameters for complex and nonlinear systems is challenging and time-consuming. To facilitate automatic controller parametrization, this work presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with N-dimensional B-spline geometries (BSGs). We focus on the control of parameter-variant systems, a class of systems with complex behavior which depends on the operating conditions. For this system class, gain-scheduling control structures are widely used in applications across industries due to well-known design principles. Facilitating the expensive controller parametrization task regarding these control structures, we deploy an DRL agent. Based on control system observations, the agent autonomously decides how to adapt the controller parameters. We make the adaptation process more efficient by introducing BSGs to map the controller parameters which may depend on numerous operating conditions. To preprocess time-series data and extract a fixed-length feature vector, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Furthermore, this work contributes actor regularizations that are relevant to real-world environments which differ from training. Accordingly, we apply dropout layer normalization to the actor and critic networks of the truncated quantile critic (TQC) algorithm. To show our approach&#39;s working principle and effectiveness, we train and evaluate the DRL agent on the parametrization task of an industrial control structure with parameter lookup tables.},

Multiple wafer types, multiple robots, and wafer residency time constraints make the resulting scheduling problems challenging. This work focuses on scheduling a single-arm multicluster tool to process two wafer types concurrently subject to wafer residency time constraints in which a conventional one-wafer cycle and backward strategy are not efficient. With such properties, several necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to check the feasibility of a periodic schedule. Polynomial-time-complex algorithms are proposed to examine a tool&#39;s schedulability and coordinate multiple robots to handle wafers for schedulable scenarios.

  abstract  = {This paper is concerned with control design methods via a new Lyapunov function for fuzzy descriptor systems. Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy descriptor model, that can represent nonlinear systems, are divided into two families: one with same membership functions in both sides of fuzzy systems and another with different membership functions in right and left side of fuzzy systems. Although many papers propose control designs for the above two systems that are derived from Lyapunov stability theory, they are very conservative because they use a Lyapunov function including a single Lyapunov matrix. In this paper, to design less conservative conditions, we propose new Lyapunov functions with all Lyapunov matrices that are multiple. Finally, numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract  = {Adaptive high-rise buildings use multiple sensor systems, actuators integrated into the structure, and a control unit in order to actively counteract external disturbances. In civil engineering, a distinction is made between static loads such as snow, and dynamic loads, e.g. wind and earthquakes. These result in two control objectives, each of which is achieved by a separate controller. A static load compensation method is employed to minimize static displacements, while a model predictive controller induces additional damping into the structure to suppress structural vibrations. Here, both controllers use the same set of actuators with limited forces. This paper presents an investigation of the control input requirement for static load compensation and vibration damping. An algorithm for optimal control input distribution over the different control objectives is implemented to achieve good performance of the overall system. The method is tested in simulations considering a wind disturbance. By applying the introduced control strategy, the closed loop achieves a performance improvement of 14\% with regard to the building&#39;s displacements and velocities compared to the application of solely a model predictive controller.},

  abstract  = {Two-dimensional (2D) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using a LIDAR is a method used to track the position and orientation of a moving platform. 2D-SLAM assumes that the platform translates in a 2D plane and can only rotate about an axis perpendicular to that plane. However, the assumption of no out-of-plane (OOP) motion does not hold true for platforms experiencing motion in six degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF), such as wearable technologies that have no 3D LIDAR. This paper proposes a new algorithm, called the Level Plane for SLAM (LPS) for removing OOP motion from 2D-LIDAR scans generated on platforms experiencing 6-DOF without requiring scan-matching in 3D. Like other existing methods, an IMU is combined with a 2D-LIDAR to determine the platform&#39;s orientation, capture OOP motion, and generate a scan in $3\mathrm{D}$ . Unlike other methods, OOP motion is removed by projecting scans onto a globally stabilized coordinate frame in $2\mathbf{D}$ where both scan matching and map alignment take place. The proposed algorithm is validated over a series of experiments with different levels of induced and observed OOP motion. Experimental results show that LPS is able to handle more OOP motion than other algorithms and run in real-time.},

The desired trajectories are known only by a subset of agents, named leaders: the other agents, the followers, are required to estimate the desired trajectories based on a dynamic consensus scheme. Then, the desired trajectories to be tracked by each agent are computed from the estimated trajectories for the centroid and the formation and a simple local control loop is adopted to track the former. Stability and performance are analyzed and experiments are run on Robotarium platform to show the effectiveness of the approach and the effect of different parameters on the achieved performance.},

The largest difficulty in the inverse hysteresis compensation mechanism lies in that its parameters are hard to determine. To obviate such obstruction, the unknown hysteresis parameters are estimated online by the adaptive techniques together with uncertain system parameters. Thus, hysteresis effects as well as parameter uncertainties can both be suppressed without the time-consuming off-line identification. Meanwhile, the tracking differentiator is utilized to solve ?explosion of complexity? problem in backstepping control by calculating the derivatives of the virtual control laws. Based on the Lyapunov stability analysis, it has been revealed that the boundedness of all the system signals is achieved and the tracking error along with estimation errors can all converge to an compact set around zero. Contrastive simulations are performed to demonstrate the theoretical findings of this control algorithm.},

The raw MEG data is initially transformed into their time-frequency representation, which are then used as inputs to MEGNet3D. Both magnetometer and gradiometer recordings have been investigated separately. The proposed model exhibits an accuracy of over 75\% for most classification conditions. Thus, MEGNet3D is capable of handling high subject variability and shows that spectral-temporal representation of resting-state MEG data yields relevant neural markers related to the existence of ALS.

  abstract  = {Personalized patient representation learning (PPRL) is a critical element in clinical risk prediction. It aims to obtain a complete portrait of each patient based on Electronic Health Records (EHR). Although existing works have achieved remarkable progress in healthcare prediction, there are still three major issues. First, feature correlation is crucial for risk prediction, but it has not yet been fully exploited by existing works. Second, variation pattern of dynamic feature contains useful information about patient&#39;s physical status, but adaptive pattern recognition is still a challenge. Third, existing works usually adopt a two-stage embedding process to process each dimension of the EHR data. However, some useful low-level information for PPRL will be lost. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a fine-grained PPRL architecture named FG RL- N et for clinical risk prediction based on EHR. Specifically, we propose a Medical Feature Correlation Detection Module (FCM) to effectively learn the feature correlations for each patient and a Temporal Variation Pattern Recognition Module (TVM) to effectively detect the variation patterns of each dynamic feature. Moreover, we design a Fine-Grained Representation Mechanism (FGRM) to preserve the low-level information (from both feature and visit dimensions) useful for risk prediction. In addition, in the stage of data preprocessing, We utilize generic medical classification knowledge to classify numerical dynamic data. We conduct the in-hospital mortality experiment and the decompensation experiment on a real-world dataset. The experiment results show that the FGRL-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold significant potential for improving the lives of children with severe physical disabilities, however research must prioritize user-centered approaches and real-world applications to maximize benefits. This paper examines the integration of home-based BCIs for children with quadriplegic cerebral palsy through user-centered design, focusing on the feasibility, usability, and impact on personal goals and activities of daily living. Seven children aged 6–15 years with quadriplegic cerebral palsy and their families participated in this pilot study, using personalized BCI packages and home-based virtual sessions to help them achieve individualized goals in self-care, productivity, and leisure. We utilized a collaborative goal-setting approach and assessed satisfaction and performance changes using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the BCI-adapted Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (e-QUEST2.0). Significant improvements in performance and satisfaction were observed in the COPM scores, while parents were most satisfied with professional services and least satisfied with the adjustability of the BCI system, as per the eQuest2.0 questionnaire. Despite no significant improvement in BCI consistency across nine sessions, the intervention positively impacted participants&#39; perceived performance and satisfaction in goal-oriented activities. Future research should focus on enhancing BCI design, comfort, and effectiveness while considering user priorities and feedback for personalized goal achievement.},

An innovative verification technique of a Petri net-based system is oriented toward practical applications, and can detect errors at the early design and modelling stage. The idea is illustrated by a real-life case study of supporting decision making in AM technology adoption affecting supply chain management (SCM). Two main issues are addressed. Firstly, making optimal decisions about AM technology requires models rarely possessed within a company. Therefore, this work proposes a model supporting the decision making related to the implementation of AM technology, based on a Petri net, by utilizing its main advantages: graphical modelling, and strong mathematical support of formal verification techniques. Contrary to the most popular analysis methods (which are bounded exponentially in a general case), it is proved that the presented method is bounded by a cubic polynomial with net size. Secondly, an investment in AM technology is often financially assessed and does not affect other processes, as in our SCM case. Hence, strong connectivity within the proposed Petri net-based model is examined.},

The continual use of EMG-based interfaces gradually alters signal characteristics owing to electrode shift and muscle fatigue, leading to a gradual decline in classification accuracy. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach for adaptive EMG pattern classification using semi-supervised sequential learning. The proposed method uses a Bayesian classification model based on Gaussian distributions to predict the motion class and estimate its confidence. Pseudo-labels are subsequently assigned to data with high-prediction confidence, and the posterior distributions of the model are sequentially updated within the framework of Bayesian updating, thereby achieving adaptive motion recognition to alterations in signal characteristics over time. Experimental results on six healthy adults demonstrated that the proposed method can suppress the degradation of classification accuracy over time and outperforms conventional methods. These findings demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach and its applicability to practical EMG-based control systems.},

We consider the problem of allocating two of four indivisible items to each of two players, where the only known preference information is each player&#39;s strict ranking of the items. How is the rank correlation of preferences, as measured by Kendall Tau, related to properties that facilitate fair allocation such as the availability of envy-free, Pareto-optimal, maximin, and max BordaSum allocations? We also examine the relationship between the ranked correlation and features of Fallback Bargaining such as the depth of agreement and the probability of a (two-way) tie. We further categorize the players into two types, risk-averse and risk-acceptant, and analyze how player type affects various fair division properties. Our results suggest that increasing similarity of preferences tends to increase the number of Pareto-optimal and maximin allocations but to decrease the number of envy-free allocations. Higher rank correlation also makes Fallback Bargaining less compelling. Understanding how similarity of preference rankings influences the trade-offs among allocation properties gives new insight into the difficulties of fair allocation of indivisible items.},

Thus, social-aware motion planning and control while considering interactions with HDVs on the road is critical for AVs&#39; deployment and safe driving under various maneuvers. Previous research mostly focuses on the trajectory planning of AVs using Model Predictive Control or other relevant methods, while seldom considering the integrated planning and control of AVs altogether to simplify the whole pipeline architecture. Furthermore, there are very limited studies on social-aware driving that makes AVs understandable and expected by human drivers, and none when it comes to the challenging maneuver of driving through roundabouts. To fill these research gaps, this paper develops an integrated social-aware planning and control algorithm for AVs&#39; driving through roundabouts based on Driving Risk Field (DRF), Social Value Orientation (SVO), and Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC), i.e., DRF-SVO-MPCC. The proposed method is tested and verified with simulation on the open-sourced highway-env platform. Compared with the baseline method using purely Nonlinear Model Predictive Control, the DRF-SVO-MPCC can achieve better performance under various maneuvers of driving through roundabouts with and without surrounding HDVs.},

However, the consumer adoption of home charging stations (HCSs), which are considered key drivers of EV deployment, is often ignored. By modeling a two-sided market of EVs and PCSs (i.e., indirect network effects) under the adoption of HCSs, this study explores the EV diffusion process and considers effective strategies for its spread. We examine two cases: in the first, consumer adoption is determined exogenously; in the second, it is determined endoge-nously. In each case, we vary the strength of the indirect network effects, which correspond to the drivers&#39; concern, referred to as “range anxiety.” Through numerical simulations, we evaluate the market shares of EVs, HCSs, and PCSs, as well as social welfare. Our findings have strategic implications for policymakers seeking to increase the market share of EV s in the presence of different types of charging stations without negative social impacts.},

  abstract  = {An evacuation navigation model incorporating a fire&#39;s detrimental effect on evacuees&#39; escape capability is presented. Fire is one of the most common hazards in buildings that severely impacts evacuees&#39; escape capability. A fire dynamics model is used to simulate dynamics of a fire at various locations in a building. An index, called Capability Deterioration Rate (CDR), is introduced to model how fire effluents, such as smoke, heat, and toxic gases, impact escape capability spatiotemporally. This index is incorporated into a modified Dijkstra algorithm by changing weights of navigation edges. An agent-based model taking into account the fire dynamics and escape capability is used to simulate an agent&#39;s evacuation from a location to minimize the total travel cost from the location to an egress door. A three-floor building is used as a case study to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed model can be used to evaluate and select the best navigation plan in terms of escape capability under various fire scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Conventional classification approaches for EEG- based emotion recognition cannot often adapt to different domains, such as cross-subject or cross-dataset scenarios, leading to poor performance. To handle this challenge, we introduce a novel fusion method using a combination of multiple domain adaptation techniques to improve the emotional states in EEG datasets via classification accuracy. For this aim, Our proposed approach exploits domain adaptation approaches such as Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), Correlation Alignment (CORAL), Transfer Joint Matching (TJM), Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK), and Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA), to enhance the overall classification performance. Later, a new fusion approach called Multiple Domain Adaptation based on a Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MDA-NF) is applied to combine the classifiers using proper fuzzy membership functions and deliver maximum separation between classes. The main contribution is by applying the fusion approach using MDA- NF technique, adaptability is sufficiently enhanced. Another advantage is to employ multiple adaptation techniques that improve separation between classes. In experimental test results conducted with cross-subject and cross-dataset scenarios, the MDA-NF approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy for both the valence and arousal aspects, as observed in two public DEAP and DREAMER datasets.},

  abstract  = {Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) is a neural source signal that is extensively used in neuroengineering due to its non-invasive nature and ease of collection. However, a drawback to the use of EEG is the prevalence of physiological artifacts generated by eye movements and eye blinks that contaminate the brain signals. Previously, we have proposed and validated an H ∞ -based Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) technique for the real-time identification, learning and removal of eye blinks, eye motions, amplitude drifts and recording biases from EEG simultaneously. However, the standard electroocu-lography (EOG) electrode configuration requires four electrodes for EOG measurement, which limits its applicability for reduced-channel mobile applications, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Here, we assess multiple configurations with varying number of EOG electrodes and compare the ANC effectiveness of these configurations to the ideal four-electrode configuration. From an analysis of the root mean squared error (RMSE) and differences in signal to noise ratios (SNR) between the ideal four-electrode case and the alternative configurations, it is reported that several three-electrode alternative configurations were effective in essentially replicating the ability to remove EOG artifacts in an experimental cohort of ten healthy subjects. For nine subjects, it was shown that only two to three EOG electrodes were needed to achieve similar performance as compared to the four-electrode case. This study demonstrates that the typical four-electrode configuration for EOG recordings for adaptive noise cancellation of ocular artifacts may not be necessary; by using the proposed new EOG configurations it is possible to improve electrode allocation efficiency for EOG measurements in mobile EEG applications.},

Previous studies on EEG channel selection have not considered the influence of genders despite long-standing belief in gender differences with respect to emotion analysis. In this paper, we collected EEG signals from 20 subjects containing 10 males and 10 females by letting them watch short emotional videos. Then, to reduce data redundancy, we propose an enhanced genetic algorithm to select the optimal channel subsets separately for male and female subjects by incorporating a novel evolution operation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracy in terms of emotion recognition than several compared methods with a smaller channel subset. Besides, experimental results also indicate that the gender differences in neural patterns indeed exist. Through this study, the gender-sensitive channel selection offers a new avenue for further development of EEG based emotion recognition.},

A within-subjects study was conducted in which the robot performed attention-recapturing behavior during a learning task under two conditions; either in an adaptive manner whenever a lapse in the user&#39;s engagement level was detected by the BCI system (Adaptive condition) or at random intervals regardless of the user&#39;s mental states (Random condition). In both conditions, users completed an information retention test following the interaction. The study found no significant difference in the postinteraction test results or mean EEG Engagement Index values between the Adaptive and Random conditions. However, analysis of 10-sec time windows following robot interventions showed that adaptively timed gestures were significantly more effective in restoring user engagement to optimal level compared to randomly timed gestures. This finding provides evidence for the potential of passive BCIs in improving user experience in pedagogical HRI settings.},

Previous studies have reported a notable effect of machine reliability on the 6 factors of the CWL. However, it remains unclear whether this effect can be detected in cognitive processes. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used technique to explore cognitive processes by recording brain activities as signals. Therefore, we utilized the event-related spectral power (ERSP) feature of EEG signals to determine the cognitive processes regarding the effect of machine reliability. The results revealed that machine reliability affected the CWL factor of performance which was reflected in the $y$ band activities of the right prefrontal cortex. The findings indicate the potential of cognitive processes in detecting the effect of machine reliability. The detection could pave the way for designing adaptive BMI to balance the machine reliability and the CWL.},

We have developed a composite system called Mind Indriya that can unobtrusively measure cognitive load (CL), anxiety and visual attention using a combination of frugal sensors like wrist wearable and webcam. The accuracies of each of the individual algorithms have been proven with cognitive load at accuracy 69.5\%, anxiety at accuracy of 86\% and the detection of eye blinks as an index of visual attention at $F_{score}$ of 0.91. Moreover, our system is person and task independent while state-of-the-art techniques are either task dependent or requires heavy personalization. The proposed system can be used in various real life applications like a) neuro-marketing - to understand how customer behavior towards new products or advertisement, b) online learning - to personalize contents or understand the learning outcome, c) Website/user interface design - to understand the effect of the new design on people&#39;s cognitive load, affect and attention span and therefore how effective the design is and so on.},

Previous studies showed that the wearable cyborg HAL trunk-unit improved their gait disturbances through only an autonomous sway control that provided lateral swing with constant frequency. To promote the improvement by establishing interactive Bio-Feedback loop, it is necessary to realize synchronization between the wearer&#39;s intention and gait states for stabilizing gait, i.e. reducing variation of gait cycle. In this study, we developed a voluntary control method that responded to an intentional change in gait cycle and a method that switched 2 kinds of controls including the voluntary control method and the autonomous sway control method for stabilizing gait. The voluntary swing control method synchronized the HAL&#39;s force with wearer&#39;s gait in a stable gait state less prone to FOG. The autonomous sway control method provided lateral swing with constant frequency as feedback to the patients to achieve a gait state less prone to FOG. These controls were switched according to the gait stability calculated by wearer&#39;s gait cycle. Through the gait experiments with an abled-body participant, we confirmed that the HAL&#39;s lateral cyclic sway synchronized with the participant&#39;s gait and each control switched based on a gait stability.

  abstract  = {Accurate lesion segmentation on breast ultrasound (BUS) images is a crucial procedure in computer-aided ultrasonic diagnosis. Owing to the privacy of BUS data and the complexity of acquiring pixel-level labels, numerous researches attempt to achieve breast lesion segmentation with predefined feature-based and deep learning-based methods in a unsuper-vised or weakly supervised scenario. Although the former can typically extract more reliable contour information of the lesion, it is severely interfered by irrelevant tissues due to its inability to capture any semantic information. Furthermore, the weakly supervised deep learning segmentation based on class activation map (CAM) can explore the semantic information while failing to provide precise contour information. In view of the above observation, we present a weakly supervised framework merging complementary contour and semantic information for early lesion segmentation in BUS images. Specifically, guided by the prior knowledge of breast anatomy, we first extract and filter the contour information of suspected lesions located in breast parenchyma layer by clustering and morphological characteristic, respectively. Afterward, semantic information extraction is performed by a classification network to automatically explore the category information of the lesion. Finally, we selectively fuse the complementary information to facilitate lesion segmentation performance with more comprehensive features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the public dataset BUSI, and the results confirm the validity of our approach.},

Our research aimed to enhance the understanding of individual responses and identify a potential objective function based on electrocortical activity. We found that electrocortical responses show more individual variability than muscle activations, emphasizing the need for personalized cortical optimization to maximize exoskeleton assistance.

The participants were instructed to walk at their preferred walking speed, but some of them showed a slight decrease in cadence and an increase in stride length during assisted walking. Particularly, participants with average cadence tended to increase their stride length when assisted. Furthermore, the participants with higher knee extensor muscle tended to improve their propulsive force during assisted walking. The experiment result showed changes in gait specific to the assistive robot and their relationship to the user&#39;s physical ability and gait characteristics.},

  abstract  = {The imbalance between the supply and demand of healthcare resources is a global challenge, which is particularly severe in developing countries. Governments and academic communities have made various efforts to increase healthcare supply and improve resource allocation. However, these efforts often remain passive and inflexible. Alongside these issues, the emergence of the parallel healthcare system has the potential to solve these problems by unlocking the data value. The parallel healthcare system comprises Medicine-Oriented Operating Systems (MOOS), Medicine-Oriented Scenario Engineering (MOSE), and Medicine-Oriented Large Models (MOLMs), which could collect, circulate, and empower data. In this paper, we propose that achieving equilibrium in medical resource allocation is possible through parallel healthcare systems via data empowerment. The supply-demand relationship can be balanced in parallel healthcare systems by (1) increasing the supply provided by digital and robotic doctors in MOOS, (2) identifying individual and potential demands by proactive diagnosis and treatment in MOSE, and (3) improving supply-demand matching using large models in MOLMs. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present a case study optimizing resource allocation from the perspective of facility accessibility. Results demonstrate that the parallel healthcare system could result in up to 300\% improvement in accessibility.},

The parallel architecture on M2OS is proposed, including the parallel interactive actual M2OS and artificial M2OS. Among them, the artificial M2OSs provide digital infrastructures for organizations to operate, collaborate, and make decisions in the virtual space, and conduct computational experiments to evaluate management decisions and predict future states of the actual M2OS. Through parallel execution and closed-loop feedback between the artificial and actual M2OSs, the management and control, experimentation and evaluation, as well as learning and training of the actual M2OS can be realized. Moreover, the functional layers of M2OS, including the infrastructure layer, data layer, scenario layer, modeling layer, decision layer, and application layer, are discussed. These layers work together to support the intelligent, autonomous, collaborative, and adaptive nature of the M2OS, and facilitate data-driven decision-making, optimize business operations, and empower managers with real-time actionable insights. The proposed M2OS paradigm has great potential to transform the management paradigm and opens up new possibilities for intelligent and collaborative decision-making.},

  abstract  = {Inspired by a common behaviour pattern from the dog-human relationship, we present a behaviour model combined with a method for controlling a real mobile robot, effectively realizing physical Human-Object-Robot Interaction. Translating social behaviours from the dog-human relationship into social robots has been already found to be a viable way. Playing, a cardinal behaviour element in the dog-human relationship, turned out to be one of the highest priority factors in forming a successful and lasting relationship between dogs and humans. Accordingly, we modeled the playing behavior when a human repeatedly initiates playing with a dog by picking up and throwing an object (toy), expecting the dog to go for the object and bring it back to the person throwing it, commonly known as playing fetch. We also developed a robot control system able to execute the commands from the behaviour model, and for gathering the poses of the participants in the real physical space we have used the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get Indoor Localization (WIL) system. The integration of these components allowed us to create a social robotics system able to offer real physical human-object-robot interaction fast enough to be enjoyable for human participants, as a tool to be used in future HRI experiments, which was our main goal. The proposed behaviour model is intended to be embedded into social robots with the purpose of applying it in e.g. therapy, child-rearing, child-robot interaction scenarios, human behaviour assessment, recreational or entertainment scenarios.},

  abstract  = {With the rapidly growing use of Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), which can exponentially increase the system complexity, the problem of planning a mission for MASs became more intricate. In some MASs, human operators are still involved in various decision-making processes, including manual mission planning, which can be an ineffective approach for any non-trivial problem. Mission planning and re-planning can be represented as a combinatorial optimization problem. Computing a solution to these types of problems is notoriously difficult and not scalable, posing a challenge even to cutting-edge solvers. As time is usually considered an essential resource in MASs, automated solvers have a limited time to provide a solution. The downside of this approach is that it can take a substantial amount of time for the automated solver to provide a sub-optimal solution. In this work, we are interested in the interplay between a human operator and an automated solver and whether it is more efficient to let a human or an automated solver handle the planning and re-planning problems, or if the combination of the two is a better approach. We thus propose an experimental setup to evaluate the effect of having a human operator included in the mission planning and re-planning process. Our tests are performed on a series of instances with gradually increasing complexity and involve a group of human operators and a metaheuristic solver based on a genetic algorithm. We measure the effect of the interplay on both the quality and structure of the output solutions. Our results show that the best setup is to let the operator come up with a few solutions, before letting the solver improve them.},

This so-called physical human-machine interaction (HMI) is useful to consider during the development of new products like tools, cars or aircrafts, in order to increase comfort and safety. In this work, the Modelica Human Body Library is presented first. It is the only digital human mode (DHM) for physical HMI available in the multi-domain modeling language Modelica so far. The model considers the human body dynamics as well as the motor control of the limbs. A special feature of the model is the human inspired control scheme, which takes into account effects such as human reaction time and limb stiffness adaption. After an introduction to the DHM, its capabilities are evaluated by comparing simulation results with experimental data from a experimental study. In the study, different unstable force fields were applied to the hands of subjects as they approached a target. The resulting hand trajectories were measured. As many control tasks for humans, especially while using tools, are characterized by unstable behavior, this study is well suited to evaluate a DHM. Comparison with the experimental data shows that the resulting hand trajectories in the simulation are comparable to the ones the subjects produced due to the force fields. This applies for both, the initial tries with big deviations as well as the tries after the subjects adapted their arm stiffness to the force field.},

Additionally, tiny objects in the image contain minimal information, making them difficult to distinguish from the background. To overcome these two challenges, we proposed a network architecture that aims to improve the accuracy of tiny object detection in drone images. Specially, we designed a tiny object detector(TOD) that can effectively extract features of tiny objects and distinguish between tiny object features and image background. Furthermore, this TOD module contains a Convolutional Visual Attention Network (CVAN) to better focus on the regions of tiny objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves mAP@.5 accuracy of 53.9\% on the VisDrone2021-test-dev dataset and improves by 2.8\% compared to YOLOv7.},

It doesn&#39;t require retaining gradients during optimization, thus greatly reducing memory allocation compared to SGD backpropagation (BP) methods. Compared to other target projection methods, tpSGD generalizes the concept to arbitrary local layer-wise loss functions.

  abstract  = {Selecting an optimal recommendation method is crucial for an electronic commerce (EC) site. However, the effectiveness of recommendation methods cannot be known in advance. Although continuous comparative evaluation in an actual environment is essential, it results in opportunity loss. To overcome this problem, opportunity loss reduction has been studied as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and adaptive meta-recommender systems (meta-RS) were devised to automatically and continuously select the best recommendation method according to a policy. The following three factors cause opportunity loss: the context of the recommendation method, temporal variation, and response time. However, studies are yet to formulate an MAB policy that considers all three factors. Thus, reducing opportunity loss remains a problem. We propose an MAB policy that considers all three causes of opportunity loss by using a Kalman filter for a linear Gaussian state space model. We conducted extensive experiments to select the best recommendation method using data from a real EC site. The results revealed that the proposed policy is highly effective for reducing opportunity loss of the meta-RS during evaluation and increasing cumulative clicks compared with baseline policies.},

Most of the studies in the literature assume that the underlying information field is Gaussian, and therefore, Gaussian Process (GP)-based models are extremely popular. Furthermore, we have found that due to the inherent computational complexity of such naive GP-based techniques, most studies in the literature do not scale well beyond small-size environments, i.e., where the number of informative points $n &amp;lt; 1000$ . These render such a predictive model more or less useless in many practical applications. In this paper, we posit that a different technique, Generative Adversarial Network-based inpainting, for robotic information gathering can be useful. The state-of-art inpainting techniques 1) do not assume that the underlying data is Gaussian, and 2) easily scale to $n\gg 1000$ . Thus, they eliminate the two bottlenecks posed by the GP-based solutions. We have tested our hypothesis on a synthetic and a real-world crop dataset. Results show that while the inpainting technique easily scales to $1024\times 1024$ , GP-based predictions cannot. On the other hand, their solution qualities are shown to be comparable.},

Current research shows that the pathogenic factors of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be caused by the abnormal connection between brain network structures. In order to find out the pathogenic factors of ADHD patients, we also carried out frequent sub-graph mining on the connectivity graph data of brain functional network. By constantly adjusting the sup-port threshold, all the subgraphs of ADHD patients and healthy control group were mined, and the differences in brain region connectivity were successfully found out. By combining the recently introduced neural document embedding model with traditional pattern mining techniques, we regard the brain network connection structure graph as the document and frequent subgraph as the atomic unit of the embedding process. By learning the mapping, each graph can be mapped to a D-dimensional continuous vector. The mapping needs to capture the similarity between the graphs. Feature vectors can be used as the direct input of graph classification in many traditional machine learning methods. Finally, support vector machine in machine learning is used to verify the accuracy of classification, and the results show that the accuracy is high.},

  abstract  = {Active semantic mapping is essential for service robots to quickly capture both the map of an environment and its spatial meaning, while also minimizing the burden on users during robot operation and data collection. SpCoSLAM, a method of semantic mapping with place categorization and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), is well suited to environmental adaptation, as it is not limited to predefined labels. However, SpCoSLAM presents two issues that increase the burden on users: 1) users struggle to efficiently determine a destination for the robot&#39;s quick adaptation, and 2) providing instructions to the robot becomes repetitive and cumbersome. To address these challenges, we propose Active-SpCoSLAM, which enables the robot to actively explore uncharted areas and employs CLIP for image captioning to provide a flexible vocabulary that replaces human instructions. The robot determines its actions by calculating information gain integrated from both semantics and SLAM uncertainties. We conducted experiments in a simulated environment, comparing the proposed method to other methods in terms of efficiency and applicability to object discovery tasks. Additionally, we tested the proposed method, which combines user instruction and CLIP, in a real environment. Our results demonstrated that the robot explored its environment with approximately five fewer iterations and 11 minutes faster compared to the case of random exploration. Moreover, our method achieved a higher success rate in object discovery tasks during earlier stages of learning compared to other methods. In conclusion, the proposed method rapidly covers an environment while gathering useful data for object discovery tasks, thus reducing the burden on users and enhancing the robot&#39;s adaptability.

  abstract  = {Mobile edge computing (MEC), as a promising paradigm, delivers computation and storage capacities at the edge of the network. It supports delay-sensitive services for mobile users (MUs). However, dynamic and stochastic characteristics of MEC networks necessitate constant migration of installed services across edge servers to keep up with the mobility of MUs. As a result, the cost of maintaining the network increases significantly. Existing studies of MEC rarely consider the cost of service migration due to MU mobility. To minimize the long-term cost for microservices in a hybrid cloudedge system comprising of MUs, small base stations (SBSs), and a cloud data center (CDC), the total cost minimization is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. To solve it, this work designs a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called Multi-swarm Grey-wolf-optimizer based on Genetic-learning (MGG), which effectively combines strong local search capabilities of grey wolf optimizer with superior global search capabilities of genetic algorithm. MGG simultaneously optimizes service request routing among MUs, SBSs, and CDC, CPU speeds of SBSs, service deployment of SBSs, service migration cost of SBSs, as well as MUs&#39; transmission power and channel bandwidth allocation. Simulation results with Google cluster trace demonstrate that MGG outperforms several state-of-the-art peers with respect to the overall cost of the hybrid system.},

  abstract  = {Efficient and accurate identification of network anomalies is of great significance to the construction of network security systems in the information age. It is highly challenging to accurately detect abnormal behaviors in the increasing network data. Currently, classification methods based on feature extraction of autoencoders have been proven to be suitable for network anomaly detection. However, traditional detection models with autoencoders have poor detection accuracy in the face of massive network features. In addition, the hyperparameter optimization of their models cannot be effectively solved. For network anomaly detection, this work proposes a new network anomaly detection method named SAXP, which integrates Stacked sparse shrink Autoencoders and a XGBoost model based on genetic simulated annealing Particle swarm optimization (GSPSO). Specifically, features extracted by stacked sparse shrink autoencoders are introduced into the XG Boost model for classification, and GSPSO is used to optimize the hyperparameters of XGBoost. Experimental results based on two real-life data sets demonstrate that the proposed SAXP achieves higher recognition accuracy than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Vehicle trajectory prediction is essential in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles (AVs), as it enables highly efficient collision avoidance, path planning, and traffic control. However, existing models for vehicle trajectory prediction predominantly focus on limited driving scenarios, resulting in limited applicability. To address this limitation, we present a novel vehicle trajectory prediction approach that employs a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, incorporating simulated environments and vehicle dynamic time series data, including longitudinal, vertical, and latitudinal position and acceleration. Our approach is distinguished by its ability to handle diverse urban driving scenarios, such as highways, roundabouts, intersections, and turns, which enhances its applicability and generalizability. We experimented and collected vehicle data from 17 drivers using a stationary driving simulator and the Euro Truck Simulator software. For the model implementation and validation, we utilized Python 3.9 and Google Colab, as well as the Scikit-learn library for Deep learning algorithms. The proposed CNN-LSTM model leverages a convolutional layer to learn local patterns and an LSTM layer to capture long-term temporal dependencies, improving performance in predicting vehicle trajectories. The experimental results demonstrate that the CNN-LSTM model provides more accurate predictions for longitudinal and lateral positions compared to traditional vehicle trajectory prediction methods that employ LSTM and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This research contributes to developing robust and reliable vehicle trajectory prediction systems vital for ADAS and AVs&#39; safe and efficient operation. The proposed approach broadens the applicability of trajectory prediction models, enabling better-informed decision-making in various driving conditions and ultimately improving road safety and efficiency in the rapidly evolving field of autonomous transportation.},

Various software reliability growth models were fitted to growth processes, and the best-fit model, which showed the minimum Akaike information criterion, was clarified for each applicant. As a result, it was shown that the individual growth processes were classified into concave and S-shaped processes. The concave and S-shaped processes were attributed to the cases where an applicant completed the training without and with wandering, respectively. Since the best-fit models included models with imperfect debugging and testing efforts these factors were discussed from the viewpoint of flight training. It was also indicated that the estimated growth models after the training can be utilized to monitor the applicant&#39;s competencies depending on operation-service flights done up to recurrent training.},

The validation test consisted of a dual task with two different tasks. As a result of the validation test, we hypothesized that there exists a one-sided state in which response delays occur in the low-priority task during the transition from the dual-task state, where the task is performed stably, to the saturation state, where all tasks are disrupted. Therefore, considering the one-sided state, we classified participants&#39; attention distribution state into four states during the dual-task and analyzed the transition of the collapse model for individual. As a result, we were able to identify the one-sided state, classify the collapse models of the dual-task into three patterns, and propose appropriate timing of intervention methods for each pattern.},

BCIs could thus benefit from cross-user data sharing, but as neurophysiological signals used in BCIs are personal health information, the protection of user privacy and data sovereignty will be of the utmost importance for end-user BCI applications. Federated learning is a novel privacy-preserving machine learning technique that decentralizes training, leaving end-user data on the device/institution of origin. In this work, we explored the feasibility of federated learning for BCIs, profiling convergence and performance for two federated learning algorithms (FedAvg and FedDC) on both identically and independently distributed (IID) and non-IID partitions of data. Federated learning for a 4-class motor imagery BCI decoding task was found to be feasible, although came at a cost of reduced performance (longer convergence rate and reduced accuracy). The FedDC algorithm, which introduces drift correction for heterogeneous data, well out-performed the FedAvg algorithm. Larger datasets with more subjects and data per subject would be beneficial for further investigations, and future work should explore federated transfer learning techniques for combating inter-subject data heterogeneity and improving global model performance.},

Inspired by this phenomenon, we explore the feasibility of manipulating EEG-based Motor Imagery (MI) Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) via perturbations in sensory stimuli. Similar to adversarial examples, these adversarial stimuli aim to exploit the limitations of the integrated brain-sensor-processing components of the BCI system in handling shifts in participants&#39; response to changes in sensory stimuli. In this paper, we first define adversarial stimuli and enumerate the characteristics of such stimuli. Second, we study the feasibility of adversarial stimuli as an attack vector in a series of human subject experiments, and report the findings on the impact of visual adversarial stimuli in the form of random partial flickers on the MI task of playing a video game. Our findings suggest that adversarial stimuli can significantly deteriorate the performance of MI BCIs across all participants, and also that such attacks are more effective in conditions with induced stress. Furthermore, we provide a preliminary analysis on the underlying dynamics of adversarial stimuli attacks by investigating the variations in Alpha, Beta, and Gamma bands. Lastly, we present a discussion on the impact of our findings, and enumerate directions of further research in this area.},

In an unknown environment, the characteristics of objects cannot be known in advance, and thus prior learning-based recognition methods such as deep reinforcement learning may not be able to cope with this situation. In this study, we construct a 3D topological map of the environment in real-time using Growing Neural Gas (GNG), which can learn 3D topological structures even for unlearned objects. However conventional GNG have the problem that they cannot generate nodes with high-density for distant objects and cannot identify whether an unknown object is static or dynamic. Therefore, by directly adding useful input data as a new node (reference vector) based on the object category labels of the winner nodes (nearest nodes) to the input vector (3D point cloud), it is possible to generate high-density topological structures even for distant objects. We proposed the Add-if-Silent rule-based GNG with Amount of Movement (AiS-GNG-AM), which can identify between static and dynamic objects based on the past amount of movement of a node. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments using a 3D dynamics simulator.},

Given that LRM is a nonlinear, non-stationary thermodynamic process, its analysis, monitoring, control, and optimization require a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of multiple interlinked laser-material interaction phenomena. Such an understanding is derived from on-line information gained from measurements made during the process by various sensors. Toward this end, this study presents a concept and recent achievement in the development of a statistical digital twin and cyber-thermophysical system towards their use to stabilize, control, and optimize the process. In particular, the digital twin statistically describes the transformation of the initial surface into the LRM topography in terms of thermodynamic transfer functions of remelting and resolidification of surface topography and bulk material. In addition, a cyber-thermophysical system was developed interconnecting the thermodynamic heat-transfer model with the laser beam position, thermal-emission distribution, and overall temperature of the laser-material interaction zone measured and synchronized on-line in space-time position coordinates. The efficiency of the developed cyber-thermophysical system was demonstrated by analyzing the surface formation and process thermodynamics during LRM of H13 tool steel. The preliminary results open new research directions in thermophysics-supported advanced analysis, monitoring, and optimization of LRM, including the implementation of artificial-intelligence methods.},

We aim to design a lightweight encrypted communication platform. Compared with a public key encryption system, our implementation costs much less hardware resource and power consumption, while providing excellent side-channel attack (SCA) protection. Besides, when there is a large burst length of data flow, two asynchronous FIFO can restore those data respectively, so our design can maintain throughput and data integrity in extreme cases.

This new controller, abbreviated as the ORFNLSTM-BLS controller, is especially proposed by combining the techniques of deep learning and broad learning method to establish an adaptive intelligent controller with an online deepest gradient descent learning algorithm to online update its weights. The ORFNLSTM-BLS controller aims to improve the performance of the ORFBLS controller by incorporating the memory of LSTM to handle time-series data more effectively. A sufficient condition of the proposed controller is established to accomplish its uniformly asymptotical stability. The effectiveness and superiority of the ORFNLSTM-BLS controller are well exemplified by carrying out one comparative simulation in comparison with a fixed-gain proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, an adaptive predictive PID controller augmented with ORFBLS (ORFBLS-APPID), and an existing ORFBLS controller in terms of two types of control performance indexes: the overall performance indexes and transient state performance indexes. The results show that the proposed ORFNLSTM-BLS controller outperforms the three existing control methods.

  abstract  = {Automated brain tumor classification is an intensively investigated problem, which recently attracted significant attention. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning represent the standard for the foundation of any recent solution. This paper proposes two simplified VGG architectures and investigates their capabilities and limitations, in comparison with state-of-the-art CNN networks deployed via transfer learning. Various parameter settings are involved in the evaluation process, including different kernel sizes, dropout rules, loss functions, etc. Networks are trained and tested on a public brain tumor classification data set consisting of 3064 images and three tumor classes (meningioma, glioma and pituitary tumor). The thorough evaluation process revealed that the proposed CNN models can achieve competitive performances with regard to state-of-the-art methods in several scenarios. The best achieved accuracy benchmarks are 98.2\% overall Dice similarity score and correct decision rate, and AUC values over 99.6\% for each of the three tumor classes.},

  abstract  = {We present a method, which incorporates knowledge awareness into the symbolic computation of discrete controllers for reactive cyber physical systems, to improve decision making about the unknown operating environment under uncertain/incomplete inputs. Assuming an abstract model of the system and the environment, we translate the knowledge awareness of the operating context into linear temporal logic formulas and incorporate them into the system specifications to synthesize a controller. The knowledge base is built upon an ontology model of the environment objects and behavioural rules, which includes also symbolic models of partial input features. The resulting symbolic controller support smoother, early reactions, which improves the security of the system over existing approaches based on incremental symbolic perception. A motion planning case study for an autonomous vehicle has been implemented to validate the approach, and presented results show significant improvements with respect to safety of state-of-the-art symbolic controllers for reactive systems.},

The proposed method addresses the issue of control time variation in the Iterative Learning Control (ILC) method, which makes it impractical for vehicle control. By controlling backlash in the angle domain, the control interval remains the same for each iteration. The backlash impact is proportional to the velocity at the end of the backlash mode. However, by bringing the reference value nearer to zero, the impact was mitigated. Additionally, the utilization of TILC enhances its resilience to sensor noise. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations and experimental results, demonstrating its practical applicability to vehicles and high accuracy in various initial conditions. This paper provides a novel approach to backlash control in-vehicle systems, contributing to the advancement of control methods for improved ride comfort and safety.},

However, generating suitable prompts that produce creative and desirable images remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method that incorporates interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) to evolve the latent array. By integrating human perception into the system, our approach enables users to search for and generate images that align with their desired specifications through interaction with the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating images that align with the users&#39; mental images from an initial image using genetic algorithms through a series of experiments. Furthermore, the results from our user studies show that our proposed method enables users to generate images that match their desired mental images with less effort and in less time compared to conventional generation methods. Overall, this study contributes to the field of text-to-image generation by introducing a human-in-the-loop approach that enhances user control and specificity in the image generation process.},

The learned similarity model can notably be used to serve recommendations. It captures a form of latent similarity that is not known to the search engine but learned from implicit user feedback. We introduce a method to create a dataset suited for similarity learning from search data. Using this dataset, we use contrastive learning and train a similarity model that outputs large scores for pairs of results that tend to receive the same attention from users and low scores otherwise. Our experiments show that BERT models and their siamese equivalents (Sentence BERT) produce meaningful similarity metrics when fine-tuned on the dataset built from search data.},

This study expands the investment discussion market to the G7 market and combines trading strategies into an innovative hybrid trading strategy to evaluate the G7 market&#39;s overall performance. As the trading strategies and markets under consideration are more inclusive, the proposed quantum-inspired algorithm with the entanglement technique can address the vast portfolio construction solution space.

Predicate embeddings were clustered to form conceptual groups and feature tokens were used to derive relation labels. In addition, we conducted a comparative study on the effects of different prompting templates. The resulting relation labels were evaluated by human annotators, which indicated that prompt-based learning, if applied appropriately, can help with deducing conceptualized relations.

Recent works propose to use representative exemplars of learnt classes, and replay the knowledge of them afterward under certain memory constraints. However, training on a fixed set of exemplars with an imbalanced proportion to the new data leads to strong biases in the trained models. In this paper, we propose an attentive knowledge replay framework to refresh the knowledge of previously learnt classes during incremental learning, which generates virtual training samples by blending between pairs of data. Particularly, we design an attention module that learns to predict the adaptive blending weights in accordance with their relative importance to the overall objective, where the importance is derived from the change of the image features over incremental phases. Our strategy of attentive knowledge replay encourages the model to learn smoother decision boundaries and thus improves its generalization beyond memorizing the exemplars. We validate our design in a standard class-incremental learning setup and demonstrate its flexibility in various settings.},

  abstract  = {Un-signalized occluded intersections are residential road intersections with narrow lanes and surrounding buildings, which are prone to traffic accidents. This work uses deep reinforcement learning to design driving strategies for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) for avoiding collision and reducing damage to electric bicycles (e-bikes) with dangerous behaviors at un-signalized occluded intersections. The conflict-avoidance behavior of e-bikes is modeled. It adopts a multi-objective reward function that considers the injury severity of e-bike riders and the driving safety and comfort of AVs. A deep deterministic policy gradient method is used to train the model to control the acceleration and steering of AVs. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of an autonomous emergency braking system and a risk-aware high-level decision strategy by simulation experiments. Experimental results show that the driving strategy can reduce the collision probability by 26.38\% on average, and the injury can be reduced by 14.05\% on average when the collision is unavoidable. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that employs reinforcement learning to model and design driving strategies for AVs conflicting with e-bikes. It can be used to improve the state of the art in AV control and safety at intersections.},

Multi-fidelity approaches have been shown as an alternative to achieve this since they are straightforward to implement and reduce the computational cost when modeling large datasets. However, they are not suited to shifting data distributions, and they remove configurations too fast. Therefore, they must be combined with other techniques. Combining multi-fidelity methods with evolutionary algorithms and island models helps to adapt better and can contribute to maintaining diversity. This paper presents a comparative analysis of 10 network topologies distributed over a generalized island model for AutoML. A dynamic migration model with multi-objective and multi-fidelity evaluation is proposed to reduce the complexity of the tasks. This proposal is compared against state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks. It was found that Hypercube, Grid 2-dim, and Grid 3-dim topologies have the best performance as they maintain a balance in the number of connections. Furthermore, these topologies were shown to be competitive against other frameworks in the state of the art.},

The satellites are assumed to be equipped with GPS receivers that obtain signals from high altitude navigation satellites, as well as relative positioning sensors based on radar, cameras, or lasers. Measurements from the latter set of sensors will aid in keeping reasonable accuracy when GPS is unavailable or unreliable and in improving estimation accuracy when GPS is available and reliable. The paper highlights that practical scenarios may present scaling challenges when applying RGMKF, which could be effectively addressed through the proper reordering of data in the measurement matrix. The proposed framework and the outlier detection scheme are evaluated through simulations that demonstrate their effectiveness in addressing challenges in state estimation of satellite formations with sensor outliers.},

This concept replicates the sensation of a long-distance fall by presenting the dropping motion to the wearer only at the start and landing of the fall in the VR space. A two-step dropping device was fabricated using an air cylinder. A two-step dropping motion was realized by combining the open/close control of the conduit with a directacting solenoid valve and pressure control with a proportional solenoid valve. In the sensitivity evaluation experiment, participants were presented with a combination of the device&#39;s operation and VR images.

  abstract  = {With the development of technology, the automation industry has gradually improved, and the application of the visual-inertial system has become increasingly prosperous. Self-driving cars and autonomous mobile robots often use the visual-inertial system as a state estimator, and their image information can be used in the artificial intelligence part to provide more information about the robot. The combination of a monocular camera and an inertial sensor has the characteristics of light weight and low power. Monocular Visual-Inertial SLAM is a system that relies on monocular cameras and inertial sensors to perform localization and mapping. Monocular Visual-Inertial SLAM restores its vector to scale with the help of known extrinsic parameter information. However, compared with other methods, it is necessary to be careful in estimating the gyroscope bias of the inertial sensor. The bias and noise of the inertial sensor will directly affect the results of pre-integration, as well as the accuracy of the visual-inertial scale recovery. This phenomenon is called scale uncertainty, which results in feature points with uncertain scale or depth, rapidly reducing the accuracy of pose estimation. This paper proposes an architecture of visual-inertial based on Structure-Scale Adaptivity. In this study, the tightly coupled residual between the structure scale and the pose is designed to provide adaptivity according to the feature conditions, providing system structure and scale constraints, and thus suppressing the problem of scale uncertainty. This study is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms and succeeds in scenarios where other algorithms have failed. It also obtains the best accuracy results in the overall test. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method on VCU-RVI and KITTI datasets, demonstrating the proposed algorithm&#39;s effectiveness and feasibility for monocular visual-inertial SLAM.},

  abstract  = {Being able to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of an engineering system is an important task in prognostics and health management. Recently, data-driven approaches to RUL predictions are becoming prevalent over model-based approaches since no underlying physical knowledge of the engineering system is required. Yet, this just replaces required expertise of the underlying physics with machine learning (ML) expertise, which is often also not available. Automated machine learning (AutoML) promises to build end-to-end ML pipelines automatically enabling domain experts without ML expertise to create their own models. This paper introduces AutoRUL, an AutoML-driven end-to-end approach for automatic RUL predictions. AutoRUL combines fine-tuned standard regression methods to an ensemble with high predictive power. By evaluating the proposed method on eight real-world and synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art hand-crafted models, we show that AutoML provides a viable alternative to hand-crafted data-driven RUL predictions. Consequently, creating RUL predictions can be made more accessible for domain experts using AutoML by eliminating ML expertise from data-driven model construction.},

  abstract  = {Data trading has been hindered by privacy concerns associated with user-owned data and the infinite reproducibility of data, making it challenging for data owners to retain exclusive rights over their data once it has been disclosed. Traditional data pricing models relied on uniform pricing or subscription-based models. However, with the development of Privacy-Preserving Computing techniques, the market can now protect the privacy and complete transactions using progressively disclosed information, which creates a technical foundation for generating greater social welfare through data usage. In this study, we propose a novel approach to modeling multi-round data trading with progressively disclosed information using a matchmaking-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) and introduce a Social Welfare-optimized Data Pricing Mechanism (SWDPM) to find optimal pricing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to model multi-round data trading with progressively disclosed information. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the SWDPM can increase social welfare 3 times by up to 54\% in trading feasibility, 43\% in trading efficiency, and 25\% in trading fairness by encouraging better matching of demand and price negotiation among traders.},

  abstract  = {This study aims to explore the potential of a reconstructive approach in detecting and analyzing hemiplegia in human walking motion using a musculoskeletal model. Hemiplegia, a neurological disorder characterized by partial paralysis of one side of the body, is a common complication of stroke that can significantly impact its victim&#39;s mobility and overall quality of life [10]. We employed a combination of surface electromyography (sEMG) and motion capture data collection techniques to study healthy individuals&#39; muscle activation and kinematics both in normal conditions and while wearing a hemiplegia simulator. The collected data were analyzed using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to decompose the muscle acti-vation into distinct muscle synergies and associated weights. We then compared the number of muscle synergies used between the healthy and simulated hemiplegia conditions to identify changes in muscle coordination patterns. Using the information obtained from the comparison, an attempt was made to construct the synergies of the hemiplegia gait from the synergies of the healthy gait by adjusting the weights. The results of this study suggest that a reconstructive approach is a feasible tool for detecting and analyzing hemi-plegia in a human walking motion. Furthermore, this study provides a framework for understanding the underlying muscle coordination patterns in hemiplegia and can serve as a basis for developing new rehabilitation strategies. This study is expected to contribute to the advancement of research in this field by providing insights into the neural control of human walking motion.},

  abstract  = {The field of artificial intelligence research has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent decades. How-ever, conventional approaches in AI research primarily depend on fixed datasets and stationary settings, which have limited applicability to real-world scenarios. In order to address this limitation, there is an increasing need to develop and study algorithms and methods for continual learning, which enables artificial systems to learn from a continuous stream of data. One of the key challenges in continual learning is to strike a balance between transfer and interference, and to identify an equilibrium solution that can effectively learn from non-stationary data. This paper presents a canonical model that is specifically designed for continual learning, utilizing the derivative of the loss function to evaluate parameter changes between tasks and achieve dynamic equilibrium. Additionally, to improve the efficiency of limited training samples in continual tasks, a feature learning method based on meta-feature disentangling is proposed. By leveraging the second derivative term of the canonical model, the parameter vector can be decoupled and meta-features can be discovered. Experimental results demon-strate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks. The validity of the proposed canonical model is further supported by these experimental results. As the demands of available settings become increasingly stringent, the advantages of disentangling meta-features become more prominent, resulting in a significant performance gap with other continual learning methods.},

  abstract  = {With the rise of AI, the recognition of Sign Language (SL) through sign-to-text has gained significance in the field of computer vision and deep machine learning. However, there are only a few medium to large open datasets available for this task, as it requires a vast dataset of thousands of signs for words/phrases in different environments, which is a time-consuming and tedious process. Furthermore, there has been very little effort towards Arabic Sign Language Recognition (ArSLR). This research paper presents the results of fine-tuning the Vision Transformer (ViT) model on a small-scale in-house dataset of ArSL. The main goal is to attain satisfactory results by utilizing minimal computing power and a small dataset involving less than 10 individuals, with only one recording made for each sign in every environment. The dataset comprises 49 classes/signs, all of which were made with two hands and belong to the Level I category in terms of popularity. To enhance the dataset, three types of augmentations - translation, shear, and rotation were employed. The ViT model, pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset, was trained on the variation of augmented datasets with 2 to 40 times samples for each original video, where the training set includes original and augmented videos of 8 volunteers and the test set includes only original videos of one particular volunteer. Experimental results reveal that the combination of rotation and shear outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 93\% on the 20 times augmented samples per class per signer dataset. We believe this study sheds light on small-scale dataset-based SLR tasks and video/action recognition in general.},

This measure greatly improves the exploring efficiency when the network are far from being fully trained; 2) State pruning and action mask measures are applied during the training. The former improves the effectiveness of the input state information, and the latter reduces unnecessary action exploring. 3) A gradually training configuration is used to make the training process more robust, where the combat adversaries are configured as the static targets, the randomly maneuver vehicles, and the Min-Max strategy vehicles respectively. The multi-UAV air combat scenarios are built up and the experiments are conducted. The results shows that these improvements have significantly improved training efficiency.},

The optimal individual is determined using the approximated fitness landscape in the low-dimensional space and subsequently mapped back to the original space using our designed rules. Furthermore, several prediction points are generated in the proximity of the optimal individual to replace certain individuals. This iterative process is repeated multiple times to accelerate the search speed of evolutionary computation (EC).

The system consists of a motion capture system and a motion learning network. The motion capture system includes an RGB-D camera and an operating glove. The position of the human operator&#39;s hand is estimated by Openpose using the RGB-D images, while the hand&#39;s posture is determined by the information captured by the glove. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a microprocessor are equipped on the glove. The IMU data is calibrated using the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) method and computed using Madgwick&#39;s algorithm. Based on the observed position and posture of the human operator&#39;s hand, a motion can be generated. This motion is then trained using the DDPG network with the Reverse Curriculum Generation (RCG) method. The network has an Actor-Critic structure and a replay experience buffer, which makes it more feasible and helps avoid overfitting. Furthermore, HER is integrated into the network to enhance convergence speed and performance. Finally, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed iHRIS enables real-time imitation of the human operator by the robot, and the imitated motion can be learned by the DDPG network.},

In case of object detection, the quantification of reliability of a particular prediction is usually given by a detection score predicted by the trained model. While a higher score indicates higher confidence, it does not reflect the actual uncertainty of the prediction considering situational variations. In this paper, the predicted detection score is converted into a true-positive rate to decide whether to accept or reject a prediction.

We characterize a global secret that composes of one or multiple states, in which each state is assigned to a security level. A state is said to be protected if any event sequence from the initial state for reaching it contains the amount of protected events equal to or greater than the required security level. In addition, we assume that the protected event labels must be recovered within a bounded of consecutive protected events (called as $K$ -protection). Our objective is to design a $K$ -protection event policy such that the protected secret state pieces satisfy a predefined protection threshold. To this end, we first construct a security automaton that integrates the system state information and its current security level, and a $K$ -protection automaton that lists all the possible protections of event sequences. Then by using the supervisor control theory technique, the valid protecting policy to enforce the security requirement is obtained. Finally, examples are used to illustrate the proposed protection method.},

In this regard, with the advent of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV), Collision Avoidance (CA) and Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) problems have been intensively studied and many cooperative and optimization-based approaches have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a double-level collision-free control system, performed by a Central Optimizer (CO) and local CAV controllers, that allows CAVs to safely cross the intersection at the same time. The CO collects data from CAVs and imposes waiting times at specific waypoints that are then used by the low-level controllers to regulate the vehicle speed. The main advantage of the presented method is that a less complex optimization problem is formulated by imposing waiting times rather than determining the speed profile. A simulation campaign conducted on Matlab shows the performance of the proposed approach.},

In this study, we introduce a coarse-to-refinement approach incorporating four novel aspects. Firstly, we leverage the properties of a principal curve (PC) to automatically fine-tune the curve shape and employ a neural network&#39;s learning ability to reduce model error. Secondly, a deep fusion learning network is utilized for the coarse segmentation step, incorporating a parallel architecture to enhance deep-learning performance. Thirdly, addressing the limitation of standard PC-based methods in determining the number of vertices automatically, we propose an automatic searching polygon tracking method using a mean shift clustering-based approach to replace the projection and vertex extension step in standard PC-based methods. Lastly, we develop an explainable mathematical map function for the kidney contour, as denoted by the neural network output (i.e., optimized vertices), which aligns well with the ground truth contour. We conducted various experiments to evaluate our method&#39;s performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in ultrasound kidney image segmentation.},

However, existing research lacks exploration of the DRL implementation for controlling neuromusculoskeletal simulators, and only a few have presented myoelectric control systems applied to the DRL-based NMMS. In this work, an off-policy DRL algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), was implemented on an upper limb NMMS with two different types of action space - direct muscle activation output and PD-based internal model, and compared their control performance. In addition, we evaluated the performance of proportional myoelectric control systems implemented on the DRL-based upper limb NMMS. The results indicate that the DRL-based NMMS can execute upper limb movements accurately, and the proportional myoelectric control system reduced the muscle activation under both types of action space. Moreover, the PD-based internal model action space shows better learning and error-tracking performance than the direct muscle activation output action space.},

With the rapid advancement of machine learning and deep learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has made considerable progress in recent years. The transformer approach has been widely used in NLP tasks with the ability of parallel processing in recurrent neural networks through the use of a self-attention mechanism. However, the excessive pursuit of accuracy leads to higher complexity in a model, and it becomes difficult to deploy such a model on mobile devices. To solve the problem of high computational cost, this research uses Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with Genetic Algorithm as the search strategy. It trains the supernet for performance evaluation to automatically design efficient architecture for different hardware platforms while considering network compression. We further reduce the size of the model with little impact on accuracy by applying K-means clustering. To show our method&#39;s effectiveness, we have deployed a model on a mobile device to perform machine translation. We use BLEU, FLOPs, and Latency as evaluation metrics. BLEU is used as an evaluation of sequence generative tasks while FLOPs and latency are used to observe whether the architecture found by the NAS is suitable for the hardware.},

However, the current DRL algorithms are often trained on a limited number of standard driving cycles, which do not necessarily represent the highly variable and diverse driving conditions encountered by HEVs in the real world. Therefore, a significant current research objective is to develop DRL methods that can adapt to new and arbitrary driving cycles. Recent studies have shown that DRL algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can better address this challenge by taking into account the temporal dependencies of environmental state. Building upon this insight, we propose an EMS based on a recurrent policy that is trained on a large number of random driving cycles to enhance the generalization of energy management strategies to arbitrary driving cycles. We evaluate the proposed method on a classic HEV, namely the Prius, and demonstrate that the recurrent policy significantly outperforms traditional DRL methods in terms of fuel economy. Furthermore, the recurrent policy is shown to be more robust and generalizable to variable driving cycles.},

According to the production characteristic of aircraft pulse-like movement in pulsating assembly lines, a material delivery model is established to minimize the time window constraint penalties and delivery costs. Due to the problem characteristics of large scale, long decision cycle and uneven distribution of tasks in time, a phased scheduling method based on an improved genetic algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the decision cycle can be divided into the aircraft moving phase and the assembling phase. Secondly, the assembling phase is subdivided into several small phases to adjust the number of used AGVs and the delivery starting time of each phase. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used within each phase to decide the delivery tasks, delivery starting time and driving paths for every AGV, which has been improved for solving the large-scale problem by optimizing the generation of initial populations and adding a local search operator. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in a practical case of an aircraft pulsating assembly line.},

  abstract  = {Road traffic accidents cause injuries, claim lives, and disrupt economic activities. It is among the key problems for intelligent transportation and smart cities. Cities, especially the mega ones, must strive for reducing accidents for public safety and sustainable growth, and the first task is to understand accidents. In this paper, we build up such understanding with the emerging explainable machine learning (ML) technique. We prepare a huge dataset with over two million accident records and use it to deliver ML models for accident modelling. Given ML models of high fidelity for mapping accident features and conditions to the accident severity, we apply several explainable ML techniques to explain the models and understand accidents. We first consider coarse granularity to capture the overall feature importance. Then we consider fine granularity methods including partial dependence plot and Shapley additive explanations. The former shows that feature impact varies at different feature values and uses a plot to reflect the impact changes. The latter puts attention to individual accident and quantifies the feature impact for the specific accident. Our core observation is that traffic accidents are often about weather, followed by location and road type. Extensive experimental study is performed to support our discussion and justify our conclusion. The deliverable of this paper offers an advanced way of understanding traffic accidents accurately in a quantitative manner and has great potential to be used for intelligent transportation and smart city applications.},

Besides, the algorithm updates the weights based on the performance of the selected policy. Compared to the static replacement policy, our algorithm is able to apply to more access patterns and achieve a high hit ratio.

It may result in poor performance when traditional object detection models are directly applied to automated driving detection. Because they usually presume fixed categories of common traffic participants, such as pedestrians and cars. Worsely, the huge class imbalance between common and novel classes further exacerbates performance degradation. To address the issues stated, we propose OpenNet to moderate the class imbalance with the Balanced Loss, which is based on Cross Entropy Loss. Besides, we adopt an inductive layer based on gradient reshaping to fast learn new classes with limited samples during incremental learning. To against catastrophic forgetting, we employ normalized feature distillation. By the way, we improve multi-scale detection robustness and unknown class recognition through FPN and energy-based detection, respectively.

  abstract  = {Recently, network architecture search has been practiced in more and more tasks, but its high cost makes it difficult for small research teams or individual researchers to follow. Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) algorithm provides an easier available solution in searching effective network architectures. Although DARTS algorithm has greatly reduced the search cost as compared with other evolution based or reinforcement learning based methods, there is still a long way to go before it is widely used, since gradient based methods consume a lot of GPU memory and its search space lacks diversity. Encouraged by the idea of progressive differentiable architecture search (P-DARTS), we propose a multi-cell progressive differentiable architecture search (MC-PDARTS) algorithm, which allows cells at different levels to learn different structures, and progressively searches the best structure for the corresponding level in each search stage. The proposed algorithm greatly enlarges the search space of the search network while reducing the memory consumption and search time in the search process, and alleviates the problem of performance collapse caused by too many skip connections which often occur in previous gradient based methods. Compared with the previous algorithms, the proposed MC-PDARTS algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with around 4-hour search on a single Nvidia GTX1080Ti GPU. In order to reduce the performance loss in the transfer process, MC-PDARTS searches directly on a large target dataset (ImageNet) without proxy tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.},

More recent approaches have considered inter-metric dependency, but have not been able to capture the complex inter-metric dynamics accurately and adaptively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dual-attentional multivari-ate time series anomaly detection framework. Our approach improves on the original Dot-Product Attention to robustly capture intra-metric dependency. Additionally, we introduce automatic graph structure learning and graph attention mechanism to adaptively capture inter-metric dependency and utilize it effectively.

  abstract  = {The remote sensing image detection task faces significant challenges, e.g. complex background, dense distribution, widely varied target scale, and diverse target directions. This paper proposes a remote sensing image Oriented object detection network (MA-Net) that integrates parallel multi-scale feature extraction and adaptive dynamic label assignment. The network is based on the FCOS object detection algorithm, which introduces a parallel multi-scale feature extraction module to enhance the model&#39;s understanding of multi-scale objects. The adaptive dynamic label assignment algorithm is introduced to enable the model to select samples that are more worthy of learning. According to the number of positive samples at different levels, hierarchical supervision reweighting is used to help the model focus on more important levels and improve detection accuracy. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets, DOTA and HRSC2016. Compared with the original FCOS algorithm, the detection accuracy of our algorithm was improved by 2.45\% and 4.44\%. And its performance is comparable to that of state-of-the-art detection methods.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous vehicles must be capable of handling the occlusion of the environment to ensure safe and efficient driving. The social occlusion inference task focuses on inferring occupancy from agent behaviors as a remedy for perceptual deficiencies. We identify visible trajectories, road context, and occlusion information as the three key environmental elements represented by vectors in our method. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel social occlusion inference approach that learns a mapping from three types of vectors to an occupancy grid map (OGM) representing the view of the ego vehicle. Specifically, vectorized inputs are encoded through the polyline encoder to aggregate vector-level features into polyline-level features. Since vehicles are constrained by the road and affected by other agents and occlusion areas, we exploit a transformer module that models the high-order social interactions of three types of polylines. Importantly, to address the inconsistency between input and output modalities and introduce prior knowledge of occlusion, occlusion queries are proposed to fuse polyline features and generate the OGM without the input of visual modality. We evaluate our approach on the INTERACTION dataset, which achieves on-par or better performance than the baselines. The ablation study demonstrates that three key elements of input can enhance the performance of our network.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to design an optimal PD control for unknown robot systems using Conditional Adversarial Generative Networks (C-GAN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) to approximate LQR PD control. This new control mechanism ensures both stability and optimal performance.

However, the black-box nature of DNNs will bring many hidden risks as in the 2D image field. In this paper, we present a preliminary evaluation on the out-of-distribution (OOD) overconfidence issue of deep point cloud classifiers, which has been proven to exist in deep 2D image classifiers, i.e., OOD inputs will lead to overconfident predictions on predefined categories. We also investigate whether a simple thresholding baseline and two modern OOD detection solutions can handle the issue by detecting OOD samples. Extensive experiments with four representative deep point cloud classifiers train/evaluate on different in/out-of-distribution point clouds validate the severity and knottiness of the OOD overconfidence issue. Our investigation will provide the groundwork for future studies on handling the OOD overconfidence issue of DNN classifiers for 3D point clouds.},

The key challenge in this setting lies in how to effectively combine features extracted from both modalities. Due to the large domain discrepancy between the image and point cloud, existing methods that use cross-modal attention to directly fuse features have increased attention on redundant information and noise from different modalities, resulting in poor feature fusion performance. Hence, by introducing multi-modal fusion transformers that use bottleneck tokens, we enabled point cloud feature to learn image feature through information bridges, leading to improved point cloud completion performance. Our method can not only benefit from RGB images, but also from sketches with less feature information but more emphasis on edge information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enhances the quality of point cloud completion and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

Most existing evolutionary multi task algorithms treat all optimization tasks equally, assuming that all tasks can be evaluated at the same time. However, in practice, the function evaluation time of different tasks varies greatly due to their distinct properties. This paper proposes to formalize this special scenario of multi task optimization as multi task optimization with non-uniform evaluation cost, and concentrates on how to effectively and efficiently solve it. For this type of problem, we propose an adaptive evolutionary multi task optimization algorithm that uses a multi-population evolutionary framework to solve multiple tasks in parallel, allocating different computational resources to different tasks. It performs effective positive knowledge transfer between different tasks, and dynamically adjusts the amount of knowledge transfer according to the survival rate of offspring and transferred individuals. To verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct experiments on artificially constructed benchmark problems fitting our proposed scenario of multi task optimization with non-uniform evaluation cost. The experimental results show the superiority of our proposed algorithm over other state-of-the-art algorithms. For the multitask optimization problem with non-uniform evaluation cost, the proposed algorithm can solve tasks efficiently within a limited budget of computational resources.},

In this work, we develop a fast, compact, accurate and robust image segmentation model for automatic thyroid segmentation in medical ultrasound images. We propose an automatic deep active contour (DAC) model based on local image characteristics, which utilizes the deep neural network model to obtain the initial contour and constructs external energy items based on the local image characteristics of contour points. Compared with the deep neural network model, the DAC model requires less training data, and the segmentation performance of the DAC model on a small dataset can reach that of the deep neural network model on a larger dataset. The proposed DAC model can be used for automatic thyroid segmentation in medical ultrasound images, which does not require massive computing resources, long training time, and large amounts of carefully labeled data.},

Some black box models have achieved expert-level accuracy on medical datasets, but these models are less adopted in clinical practice due to the lack of interpretability. In the past few years, designing interpretable models has been one of the major challenges in the medical field. The existing interpretable prototype networks only use medical images for training, ignoring the role of medical reports, and these medical reports can assist in prototype training and activation. Furthermore, existing prototype network methods neglect the position information in medical images, which is helpful for disease diagnosis. To solve these shortcomings, we propose an interpretable medical image classification framework (MProtoNet) that improves the accuracy and interpretability of disease predictions. In MProtoNet, we design a multimodal attention module and use prototype activation restriction loss to provide evidence for prototype training and activation. In addition, we design a position embedding module and multi-factor similarity calculation method to effectively utilize the position information in the image. We conducted experiments on the chest datasets MIMIC-CXR and open-I to test the model and compare it with other baseline models. Experimental results show that MProtoNet has made improvements in accuracy while preserving the interpretability of the model.},

  abstract  = {The study of medical image classification is of great importance to assist doctors in diagnosing conditions and intelligently identifying types of illnesses. However, unlike general image classification, this task is still very challenging because medical images have more complex and variable structural patterns. There are two directions currently explored: transfer learning and Transformer-based, but they have certain drawbacks. For example, transfer learning requires a large amount of annotated data support and the training process is tedious and complicated; the Transformer-based approach has the problem of high computational time complexity, which is also very time-consuming. It cannot be ignored that their representations for classification need to be enhanced. Based on the above issues, our proposed CAME consists of three feature extraction modules from different scales including local feature information, global semantic representation, and external attention, and a multi-scale feature aggregation module (MSFA). The MSFA module enhances the semantics of each of the three scales of representations through space, through the attention mechanism, and then aggregates the three enhanced representations to obtain the final representation. In the experiments, the proposed CAME performs best in the baseline on the benchmarks of the three criteria and achieves end-to-end medical image classification.},

Common solutions include using measurements from a LiDAR sensor; however, the generated point cloud is often sparse and irregular and limits the system&#39;s capabilities in 3D rendering and safety-critical decision-making. To mitigate this challenge, information from other sensors on the UAV (viz., a camera used for object detection) is utilized to help the depth completion process generate denser 3D models. Performing both aerial depth completion and object detection tasks while fusing the data from the two sensors poses a challenge to resource efficiency. We address this challenge by proposing a novel approach to jointly execute the two tasks in a single pass. The proposed method is based on an encoder-focused multi-task learning model that exposes the two tasks to jointly learned features. We demonstrate how semantic expectations of the objects in the scene learned by the object detection pathway can boost the performance of the depth completion pathway while regressing the missing depth values. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-task network outperforms its single-task counterpart, particularly when exposed to defective inputs.},

Most existing solutions rely on deep CNNs to learn strong feature representations of objects isolated from the background to detect small objects with minimal visual features in images. However, this approach incurs significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose DualYOLO, a fast and accurate long-range small object detection method that combines multi-level multi-scale feature fusion (MLMFF) and concat channel attention (CatCA). Specifically, in order to prevent small targets from becoming more and more blurred after multilayer convolution operations, DualYOLO fuses the features of different layers in the backbone network to obtain small target features with strong semantics and high detail. Furthermore, we use a new loss function to address the sensitivity of IoU to small object position deviations, thereby improving detection accuracy. In terms of data preprocessing, we utilize an image slicing strategy to process the dataset. The experimental results show that DualYOLO achieves 82.2\% accuracy (in terms of mAP@.5) on the VEDAI dataset processed using slices, with a performance more than 2\% higher than that of large models (e.g., YOLOv5x,YOLOR and YOLOv7).},

  abstract  = {In the field of change detection, detecting changes in images with different resolutions is crucial for both long-term interval scenes and scenarios that require rapid detection. However, existing methods face two main issues. Firstly, they require more stringent prior knowledge. The SPM-based methods require pixel-level class labeling of high-resolution(HR) images, while the approaches based on image super-resolution require HR images corresponding to low-resolutionr(LR) images. Such prior knowledge is either costly for labeling or difficult to meet in realistic scenarios. The second is that redundant error accumulation affects detection accuracy. Whether in traditional sub-pixel mapping(SPM) methods or deep learning methods based on image super-resolution, the final detection results are obtained after generating HR images from LR images. The redundant error produced in this step will be accumulated and affect the final detection results. Although the unsupervised methods do not have this problem, the detection accuracy is not as good as that of the supervised. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale Transformer network(MTN). This model first uses a multi-scale feature extractor(MFE) to extract multi-scale features and perform scale matching at the feature level. Then, the Transformer is used to extract long-range relationships of ground objects on the multi-scale features to enhance the features. Finally, the multi-scale features are fused, and a classifier composed of a convolutional network is used to obtain binary change detection results. In addition, we consider that the edges of objects may be affected during the scale matching process, and introduce a CEBoundary Loss to better detect object edges. The results on the LEVIR and Google datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code of MTN is available at https://github.com/Gavin-debug/MultiResolutionCD.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, many rotated object detection (ROD) methods have been proposed and have attracted wide attention in many fields. Most of them use anchor-based or Gaussian heatmaps for label assignment (LA), which cannot capture the shape and orientation characteristics of the rotated object and introduce a large number of hyper parameters. At the same time, most methods only add angle regression or use enclosing rectangles to realize ROD, which cannot express the object well. In this paper, we propose a new method for ROD, named GRDet, which is keypoint-based Anchor-free algorithm. GRDet can adaptively learn and represent an object with point sets, discarding the limitation of anchor on the size and orientation of the object. Specifically, we introduce a conversion function that is able to transform the point set into a rotated bounding box (RBB) for precise localization and classification. In addition, we propose a Gaussian-based dynamic label assignment (GDLA) strategy to realize the assignment of positive and negative (P&amp;N) samples, which can adaptively learn according to the size and orientation characteristics of any rotated object. Moreover, we define an intersection over union (IoU) suitable for ROD, called Gaussian-IoU, which simulates the calculation of IoU by Gaussian distribution and solves the case that some points are not differentiable. Furthermore, we design a dynamic spatial quality constraint (DSQC) for RBB, which can dynamically evaluate the quality of the predicted RBB, and adaptively select high quality RBB. We use KFIoU loss and introduce Gaussian center loss to supervise the training of the network. Extensive experiments with DOTA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

An innovative approach based on Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions (BDI) agents and model checking is proposed. To do so, we first give a formal definition of ethical rules. Based on this definition, an algorithm is then designed to implement ethical reasoning. Finally, we apply this approach to TRACILOGIS (an academic full-sized application platform) to illustrate its feasibility. Four properties are designed and checked.

  abstract  = {Quadruped robots have the distinct ability to adapt their body and step height to navigate through cluttered environments. Nonetheless, for these robots to utilize their full potential in real-world scenarios, they require awareness of their environment and obstacle geometry. We propose a novel multi-agent robotic system that incorporates cutting-edge technologies. The proposed solution features a 3D neural reconstruction algorithm that enables navigation of a quadruped robot in both static and semi-static environments. The prior areas of the environment are also segmented according to the quadruped robots&#39; abilities to pass them. Moreover, we have developed an adaptive neural field optimal motion planner (AN-FOMP) that considers both collision probability and obstacle height in 2D space. Our new navigation and mapping approach enables quadruped robots to adjust their height and behavior to navigate under arches and push through obstacles with smaller dimensions. The multi-agent mapping operation has proven to be highly accurate, with an obstacle reconstruction precision of 82\%. Moreover, the quadruped robot can navigate with 3D obstacle information and the ANFOMP system, resulting in a 33.3\% reduction in path length and a 70\% reduction in navigation time.

However, existing FANET schemes do not consider the mutual influence between data routing and UAV trajectory scheduling, resulting in limited network performance especially when the number of UAVs in FANET is large. This paper proposes a joint optimization framework for routing and UAV trajectory scheduling in FANET to enhance communication reliability and efficiency. Unlike previous studies that consider routing and trajectory scheduling separately, this framework formulates the routing problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs trajectory schedule to guide the state transition probability, addressing the limitation of routing algorithms that passively perceive network topology. In addition, we exploit reinforcement learning to iteratively determine the optimal routing and trajectory scheduling strategy with the support of network topology prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can significantly reduce latency, communication overhead, and packet loss in FANET.},

The morphogenetic leader drone is capable of landing on uneven terrain, traversing it, and maintaining horizontal position to deploy smaller drones for extensive area exploration. After completing their tasks, these drones return and land back on the landing pads of MorphoGear. The reinforcement learning algorithm was developed for a precise landing of drones on the leader robot that either remains static during their mission or relocates to the new position. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed landing algorithm under both even and uneven terrain conditions. The experiments revealed that the proposed system results in high landing accuracy of 0.5 cm when landing on the leader drone under even terrain conditions and 2.35 cm under uneven terrain conditions. MorphoLander has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency of the industrial inspections, seismic surveys, and rescue missions in highly cluttered and unstructured environments.},

Their functioning is guaranteed by their control system that ensures the desired flow-rate, and consequently, the proper pressure, to be provided to the actuator&#39;s chambers. Nevertheless, achieving a good model of such HSAs for control purposes is non-trivial, due to their hybrid nature inherited from the switching between the different operating modes produced by valves. To overcome this limit, we propose an average equivalent discrete-time model of the chambers&#39; pressure dynamics related to a single control input for the digital valves. The proposed model takes inspiration from the analogy existing between hydraulic systems and power electronic converters, and guarantees the same performance as the traditional model, with the advantage of greatly simplifying the control of the servo actuator. Finally, the consistency of the proposed model with respect to its nonlinear hybrid version is proved via numerical examples.},

Identifying the driving mechanisms of the drivers of urban-rural integration development is crucial for predicting the future trends of urban-rural integration and identifying the key promotion paths. In this study, 27 representative factors were synthetically identified using literature research and expert interview methods. Then, the explanatory structural model (ISM) is combined with the Impact Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC), which can be used to analyze and model the complex relationships and interactions in URI systems, to establish integrated ISM- MICMAC model. The model was applied to quantify the causal driving relationships among factors and to develop a multilevel recursive structural model for understanding the underlying mechanisms. The analysis revealed that all 27 drivers can be classified into seven layers. Four source factors such as land use planning and policies, three outcome factors such as urban and rural residents&#39; income, and 20 process factors such as population size are included. And accordingly, corresponding suggestions are made for the government. This study contributes to the advancement of theoretical and model development in understanding the driving mechanism of urban-rural integration. Moreover, it provides valuable insights for policymakers in formulating evidence-based development strategies.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, large language models have been responsible for great advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). ChatGPT in particular, an AI chatbot developed and recently released by OpenAI, has taken the field to the next level. The conversational model is able not only to process human-like text, but also to translate natural language into code. However, the safety of programs generated by ChatGPT should not be overlooked. In this paper, we perform an experiment to address this issue. Specifically, we ask ChatGPT to generate a number of computer programs in order to evaluate the security of the resulting source code. We further investigate whether ChatGPT can be prodded to improve code security by appropriate prompts, and discuss the ethical aspects of using AI to generate code. Results suggest that ChatGPT is aware of potential vulnerabilities, but nonetheless often generates source code that are not robust to certain attacks.},

We propose a Dialogue-based Contrastive Learning for identifying social Bias (DialCL-Bias) framework in dialogue based on two dimensions-relevance and fine-grain. For the identification of social bias relevance, we propose a Dialogue-based Semantic Contrastive Learning (DialSCL) method. DialSCL converts simple dichotomy into triple input and decomposes the classification target based on data annotation rules for achieving semantic-level classification. We use a Key Words and Cosine Similarity (KWCS) method to construct difficult samples and achieve improvement in DialCCL. For the identification of fine-grained social bias, we propose a Dialogue-based Context Contrastive Learning (DialCCL) method. DialCCL simultaneously learns the context-level features of samples and the parameters of classifiers in the same space to naturally generate a classifier. Finally, we measure the degree of bias in the open-domain dialogue corpus and the responses of ChatGPT by using the social bias identification classifiers.},

This presents a significant challenge for food recognition, particularly in identifying the ingredients in food images. This paper focuses on recognizing the ingredients that are segmented from food images, and it proposes a method to achieve this. Specifically, the method localizes the candidate regions of the ingredients using the locating and sliding windows methods. These regions are then classified into ingredient classes using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)-based single ingredient classification model trained on a dataset of single ingredient images. Finally, the ingredients are determined from these candidate results using a decision-making scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through experimental results.},

Firstly, time series analysis and feature engineering act on the original data to decompose load data into three components and extract relevant features. Then, based on the idea of stacking ensemble, long short-term memory is employed as an error correction module to forecast the components separately, and the forecast results are treated as new features to be fed into extreme gradient boosting for the second-step forecasting. Finally, the component sub-series forecast results are reconstructed to obtain the final LF results. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world electricity load data from two cities in China, and the experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to the other benchmark models.},

Multi-modal sarcasm detection, which combines information from different modalities, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, many current methods concatenate image and text features directly without considering the contextual information between the cross-modal alignment and single-modal features simultaneously. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel Global-Aware Attention Network (GAAN) for multi-modal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we investigate a cross-modal multi-granularity alignment module that captures align context features through coarse-grained and fine-grained attention. More importantly, considering the complementary effects of single-modal contextual information in sarcasm detection, we fuse textual, visual context features and alignment context features to obtain the global context features. We conducted extensive experiments on public datasets, and the results compared to the baselines illustrate that our proposed model obtains state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal sarcasm detection.},

The vulnerability analysis of Interdependent Infrastructure Systems (IISs) is crucial for enhancing system resilience against threats. This paper proposes a global vulnerability assessment model by considering the interplay between the attack strength of different risks and the preparedness of infrastructure systems. Three load metrics, Degree-based load, Betweenness-based load, and Flow-based load are adopted to evaluate the vulnerability of IISs. The vulnerability assessment model incorporates both inner- and inter-networks cascading failures to examine the impact of tolerance parameters on global vulnerability. Moreover, critical components are identified by analyzing N-1 scenarios. The results indicate that the vulnerability of IISs assessed by the flow-based load metric can reflect the real-world performance of service-providing IISs. Adjusting the tolerance parameter proves to be effective in mitigating the spread of failures. The vulnerability distribution of IISs can assist stakeholders in identifying critical components to protect for safeguarding IISs against attacks.},

Existing repair strategies take less account of passenger factors and differences in station failure levels. To address this issue, this paper proposes a repair model with the objectives of maximum resilience and speed under differences in station failure levels in the bus feeder scenario, taking into account both passenger travel time and passenger flow characteristics in network performance, which can provide the best repair sequence strategy for multi-engineering teams. The proposed model is further applied to the metro network in downtown Shanghai. The simulation results indicate that the resilience-first strategy provides the highest level of resilience, but the total repair time is prolonged. Moreover, the speed-first repair strategy achieves optimal resilience and ensures the shortest repair time.},

  abstract  = {Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) technology is an effective means to defend against cheating and counterfeiting attacks in wireless communication. However, to move from a theoretical algorithm to a practical application, the challenges of imbalanced data samples and environmental noise must be addressed for Radio Frequency (RF) identification technology. Although noise reduction can restore the signal to some extent, the recognition performance of RFF technology is affected when the dataset is imbalanced. While many RF identification algorithms focus on identification performance under a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), performance degradation caused by data imbalance is a pressing problem that requires attention. Directly applying re-sampling algorithms in imbalanced dataset processing can lead to data overlap and neural network over-fitting. To address these issues, this paper proposes a “Redistillation of Radio Frequency Knowledge” (RRFK) algorithm combined with knowledge distillation (KD). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve good recognition performance in both stepped and long-tail imbalanced data sets.},

Therefore, a scheme to provide disaster recovery for cloud storage services in a multi-cloud storage environment is needed in real production. In this paper, we propose a disaster recovery scheme based on blockchain technology. The proposed scheme outlined in this study aims to address the issue of data availability within the cloud storage landscape. The proposed scheme achieves this goal by dividing data into hot and cold categories, verifying the integrity of copy data via blockchain technology, and utilizing blockchain networks to manage multi-cloud storage systems.

  abstract  = {Compressed video action recognition has received significant attention due to its potential for reducing storage and computational costs. However, the current methods typically only capture a few RGBs and compressed motion cues (e.g., motion vectors and residuals), which are insufficient for modeling actions at their full temporal extent. To address this issue, we propose a Time Domain Fusion (TDF) Module that can extract both low-frequency and high-frequency components from the video and integrate them seamlessly, resulting in the effective integration of abundant motion information into a single frame. More importantly, by using the TDF module, we introduced a new network called I-Frame Fusion Network (IFF-Net). The IFF -Net interacts with the original network (I-frame, motion vector, and residual) in two ways: explicit and implicit. Explicit interaction involves extracting the new representation and the original compressed representation information separately and then performing a later fusion. In contrast, implicit interaction uses the distillation approach, with the IFF-Net acting as the teacher to guide the I-frame network to learn full temporal expressions. Our approach performs better than state-of-the-art methods on the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets for compressed video action recognition.},

  abstract  = {With the advancement of the Internet, Graph Neural Networks based recommendation systems have become a topic of great concern in the research field. However, the current recommendation systems still have the following problems. First, it focuses on modeling users but ignores the problems of missing values of item rating vectors and non-corresponding positions of item rating vectors in the process of solving associated items; second, it focuses on the association relationship between users but pays less attention to the association relationship between items; third, there is insufficient research on the short-term attractiveness of items and the users&#39; temporary preferences. To address the above problems, this study proposes the following solutions to better construct the item social graph and extract the short-term interest/attraction of users/items. Firstly, for problem one, this study reconstructs the item rating vector innovatively based on whether users have interaction with the items; secondly, for problem two, this study proposes to use Pearson similarity to calculate the association relationship between items so as to construct the item social graph. Again, for problem three, This paper investigates temporal information features and extracts short-term user preferences and item attractiveness. To achieve this, an attention network that focuses on temporal information features is constructed by combining channel attention and bidirectional long-term and short-term memory networks. Finally, it involves using a multilayer perceptron with a residual connection structure to combine user and item factors, leading to more accurate predictions. In this study, two publicly available datasets, Epinions and Ciao, were used in a comparative experiment. This model outperformed other baseline models in the experiment, resulting in a reduction of 1.42\% and 1.24\% in MAE values, and 1.47\% and 1.38\% in RMSE values, respectively. These findings suggest that incorporating short-term preferences and reconstructing item social graphs can enhance the precision of social recommendations.},

  abstract  = {Traffic forecasting is a crucial undertaking in the transportation domain. Current practices rely heavily on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to model temporal dependencies in traffic forecasting. However, these approaches tend to overlook the interdependence of multi-hop time steps, impeding their ability to capture long-term dependencies and ultimately limiting their effectiveness in long-term forecasting. To address this issue, we present a novel method, the Time-Graph Adjustive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (TAGRN), for traffic forecasting. Our approach employs a Time-Graph model on the temporal domain, treating each time step of the traffic series as a graph node. We incorporate the similarity between time steps as weighted edges, enabling the Time-Graph to capture correlations between multi-hop time steps and model long-term dependencies through graph convolution. We utilize the Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) technique for information propagation due to its simplicity, linearity, and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive semantic graph to enhance the capture of spatial information on the spatial domain. Experimental results on various real traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared to existing approaches, TAGRN achieves superior performance in long-term traffic forecasting, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

  abstract  = {In recommendation, graph-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods mitigate the data sparsity by introducing Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL). However, the random negative sampling strategy in these GCL-based CF models neglects the semantic structure of users (items), which not only introduces false negatives (negatives that are similar to anchor user (item)) but also ignores the potential positive samples. To tackle the above issues, we propose Topology-aware Debiased Self-supervised Graph Learning (TDSGL) for recommendation, which constructs contrastive pairs according to the semantic similarity between users (items). Specifically, since the original user-item interaction data commendably reflects the purchasing intent of users and certain characteristics of items, we calculate the semantic similarity between users (items) on interaction data. Then, given a user (item), we construct its negative pairs by selecting users (items) which embed different semantic structures to ensure the semantic difference between the given user (item) and its negatives. Moreover, for a user (item), we design a feature extraction module that converts other semantically similar users (items) into an auxiliary positive sample to acquire a more informative representation. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models significantly on three public datasets.

  abstract  = {Traffic forecasting is a critical task in transportation planning and management, which requires modeling the complex spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. Most current methods employ Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to model spatial dependencies, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to model temporal dependencies. However, the representation ability of such methods is limited due to: 1) the conventional temporal extract models, such as RNN and TCN, suffer from limited flexibility, specifically, RNN can only capture temporal dependencies sequentially, while TCN is constrained by its multi-layer dilated convolution structure; 2) spatial and temporal dependencies are intricately intertwined in the real world, but most methods fail to capture this spatial-temporal correlation resulting in sub-optimal performance. To this end, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks (STHGCN), in which we design Spatial-Temporal Hierarchical Graph (STHG) to simultaneously model spatial and temporal dependencies. Specifically, to model temporal dependencies more flexibly, we introduce two crucial components: the Local Temporal Transmission Matrix (LTTM) and the Multi-hop Temporal Similarity Matrix (MTSM). The LTTM captures adjacent temporal dependencies, while the MTSM captures multi-hop temporal dependencies. We further propose a Temporal Neighbor Fusion model that combines the LTTM and MTSM to obtain the adjacency matrix of STHG. Additionally, accounting for spatial-temporal correlation, we exploit the spatial GCN results as the STHG nodes which allows us to learn spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously via the temporal GCN. Our experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that STHGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for traffic forecasting. The code is available at https://github.com/sqy123qwer/STHGCN},

We model space-manipulators as open-chain multi-body systems with 1-degree-of-freedom joints where the configuration space of the spacecraft is isomorphic to the Special Euclidean group SE(3). We formulate the dynamics of the spacecraft-manipulator via the Lagrange-Poincare equations and the dynamics of its target via Euler-Poincare equations to avoid kinematic singularities associated with parametrization of their poses. This model reduces the phase space of the space-manipulator by exploiting its inherent independence of the spacecraft&#39;s pose. We consider the full pose of the end-effector relative to the target as the system output, which transforms the output-tracking control problem into an output-regulation problem. To avoid parametrization singularities of this output, we perform feedback linearization on the matrix Lie group SE (3) in the reduced phase space of the space-manipulator. We then propose a feedback/feedforward proportional-integral-derivative workspace controller, based on coordinate-free pose and velocity error functions defined on the matrix Lie group associated with the target&#39;s relative pose. We provide analytical proof of the almost-global stability of the presented controller when regulating the end-effector&#39;s pose relative to the target towards identity.},

  abstract  = {Sleep Stage Classification (SSC) is a labor-intensive task, requiring experts to examine hours of electrophysiological recordings for manual classification. This is a limiting factor when it comes to leveraging sleep stages for therapeutic purposes. With increasing affordability and expansion of wearable devices, automating SSC may enable deployment of sleep-based therapies at scale. Deep Learning has gained increasing attention as a potential method to automate this process. Previous research has shown accuracy comparable to manual expert scores. However, previous approaches require sizable amount of memory and computational resources. This constrains the ability to classify in real time and deploy models on the edge. To address this gap, we aim to provide a model capable of predicting sleep stages in real-time, without requiring access to external computational sources (e.g., mobile phone, cloud). The algorithm is power efficient to enable use on embedded battery powered systems. Our compact sleep stage classifier can be deployed on most off-the-shelf microcontrollers (MCU) with constrained hardware settings. This is due to the memory footprint of our approach requiring significantly fewer operations. The model was tested on three publicly available data bases and achieved performance comparable to the state of the art, whilst reducing model complexity by orders of magnitude (up to 280 times smaller compared to state of the art). We further optimized the model with quantization of parameters to 8 bits with only an average drop of 0.95\% in accuracy. When implemented in firmware, the quantized model achieves a latency of 1.6 seconds on an Arm Cortex-M4 processor, allowing its use for on-line SSC-based therapies.},

We present a targeted concept of circadian neuromodulation using a novel device platform. This system utilises stimulation of circuits important in sleep and wake regulation, delivering bioelectronic cues (Zeitgebers) aimed at entraining rhythms to more physiological patterns in a personalised and fully configurable manner.

This paper proposes a fast algorithm for crop pest detection based on lightweight feature extraction and knowledge distillation. Firstly, we introduce partial convolution and propose a lightweight feature extraction module, C3Faster, which reduces the model&#39;s computation and speeds up model inference while ensuring effective feature extraction. Secondly, we use knowledge distillation to improve the model&#39;s detection accuracy by using teacher networks to assist in training. Finally, we created a dataset, CropPest6, consisting of six crop pest categories and conducted experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the detection time, number of parameters, and computation by 17\%, 38\%, and 44\%, respectively, compared to the baseline model. Furthermore, our method achieves 93.9\% Precision, 93.6\% Recall, and 97.5\% mean Average Precision (mAP), demonstrating its practical suitability for fast crop pest detection.},

  abstract  = {Digital watermarking technology is a method of embedding specific information in digital images and videos, often used for copyright protection and identity verification. However, unscrupulous users may also use this technique to falsify and tamper with data. Therefore, a reliable watermark attack network is needed to detect and remove watermarks embedded by unscrupulous users. In this paper, we propose a watermarking attack network based on feature pyramid attention, which can effectively remove watermarks embedded in digital images and greatly guarantee the image quality of carrier images. The network consists of two main modules: the feature extraction module and the watermark attack module. In the feature extraction module, we use a convolutional neural network and a residual block to extract the features of the image. Then, in the watermarking attack module, we use the pyramid attention mechanism to focus on the important regions in the feature map and apply the attention weights to the watermarking attack operation. To validate the effectiveness of this network, we conducted experiments using a variety of standard data sets. Experimental results show that the network can effectively attack the watermark information embedded in digital images while guaranteeing the quality of the images after the attack. Overall, the watermarking attack network based on feature pyramid attention proposed in this paper is an effective attack with high imperceptibility that can be applied in the field of digital media protection and security in practical scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to determine human sentiment by extracting and integrating valuable information from multiple modalities, which has a wide range of application scenarios and can provide reliable references for opinion analysis, disease analysis, financial prediction and other fields. Many researchers in this field have proposed effective strategies from different perspectives. However, existing studies often fuse textual and non-textual modalities at the same layer while neglect the difference in information quality between them. The huge representation quality gap between modalities hinders the model from thoroughly learning the interactions between modalities and affects the model&#39;s performance. Based on the above reasons, we propose a multimodal sentiment analysis model based on heterogeneous representation optimization and cross-modal attention. The model designs a bimodal gated filtering mechanism which enhances the quality of semantic representations of non-text modalities by extracting and optimizing non-text modalities information. In addition, to fully exploit the useful inter-modal information and improve the quality of modality fusion, the model uses a cross-modal attention mechanism to model the complex dependencies between modalities and introduces a holistic view for semantic complementation in the prediction stage. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on two public datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experimental results show that our method can efficiently decrease the semantic gap between text and non-text modalities, significantly outperforming existing methods with superior generalization ability and strong competitiveness.},

  abstract  = {The defect detection of Printed Circuit boards (PCB) is challenging due to the complex image background, various types of defects, and small size of defects. This paper develops and evaluates the SC-YOLOv5 network for accurately detecting printed circuit boards. First, we combine the spatial attention mechanism of SA with the Efficient Channel Attention Mechanism (ECA-Net) channel attention module to construct the hybrid attention mechanism module (SCA). SCA has higher defect feature expression ability and doesn&#39;t need dimensionality reduction. Second, we analyze the feature pyramid structure of YOLOv5 and construct a multi-direction dilated convolution module (MD) for the last feature layer. MD has a rich receptive field so that MD can retain more defect information during the feature pyramid downsampling process. We perform experimental evaluations on PCB Dataset and DeepPCB datasets. Experiments show that SC-YOLOv5 improves mAP by 1.9\% and 1.6\%, respectively, on the two datasets, and the detection speed can reach 120FPS. Compared with the mainstream indication defect detection algorithms, SC-YOLOv5 significantly improves accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Public crisis events are unexpected and disastrous events that endanger the overall life of the entire public. Most public crisis events are unpredictable and sudden, including accidents, natural disasters, social unrest, public health emergencies, and so on. When public crisis events occur, users usually send many tweets on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to share real-time conditions and seek help. These tweets, if effectively selected and utilized, will help humanitarian organizations assess the situation and plan relief operations. Previous studies mainly used text data for tweet classification but ignored the complementarity among multimodal data. Although some works combined multimodal data from tweets for tweet classification, but the fusion method was not comprehensive enough, ignoring the heterogeneous differences between the multimodal data. Therefore, the MMC-GAN (Multimodal Cycle-GAN With Mixed Fusion Strategy) model is introduced, which classifies public crisis. The MMC-GAN model consists of three modules: image feature extractor, text feature extractor, and multimodal fusion module. The image feature extractor and the text feature extractor use the newly proposed ResNet(V+H) and BERT to learn visual and textual feature from tweets, respectively. The multimodal fusion module uses the mixed fusion method to get the final classification outcomes after fusing text and image data from several data domains into a single data domain. The MMC-GAN model is validated on the Crisis MMD v2.0 dataset, and the model performance is significantly better than the baseline algorithm and other related research works. SO the MMC-GAN model can effectively fuse the data of different modalities, improving the accuracy of the results about classifying tweets.},

In this paper, we propose CTPMVSNet by using the Global Feature Aware Transformer (GFT) to aggregate global context information within and across images. In order to make better use of GFT, we use Deformable Convolution Module (DCM) to ensure a smooth transition of the extracted feature range.

In this paper, a model for automated resource allocation is constructed using various actors of the Ptolemy-II tool. This model is built in a modular fashion such that most of the key functional actors are custom-built user libraries that can be utilized in future scaling and design. The proposed model is capable of allocating resources and scheduling patient treatment in a range of scenarios with the flexibility to change certain parameters in every case. This paper illustrates how the proposed model can evaluate, visualize, and identify scaling issues in a hospital by running a few different scenarios with varying number of caregivers. These scenarios also show the variability of metrics like average waiting patients, the efficiency of the hospital and average doctor load with respect to the change in the number of caregivers.},

The Price Portfolio Forecasting Model, leveraging the EXPMA Mean Method, plots the long-term price trend line and forecasts future price movements, incorporating the tangent slope and rate of change. For short-term investments, we apply the ARIMA Model to predict ensuing prices. The Mean-Variance Model with Transaction Costs employs the Monte Carlo Method to formulate the feasible region. To strike an optimal balance between risk and return, equal probability weights are incorporated as coefficients of the laziness factor. To assess the efficacy of this combined strategy, we executed extensive experiments on a specified dataset.

Although schedulers employing neural models can improve performance, they suffer limitations such as long inference time and loss of interrelation between pages.

  abstract  = {Energy harvesting act as one of the promising techniques to provide sustainable energy for self-powered sensor nodes by converting environmental energy into electricity. Energy harvested from single micro-energy source suffers from low power density and vulnerable to environmental changes, while the hybrid energy harvesting system can supply energy sustainably. However, cumulative power from various energy sources leads to a challenge of low energy conversion efficiency. In this paper, a Combined Maximum Power Point Tracking (Com-MPPT) method for hybrid energy harvesting is designed to improve the overall harvesting efficiency. By analyzing output characteristic curves under different environmental states, a mathematic model for hybrid energy harvesting system is proposed. It is found that with the change of environmental factors, multiple power peaks exist with varying voltage on the load, where traditional MPPT method for single energy source is no longer applicable. Therefore, the proposed Com-MPPT algorithm based on Search skip and linear extrapolation proposed in this paper can quickly search for the global maximum power peak in the case of multiple power peaks in hybrid energy collection. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can track the global maximum power point rapidly under different environmental conditions, and the tracking time is more than 50\% shorter than that of the improved particle swarm optimization and flower pollination algorithm.},

Various metrics measuring algorithm returns and algorithm stability are used as evaluation criteria in this paper. In this paper, common deep reinforcement learning algorithms are compared. The experimental results show that the TQC algorithm has a highest return of 33.9\% during the test period, which is 3\%, 3\% and 15.6\% higher than A2C, PPO and DDPG respectively. And, the TQC algorithm has the highest stability of return, which is an important evaluation metric for portfolio management algorithms.

Unfortunately, due to the object blur or occlusion in video frames, using single-frame object detection directly will greatly limit the accuracy. The issue is significantly worse in few-shot settings due to insufficient support and timedomain information. In this paper, we propose a temporal aggregation with context focusing framework (TACF) for few-shot video object detection, which aims to fully use the information between support images and adjacent video frames. The context focusing module effectively encodes the target object in adjacent frames according to the support images. Afterward, the temporal aggregation module implicitly extracts the most similar ROI features from these adjacent frames to obtain the target proposals. In the end, the matching network determines the category and bounding box by calculating the distance with the support images. Extensive experimental evaluations on FSVOD and FSYTV databases show that our method achieves more competitive results than image-based methods, naive video-based extensions, and the state-of-the-art few-shot video object detection method.},

However, existing traditional rain removal methods are very time-consuming, and newly emerging deep learning-based methods require a large amount of data and computational resources, resulting in long time consumption and poor visual effect. To solve the problems of existing methods, a new method is proposed to remove oblique rain streaks in windy conditions better. Firstly, the directional gradient constraint is proposed to locate oblique rain streaks in the rain layer effectively. Then, a sparse prior for oblique rain streaks is presented to enhance oblique rain streaks removal. After that, an optimization problem combining the directional gradient, sparse priors, and non-negativity constraints is presented. Finally, the alternating direction method of multipliers is exploited to solve the optimization problem effectively. Experiment results show that our method outperforms other methods in removing oblique rain streaks and requires less time.},

  abstract  = {Multi-scale features are of great importance in encoding objects with scale variance in object detection tasks. A common strategy for multi-scale feature extraction is adopting the classic top-down and bottom-up feature pyramid networks. However, these approaches suffer from the loss or degradation of feature information, impairing the fusion effect of non-adjacent levels. This paper proposes an asymptotic feature pyramid network (AFPN) to support direct interaction at non-adjacent levels. AFPN is initiated by fusing two adjacent low-level features and asymptotically incorporates higher-level features into the fusion process. In this way, the larger semantic gap between non-adjacent levels can be avoided. Given the potential for multi-object information conflicts to arise during feature fusion at each spatial location, adaptive spatial fusion operation is further utilized to mitigate these inconsistencies. We incorporate the proposed AFPN into both two-stage and one-stage object detection frameworks and evaluate with the MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets. Experimental evaluation shows that our method achieves more competitive results than other state-of-the-art feature pyramid networks. The code is available at https://github.com/gyyang23/AFPN.},

In this work, we find that if the attack direction of the original example is controlled from the beginning, the produced adversarial examples will be more transferable. Specifically, we propose the Output Direction Controller (ODC) to initialize the example direction so that the example starts off with a deviation from the true direction or toward the target direction. ODC is a simple and extensible component that can be combined with various transfer-based attack methods and significantly improve the transferability of the adversarial examples. On the ImageNet dataset, we optimize the baseline method by ODC to improve the success rate of untargeted attacks by an average of 11.79\% and targeted attacks by an average of 3.38\%.

  abstract  = {Face detection is a fundamental and practical problem in computer vision, which aims to indicate the face positions in a wild environment precisely. However, different from the generic object detection tasks, there are a large number of face samples that suffer from unconstrained poses, occlusion, extreame lights, or other harmful conditions. YOLOV5 is an incredible milestone in the object detection area, but still not powerful enough for the challenging samples. To ease these difficulties, in this paper, we customize DSH-YOLOV5, a practical face detector. Specifically, we integrate a decoupled head with swin transformer layers, whose self-attention mechanism has great potential to explore subtle interconnection details. Additionally, we use two context modules (CBAM and SSH) to enhance the performance of features. Furthermore, we design a novel copy-paste data augmentation to fit the above challenging scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we achieve SOTA performance on WIDER FACE, FDDB, and PASCAL FACE with competitive computational costs. Moreover, under COVID-19, we add the breathing mask and gender classification branches based on the ROI Align to produce more practical face information.},

Therefore, HBB (horizontal bounding box) is not suitable to represent the objects in remote sensing images. We propose a detection framework named Oriented CenterNet, which can detect arbitrary orientation objects efficiently. We adopt the light weight backbone called Swin-Tiny Transformer. Compared with CNN-based backbone, it can obtain the global receptive field and establish connections with other pixel points. And then, we propose a new and simple six-parameter representation, named Cornerpoint Offset Representation, to represent rotated objects, which can convert HBB to RBB (rotated bounding box) easily. For small objects in remote sensing images, the network adopts an effective feature fusion and sampling method, Center Pooling is integrated into the prediction module, to enhances the features of small objects and weakens the background noise. In addition, we redefine the loss function by dividing the regression loss into horizontal and rotated parts, in order to provide better supervision in the training process of the network.

It uses labeled source domain datasets and unlabeled target domain images to learn to segment the network. This article proposes a domain adaptive framework that combines decoupled adversarial network and self-training. The problem of over fitting the source domain in domain adaptation and the inability of the network to focus on segmentation tasks has been solved. Considering the impact of the long tailed distribution of data, the Rare Class Sampling (RCS) module is introduced. In order to make full use of pseudo-labels, we designed a self-training UDA scheme using weighted pseudo-labels. At the same time, the RCS module for rare class sampling improves the quality of pseudo-labels by reducing the recognition bias of self-training on public classes. The LoveDA dataset is the latest domain adaptive dataset for land cover mapping. In urban-to-rural and rural-to-urban scenarios, our proposed UDA method has significant advantages.},

Although it has achieved great success in high-resource languages, it still remains challenging in low-resource languages due to the lack of labeled training data. Consequently, there is growing interest in code-switching method for cross-lingual SLU to solve the problem in the low-resource languages. However, despite the success of existing models, most of these methods fail to effectively leverage the code-switched utterances. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed CMM for zero-shot cross-lingual SLU which simplifies the learning task for the model. Specifically, we apply both mixup and curriculum learning method to dynamically combine the information from pure utterances and code-switched utterances. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the performance compared to several strong baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on MultiATIS++ dataset, with a relative improvement of 3.0\% in terms of overall accuracy over the previous best model.},

Automatic audio-visual emotion recognition has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, previous methods cannot effectively exploit the complementarity between modalities when performing feature fusion, and the resulting fused feature representations may contain redundant information from different modalities. This paper proposes an audio-visual emotion recognition model based on multi-scale channel attention (MCA) and global interactive fusion (GIF). The MCA module is designed to extract modal key emotional features at multiple contextual scales to express human emotions. Then, feature fusion is performed by using the GIF module, which is implemented in two steps. In the first step, features are fused through a global interactive attention layer, which considers the global interactive information of both intra and inter modalities, and reduces the redundancy of fused feature representations by fusing only the attention scores. In the second step, multiple convolutional neural networks with different kernel sizes are used to further learn the multi-scale emotional information in the fused features that is meaningful for both modalities. The proposed model is verified on two multimodal emotion datasets, the RAVDESS and the SAVEE, and achieves accuracies of 84.12\% and 98.71\%, respectively, with only 2M parameters.},

  abstract  = {Facial expressions convey a great deal of information during human emotional interaction. However, due to the potential for various types of in-the-wild interferences, such as occlusions and variant head poses, dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) has been a desperately complicated task. Previous methods focus on applying more robust models to extract the spatial-temporal features but ignore the impact of the key features of the regions of interest (ROIs). This inhibits further improvement of recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a 3D vision Transformer with a deformable module termed 3D-DSwin Transformer to guide our model to capture more discriminative features. The deformable module can gradually shift the deformable points to guide our model to pay more attention to the ROIs. A simple yet effective video augmentation method is proposed to expand the number of training samples and avoid overfitting. Visualizations and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed 3D-DSwin Transformer has the ability to obtain the key feature maps, and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on both the FERV39k and DFEW benchmarks.},

In this paper, we propose a Semantic Interaction Fusion Framework (SIFF) extracting the semantic information that evokes the specific sentiment from multiple modalities and integrating multimodal semantic information using a gate attention fusion module. The gate attention fusion module fuses multimodal semantic information adaptively, eliminating the influence of conflicting information and strengthening the emotional cues interaction between multiple modalities. We perform experiments on two benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. Our proposed method on both datasets achieves the accuracy of 87.2\% and 86.5\%, respectively, which is a 1.1\% and 1.8\% absolute improvement over the current state-of-the-art.},

For compensating this limitation, this study proposes a dual-cell recurrent network (DCRN) that combines aspect term extraction (ATE) and target-oriented opinion word extraction. The DCRN model is trained and evaluated on global fields, including explicit and implicit target aspects. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed DCRN model outperforms existing methods by an average of 4.90\% on the SemEva114–16 datasets. Furthermore, the DCRN model achieves higher Macro-F1 values than the IOG model on the Restaurant 14–16 datasets by 8.97\%, 7.90\%, and 8.70\%, respectively. These results indicate that the DCRN model significantly improves the performance of TOWE and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, aspect sentiment quadruple prediction (ASQP) has become popular in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Its purpose is to decode a given sentence into aspect sentiment quadruples (aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, and sentiment polarity). When trying to efficiently extract aspect sentiment quadruples, the following problems are often encountered: Firstly, the intrinsic relationships between aspect terms and opinion terms are usually ignored, thus failing to address the correlation between establishing aspect-opinion pairs and ignoring the mutual interference between different sentiment quadruples; Secondly, the semantic information contained in the sentiment elements of comment utterances is often underutilized, thus increasing the risk of obtaining inaccurate predictions. We propose a two-stage framework to address these issues by enhancing the correlations between aspects and opinions and fully utilizing the semantic information of sentiment elements. Specifically, in the first stage, we treat the extraction task as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem, employ a span-based labeling scheme, and construct a question-and-answer-based MRC task to efficiently extract aspect-opinion pairs. In the second stage, we view the classification of aspect categories and sentiment polarities as a text generation task, where the semantics of sentiment elements can be leveraged by learning to generate them in natural language form. Finally, the two stages are combined with our proposed template generator, and the aspect sentiment quadruples can be decoded. We conducted experiments on two datasets, and the experimental results were superior to those of the comparison approaches, with our model demonstrating excellent performance in terms of processing complex sentences containing multiple quaternary groups. Additionally, in sub-task experiments, our model achieved good results, further proving its effectiveness. We will upload the specific code to https://github.com/SlienceLZJ/ASQP.},

To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-channel dialogue clues embedding context perception network (Dialogue-Clues) that integrates dialogue clues information into global conversation context modeling. We also introduce a dual-channel dialogue clues perception architecture that captures and reinforces both static and dynamic dialogue clues in conversations, and bidirectionally reinforces both types of dialogue clues information. To better represent dynamic dialogue clues, we construct a novel speaker-interaction isomorphic graph structure for the dual-channel dialogue clues perception architecture. Through extensive comparisons with ten existing methods on four public datasets, we confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that integrating Dialogue-Clues information can improve the ability of context modeling.},

  abstract  = {Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and painless technique used in both clinical trials and research on cortical activity and brain networks. TMS involves the use of an electromagnetic coil, which can induce powerful but brief magnetic pulses. When the coil is headed against the scalp, it can induce electrical activity in underlying brain tissue. For effective results, the TMS coil should be in appropriate contact with patients&#39; scalp and positioned for consistent stimulation. In many cases, it requires researchers and clinicians to not only hold and position the coil on subjects&#39; head, also to take care to ensure appropriate and consistent contact between the TMS coil and subject&#39;s scalp. This task is noticeably tiresome for the operators considering weight of the coil and a dense cable attached to it. On the other side, the patient or participant has to sit motionless; otherwise, the contact will be lost and the stimulation will have a reduced impact. In this paper, we propose and develop a haptically-enabled teleoperated robotic platform that removes all those limitations and burdensome from both TMS operators and patients/participants. The operator, through a haptic interface, remotely controls a robotic arm holding the coil. This system provides the operator with the sense of touch to feel the contact force between the coil and patient/participant&#39;s head. Therefore, operators and patients/participants do not need to be in the same location while conducting TMS, including the “motor thresholding” procedure. This will offer a huge benefit to the healthcare services in rural areas. Experimental evaluations carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robotic system.},

Detecting cognitive distraction in real-time can be a valuable strategy for preventing accidents. In this study, a novel approach is presented for the purpose of detecting cognitive distraction in real-time using artificial intelligence while taking into account eye-tracking and head movement data, combined with driving performance measures. This methodology involved collecting data from participants in a driving simulator, on a motion platform, while they performed a cognitive task as well as a control driving scenario. The data collected included eye-tracking data, head movement data, driving performance measures, and subjective ratings of distraction. To develop an accurate model for detecting cognitive distraction, a Deep Feedforward Neural Network (D-FFNN) model was employed while considering binocular gaze direction, pupil diameter, orientation of each eye, head rotational velocities, and head acceleration. The developed model was trained using the collected data and achieved an accuracy of 96.09\% in detecting cognitive distraction. The results of our study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying cognitive distraction in real-time. Also, the accuracy of this model was compared with other AI based classification algorithms. The proposed method has significant implications for preventing vehicle accidents caused by cognitive distraction. The proposed method can be integrated into existing driver-assistance systems to alert drivers and assist them in returning their focus to the road.},

In order to effectively solve the recognition problem of named entities in TCM, and to address the phenomenon of underutilized semantic information in entity recognition tasks, an entity recognition method incorporating Chinese character multi-features and SPAN pointer networks is proposed to obtain character feature vectors of data using the powerful characterization information of the pre-training model BERT, connect the character vectors with lexical and radical feature embeddings, and obtain the long-range textual context through BiGRU and Attention layer to obtain the contextual information of long-range text, and finally use SPAN pointer network to achieve the start boundary determination of the entity and complete the extraction of the entity. In addition, adversarial training and focal loss are added to reduce the risk of overfitting and enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the model. The final experiments show that this method has superior performance in dealing with the named entity recognition problem of TCM.},

  abstract  = {Due to privacy and cost reasons, distributed machine learning in Wide-Area Networks(DML-WAN) is becoming an emerging and popular collaborative learning paradigm. However, heterogeneity in computing power and data distribution among workers in different locations has a dramatic impact on training performance, including convergence speed and learning accuracy. Most of the existing works on distributed training mechanisms either focus on computing heterogeneity or data heterogeneity, and none of them can handle both well. In this paper, we propose FedGSync, a novel distributed training mechanism to improve the training performance for DML-WAN, where computing heterogeneity and data heterogeneity usually coexist. To speed up training and improve model accuracy, FedGSync clusters workers into groups according to the similarity of their data distribution and introduce group-based weak synchronization to minimize the synchronization delays waiting for slow workers and the accuracy loss by balancing the contributions of all data distributions. To preserve data privacy and improve efficiency, FedGSync only groups workers based on principal components of gradients and design an approximate grouping mechanism based on Kmeans. To further reduce synchronization time, FedGSync prioritizes packets and uses differential transmission for gradient packets between groups. Evaluation results demonstrate that FedGSync improves convergence speed and learning accuracy under the coexistence of computing heterogeneity and data heterogeneity compared with state-of-the-art distributed training mechanisms.},

This paper proposes a novel approach, FedCRC, that decouples the machine learning model into a representation extractor and predictor. This enables us to enhance both generalization and personalization, thereby addressing the challenge of data heterogeneity in FL. The approach employs a stable global predictor to unify the representation learning criterion during the training of the representation extractor. Additionally, a personalized predictor is trained for each client to achieve a personalized model tailored to the local data distribution. Our FedCRC algorithm was evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets with varying distributions, covering diverse settings. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

This versatile network can be effectively employed in a wide array of applications, including data compression, noise reduction, and interpolation. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate that ST-ATGCN network outperforms most of the currently prevailing GCN-based methods. This indicates the efficacy of the proposed network architecture in accurately extracting and reconstructing human skeleton information. Moreover, the reconstruction network exhibits proficiency in effectively restoring noisy action sequences.},

Researchers have proposed numerous methods to detect malicious domains, among which heterogeneous graph (HG) based models have demonstrated good performance. However, their success may also motivate attackers to defeat HG based models in order to evade detection. In this paper, we propose a novel malicious domain detection model named RoDom, which is robust against adversarial attacks on HG. Firstly, we introduce different perturbations to construct multiple attacked graphs, which are designed to simulate different types of adversarial attacks on the HG. Secondly, we design a discriminator to perform robust representation learning on the HG by discriminating the original graph from attacked graphs. Finally, we introduce a classification selector to further improve the model&#39;s robustness by automatically combining domain representations of multiple HGs for domain classification. The experimental results show that RoDom out-performs other state-of-the-art methods and exhibits stronger robustness against adversarial attacks on the HG.},

Our study investigates the impact of these joints on maintaining the quadruped&#39;s desired height and following commanded velocities while traversing challenging terrains. We provide comparison results, based on a Cost of Transport (CoT) metric, between quadrupeds with and without prismatic joints.

But because of their small size and complex backgrounds, some smaller traffic signs are harder to detect than larger ones. On the other hand, some false information is always detected due to the influence of light changes and bad weather. Therefore, in order to solve the problems of missing detection and false detection, this paper proposes an adaptive multi-scale spatial-channel attention fusion center network (MSCA-Center Net). Firstly, a residual space-channel attention module combined with multi-channel information is proposed. The module divides the channels in the feature map into several groups, generate separate spatial and channel attention for each group, and combine the spatial and channel information of the multi-channel. Then, a multi-scale attention fusion module is proposed to integrate the extracted high-level and low-level features, which can improve the detection and classification accuracy. In addition, a coordinate attention module is introduced to obtain the final feature code, so that the model can locate and identify the target area more accurately. Finally, the optimal detection box is generated adaptively according to the feature coding. The proposed model was tested and evaluated on the CCTSDB dataset. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can detect traffic signs adaptively in real time under complex background, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Here we present the Spatial Reasoner (SR), a distributed ROS-based data management and processing pipeline capable of supporting coordinated human/robot interaction in large, urban environments in real time. The SR processes information from sensors mounted on ground and air platforms or in static positions and aggregates it into discrete, meaningful human/robot, human/human, and human/environment encounters. Encounters are explainable and traceable and used by other system components to generate evidence and recommendations to support the decision-making of a human operator. Uncertainty is propagated through its layered architecture making it highly robust and informative in unknown environments. The SR has been deployed and tested in hundreds of hours of live experimentation. It has efficiently observed and processed hundreds of thousands of interactions in dense, crowded environments and has been shown to effectively provide information for a human-directed and controlled AI system.},

With the rapid development of AI, many researchers focus on understanding the statuses of the fish via using water quality sensors and fish motion detection. However, existing methods focus on the pattern of movement of the fish, without exploring the health statuses in a real environment. Meanwhile, the computational requirement of the model and computing hardware equipment is also need to be taken into consideration. Thus, an edge-based aquaculture monitoring system is proposed with the advantage of health statuses recognition based on AI model and real-time communication by using edge computing devices. Slowfast, the deep learning algorithm is also first implemented to detect the different statuses of fish with an accuracy of 97.06\%, which outperforms the other existing methods. The proposed monitoring system has also been successfully deployed in monitoring the intensive American shad farming in the cities of Suzhou, China.},

  abstract  = {Motion planning in dynamically changing environments is one of the most complex challenges in autonomous driving. Safety is a crucial requirement, along with driving comfort and speed limits. While classical sampling-based, lattice-based, and optimization-based planning methods can generate smooth and short paths, they often do not consider the dynamics of the environment. Some techniques do consider it, but they rely on updating the environment on-the-go rather than explicitly accounting for the dynamics, which is not suitable for self-driving. To address this, we propose a novel method based on the Neural Field Optimal Motion Planner (NFOMP), which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of normalized curvature and the number of cusps. Our approach embeds previously known moving obstacles into the neural field collision model to account for the dynamics of the environment. We also introduce time profiling of the trajectory and non-linear velocity constraints by adding Lagrange multipliers to the trajectory loss function. We applied our method to solve the optimal motion planning problem in an urban environment using the BeamNG.tech driving simulator. An autonomous car drove the generated trajectories in three city scenarios while sharing the road with the obstacle vehicle. Our evaluation shows that the maximum acceleration the passenger can experience instantly is −7.5 m/s 2 and that 89.6\% of the driving time is devoted to normal driving with accelerations below 3.5 m/s 2 . The driving style is characterized by 46.0\% and 31.4\% of the driving time being devoted to the light rail transit style and the moderate driving style, respectively.},

  abstract  = {In unsupervised text classification, contrastive learning can effectively learn discriminative representations of text features, thereby improving the performance of the model. However, in the context of supervised text classification, contrastive learning methods cannot fully utilize the label information of samples in the text classification model, nor can they learn the relationship between labels and features among samples well. Therefore, how to improve the generalization and robustness of the supervised text classification model has been a problem that researchers have been exploring. In this paper, we propose a framework called VABCL (Virtual Adversarial and Bidirectional Contrastive Learning) based on virtual adversarial training and bidirectional contrastive learning. This framework combines virtual adversarial training with contrastive learning to train the model to establish better relationships between adversarial and real samples, thus improving the robustness and generalization performance of the classification model. Furthermore, we generate augmented samples using the label information of the samples, and use bidirectional contrastive learning to learn the relationship between sample labels and features, further improving the accuracy of the classification model. We experimentally verified the VABCL framework on three benchmark text classification datasets, and the results confirmed the improvement in the feature extraction ability and classification accuracy of VABCL, indicating that VABCL has good performance in the field of supervised text classification.},

We present Multi-Granularity Interest Learning(MGIL)—combining the memorization of user&#39;s historical preferences with generalization of user&#39;s interests. Our fine-grained interest module learns interests at the granularity of items, preserving the memory of users&#39; historical preferences as much as possible. The coarse-grained interest module, on the other hand, extracts multiple high-level interests from user behavior sequences to characterize multiple aspects of user interest, which are more generalized and abstract. The two modules complement each other from different granularities. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, Movielens, Taobao and Amazon. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and diversity of recommendation compared to state-of-the-art models.},

Detecting multivariate anomalous data in such systems is challenging due to the lack of a complete comprehension of anomalous behaviors and features. This paper proposes a framework to address time series multivariate anomaly detection problems by combining the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). By clustering the multivariate data, SOM creates an environment to enable the DRL agents interacting with the collected system operational data in terms of a tabular dataset. In this environment, Markov chains reveal the likely anomalous features to support the DRL agent exploring and exploiting the state-action space to maximize anomaly detection performance. We use a time series dataset, Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB), to evaluate our framework. Compared with the best results by some currently applied methods, our framework improves the F1 score by 9\% from 0.67 to 0.73.},

Scholars have proposed many cognitive diagnostic models. However, most of the models do not fully extract and utilize the relevant data and parameters of cognitive diagnosis. Moreover, some models only rely on artificially designed simple functions to analyze the cognitive process of students, which cannot fully capture the complex relationship between students and the exercises. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a neural cognitive diagnostic model named NCDFSA, which focuses on students&#39; attention to knowledge concepts. The model utilizes neural networks to diagnose students&#39; knowledge and considers students&#39; implicit relationships with knowledge concepts. We introduce the concept of attention matrix(AM) and define the importance of knowledge concepts by the frequency of usage of knowledge concepts to improve the prediction effect.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an open-set intrusion detection framework that incorporates a cluster anomaly detection plugin to identify non-discriminative unknown classes by introducing primitive features and detecting adversarial examples through cluster design. Specifically, 1) we use the anomaly detection plugin trained with primitive features from the raw data to discover unseen data. Samples rejected by either deep discriminative classifiers or detection plugins are considered unknown. 2) We design the plugin as a cluster of one-class anomaly detectors. This approach effectively isolates adversarial examples carefully crafted to deceive the deep classifier. 3) We provide theoretical evidence of the proposed framework&#39;s ability to detect non-discriminative unknown classes and adversarial examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when applied to open-set intrusion detection.},

Our approach is tested on cutting stock problem instances. Compared with the vanilla CG algorithm, the iterations and time required for convergence are reduced by up to 31\% and 48\%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a FER method based on AUs and use a effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called AUs-Enhanced Expressions Representation Network (AU-EERN). Specifically, first we define the center position of the region of interest of each AU through face landmarks. Second, we attach AUIs to facial expressions in the form of Gaussian heatmaps and crop AU regions of interest (RoI) based on each AU center point. Finally, we fuse the obtained AUI-enhanced expression features with the deep features of the AU RoI region via a convolutional neural network for further expression recognition. Our proposed method is evaluated on the widely available FER databases RaFD and Oulu-CASIA. Experimental results and comparisons show that our model achieves better performance than several other popular methods.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks show great advancement in recent decades in classifying medical images (such as CT-scans) with high precision to aid disease diagnosis. However, the training of deep neural networks requires significant sample sizes for learning enriched discriminative spatial features. Building a high quality dataset large enough to satisfy model training requirement is a challenging task due to limited disease sample cases, and various data privacy constraints. Therefore in this research, we perform medical image classification using transfer learning based on several well-known deep networks, i.e. GoogLeNet, Resnet and EfficientNet. To tackle data sparsity issues, a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) is used to generate new medical image samples to increase the numbers of training instances of the minority classes. The transfer learning process itself also allows the building of strong classifiers by transferring knowledge from the pre-trained image domain to a new medical domain using a small sample size. Moreover, the lottery ticket hypothesis is also used to prune each transfer learning network trained using the new target image data sets. Specifically, the L1 norm unstructured pruning technique is used for network reduction. Hyper-parameter fine-tuning is also performed to identify optimal settings of key network hyper-parameters such as learning rate, batch size and weight decay. A total of 20 trials are used for optimal hyper-parameter selection. Evaluated using multi-class lung X-ray images for pneumonia conditions and brain tumor CT-scans, the fine-tuned EfficientNet model obtains the best brain tumor classification accuracy rate of 96\% and a fine-tuned GoogLeNet model with pruning has the highest pneumonia classification accuracy rate of 81.5\%.},

Manifold word-based stylistic markers have been successfully used in deep learning methods to deal with the intrinsic problem of authorship attribution. Unfortunately, the performance of word-based authorship attribution systems is limited by the vocabulary of the training corpus. Literature has recommended character-based stylistic markers as an alternative to overcome the hidden word problem. However, character-based methods often fail to capture the sequential relationship of words in texts which is a chasm for further improvement. The question addressed in this paper is whether it is possible to address the ambiguity of hidden words in text documents while preserving the sequential context of words. Consequently, a method based on bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) with a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to capture sequential writing styles for authorship attribution. The BLSTM was used to obtain the sequential relationship among characteristics using subword information. The 2-dimensional CNN was applied to understand the local syntactical position of the style from unlabeled input text. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated against numerous state-of-the-art methods across the public corporal of CCAT50, IMDb62, Blog50, and Twitter50. Experimental results indicate accuracy improvement of 1.07\%, and 0.96\%, on CCAT50 and Twitter, respectively, and produce comparable results on the remaining datasets.},

  abstract  = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social communication and interaction. Early diagnosis of ASD can mitigate the severity and help with ideal treatment direction. Computer vision-based methods with traditional machine learning and deep learning are employed in the literature for automatic diagnosis. Recently, deep learning with a facial image-based ASD classification has gained interest due to its ease of collection and non-invasiveness. We observed that the existing approaches utilized either local or global features of facial images to diagnose ASD. However, its important to consider both local and global features to obtain fine-grained details and larger contextual information for accurate detection and classification. This paper proposes a sequencer-based patch-wise Local Feature Extractor along with a Global Feature Extractor. Finally, the features from these modules are aggregated to obtain the final feature for the classification of ASD. Experiments on a publicly available Autism Facial Image Dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. We achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 94.7\%, 94.0\%, 95.3\%, and 94.6\%, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Previous studies on automatic personality perception have primarily focused on a limited number of personality traits. However, in real-world situations, humans exhibit a wide range of personality traits. To overcome this limitation, a new methodology for automatic personality perception is proposed in this paper. This revised approach can predict various personality traits (17 traits) with satisfactory performance by utilizing physiological signals. The underlying concept is to stimulate participants with different emotional stimuli to elicit physiological responses in a specific scenario. Biomarkers such as Electroencephalogram (EEG), Skin Conductance, Blood Volume Pulse, and Pupil Dilation reflect an individual&#39;s personality traits. Two experiments are conducted with different scenarios, including Image/Video Stimulation and Driving Simulation, to support this study. Based on the collection of data and validation of supervised learning models, Naive Bayes outperforms other classifiers explored in this research. EEG is the most effective signal for predicting personality, although combining other signals may produce similar results. Our method accurately predicts the 17 personality traits, demonstrating significant potential for clinical research.},

Consequently, changes in dentures or biting speed can create an illusion of different textures for the same food. Like-wise, in mastication robots, variations in control parameters and probe geometry can lead to differences in acquired data, resulting in texture misidentification. This study aims to bridge the gap in texture perception between humans and machines, and make their misperception of texture more similar. To achieve this, the possibility of replicating human texture perception by machines was investigated using a highly accurate texture discriminator called “Gel Biter”, which comprises multiple soft materials. The findings indicate that misperception due to variations in mastication speed leads to misdiscrimination with a tendency similar to that in humans. Additionally, it was discovered that different contact between the tooth-shaped probes can cause a completely different texture perception. The potential contributions to food development using human dental techniques and food texture illusion are also discussed.},

To tackle this issue, we present a new FPN network structure (ICE-FPN) based on channel-enhanced feature pyramid network (CE-FPN) in this paper, which can mitigate the YoloX network confounding effect while reducing the number of parameters and computational effort caused by CE-FPN.

The data-driven deep reinforcement learning method has great potential in providing fast decision-making. However, a large number of agents lead to the curse of dimensionality, making it inefficient to obtain effective control strategies. When tackling similar tasks in different power gird, the retraining of multiple agents will bring us great cost. To solve this problem, we propose a transferable multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that employs model reload and buffer reuse methods to transfer control strategies from small-scale simple scenes to large-scale complex scenes. It also utilizes attention mechanisms to aggregate observation features and handles the problem of variable observation dimensions. Finally, the distribution service restoration problem is modeled as a Markov decision process and solved using the QMIX algorithm. The performance of the proposed method has been verified in IEEE 34-node and IEEE 123-node distribution systems.},

This paper proposes a video prediction method based on multi-resolution echo state networks (ESN) for a jar test. Because the proposed method is constructed based on ESN, we succeed in long-term video prediction even if the amount of training videos is small. Specifically, we develop a new model that performs ESN while observing the input video at different resolutions and effectively fuses the prediction results. The multi-resolution approach enables us to acquire both rough shape changes and fine pattern features, resulting in accurate prediction. In fusion of the multiple prediction results, our method can calculate optimal weights by the least squares method. Experimental results for a jar test confirm that our method outperformed existing video prediction methods based on deep neural networks. In addition, the results on the sky timelapse dataset show the versatility of our method.},

Transformer-based models, pre-trained on unlabeled data, can outmatch the performance of models trained from scratch for each task.

This paper investigates the best strategies for optimizing the use of a small labeled dataset and large amounts of unlabeled data and perform a classification task in the legal area with 50 predefined topics. More specifically, we use the records of demands to a Brazilian Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office aiming to assign the descriptions in one of the subjects, which currently demands deep legal knowledge for manual filling. The task of optimizing the performance of classifiers in this scenario is especially challenging, given the low amount of resources available regarding the Portuguese language, especially in the legal domain. Our results demonstrate that classic supervised models such as logistic regression and SVM and the ensembles random forest and gradient boosting achieve better performance along with embeddings extracted with word2vec when compared to BERT language model. The latter demonstrates superior performance in association with the architecture of the model itself as a classifier, having surpassed all previous models in that regard. The best result was obtained with Unsupervised Data Augmentation (UDA), which jointly uses BERT, data augmentation, and strategies of semi-supervised learning, with an accuracy of 80.7\% in the aforementioned task.},

As a tumor shows altered electrical properties, intraoperative impedance measurements can support the surgeon to classify the tissue. An important step in this process is the decision on how to pass the impedance information to the classification algorithm. This can be either in the form of a raw measurement vector or based on parameters extracted from the measurement. These parameters arise from curve characteristics of the Nyquist diagram, electrical tissue models, or indices defined as ratios between specific measurement points. In this work, different features proposed in the literature are reviewed and extracted from impedance measurements taken on bladder tissue. The most influential measurement frequencies are determined via a principle component analysis, and the most promising parameters are selected based on an analysis of variance. The different feature extraction approaches are compared based on the classification accuracy on unseen test data. The accuracy is very high for all different ways to define features, and it increases for every approach when only considering the selected features. Especially for the Nyquist parameters and indices, as well as the reduced measurement vector, the number of necessary frequencies is significantly reduced. This shortens the measurement, which is favorable for an intraoperative application.},

It maintains a linear relationship with the prediction error of the neural network. This is expected to offer the lowest learning rate at the global minima, and higher learning rates elsewhere. Hence, a number proportional to the prediction error is used as a learning rate, subject to the constraint that the number is within an acceptable range (here [0,1]). The derivation of an optimal learning rate from a given cost function is illustrated with the popular binary/categorical cross-entropy cost function(s). Experiments performed under multiple settings demonstrate that, with the CoRL optimizer needs no parameter tuning to obtain state-of-the-art results with significantly lower training time for equivalent performance.},

Robustness of connectivity and controllability is the ability of a network to maintain its basic functions against various malicious attacks. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches provide an efficient framework to approximate the network robustness, which significantly reduces computation time compared to attack simulations. In this paper, the performance of CNN-based prediction for connectivity and controllability robustness is investigated, when there are noises in the network input representation. Two CNN-based predictors are compared and investigated, 1) convolutional neural network-based robustness predictor (CNN-RP), and 2) spatial pyramid pooling-based convolutional neural network (CNN-SPP). Two aspects of network information noises are considered and investigated, 1) the random node information noises (RNIN), and 2) the random edge information noises (REIN). The following main conclusions are obtained from extensive experimental studies on synthetic networks: 1) CNN-RP is more tolerant than CNN-SPP to network noises, 2) The characteristics of small-world and scale-free networks make them have a favorable anti-noise ability, and 3) RNIN has less impact on CNN-based prediction performance than REIN, RNIN and REIN show opposite effects on prediction performance when the size of the predicted network is out of the training network size range.},

A significant challenge faced by many existing algorithms pertains to their inability to reconcile the competing goals of solution quality and computational efficiency, rendering them unsuitable in large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive community-based influence maximization algorithm, named AComA, to solve the IM problem with a balance of effectiveness and efficiency. First, we introduce a community detection method to divide a large-scale network into several communities. An adaptive indicator is then defined to identify vertices with high propagation values in divided community networks. Based on community detection and the adaptive influence indicator, the number of candidate vertices is reduced, which significantly reduces the search space of the problem. Second, to select the final seed set from these candidate vertices, a genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced. The crossover and mutation operations are modified explicitly to adapt to the IM problem. By extracting information from the local neighborhood and the global community structure, AComA achieves a more accurate measurement of the influence spread for each vertex. The method proposed in this paper is tested on several real-world datasets. The experimental results show that AComA is promising.},

A user&#39;s fingerprint can act as a virtual representation or cyberproxy, allowing users to exist in the digital world with a unique, changeable, and privacy-preserving identity. The digital twin or clone fingerprint is generated using deep neural networks combined with a user-specific token/key. This approach allows third parties to process and store the proxy biometrics without putting the user&#39;s personal information at risk. We suggest that this approach could provide a safer and more secure alternative to traditional biometric security systems.},

  abstract  = {Face detectors are a subset of object detectors that output, at a minimum, a set of locations in an image if and where human faces are present. Face detection is challenging, in part, due to low variance in the structural content of frontal-view faces (i.e., most faces have two eyes, a nose and a mouth) and high variance in visual appearance. This aspect of the domain skews detectors to higher false positive rates as a consequence of many patches of imagery containing features spatially consistent with frontal-view faces. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three state-of-the-art face detectors (BlazeFace, MTCNN, and SCRFD) on frontal-view face imagery in a novel human-labeled dataset of 64,104 images with reliable ground truth. We show evidence that modern CNN-based models rely heavily on low-level image features, in spite of their powerful capability to learn complex, discriminatory visual features and concepts. We do this by altering the spectral and color content of frontal-view face images. To gain a better understanding of detector failures, we apply the Deep Dream technique to enhance image features that lead models to false positives.},

  abstract  = {Some unique characteristics of biological data are (1) that they are always High-Dimension and Low-Sample-Size (HDLSS) and (2) there are changes in the data distribution, such as an imbalance in classes, distribution and covariate shifts, etc. In this paper, we propose a Group Lasso with Checkpoints SElection (GL_CSE) algorithm to tackle both issues. To address the first issue, we utilize a group Lasso regression model tailored for HDLSS data to perform feature selection on predefined groups of features, alleviating overfitting and being invariant under group-wise orthogonal reparameterizations. To address the second issue, we propose the checkpoint selection method to extract important model checkpoints while training on group Lasso via two proposed metrics, i.e., the average KL-divergence between training and validation features and the Frobenius error of the covariance matrices between training and validation features. Both metrics aim to select model checkpoints with minimal drifts between the training and validation features. The results of our experiments indicate that our proposed GL_CSE algorithm achieves better performance compared to other baseline methods in terms of the MSE and R 2 measurements. Specifically, on the biological age dataset, our GL_CSE method achieves 0.8799 and 0.9883 for the MSE and R2 measurements, respectively. Additionally, we also show that our proposed checkpoint selection method performs better than regular K-fold cross-validation. Specifically, on the biological age dataset, GL_CSE (Q2) achieves 0.9045 MSE and 0.9880 R2, respectively, which outperforms the regular K-fold cross-validation results, i.e., 1.0612 MSE and 0.9871 R2, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a surgical procedure for large kidney stone removal through an incision in the patient&#39;s back. To gain kidney access, the surgeon steers a needle towards the kidney while simultaneously controlling the position and orientation of a US probe to keep the needle in the image plane. To successfully reach the kidney while avoiding delicate structures, a significant level of skill and precision is required. To alleviate the surgeon&#39;s cognitive workload, robot-assisted needle tracking can be implemented to autonomously track the needle in the US images and adjust the US probe&#39;s position and orientation such that the same portion of the needle is visible in the images. This paper presents a US-guided visual servoing (VS) algorithm to track the translation and rotation of a needle in a plane. Image features representing the desired pose of the needle in the image are defined, through which an interaction matrix is devised to relate the rate of the change of the image features in US images to the required position and orientation of the US probe connected to a robotic manipulator. Experimental results in 4 experimental scenarios in a water tank demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in tracking the needle in real-time with an accuracy of 2.6 mm with a control rate of 20 Hz. Although VS has been used to track surgical targets in the past, this paper proposes the first implementation of VS for needle tracking in longitudinal US images subjected to 3-DOF motion in a plane without any prior knowledge of needle trajectory or additional position sensors.},

The UAV itself is an underactuated nonlinear system posing significant control challenges. Recent research on this topic has shown promising results and interesting modelling methods such as the Udwadia-Kalaba method has been proposed, to model the loaded system.

  abstract  = {Roadmap-based path planning is a well-established method for multi-robot systems, where the free space of the environment is represented as a roadmap graph. The Voronoi diagram is known for its efficiency in creating roadmaps for single-robot systems due to its ability to generate paths with high clearance from obstacles. However, the design of the Voronoi diagram does not allow for redundant paths, as only one path is obtained between each pair of obstacles. In contrast, multi-robot path planning requires multiple path options for efficient solutions. Therefore, we propose redundant Voronoi roadmap graph, which incorporates multiple paths computed from the Voronoi diagram. In this approach, we introduce imaginary obstacles to modify the costmap and obtain a roadmap with more paths. Our proposed roadmap retains the high clearance feature of the Voronoi diagram and is suitable for multi-robot systems due to the availability of alternative route options. We demonstrate that our method can generate roadmaps in various simulated environments with different levels of redundancy. Additionally, we verify the efficiency of our proposed roadmap graph through graph analysis and multi-robot path planning experiments. Comparative analysis shows that the use of the proposed roadmap increases the success rate and solution quality compared to the roadmap obtained directly from the conventional Voronoi diagram.},

The results of the experiment were compared with the human ROM reported in previous studies, and it was found that the developed robotic forearm could achieve a ROM similar to that of humans.

An edge addition strategy is proposed as an alternative optimization method in this paper. Nested Ring Structure (NRS), whereby each node&#39;s edges connect its nearest neighbors along the backbone direction, have exhibited robust controllability against random attacks. Therefore, The Nested Edge Addition (NEA) strategy is proposed, which enhances network controllability by building NRS through edge addition to a given initial network. With a small number of added edges, NEA can rapidly enhance network controllability, allowing the network to be controlled using just one driver node. The more nested edges are added, the stronger the NRS in a network, thus exhibiting better controllability robustness. The effectiveness of NEA is verified by simulations on both synthetic and real-world networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that NEA is an efficient strategy for designing network topology and optimizing real-world networks.},

In this paper, we propose TDID, a Transparent and efficient Decentralized IDentity management system with blockchain. The key insight behind TDID is to manage the registration and authentication of DIDs via smart contracts, and design Structured Merkle Patricia Tree (SMPT) as an underlying data structure to store identity data on blockchain. The smart contract based processes can improve transparency of decentralized identity management, while the SMPT data structure can realize efficient storage of DID data. We implement and evaluate TDID on different identity management operations, and the experimental results show that TDID can achieve about 3.1 times for write operation and 6.3 times for read operation while improving the transparency of DID management.},

  abstract  = {The rapid development of the AI industry had led to the widespread utilization of numerous edge devices in the real world. However, AI services still heavily rely on high-performance computing systems, which means that these devices are not being effectively utilized. To address these issues, EdgeCPS technology has emerged. EdgeCPS is a technology that supports the seamless execution of various services, including AI applications, through the interconnection of edge devices and edge servers, as well as resource and function augmentation. In order to appropriately utilize edge devices in an EdgeCPS environment, the paper proposes an EdgeCPS-AI knowledge sharing model for supporting computing partition services. The proposed EdgeCPS-AI knowledge is represented as a graph, which systematically structures AI service-related information that arises on virtual and physical edge devices. This knowledge provides not only partitioned AI weighted models in order to support the characteristics of EdgeCPS, but also enables flexible provision of various information required for AI services. Thus, this approach can facilitate the reconstruction of AI services according to service requirements and maximize the utilization of edge devices. To achieve this, a microservice-based computing partition AI service is devised and experimentally proven by constructing a Kubernetes system using 8 heterogeneous edge devices and a graph DB system consisting of 2,762 nodes. Experimental results show that performing computing partition services on edge devices is significantly more efficient in terms of overall resource consumption, with up to 85.57\% improvement, as compared to performing the same tasks on high-performance computing systems.},

However, most existing leader-follower-relationship based models ignore the influence of normal individuals and do not consider the feedback effect of opinion difference on individuals, which are important for opinion spread. In this paper, inspired by two well-known social theories: Emotional Mobilization and Social Judgement Theory, we first propose a method to identify individual influence factor based on both network topology and personal behavior attributes. Then, we propose a novel opinion evolution model named Dynamic Adaptive Individual Weighting model which focuses on individual heterogeneity and considers the opinion difference assimilation effect. In this model, the influence weight of an agent&#39;s neighbour on the agent can be dynamically affected by their opinion difference and adaptively adjusted based on the neighbour&#39;s relative influence factor. Moreover, environmental noise is also introduced to assimilate realistic situations&#39; uncertainty. Experimental results on 12 real and 2 generated network datasets show that our proposed model can precisely reflect the evolution process and trend of opinions over different social networks. The study can enable decision-makers better understand the fundamental processes of opinion diffusion and design more efficient strategies for political or business activities.},

  abstract  = {Chaotic resonance, resembling stochastic resonance, is induced by internal fluctuations (i.e., chaos). This phenomenon has been observed in numerous systems. The most representative form of chaotic resonance is the synchronization with respect to weak applied signals under chaos-chaos intermittency, where a chaotic orbit moves among multiple attractors. Chaotic resonance exhibits higher sensitivity than stochastic resonance, but its engineering applications are limited by concerns such as the requirement to adjust the state of chaos by internal system parameters to induce chaotic resonance rather than the external noise strength. However, achieving this adjustment is challenging, especially in biological systems. Therefore, to handle this limitation, we proposed a novel double-Gaussian-filtered reduced region of orbit (RRO) method (called the DG-RRO method) for obtaining perturbed feedback signals lower than the conventional RRO method. This DG-RRO feedback signal is determined by the inverse sign of the map function and double-Gaussian filters around the local maximum/minimum values of the map. Because of its fine local specification, the DG-RRO feedback signal induces a chaotic resonance by one-third the feedback strength of the conventional signal. This method may pave the way for using chaotic resonance in engineering applications.},

  abstract  = {Nature-inspired population-based stochastic search algorithms (SSA) have demonstrated effectiveness in solving many real-world dynamic optimization problems (DOPs), such as dynamic optimal power flow (DOPF) problems. The basic idea of solving DOPs using SSAs is to “track the moving optima”, rather than solving the changed problems from scratch. Its hidden assumption is that the problems are slightly changed in general, and it is expected that the search process can be accelerated by learning from past search experiences. However, the hidden assumption that the current search process can always benefit from previous search experiences might not be true for certain cases. For example, if the current problem is not similar to any of its previous problems, the historical solutions might not be helpful for the current search. To reduce such negative transfer, the following issues are worthy of study: how to choose which historical problems to learn from, and how to determine the degree of learning from historical problems. To solve the above problems, we propose a dynamic processing framework based on fuzzy rules from the perspective of incorporating human knowledge for optima tracking. The experimental results on the DOPF problems show that the SSA with the proposed optima tracking strategy outperforms other comparative algorithms.

In this paper, we empirically study the effect of noise range, sample size and resampling type on the solution quality of MOEAs when noise is added to decision variables. Our empirical results, conducted on three commonly used Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOEAs), i.e. NSGA-II, MOEA/D and IBEA, demonstrate that noise range has more significant impact on the robustness of optimization algorithms compared to sample size and resampling type. In addition, we introduce the concept of bad point, which is able to illustrate how noise affects the performance of different MOEAs.},

The novelties in the model include the DE differential mutation and crossover operators as the main search engine and a non-dominated sorting selection scheme. Experimental results on two benchmark test suites and eight real-world CMOPs suggested that the proposed model reached better overall performance than the original model.},

  abstract  = {Condition-based maintenance is becoming increasingly important in hydraulic systems. However, anomaly detection for these systems remains challenging, especially since that anomalous data is scarce and labeling such data is tedious and even dangerous. Therefore, it is advisable to make use of unsupervised or semi-supervised methods, especially for semi-supervised learning which utilizes unsupervised learning as a feature extraction mechanism to aid the supervised part when only a small number of labels are available. This study systematically compares semi-supervised learning methods applied for anomaly detection in hydraulic condition monitoring systems. Firstly, thorough data analysis and feature learning were carried out to understand the open-sourced hydraulic condition monitoring dataset. Then, various methods were implemented and evaluated including traditional standalone semi-supervised learning models (e.g., one-class SVM, Robust Covariance), ensemble models (e.g., Isolation Forest), and deep neural network based models (e.g., autoencoder, Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)). Typically, this study customized and implemented an extreme learning machine based semi-supervised HELM model and verified its superiority over other semi-supervised methods. Extensive experiments show that the customized HELM model obtained state-of-the-art performance with the highest accuracy (99.5\%), the lowest false positive rate (0.015), and the best F1-score (0.985) beating other semi-supervised methods.},

LDAM loss, which minimizes a margin-based generalization bound, is widely utilized for class-imbalanced image classification. Although, by using LDAM loss, it is possible to obtain large margins for the minority classes and small margins for the majority classes, the relevance to a large margin, which is included in the original softmax cross entropy loss, is not be clarified yet. In this study, we reconvert the formula of LDAM loss using the concept of the large margin softmax cross entropy loss based on the softplus function and confirm that LDAM loss includes a wider large margin than softmax cross entropy loss. Furthermore, we propose a novel Enlarged Large Margin (ELM) loss, which can further widen the large margin of LDAM loss. ELM loss utilizes the large margin for the maximum logit of the incorrect class in addition to the basic margin used in LDAM loss. Through experiments conducted on imbalanced CIFAR datasets and large-scale datasets with long-tailed distribution, we confirmed that classification accuracy was much improved compared with LDAM loss and conventional losses for imbalanced classification.},

In contrast, rule- based extraction methods have better interpretability, but typically require domain experts to manually establish rules, limiting their generalization ability. In industry, there is often a demand for reliable knowledge extraction to reduce the time spent on manual verification of each piece of knowledge. In this paper, we explore the idea of combining GPT and symbolic-based methods to automatically discover reliable extraction patterns in text with a particular writing style. This method leverages the characteristics of high information density and similar writing patterns in text with a specific writing style to generate verifiable and reliable patterns. We conduct experiments on two datasets with a specific writing style to demonstrate its effectiveness, validating the idea of combining large models for reliable information extraction pattern discovery in the tested datasets.},

  abstract  = {Data pruning is the method selecting a subset from an entire training dataset while maintaining the performance after training. Most pruning metrics measure the difficulty of each training sample for the target task and select the hardest samples first. The “hardest-first sampling” works well when the pruning ratio is low (the pruned dataset is large). However, while the pruning ratio increases, the performance decreases significantly and get worse than the random pruning. This is because the hardest samples are the special samples of the class, and a model trained on few hardest samples specializes in them and drops its performance. For solving this problem, we propose a new metric: AgreementLoss. This is computed from two classifier models trained on two datasets obtained by the disjoint decomposition of the original dataset. By the dataset decomposition, the predictions of the models are more different for a sample since either of them trains each sample in the original dataset. The metric is defined as the positive or negative loss value of the trained either model, depending on two predictions agree or disagree. This metric represents the difficulty of each sample, while extremely difficult “noisy” samples get lower scores by the negative sign. By selecting samples in descending order of the AgreementLoss scores, we can reduce the priority of the “noisy” samples. Experiments on various datasets show that our method gets stable performance over all pruning ratio and outperforms other metrics especially when the pruning ratio is high.},

Although these efforts proved effective, they only focused on the information of the user itself and ignores self-supervised signals from other users. Due to the widely observed homogeneity in recommender systems, these signals from other users are also vital for user representation. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Self-Supervised Learning based on Similar users for Sequential Recommendation (SSLSRec). We present a contrastive learning objective in SSLSRec to consider augmented views from the same user and similar users as positive samples. Moreover, we propose novel Insert and Substitute augmentation methods to construct more reasonable augmentation views for user sequences.

The study uses keyword spotting as a downstream task and shows that the models are very vulnerable to attacks, even at high SNRs. The paper also investigates the transferability of attacks between models and analyses the generated noise patterns in order to develop more effective defence mechanisms.

This system can detect getting-up from a bed in real-time using machine learning with Edge AI. To evaluate the basic performance of the proposed system, a protocol was applied for four subjects, and data were collected. Alert accuracy rate and false alert rate were used as evaluation metrics, and a model was built using data from three of the subjects and evaluated with the remaining subject, which was repeated for all four subjects. For high-risk bed-leaving behavior, medium-risk pre-bed-leaving behavior, and low-risk get-up behavior, the alert accuracy rate (i.e., Recall) was 89.4\%, 97.5\%, and 86.3\%, respectively, and the false alert rate (1-Precision) was 6.3\%, 10.2\%, and 0.0\%, respectively. This confirmed the possibility of predicting rising behavior with high accuracy. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, a real-time get-up detection system was developed, and its practicality was demonstrated. Future challenges include reevaluating feature extraction and evaluating the performance of the proposed system with a diverse range of subjects of different ages, genders, and health statuses.},

We started from an initial MTANN module that had been trained with an initial set of polyps and non-polyps. We applied the trained initial module to polyps and non-polyps to analyze the weakness of the initial module. We arranged the output scores of the initial module to form a score scale in receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) space, representing the “degree of difficulty” in distinction between polyps and non-polyps by the initial module. Based on the score-space, several sets of training polyps and non-polyps with different degrees of difficulties were determined. We trained several MTANN modules with the several sets of training samples so that each module became an expert at a certain level of difficulty. We then combined expert modules with a mixing module to form a “mixture of expert” MTANNs. Our database consisted of CT colonography datasets acquired from 100 patients, including 26 polyps. The mixture of expert MTANNs with the ensemble training method distinguished all polyps correctly from more than 50\% of the non-polyps. We compared the effectiveness of the ensemble training with that of training with manually selected cases. The performance of the mixture of expert MTANNs with ensemble training method was superior to that of the “reference-standard” MTANNs trained with manually selected cases, which could reduce the cost of the manual selection.},

Its symptoms include motor impairments such as bradykinesia, muscle stiffness, tremor at rest, and postural dysreflexia, as well as non-motor impairments such as depression and autonomic neuropathy. One measure to evaluate Parkinson&#39;s disease is the Unified Parkinson&#39;s Disease Rating Scale. One of the items in this scale that evaluate bradykinesia, one of the motor symptoms, is the finger tapping test. However, many of the expressions used there are subjective, and the evaluation criteria are ambiguous. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a quantitative hand movement evaluation system using MediaPipe Hands, to analyze finger tapping test, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. With this developed system, hand movements can be analyzed by using a webcam. Hand motion was analyzed by calculating the length between hand joints, the speed of joint movement, and the angle between joints. To evaluate the accuracy of the system, we first measured the length between the joints of the fingers as the hand was moved away from and closer to the camera, and then examined the error. Then, the finger tapping test was conducted using the developed system to evaluate the bradykinesia. Accuracy evaluations have shown that MediaPipe Hands can detect hand movements with high accuracy. The finger tapping test also revealed that there was reproducibility in the magnitude of each finger movement, but not in the speed of the movement.},

Therefore, the use of Blood oxygenation level-dependant magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD MRI) has been investigated as a method for prenatal diagnosis of FGR. This paper proposes a FGR estimation method using placenta region in time-series BOLD MRI. The proposed method extracted placenta region semi-automatically using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) on the time-series BOLD MRI, and input time-series radiomics features in the placental region into Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to estimate FGR/non-FGR status of patient. As a result, the semi-automatic extraction of the placental region achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.774 at the final frame where the extraction accuracy would be decreased due to propagation. And the result of 4-fold cross validation test, FGR/non-FGR were predicted in F-measure of 0.773, 0.745, 0.794 and 0.800, respectively.},

  abstract  = {In total knee arthroplasty, nearly 100 types of surgical instruments are prepared in addition to the usual surgical instruments. Since there are many types of surgical instruments used and their shapes and sizes are similar, accidents due to incorrect selection of implants have occurred. In addition, there is concern that the shortage of nurses will accelerate around the world in the future. For these reasons, we developed a surgical instrument detection system for total knee arthroplasty to reduce the incidence of accidents and the burden on scrub nurses. The surgical instrument detection system in the previous study required a lot of labor and time to create training data. Also, when increasing the number of surgical instruments to be detected, it was necessary to retrain all the surgical instruments. To solve these problems, we developed an automatic annotation system using a turntable in this study. In addition, we develop learning and inference methods using standard objects. In the experiment, we verified the accuracy of the learning data created by the automatic annotation system and verified the object detection accuracy for five types of surgical instruments. As a result, all experiments showed the effectiveness of this system.},

  abstract  = {Planning ship routes that take into account meteorological and oceanographic conditions is a salient problem for both commercial and Naval applications. The A* algorithm is a very common method for finding the minimum cost path in a graph. Finding appropriate heuristics for a cost function is critical to the computational efficiency and memory requirements of the A* algorithm. We propose heuristic evaluation functions (HEFs) based on the minimum, mean, median, and mode of the cost function values over the reachable nodes given time constraints. Only the HEF based on the minimum is admissible, but we show that the other heuristics are able to find near-optimal solutions in substantially shorter times than the Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm, which does not use a heuristic. We evaluate these heuristics over many scenarios and show that overall the HEF based on the mean value performs the best. This HEF can be used in time-critical applications where an occasional loss of optimality is sacrificed for faster run time, such as real-time planning and control, or as part of a multi-objective shortest path algorithm for planning and execution.},

Existing crack depth measurement methods are time-consuming, expensive, and cannot measure a wide area. In comparison, the proposed method can measure the depth of cracks in a short time and over a wide area by stereo matching only two aerial images. In addition, the drone&#39;s movement extends the baseline length, which increases the resolution in the height direction, resulting in precise depth measurements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we took aerial images of cracks made of Styrofoam using shooting equipment made of aluminum frame and measured their depth. We realized stable millimeter-order crack depth measurements and achieved millimeter-order height resolution of 1.404 millimeters, and achieved 0.14 percent and 0.13 percent errors for 5 centimeters and 15 centimeters deep cracks, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) can provide real-time positioning information for outdoor users, but cannot for indoor scenarios or heavily occluded outdoor scenarios. Strap-down Inertial Navigation System (SINS) are widely used to locate people in complex interior or heavily occluded outdoor scenarios due to its light weight and low power consumption. However, IMU of SINS are noisy, and the sampling data error is large, which is a divergence of the error with time. Therefore, it will generate a positioning accumulation error, which affects the final positioning accuracy. The problem of cumulative IMU errors is usually dealt with by Zero-Velocity Update (ZUPT). The zero-velocity detection part of basic ZUPT method usually uses a single threshold to determine the gait of pedestrian, which often has the problem of gait misjudgment and omission. To address these problems, this paper proposes a composite conditional detection method to solve the problem of misjudgment in the zero-velocity interval. In addition, we redesign the zero-velocity update algorithm and uses the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) for pedestrian positioning error correction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ZUPT method based on dual-threshold detection can better detect the interval between pedestrian motion and stationery than ones with single threshold. The zero-velocity update algorithm based on CKF has higher performance than conventional EKF and UKF methods, which constrains the cumulative error of SINS to about 0.2\% of the whole walking distance.},

  abstract  = {Emergency vehicles (EVs) are crucial in responding to time-critical events such as traffic accidents, medical emergencies, and fires in urban areas. Most traffic control approaches try to reduce the travel time of EVs by giving them the highest road-use priority, which may cause delays for other nearby traffic participants and reduce the smoothness of normal traffic. This work proposes a novel approach to reduce both the travel time of an EV and the negative impact on normal traffic by dynamically evacuating traffic adjacent to an emergency path. The approach periodically acquires a subnet for each road segment of the emergency path based on dynamic traffic conditions. Regular vehicles on the subnet are restricted from using the emergency path, which minimizes the time for emergency service delivery. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approach in many metrics, such as the travel time of the EV and the additional delay of normal traffic. In addition, this work performs sensitivity analysis on regular vehicles&#39; compliance rate to evacuation. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach at different compliance rates.},

However, there is a lack of effort in exploring Human Extended Reality Interaction (HXRI)-based concepts to design effective training environments that corroborate the actual training procedure. In this paper, an HXRI-based multi-level approach has been proposed for the creation of XR-based training environments. The multi-level approach takes advantage of both Virtual and Mixed Reality to create a holistic training environment while eliminating the disadvantage arising from using stand-alone VR and MR-based training environments. The approach was based on the results of an exhaustive study in which medical personnel interacted with VR and MR environments to train in an orthopedic surgical procedure. The approach, design, and development of the XR environments, the study, and the results from the study which underscore the importance of such a multi-level approach are presented in the paper.},

  abstract  = {Upper Limb (UL) Rehabilitation in Multiple Scle- rosis (MS) is an open research field due to the complex interplay between cognitive and physical dysfunctions. Virtual Reality (VR) can face such an issue by enriching physical training with engaging features, including biofeedback strategies to self- regulate autonomic functions according to the visualisation of indices like heart rate variability (HRV). In the present work, HRV biofeedback is introduced in a VR-based exergame (a game designed to promote exercising), tailored to rehabilitation of the dominant upper limb in Persons with MS (PwMS). The exergame is based on a dual-task paradigm, integrating a UL motor rehabilitative task with a breathing task. The aim is to investigate how the design developed for the HRV biofeedback affects engagement and performance during the exergame session. As a preliminary study, sixteen able-bodied subjects are tested in a within-subjects design, to assess the quality of the game features and design, before approaching MS patients. Two conditions are presented, with and without biofeedback. The proposed HRV biofeedback has two possible levels, depending on whether or not the desired respiratory rate of six breaths/min is successfully maintained. It is used to control game elements and change difficulty of the session. The main finding of this study is that biofeedback improves both user performance and experience in healthy subjects. These results underline the great potential of this technique to promote engagement. Thus, they point to fostering the rehabilitative effectiveness of repetitive motor tasks and encouraging adherence to the long- term training. Future studies will encompass fine tuning of the experimental setup and include PwMS to further adjust the game to patients&#39; needs and observe the setup compliance to rehabilitation settings.},

Each input modality has two steps: 1) pointing to the desired button, and 2) the selection of the item. We compare the hand laser pointer with trigger selection, the head laser pointer with trigger selection, and the head laser pointer with the dwell time selection (no need to use the hands). In addition, we propose new types of visual feedback: for all the input modalities, we display in the field of view of the user the last 5 letters. For the modality with the dwell time, we add a circular progress bar around the field of view of the user to provide a constant awareness of the possible button selection. The proposed virtual keyboard input modalities were assessed by 32 participants. The results support the conclusion that the hand pointer with the trigger control provides the best speed compared to other modalities.},

In this paper, we explored the potential of a setting for Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR, where a display augments a surface without making the user wear any visor) in two conditions of a lower limb ownership training involving subjects without disabilities. In the first condition, the subject must contract the quadriceps of a leg for commanding (through electromyography, EMG) a virtual leg (a 3D model of the Hybrid Knee prosthesis) to kick a virtual wall: each collision corresponds to a vibratory feedback on the thigh (a position defined for upcoming tests with transfemural amputees). The second condition adds a social context to engage the user: the subject is asked to cooperate with another (fictional) player to kick on the same virtual wall. Subjective (through questionnaires) and objective (according to the number of kicks as a performance index, and the proprioceptive drift as an embodiment index) assessments have been performed before a rubber leg illusion test. Overall, we observed how the cooperative task can engage the subject to be more active. However, this condition can reduce the impact of the training on the embodiment itself, probably because the social task generates a distraction. Nevertheless, such findings suggest the possibility to alternate these two tasks in the same session to increase the duration of a prosthetic embodiment training.},

  abstract  = {The rise of AR/VR has led to an increased demand for 3D content. However, the traditional method of creating 3D content using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a labor-intensive and skill-demanding process, making it difficult to use for novice users. Sketch-based 3D modeling provides a promising solution by leveraging the intuitive nature of human-computer interaction. However, generating high-quality content that accurately reflects the creator&#39;s ideas can be challenging due to the sparsity and ambiguity of sketches. Furthermore, novice users often find it challenging to create accurate drawings from multiple perspectives or follow step-by-step instructions in existing methods. To address this, we introduce a groundbreaking end-to-end approach in our work, enabling 3D modeling from a single free-hand sketch, Deep3DSketch+\+. The issue of sparsity and ambiguity using single sketch is resolved in our approach by leveraging the symmetry prior and structural-aware shape discriminator. We conducted comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets, including both synthetic and real data, to validate the efficacy of our approach and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Users are also more satisfied with results generated by our approach according to our user study. We believe our approach has the potential to revolutionize the process of 3D modeling by offering an intuitive and easy-to-use solution for novice users.},

  abstract  = {In crowdsourced delivery organizations, where individual vehicles with shared common goals may have conflicting individual interests, the preference is for collaboration over competition, provided it is less costly. However, achieving a balance between the efficiency of individual vehicles and the overall fleet poses a challenge. This paper introduces a novel Vehicle Routing Problem with Fair Profits and Time Windows (VRP-FPTW), which aims to meet customer demand and stringent time windows while maximizing the profit of the worst-off vehicle in the fleet. We propose a centralized and distributed vehicle routing model for this problem, both with quality of solution guarantees. The distributed approach is tailored for multi-agent systems relying on a coordination mechanism where each vehicle modeled as an individually rational agent finds its route autonomously in coordination with a fleet coordinator agent, without sharing its private information. The objective of a vehicle agent is to maximize its own profit while following the fleet&#39;s norms and regulations based on shared values. Simulation experiments provide compelling evidence of the robustness and scalability of the proposed distributed approach, showcasing significant enhancements in both solution quality and computational efficiency, particularly when dealing with larger vehicle fleets.},

Computer vision-based methods have been used extensively in recent years to tackle the problem of parking lot management, but most of the works assume that the parking spots are manually labeled, impacting the cost and feasibility of deployment. To fill this gap, this work presents an automatic parking space detection method, which receives a sequence of images of a parking lot and returns a list of coordinates identifying the detected parking spaces. The proposed method employs instance segmentation to identify cars and, using vehicle occurrence, generate a heat map of parking spaces. The results using twelve different subsets from the PKLot and CNRPark-EXT parking lot datasets show that the method achieved an AP25 score up to 95.60\% and AP50 score up to 79.90\%.},

The system is capable of detecting around 10 vehicles even with just one camera, and is able to track vehicles with the same ID as they enter and pass through the parking lot. Furthermore, it proposes a method to map the locations of vehicles on real-world maps, allowing for accurate estimation of parking occupancy. The system achieved high accuracy in vehicle detection and tracking, with a 98.4\% recall rate and 100\% tracking accuracy. The accuracy of parking occupancy estimation was calculated using root mean square error, with an average error of 0.24m and a maximum error of 0.36m. The results demonstrate the feasibility of detecting and tracking vehicles, as well as estimating parking occupancy, in parking lots without parking lines using only one camera. Further testing on multiple sites, including nighttime and adverse weather conditions, is needed to increase the reliability of the system.},

  abstract  = {Complete and valid spatio-temporal traffic data play a vital role in intelligent transportation systems applications, such as congestion avoidance and route guidance. However, traffic data from real-world scenarios is usually incomplete or corrupted due to communication or sensors malfunctions, which makes the traffic analytics difficult. Since traffic data contains complex spatio-temporal patterns, it is very challenging to develop an efficient learning model that can accurately recover incomplete traffic data. To tackle this issue, this work propose a Tucker Decomposition-based Latent factorization of tensors (TDL) model with two interesting ideas: 1) modeling spatio-temporal traffic data as an incomplete third-order tensor and building a Tucker decomposition based learning objective according to the density-oriented principle for precisely recovering missing traffic data; and 2) adopting a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control principle-incorporated parameters learning scheme for achieving high computational efficiency. Empirical studies on four traffic speed datasets generated from different cities demonstration that the proposed TDL model achieves significant performance gain in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared with state-of-the-art models.},

However, VDS has limitations. For example, in actual driving situations such as intersections or exits, each lane may have different traffic conditions, revealing the limitations of traffic information provided by conventional VDS. In this paper, we propose a methodology to efficiently monitor the traffic condition and safety on the road by utilizing a LiDAR sensor installed on a vehicle to collect continuous traffic information about surrounding vehicles. To implement the Mobile Detection System (MDS), we collect point cloud data from LiDAR and detect the position and size of vehicles using a deep learning-based voxel-RCNN. We then convert the data into traffic information for analysis. Furthermore, we propose an efficient method for analyzing road hazards by introducing the MTTC method based on the TTC for hazard assessment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare its reliability with that of conventional VDS and perform road hazards analysis using LiDAR-based probe vehicles with data collected directly from highways in Korea.},

We consider a human operator moving the position of an end effector of a haptic device as the velocity command input to the UAV. The CBF is applied as a constraint to maintain the collision-free motion of the UAV for safety. On the other hand, to preserve the stability of the system, we consider passivity as another constraint together, but it leads to undesired behavior of an optimal solution for haptic feedback. To deal with the issue, the strategy called energy tank for passivity is included to replace the condition of strict output passivity. The aforementioned designs are formalized as a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) to solve numerically. Through numerical examples, we have a comprehensive discussion about the features of the proposed controller with better safety. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method in practice.},

Therefore, the mobile robot with IC could function solely in familiar environments. To make IC applicable in unfamiliar environments, this study proposes a novel method, instant IC, that eliminates the requirement for a pre-prepared virtual environment. The proposed robot system can instantly generate a virtual environment using actual 360° images of the robot in motion, utilizing instant neural graphics primitives and neural radiance fields. The 360° images allow the entire surrounding environment to be virtualized without requiring specific camera orientations. In addition, by optimizing the density of neural radiance fields using depth estimation results beforehand, the reconstruction accuracy at unknown poses can be guaranteed. Furthermore, we propose a depth scaling method based on the actual measurements obtained by LiDAR to increase the consistency of virtual and real environments. With this instant virtual environment, the proposed system enables teleoperation in unknown environments via the seamless transition between real and virtual environments. The experimental results exhibit consistent and smooth back-and-forth transitions between virtual and real space in mobile robot teleoperation.},

Whereas the state-of-the-art sacrifices agility for stability by restricting the vehicle domain to operate in the open-loop stable regime, this paper expands existing shared control approaches to ensure safety outside the open-loop stable region. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control framework balances a cost to follow the driver&#39;s commands and costs for safety, such that it does not disturb the driver in safe states and intervenes only when necessary in dangerous states seamlessly. Specifically, a novel cost function is formulated to incorporate driver intent, while ensuring safety through costs on the maximum phase recovery envelope and track bounds. Ensuring sufficient model fidelity for drifting is achieved through a nonlinear bicycle model that incorporates a nonlinear tire model and wheelspeed dynamics. Circular drifting experiments with a full-scale vehicle demonstrate the ability of the controller to follow driver commands in safe states, while augmenting the driver commands to avoid situations of track bound violation and spin-out when drifting a circle.},

To alleviate these predicaments, this paper designs a random pairwise competition based ant selection for pheromone updating. Specifically, a number of ants are randomly selected from the ant colony and then are randomly paired together. Subsequently the better one in each pair is selected to update the pheromone matrix. In this way, a good balance between search diversity and search convergence is potentially maintained. Integrating this selection strategy along with a local search scheme into the ACO framework, a new ACO algorithm called random pairwise competition based ACO (RPCACO) is developed. Experiments conducted on 8 TSP instances from the TSPLIB benchmark set demonstrate that RPCACO is more effective and efficient than the five classical ACO algorithms in solving TSP.},

The key to mutation lies in the selection of parent individuals participating in the mutation. Along this road, this paper devises a binomial distribution-assisted individual selection strategy for DE. Specifically, this paper takes advantage of the probability distribution function of the binomial distribution to assign weights to individuals based on their fitness rankings. In this way, the selection of individuals focuses more on medium better individuals instead of the top best ones. Therefore, high mutation diversity can be preserved and thus it is likely that falling into local regions can be effectively avoided. Embedding this selection strategy into DE, a novel DE variant called binomial distribution assisted DE (BDDE) is developed. Experiments conducted on the CEC2017 benchmark suite have verified the effectiveness of BDDE in solving optimization problems. Particularly, BDDE gains much better performance against the well-known and representative mutation strategies.},

The anomalies are detected using a threshold approach, where data points that fall outside a certain threshold are considered as anomalies.

  abstract  = {Multiple traveling salesmen problem (MTSP) is an extension of traditional traveling salesman problem (TSP). It involves both the city assignment optimization and the route optimization of each salesman. Genetic algorithms (GA) have been widely used to solve MTSP thanks to its easiness in implementation and good global search ability. To help GA effectively solve MTSP, researchers have developed various encoding schemes. However, there is no systematic and comparative study on the effectiveness of these encoding strategies. To fill this gap, this paper conducts investigations to compare four popular encoding strategies for MTSP, namely the one-chromosome encoding, the two-chromosome encoding, the two-part-chromosome encoding and the multi-chromosome encoding. Experimental results on different MTSP instances with different numbers of cities and salesmen show that the multi-chromosome encoding is far better than the other encoding strategies.},

From this reason, the easy and frequent assessment of the locomotive function thought the people&#39;s daily lives is strongly expected. One of the promising methods to evaluate locomotive function is the Timed Up and Go test (TUG test), which is a widely used method in the field of physical therapy for locomotive rehabilitation in medical facilities. Throughout our research activities, we have been investigating robotic approaches to assess cognitive and motor functions of aged people in the purpose of their health expectancy extension. In this article, we will propose a novel method of a gait measurement system that will be incorporated with health care mobile robots developed previously.

This paper utilizes the actor-critic framework to resolve the WTA problem, and this framework enables retrieving solutions 23 times faster than the previous deep Q-network approach. Additionally, we incorporate a recurrent neural network model of gated recurrent units (GRU) to allow agents to learn the latent state-space of the WTA problem. Our experiments demonstrate the solution quality and the time efficiency compared to traditional heuristic methods as well as recent DQN-based RL models.},

Both approaches are shown to enforce constraints for a nonlinear second order system. NN-NL-RG requires a smaller dataset size as compared to NN-DTC for well-trained neural networks. For systems with multiple constraints, NN-NL-RG is also more computationally efficient than NN - DTC.

In GP-Tasking, each individual is trained with multiple fitness functions (where each function represents one task and has different training/testing sets). Empirical evidence demonstrated that the quality of evolved solutions is comparable to standard GP achieving significantly faster computational time while maintaining smaller evolved population sizes. In this work, we improved GP-Tasking allowing the system to accumulate knowledge and use them not only in multitasking, but also with different problems to mimic lifelong learning. We further introduced a new crossover mechanism to transfer useful knowledge across different tasks. Moreover, we introduced new population initialisation approach to accumulate knowledge across different domains. Experimental results of the new LLGP-Tasking demonstrate superiority of evolved solutions over standard GP and it maintained same search speed produced by its predecessor (i.e., GP-Tasking).},

However, the fault detection of the gas engine rotor system still faces challenges due to the difficulty of acquiring sensitive features and the lack of labeled data. To address these issues, we propose an improved DQN-based Transfer Reinforcement Learning method (Transfer-DQN) for robust gas turbine rotor fault diagnosis. The proposed method takes the collected one-dimensional raw vibration signal as input, with the fault sample set and fault category serving as the model environment and action. It uses a multi-scale one-dimensional wide convolutional neural network (M-WDCNN) with ∊-greedy strategy for Q-network fitting and decision making. Additionally, to consider the computational efficiency and differences between fault classes, Transfer-DQN uses multiple fault sample data as the source domain and a single fault class as the target domain, while performing the source-to-target domain transfer learning based on generative adversarial. Extensive experiments on the bearing dataset of Western Reserve University and our gas turbine test bench demonstrate the superiority of Transfer-DQN, achieving accuracies of 98.95\% and 96.91\%, respectively. Compared with baseline approaches, our method breaks through the previous upper limit of 95\% to meet the need for robust and efficient fault diagnosis.},

The maximum temperature thresholds for such systems are integrated in DIN EN ISO 13732–1. This paper presents a study on the effects of contact surface heating on thermal comfort in automotive interiors, with a particular focus on individuals with heat sensitivity impairments caused by polyneuropathy. Two groups of individuals, one with normal sensitivity and the other with impaired heat sensitivity due to polyneuropathy, were tested for their thermal perception and response to an overwarmed seat and steering wheel heating system. The study aimed to measure the temperature and time at which individuals in a Control and Experimental group would stop using an overwarmed contact surface heating on the steering wheel and seat. In addition, the thermal load on passengers in a vehicle environment was investigated to define time limits and temperature thresholds for comfortable and uncomfortable states when using contact surface heating systems. A BMW driving simulator was used to simulate a realistic in-vehicle experience. The results indicate that both groups could feel the heat but had significant differences in their threshold temperature and time to discontinue heating. The heat sensitivity impaired group had a more sensitive thermal perception compared to the normal sensitive group. The outcomes of this research offer valuable insights for the design and advancement of contact and surface heating systems in vehicles, specifically for individuals who suffer from heat sensitivity impairments.},

This paper sketches three transformations and introduces the concept of Cyber-Physical Humans as an inevitable result of their merger. Cyber-Physical Humans connect the cyberspace (back) with the physical space and derive their value in their capability to interact directly, or indirectly, with the physical world. This means that in the real world, we can encounter representations of people present in cyberspace for instance as holographic projection or as robotic avatar. Emerging technologies allow us to be present in the real world, in a digital world, in a remote world, or in multiple worlds at the same time. It is no longer hypothetical to be in the real world and talk with one colleague who is present through a holographic projection from the metaverse and another who is present through a robotic avatar operated in telepresence from a remote control station. These digital transformations will blur the lines between the real, the virtual, and the remote world with potentially huge consequences for the way we live, work and communicate. This predictably comes with great opportunities and risks amongst others health risks (isolation, problematic use, cyber sickness), and security &amp; privacy risks (deep-fakes, alternate presentations, spoofing, identity theft). It is important to address these risks to ensure that the benefits of Cyber-Physical Humans are maximized while minimizing the negative consequences.},

This approach is specifically designed for the task of point cloud registration. Finally, we search for the maximum overlap area by matching the spatial consistency between points and calculate the 3D transformation matrix to complete the registration process.

However, existing collaborative 3D object detectors in a fully supervised paradigm heavily rely on large-scale annotated 3D bounding boxes, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle this issue, we propose a sparsely supervised collaborative 3D object detection framework SSC3OD, which only requires each agent to randomly label one object in the scene. Specifically, this model consists of two novel components, i.e., the pillar-based masked autoencoder (Pillar-MAE) and the instance mining module. The Pillar-MAE module aims to reason over high-level semantics in a self-supervised manner, and the instance mining module generates high-quality pseudo labels for collaborative detectors online. By introducing these simple yet effective mechanisms, the proposed SSC3OD can alleviate the adverse impacts of incomplete annotations. We generate sparse labels based on collaborative perception datasets to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets reveal that our proposed SSC3OD can effectively improve the performance of sparsely supervised collaborative 3D object detectors.},

  abstract  = {Encountered-type haptics (ETH) is an emerging research field that enables unencumbered physical haptic interaction in virtual reality (VR). In this paper, we propose Encountered-type haptics (ETH) as an interaction medium for immersive remote teleoperation, facilitating intuitive bare-hand interaction with visuo-haptic feedback. Our system allows a human operator to control a remote robot immersively through the visual rendering of the VR environment, while interacting with a haptic robot at the user site. The ETH feedback rendering and the teleoperation at the remote site are both implemented using a 7 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) Franka Emika Panda robot under Cartesian-impedance control. The Cartesian goal poses for each robot are determined based on the pose of the operator&#39;s proxy hand in the VR environment and the operator&#39;s interaction intention, estimated through hand gestures and gaze direction. The impedances of both robots are updated at runtime to provide the operator with bilateral haptic interaction forces. Our system was evaluated through a user study involving a door-opening task under three teleoperation conditions: (1) without haptic feedback, (2) ETH feedback with constant impedance, and (3) ETH feedback with variable impedance. The results highlight the advantages of using ETH, including the ability to regulate forces at both the user and robot sites. ETH conditions demonstrate lower peak forces and reduced force jittering at the remote site. Furthermore, the variable impedance condition within ETH shows improved task execution times and reduced exerted force. This paper demonstrates that ETH is an effective medium for immersive bare-hand bilateral teleoperation.},

As with face-to-face experiences, these robot mediated encounters have social aspects that current commercially available MRP robots lack the capabilities to incorporate. In previous work, we integrated a manipulator onto a commercial telerobotic platform to enable expressive gestures and demonstrated that the gesturing capabilities enhanced the social connection between remote and local users. However, we also found that controlling the robot for complex interactions, such as a handshake, diminishes the remote user” s social experience. This paper presents the discovery of models for handshakes in different social contexts, which can be used in a shared-control architecture to reduce the effort on the remote user. Using a haptic measurement glove, force and inertia data was collected for human-human handshakes in various social contexts. By applying a k-nearest neighbor algorithm in combination with dynamic time warping and a support vector machine algorithm, two classification models are derived that predict the social context and can be used in an intelligent shared-control robot architecture.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in controlling blood glucose levels in a personalized way in type 1 diabetic patients. In this study, we investigate the impact of different activation functions and layer numbers on RL performance in blood glucose control. We train RL agents with various combinations of activation functions and layer numbers on a virtual patient model. The RL agents are evaluated based on their ability to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range while minimizing the frequency and magnitude of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events. Our results show that the choice of activation function and layer number significantly affects the RL performance. Specifically, the agents with ReLU activation functions and two or three hidden layers outperform the other agents, achieving a higher percentage of time in the target range and fewer hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of RL-based blood glucose control systems in type 1 diabetic patients.},

  abstract  = {Brain tumor segmentation has been a widely researched topic for decades, and it intensified ten years ago as a consequence of the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenges (BraTS), which provided and yearly updated a standard multi-spectral brain tumor MRI data set and a unified evaluation framework to the research community. This paper proposes a procedure for brain tumor segmentation, which uses a spatial histogram enhancement method to preprocess the data, and two identical cascaded U-net networks that work with 3D convolution. The first U-net accomplishes an intermediary segmentation of the brain volume, while the second one reevaluates the labels given to pixels based on the labels of neighbor pixels. The output of both U-nets are evaluated using statistical accuracy benchmarks. The proposed procedure achieved an average Dice score of 88.8\% on the high-grade glioma records of the BraTS 2019 training data set. Post-processing increased the average Dice score by 1.1\%, but in case of typical small high-grade tumor lesion it can achieve an improvement of up to 5\%.},

The use of an insulin bolus advisor may improve glycaemic control as well as reduce the burden of the disease on these patients. This paper investigates the application of an impulsive model predictive controller in a bolus advisor system. The bolus calculator is assessed in closed-loop simulations using different basal insulin scenarios. The simulations show that a model predictive controller can achieve good glycaemic control and may be suitable to give bolus recommendations to people with diabetes. Higher basal insulin levels can result in better times in the target range but also carry a higher risk of hypoglycemia.},

Thus, the control method — often model predictive control in artificial pancreas systems—must provide a non-negative control signal. Existing solutions include saturation and constrained optimization. In this paper, we propose a dynamic extension of the patient model as a way of ensuring the positivity of the control signal, a method previously applied in tumor growth control. We evaluate the controller in a closed-loop simulation and compare the results with a controller using saturation. Our simulations show that control performance with the extended model can reach or exceed the performance achieved with saturation.},

This is achieved through the administration of a combination of drugs that depress the central nervous system and can include intravenous injections, inhaled gases, or a combination of both. During the anesthesia maintenance phase, the events in surgery are not continuous, but obey a profile similar to that endorsed by event-based control. The present study considers event-based control as a natural solution to the control challenge of general anesthesia. Two fractional order Proportional Integral (PI) controllers are tuned and implemented using a decentralized approach to control a part of general anesthesia based on hemodynamic variables. The results show that this approach can be successfully used to keep Cardiac Output and Mean Arterial Pressure stable, with a special focus on patient safety, through fast detection of surgical stimulus and robustness to inter/intra patient variability.},

Within this context, the behavior of an agent with respect to a role is referred to as a process role. This research paper introduces a role engine that incorporates a trust establishment algorithm aimed at identifying optimal and reliable process roles. In our study, we define trust as a continuous value ranging from 0 to 1. To optimize trustworthy process roles, we have developed a consensus-based Gaussian Process Factor Graph (GPFG) tool.

How to select stable cloud providers for material procurement (SSCPFMP) has become a critical supply chain optimization issue in cloud manufacturing. By extending the Group Role Assignment (GRA) model, this paper formalizes the problem. Moreover, we propose a new method for evaluating cloud providers that incorporates stability as an important criterion. Additionally, in order to complete the stability assessment as quickly as possible, we propose using the KB4 logic instead of the commonly used KB5 to mine potential cooperative relationships between cloud providers. We prove by deduction that KB4 and KB5 are equivalent. Largescale simulation experiments indicate that the KB4 logic performs significantly better than the KB5 logic, which can be improved by up to 43.78\%. By using this method, decision makers are able to find more stable cloud providers for material procurement within a shorter timeframe.},

Specifically, we first assess the cost of procurement, the carbon emissions involved, and the quality of the items. We then aggregate the evaluated data and combine them using the analytic hierarchy process to calculate the total qualification value. Also, we specified various constraints and used the E-CARGO model to formalize this problem. Based on the qualification values, we can use the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization (CPLEX) package to find the best sourcing solution according to the working hour allocation.

A user&#39;s browsing and rating history is necessary for the score calculation. These studies either treated all histories as equal or used only the most recent histories. However, these calculation methods cannot cope with unexpectedness in the case of constant change owing to fluctuations in user preferences and public popularity. In this study, we propose a serendipity-oriented recommender system that sequentially calculates the unexpectedness score and predicts the score in the recommendation time. The proposed system consists of a reranking algorithm that reranks a recommendation list generated by accuracy-oriented recommender systems. It also introduces a parameter to adjust users&#39; ability to accept unexpectedness and aims for serendipitous recommendations that are in line with user preferences. The experiment on two benchmark datasets showed two results: the first is the proposed system improved the serendipitous metric by 0.061 points compared with accuracy-oriented systems before reranking and by 0.045 points compared with them without using the acceptance parameter. The second is the error between the predicted and ground truth of the unexpectedness score was smaller for a large dataset.},

  abstract  = {We investigate a user-centered approach to trajectory search in large data sets. We assume that user draws a query trajectory and expects to obtain a number of similar trajectories. Unlike the research results reported elsewhere, we try to answer the following simple question: What if we only focus on user experience of trajectory search, and give less or no importance to computational efficiency, how would we design such a user-centered trajectory search? Our answer is an approach based on gates through which a trajectory has to pass in order to be considered similar to the query trajectory. User thus does not have to draw an accurate query trajectory what can require a considerable amount of time, effort and attention to detail, and can lead to user frustration. We compare our approach to existing approaches, Geodabs and Geohash. For experimental evaluation we apply a dense synthetic data set. Our approach finds all trajectories that pass through any required gates, whereas Geodabs and Geohash only find a subset of similar trajectories with respect to a similarity measure.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a model-free learning-based controller for whole-body control of an orbiting space robot during proximity operations. Proximity control methods for space robots (robotic manipulators mounted on a floating satellite base) enable the robotic arm to reach up to the target body in order to perform autonomous tasks like in-orbit servicing, debris capture, etc. However, coupled motion control of such robots is tricky due to the floating nature of the satellite base. Although conventional controllers have been employed for coupled control of such nonlinear systems, their modeling and sophisticated control become all the more difficult with the increasing degree of freedom of the robot. Model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successful in learning complex policies in the field of robotic manipulation. However, most of the research in this domain has been focused only on the control of the space robotic arm, and not the satellite base, with a majority of them focusing only on the arm position control. A coupled controller which also simultaneously controls the satellite base orientation is essential for the proper functioning of onboard sensors and equipment which have pointing requirements. This paper uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to control the position (3 DOF) and orientation (3 DOF) of the end-effector while also controlling the orientation of the base satellite (3 DOF). To the best knowledge of the authors, a model-free Deep RL method has not yet been used for simultaneous 9 DOF control of a floating space robot so far. We also improvise over the standard reward functions that are used in Deep RL algorithms for improved performance of the learning algorithm. The training of the policy is performed using a PyBullet physics simulator and the comparison of the performance of the learning algorithm against the standard reward functions is presented.},

Existing compression methods suffer either low compression effects or privacy leakage. A privacy-aware Trajectory Compression scheme based on Fuzzy markovian Prediction (TCFP) is proposed in this paper, which consists of two steps of fuzzy compression. The first-step compression is achieved by converting the raw trajectory data into fuzzy information on the edge vehicle sides. Further compression is performed at edge RSUs through fuzzy multi-order Markovian prediction combined with new-devised fuzzy deviation filtering rules. Extensive experimental evaluation based on real-world data sets demonstrates the proposed TCFP scheme achieves desired QoS performance in terms of compression rate, compression time and information loss.},

  abstract  = {Medical abdomen image segmentation is a challenging task owing to discernible characteristics of the tumour against other organs. As an effective image segmenter, Mask R-CNN has been employed in many medical imaging applications, e.g. for segmenting nucleus from cytoplasm for leukaemia diagnosis and skin lesion segmentation. Motivated by such existing studies, this research takes advantage of the strengths of Mask R-CNN in leveraging on pre-trained CNN architectures such as ResNet and proposes three variants of Mask R-CNN for multi-organ medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose three variants of the Mask R-CNN transfer learning model successively, each with a set of configurations modified from the one preceding. To be specific, the three variants are (1) the traditional transfer learning with customized loss functions with comparatively more weightage on the segmentation performance, (2) transfer learning based on Mask R-CNN with deepened re-trained layers instead of only the last two/three layers as in traditional transfer learning, and (3) the fine-tuning of Mask R-CNN with expansion of the Region of Interest pooling sizes. Evaluating using Beyond-the-Cranial-Vault (BTCV) abdominal dataset, a well-established benchmark for multi-organ medical image segmentation, the three proposed variants of Mask R-CNN obtain promising performances. In particular, the empirical results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed adapted loss functions, the deepened transfer learning process, as well as the expansion of the RoI pooling sizes. Such variations account for the great efficiency of the proposed transfer learning variant schemes for undertaking multi-organ image segmentation tasks.},

  abstract  = {Recently, it has been pointed out in many studies that the performance of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms can be improved by selecting solutions from all examined solutions stored in an unbounded external archive. This is because in general the final population is not the best subset of the examined solutions. To obtain a good final solution set in such a solution selection framework, subset selection from a large candidate set (i.e., all examined solutions) has been studied. However, since good subsets cannot be obtained from poor candidate sets, a more important issue is how to find a good candidate set, which is the focus of this paper. In this paper, we first visually demonstrate that the entire Pareto front is not covered by the examined solutions through computational experiments using MOEA/D, NSGA-III and SMS-EMOA on DTLZ test problems. That is, the examined solution set stored in the unbounded archive has some large holes (i.e., some uncovered area of the Pareto front). Next, to evaluate the quality of the examined solution set (i.e., to measure the size of the largest hole), we propose the use of a variant of the inverted generational distance (IGD) indicator. Then, we propose a simple modification of EMO algorithms to improve the quality of the examined solution set. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modification through computational experiments.},

  abstract  = {Expensive optimization problems (EOPs) are becoming more and more ubiquitous nowadays. To effectively solve such problems, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have been developed. Specifically, a SAEA usually maintains a surrogate model to simulate the real objective function of an EOP. Such a surrogate model is trained based on real-evaluated solutions. Then, it is utilized to evaluate the fitness of individuals in the EA instead of the real expensive fitness evaluation. Though many SAEAs have been designed, they mainly concentrate on dealing with low-dimensional EOPs with fewer than 300 dimensions. Their performance on large-scale EOPs with more than 300 dimensions is unknown. To fill this gap, this paper conducts a comparative study on two types of state-of-the-art SAEAs with a total of four algorithms on four classical EOPs. To make comprehensive comparisons, we range the dimension size from 50 to 1000. As far as we know, this is the first time to assess SAEAs on EOPs with such a wide range of dimension sizes and such high dimensionality. The comparison results show that the optimization performance of the compared four SAEAs on high-dimensional EOPs with more than 500 dimensions is not as satisfactory as their performance on low-dimensional EOPs because of their slow convergence. Therefore, research on large-scale SAEAs for high-dimensional EOPs still deserves intensive attention.},

  abstract  = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) have multiple global optima, hence the algorithm must preserve population diversity to locate multiple global optima and ensure the precision of the obtained solutions simultaneously. To achieve these, the niching technique is widely applied. Although the niching technique shows encouraging performance, some niches may continuously evolve even though accurate enough global optima in their regions have been found. This may cause the waste of computational resources and the inefficiency of search behavior. To maintain population diversity and accuracy, and to break through the mentioned deficiency, an optimal peaks detected-based differential evolution (OPPDE) algorithm is proposed, which has three novel components. Firstly, to maintain population diversity, OPDDE designs a parameter-insensitive OPTICS-based niching strategy to automatically partition niches. Secondly, to avoid wasting computation resources on founded global optima and enhance search efficiency, OPDDE designs an optimal peaks detection strategy that uses historical information to identify the founded global optima. Thirdly, a dynamic step local search strategy is used to refine solutions. The proposed OPDDE algorithm generally superiors some state-of-the-art algorithms regarding both the accuracy and completeness of solutions, according to experiments on widely used MMOP benchmarks.},

Many existing EMO algorithms randomly generate an initial population to start the evolutionary process. To fill this research gap and attract more attention from EMO researchers to this important yet under-explored issue, in this paper, we examine the effects of various initialization methods that may become promising alternatives to the commonly-used random initialization method. Each initialization method is evaluated through computational experiments on test problems of various sizes with 5–1000 decision variables. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantage of well-designed initialization methods over the random initialization method.

In the literature, most HSS algorithms were designed for small-scale HSS (e.g., environmental selection: select $N$ solutions from $2N$ solutions where $N$ is the population size). Few researchers focus on large-scale HSS as a post-processing procedure in an unbounded external archive framework (i.e., subset selection from all examined solutions). In this paper, we propose a two-stage lazy greedy inclusion HSS (TGI-HSS) algorithm for large-scale HSS. In the first stage of TGI- HSS, a small solution set is selected from a large-scale candidate set using an efficient subset selection method (which is not based on exact hypervolume calculation). In the second stage, the final subset is selected from the small solution set using an existing efficient HSS algorithm. Experimental results show that the computational time can be significantly reduced by the proposed algorithm in comparison with other state-of-the-art HSS algorithms at the cost of only a small deterioration of the selected subset quality.},

The DM undertakes the consultation and preference elicitation using Gaussian process (GP) to provide preference information. We employ the decomposition-based EMO algorithm (i.e., MOEA/D) for optimization. The experiment comprises two sessions. Firstly, we simulate the decision maker module with GP.

  abstract  = {The deep operator network (DeepONet) architecture is a promising approach for learning functional operators, that can represent dynamical systems described by ordinary or partial differential equations. However, it has two major limitations, namely its failures to account for initial conditions and to guarantee the temporal causality – a fundamental property of dynamical systems. This paper proposes a novel causal deep operator network (Causal-DeepONet) architecture for incorporating both the initial condition and the temporal causality into data-driven learning of dynamical systems, overcoming the limitations of the original DeepONet approach. This is achieved by adding an independent root network for the initial condition and independent branch networks conditioned, or switched on/off, by time-shifted step functions or sigmoid functions for expressing the temporal causality. The proposed architecture was evaluated and compared with two baseline deep neural network methods and the original DeepONet method on learning the thermal dynamics of a room in a building using real data. It was shown to not only achieve the best overall prediction accuracy but also enhance substantially the accuracy consistency in multistep predictions, which is crucial for predictive control.},

  abstract  = {Children are an under-served population in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) development. The high prevalence of lifelong disability coupled with the diversity and plasticity of children&#39;s brains make them ideal candidates for personalized BCI systems. Channel selection methods provide a tool for the in-session personalization of BCI systems. To evaluate the efficacy of channel selection for pediatric users, we tested four wrapper-based channel selection algorithms, sequential forward selection (SFS), sequential backward selection (SBS), sequential forward floating selection (SFFS), and sequential backward floating selection (SBFS) on offline motor imagery BCI data from three datasets involving typically developing children. The purpose was to assess the performance benefits and computational costs of each algorithm. All algorithms provided classification accuracy gains of 10–15\% with their optimal subsets. The time required to reach the optimal subsets varied between algorithms, but all took less than 80 s with mean completion times of 9.5 s and 35.8 s for the fastest (SFS) and slowest (SFFS), respectively. Adjusting the stopping criterion of the algorithm enables users to further reduce computation time with a disproportionately small effect on classification accuracy. All methods demonstrated an ability to prioritize expected physiological regions of interest and leave out channels detrimental to the classifier. Channel selection offers personalization of the BCI system for a specific user and a specific classifier. These findings emphasize the value of using personalized channel selection algorithms to improve motor imagery BCI systems for pediatric users.},

  abstract  = {The P300 speller is a widely used application in brain-computer interface research. It has been demonstrated that the P300 speller can serve as a neurofeedback training tool for attention enhancement by gradually increasing the difficulty of the spelling task. This adaptive approach makes it harder for users to spell words correctly, encouraging them to improve their attention to counteract the increasing difficulty. Therefore, the adaptive P300 speller has the potential to serve as a treatment option for children with ADHD, elderly patients with dementia, and as a cognitive enhancement tool for healthy adults. However, the training length, including setup time, needs to be quick to ensure user acceptability. This study investigates the effect of different electrode subsets on P300 speller performance, with and without the use of the xDAWN spatial filter. Results indicate that the xDAWN spatial filter can improve performance with many electrodes but can decrease results with fewer than eight electrodes. For scenarios where near-perfect performance is crucial and many electrodes are available, a set of 16 electrodes with the xDAWN spatial filter is recommended. For situations where cost and setup time are a concern and lower performances are acceptable, using six electrodes without the spatial filter were found to be sufficient.},

The impact of background music and noise on user&#39;s performance (information transfer rate - ITR and accuracy) has already been investigated for different types of spellers, and usually led to a distractive, decreasing effect on the BCI performance, though there is always room for improving the subjective user experience. In this study, 11 participants used a cVEP-based BCI to perform two spelling tasks “BCI_AND_MUSIC” and “CONTRARY”, while listening via headphones to a standard instrumental song, a self-chosen instrumental song (“own music”), or to noise conditions: “no music” and “white noise”. Objective factors such as the blood pressure and heart rate were measured after each spelling task, and questionnaires were answered. The BCI accuracy was close to 100\% in most cases, while the lowest accuracy was reached while listening to the individually selected, self-chosen music (“own music”). Similarly, the ITR was the highest in case of “no music” and lowest in case of “own music” (which, on the other hand, resulted in a better mood and higher excitement of the participants). Thus, while the general condition of “no music” could be recommended for further BCI experiments, additional research regarding individual factors like musicality or listening habits of BCI participants should be considered.},

Boccia is a precision sport in which the objective is to get a ball as close as possible to a target. In its most adapted form, Boccia allows for the use of a ramp to assist the user. The proposed system consists of a BCI-enabled ramp that can be controlled by the user&#39;s brain signals using a visual control paradigm (i.e., P300, or SSVEP). We developed a software interface using custom tools in Unity and Python for the front-end and back-end, respectively. To validate the software, we tested the system with five subjects who performed six pipelines (three with P300 and three with SSVEP) to simulate real-world use. Each pipeline consisted of 10 guided selections in the software. The classifiers used Riemannian geometry and shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (sLDA) for P300 and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for SSVEP. The results showed that the P300 $(93\pm 3\%,\ \text{mean} \pm \text{SEM})$ paradigm had higher classification accuracy than the SSVEP $(27\pm 0.02\%, \text{mean} \pm \text{SEM})$ paradigm. Additionally, we designed and built a 3D CAD model and a hardware prototype of the ramp. The hardware prototype uses linear actuators to change the incline of the ramp and the height of the ball. Stepper motors allow for the rotation of the ramp and the release mechanism of the ball. Recommendations on improvements to the hardware and software components are made for future prototypes. The presented system opens new possibilities for sports applications that can improve the quality of life of people with severe motor disabilities.},

This suggests that supporting areas away from the point of force action can improve the performance of novice players. Therefore, in this study, we developed an assist suit that facilitates lower body twisting for table tennis beginners during forehand swing. U sing this assistive suit, experiments were conducted for the experimental group under the following four conditions (1) “No wear (before),” (2) “Without assist,” (3) “With assist,” and (4) “No wear (after)” to clarify the effect of wearing, assist, and training. In addition, a control group in which participants hit the ball without the assist suit was set up to examine the training effect of repetition. The results showed that both the amount of waist rotation and racket velocity increased significantly in the experimental group compared to the control group, which indicates the effect of the assist suit on training.},

Time delay system models are complex and challenging to optimize due to their inherent characteristics, such as non-linearity, multi-modality, and constraints. The study includes an explanation of the choice and core functionality of the selected algorithms, which are both baseline and state-of-the-art variants of self-organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA), state-of-the-art variant from the Success-History-based Adaptive Differential Evolution family of algorithms, with emphasis on diverse search (DISH algorithm), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. The hyperparameters of the metaheuristic algorithms were set using the iRace automatic algorithm configuration framework. The paper emphasizes the importance of metaheuristic algorithms in control engineering for time-delay systems to develop more effective and efficient control strategies and precise model identifications. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art algorithms with specific adaptive mechanisms like population organization process, diverse search and adaptation mechanisms ensuring a gradual transition from exploration to exploitation. Overall, this study contributes to understanding the challenges and advantages of using metaheuristic algorithms in control engineering for time delay systems. The results provide valuable insights into the performance of modern metaheuristic algorithms and can help guide the selection of appropriate adaptive mechanisms of metaheuristics.},

  abstract  = {Biological inspiration from honeybees, insects, and other animals has been used to create interesting implementations of multi-robot swarms. When the robots in a swarm are completely distributed, that is they lack any form of centralized control, the swarm acts as an agent-based model (ABM) wherein each agent implements its own controller and collective behavior emerges from the interactions between agents. Differential equation and graph-based models of some types of swarms have been used to guarantee collective behavior, but guaranteeing or predicting outcomes for hub-based agent colonies with finite numbers of robots remains an open problem. This paper presents a case study of designing an agent-based, hub-based swarm that solves the best-of-N problem with predictable success rates and completion times. The key innovation is modifying a tripartite graph formulation (TGF) from previous work so that it acts as a graph schema which abstracts an ABM into a simplified four state model, which in turn leads to a large discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) that describes how the collective state evolves over time. The DTMC can be used to compute success rates and completion times, which act as predictions for the ABM. Deviations between observed ABM outcomes and DTMC predictions lead to modifications in the ABM so that the swarm becomes more predictable.},

As generative models have shown a great scalability to learn high-dimensional distributions and found wide applications in the domain of image and text, they can be a powerful tool to facilitate us to accomplish the challenging quantum tasks. In this work, we propose using normalizing flow (NF) models with fast sampling to learn discrete quantum distributions for quantum state tomography. Particularly, three NF models, including denoising flow, argmax flow, and tree flow, are first adapted to the task of explicit quantum probability density estimation. We then perform extensive experiments on a large scale of quantum systems, and our numerical results demonstrate that these discrete NFs admit an excellent sampling efficiency in the sense that they are insensitive to the system size to learn the high-dimensional quantum distributions, without compromising the learning performance. Finally, in comparison to the other generative models, such as autoregressive, the NFs avoid the problem of slow sequential sampling.},

In this study, based on the coarse-to-fine human-robot collaboration framework, we investigate the possibility of realizing human-robot interaction and collaboration for accurate manipulation utilizing voluntary bimanual coordination. The practical motivation of utilizing the voluntary bimanual coordination, which can be perceived as an indirect way of implementing interlimb transmission of force feedback information, is to avoid the bad effect on force feedback presentation due to the counterforce if the human-robot collaboration was realized in an unimanual manner. For experimental studies, we firstly evaluated the synchronous protocols in terms of in-phase and anti-phase between two arms. Based on the studied protocol, moving target tracking was then demonstrated as an application scenario of the proposed human-robot collaboration utilizing voluntary bimanual coordination.},

  abstract  = {Humans have spatiotemporal limitations. Robotic avatar technology enables the expansion of an individual&#39;s innate physical characteristics, physical capabilities, and perceptual and cognitive abilities. Our research group has focused on scalability and co-creativity through co-operation and collaboration between humans, and has developed a system in which two operators are physically integrated into a single robotic arm. In particular, to enable more human-like tasks, such as receiving and delivering, we extended the system to a dual-arm robotic avatar and built a system in which multiple persons can integrate their bodies, with the expectation of further task efficiency and human extension. Specifically, we investigated the workability and operator cognition of the dual-arm robotic avatar when it was operated by one, two, or three individuals. The results showed that stability improved with the three-person operation. Furthermore, it was found that co-operation among multiple persons can overcome the original individual abilities for operation. In the three-person condition, all participants obtained a higher feeling of control than the actual amount of manipulation, which has potential applications in skill transfer. The three-person condition tended to be better, validating the usefulness of multi-person body integration.},

  abstract  = {The growing spread of robots for service and industrial purposes calls for versatile, intuitive and portable interaction approaches. In particular, in industrial environments, operators should be able to interact with robots in a fast, effective, and possibly effortless manner. To this end, reality enhancement techniques have been used to achieve efficient management and simplify interactions, in particular in manufacturing and logistics processes. Building upon this, in this paper we propose a system based on mixed reality that allows a ubiquitous interface for heterogeneous robotic systems in dynamic scenarios, where users are involved in different tasks and need to interact with different robots. By means of mixed reality, users can interact with a robot through manipulation of its virtual replica, which is always colocated with the user and is extracted when interaction is needed. The system has been tested in a simulated intralogistics setting, where different robots are present and require sporadic intervention by human operators, who are involved in other tasks. In our setting we consider the presence of drones and AGVs with different levels of autonomy, calling for different user interventions. The proposed approach has been validated in virtual reality, considering quantitative and qualitative assessment of performance and user&#39;s feedback.},

  abstract  = {Driving at night is a challenging task for humans due to low-light conditions and often low concentration caused by drowsiness. Here, advanced driver assistance systems can come to the rescue and support the driver to increase comfort as well as safety. For that, the vehicle needs a sound and complete understanding of its environment, especially other road participants. The earlier this information is available, the more proactive decisions can be made by the system. To detect on-coming vehicles as soon as possible even before they are actually directly visible, the light reflections caused by their headlamps can be leveraged. Previous work showed that algorithms can perform this task on rural land roads. However, for more complex urban scenarios no approach exists so far. Yet, before starting the dataset and algorithm development for a computer vision system able to solve the task, a sound understanding of the problem is required. In a recent study we already showed that humans can anticipate oncoming vehicles based on their light reflections also in urban scenarios. Still, it remains unclear whether spatial information alone is sufficient to perform the task, or if the temporal context is required. This understanding is essential when designing labeling pipelines for a dataset, as well as algorithm development. Therefore, in this paper we perform a large experiment to evaluate the importance of temporal context for the human ability to anticipate oncoming vehicles at night in urban scenarios. We present participants scenes with different numbers of frames and measure their anticipation performance. We show that providing temporal context significantly increases the human detection accuracy as well as decision confidence. With this we provide additional insights into the task of anticipatory vehicle detection at night which can be taken into consideration when designing a dataset as well as algorithms.},

A VR study was conducted wherein 37 participants interacted as pedestrians with an automated vehicle to evaluate implicit communication via lateral offset, explicit communication via an external human-machine interface, and a combination of both. The results indicate that the combined communication approach was ranked the highest in subjective evaluations, while the external human-machine interface achieved the best efficiency results. In terms of traffic safety, no differences were found between the different communication modalities. The study concludes that a combined communication approach, consisting of both implicit and explicit signals, can enable safe and efficient cooperation between traffic participants in future interactions between automated vehicles and pedestrians. However, in situations involving further agents, such as manual vehicles, clearer communication may be necessary. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of communication strategies for automated vehicles and provides insights for future research.},

  abstract  = {As people become more aware of their food choices, food computation models have become increasingly popular in assisting people in maintaining healthy eating habits. For example, food recommendation systems analyze recipe instructions to assess nutritional contents and provide recipe recommendations. The recent and remarkable successes of generative AI methods, such as auto-regressive Large Language Models, can enable robust methods for a more comprehensive understanding of recipes for healthy food recommendations beyond surface-level nutrition content assessments. In this study, we investigate the use of generative AI methods to extend current food computation models, primarily involving the analysis of nutrition and ingredients, to also incorporate cooking actions (e.g., add salt, fry the meat, boil the vegetables, etc.), Cooking actions are notoriously hard to model using statistical learning methods due to irregular data patterns - significantly varying natural language descriptions for the same action (e.g., marinate the meat vs. marinate the meat and leave overnight) and infrequently occurring patterns (e.g., add salt occurs far more frequently than marinating the meat). The prototypical approach to handling irregular data patterns is to increase the volume of data that the model ingests by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, in the cooking domain, these problems are further compounded with larger data volumes presenting a unique challenge that is not easily handled by simply scaling up. In this work, we propose novel aggregation-based generative AI methods, Cook-Gen, that reliably generate cooking actions from recipes, despite difficulties with irregular data patterns, while also outperforming Large Language Models and other strong baselines.},

Among various methods to enable neural networks to estimate uncertainty, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout has gained much popularity in a short period due to its simplicity. In this study, we present a new version of the traditional dropout layer where we are able to fix the number of dropout configurations. As such, each layer can take and apply the new dropout layer in the MC method to quantify the uncertainty associated with NN predictions. We conduct experiments on both toy and realistic datasets and compare the results with the MC method using the traditional dropout layer. Performance analysis utilizing uncertainty evaluation metrics corroborates that our dropout layer offers better performance in most cases.},

To address this issue, we propose an offline profiling strategy that uses a query reduction strategy to obtain a reduced query set from the production environment&#39;s log file. We then run this sample on an offline test environment to collect profile data and use it to conduct function reorder optimization. To evaluate our approach, we compared the performance improvements achieved by running a reduced query set and a full query set on a MYSQL database. We generated function call graphs for both query sets and observed that the performance improvement achieved by the reduced query set was slightly lower than that of the full query set. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential benefits of offline profiling strategies for improving the performance of RDBs in production environments, while also avoiding performance losses and increasing stability.},

To examine how people listen to music daily, owing to the difficulty of having participants come to the laboratory due to the spread of COVID-19, we conducted the experiment online. Participants listened to short clips of 95 sounds and subjectively answered questions on their audibility and preferences. An analysis of their subjective answers revealed the audibility and preference differences among instruments, specifically that the recorder lacks the same audibility and preference as some of the other instruments at certain pitches. However, there was little correlation between audibility and timbre preferences. The study findings will be used in music classes in which DHH students participate and indicate that timbre audibility is necessary for building music recommendation systems for DHH individuals.

Gaze movement strategies have been widely investigated beyond laboratory settings to infer the internal states; however, eye blink behavior has not been well investigated. Consequently, the relationship between eyeblink dynamics and internal states under in-the-wild behavior is still unclear. Eyeblink detection algorithms for head-worn eye trackers are susceptible to extreme eye angles and illumination changes; this limits the study of eyeblink in natural behavior. This issue is addressed by a supervised-machine-learning-aided data analysis pipeline that offers a reliable baseline for eyeblink detection, even when using datasets acquired under harsh conditions. Our pipeline consists of training a deep convolutional neural network model by a transfer learning approach, prediction using the model, and efficient performance monitoring incorporating eyeblink characteristics. In the case study, we analyze eye videos during formula car driving data by our proposed method and the default method of an off-the-shelf eyetracker. Our method predicts better than the present software in terms of the proportion of the predicted eyeblinks with the appropriate duration range as spontaneous eyeblinks and estimated precision. The results suggest that our approach could serve as a valuable tool for cognitive, psychological, and human factors research by enabling high-quality eyeblink dynamics data acquisition from various eyetracking data.},

Under the constraints of having limited system size and computational cost, in which the main challenge comes from the “catastrophic forgetting” issue - the inability to well remember the learnt knowledge while learning the new ones. With the specific focus on the class-incremental OCL scenario, i.e. OCL for classification, the recent advance incorporates the contrastive learning technologies for learning more generalised feature representation to achieve the state-of-the-art performance but is still unable to fully resolve the catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we follow the strategy of adopting contrastive learning but further introduce the semantically distinct augmentation technique, in which it leverages strong augmentation to generate more data samples, and we show that considering these samples semantically different from their original classes (thus being related to the out-of-distribution samples) in the contrastive learning mechanisms contributes to alleviate forgetting and facilitate model stability. Moreover, in addition to contrastive learning, the typical classification mechanism and objective (i.e. softmax classifier and cross-entropy loss) are included in our model design for utilising the label information, but particularly equipped with a sampling strategy to tackle the tendency of favouring the new classes (i.e. model bias towards the recently learnt classes). Upon conducting extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Mini-Imagenet datasets, our proposed method is shown to achieve superior performance against various baselines.},

While many current studies showcase their proficiency in generating visually pleasing fused images, only a limited number of them focused on the object detection performance. This study addresses the issue by presenting an end-to-end framework for object detection through the fusion of visible and infrared features (VIFF). Specifically, our approach involves the use of two distinct processing units that independently extract features from visible and infrared images, followed by the fusion of these features using a novel fusion strategy. While the visible feature processing unit preserves the direction of the gradient of visible images, the infrared feature processing unit focuses on extracting the contrast and semantic features of infrared images. Both features are aggregated by attention mechanisms and then fed into the backbone of the object detection networks. Our fusion network achieved superior object detection accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets. We have also demonstrated that the proposed visible feature and infrared feature processing units are capable of enhancing the performance of various object detection models.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the problem of class-incremental learning. The model is trained to recognize the classes added incrementally. It thus suffers from the challenging issue of catastrophic forgetting. Stemming from the knowledge distillation idea of attempting to retain the model&#39;s knowledge on seen classes while learning the newly-added ones, we advance to further alleviate the catastrophic forgetting via our proposed multi-anchor distillation objective, which is realized by constraining the spatial relationship between the input data and the multiple class embeddings of each seen class in the feature space while training the model. Moreover, since the knowledge distillation for incremental learning generally relies on keeping a replay buffer to store the samples of seen classes, the buffer of limited size brings another issue of class imbalance: the number of samples from each seen class decreases gradually, thus being much smaller than the number of samples from each new class. We therefore propose to introduce the continually-adapted margin into the classification objective for tackling the prediction bias towards new classes caused by the class imbalance. Experiments are conducted on various datasets and settings to demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed techniques in comparison to several state-of-the-art baselines.},

In this paper, we will show that two small networks can dynamically play the changing roles of teacher and student to share their knowledge and hence, the efficiency of both the networks improve simultaneously.

We reformulate the traditional gradient optimization problem as a reinforcement learning task. In particular, by treating the trainable weight space as an environment, the learning rate as action, and the validation accuracies as the rewards, we train a Q-network (controller) to learn the discounted future validation accuracy and guide the later training of another network (worker).

  abstract  = {An undirected weighted graph (UWG) is frequently adopted to describe the interactions among a solo set of nodes from big data-connected applications like the user contact frequency from a social network services system. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is widely adopted to perform representation learning to a UWG for subsequent pattern analysis tasks such as clustering or missing data estimation. However, existing GCNs mostly neglects the latent collaborative information hidden in its connected node pairs. To address this issue, this study proposes to model the node collaborations via a symmetric latent factor analysis model, which is thus incorporated into a GCN model as a node-collaboration module for supplementing the collaboration loss. Based on this essential idea, a Node-collaboration-informed Graph Convolutional Network (NGCN) model is proposed with three-fold ingredients: a) Learning latent collaborative information from the interaction of node pairs via a node-collaboration module; b) Building the residual connection and weighted representation propagation to obtain high representation capacity; and c) Implementing the model optimization in an end-to-end fashion to achieve precise representation to the target UWG. Empirical studies on four UWGs emerging from real applications demonstrate that owing to its efficient modeling of node-collaborations, the proposed NGCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCNs in addressing the task of missing weight estimation. Meanwhile, its high scalability ensures its compatibility with more advanced GCN extensions, which will be further investigated in our future studies.},

Previous methods for resolving data imbalance mostly originate from single-label classification, which can be obstructed by the label co-occurrence issue, and they attempt to minimize or compensate for it. In this paper, we propose a novel tail class priority sampling method for long-tailed multi-label classification that untangles both issues. Our method samples tail class more often and earlier in order to make the model learn tail classes before it has bias toward common classes. Due to label co-occurrence, other classes will be spontaneously learned in same iteration, ensuring a balanced representation of the head and medium classes. To further enhance the recognition performance, we modify to a bilateral structure that samples both original and proposed sampling distribution to better represent the tail classes. We evaluate our proposed method on two widely used datasets in long-tailed version, COCO-LT and VOC-LT, and compare it with previous methods. The experimental results show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for tail classes on both datasets. Our method is applicable in various real-world scenarios, making rare class recognition achievable, and can be easily incorporated into conventional recognition frameworks.},

Unfortunately, common feature extraction methods, naive fusion strategies, and rigid inductive biases have become roadblocks to the effective improvement of previous approaches. Distinguished from other modes of data representation, tables consist of many dispersed cells that are interdependent. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a novel approach for recognizing table structures by mining the special properties of tables. The method begins by utilizing the adaptive fusion method to fuse visual and textual features acquired through a two-stream network. In the second stage, the layout features will be seamlessly integrated using a Kronecker-based strategy. The table elements with multi-modality features are then modeled based on spatial relationships. Interactions among them are established by a hybrid contextual aggregator that allows message passing at both local and global levels. Finally, table structure recognition is achieved by predicting the relationship between elements. We meticulously evaluate the proposed approach on various public datasets, including ICDAR2013, UNLV, WTW, SciTSR, and SciTSR-COMP, as well as a more complicated private dataset. The proposed method performs excellently on these datasets.},

But in general, they usually suffer from time efficiency problems and are designed only for a few diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a novel EA combined with the reverse influence sampling (RIS) to solve the IM problem. By introducing the RIS technique, we can evaluate influence spreading efficiently under various diffusion models using hypergraphs. Moreover, the hypergraphs are also used as a kind of high-level heuristic information. To combine the RIS technique with EA, we exploit the idea of RIS to design a surrogate model and decide to address the single-objective IM problem in a multi-objective way. Then we modify the classical NSGA-II algorithm and apply it to this strategy. Our experimental results on million-scale social networks validate the good performance of the proposed approach.},

The rapid development of communication technology enables the use of multiple UAVs to perform target tracking collaboratively. But it remains challenging to coordinate multiple UAVs in some complicated scenarios, e.g., tracking multiple targets using multiple UAVs. In this paper, we intend to propose a Nash-based evolutionary dynamic optimization algorithm for multi-target tracking using multiple UAVs. Firstly, considering the requirement of balancing the number of UAVs tracking each target, we formulate the tracking problem as a distributed constrained multi-objective dynamic optimization problem using model predictive control (MPC). Secondly, to better track dynamic targets with stochastic behaviors, we design an evolutionary dynamic optimization (EDO) approach to solve the optimization problem. Thirdly, in order to avoid collisions, we combine the EDO approach with Nash optimization. The experimental results show that our approach has better performance than compared algorithms.},

However, decision-makers prefer to have multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions at hand, which brings up the multimodal OM problem. In this paper, we firstly define the multimodal OM problem, which aims at providing several promising sets of initial nodes at one time. To solve this problem, we propose a genetic algorithm with a dynamic fitness sharing niching method (GADN). In GADN, we take the dynamic fitness sharing method to divide the population dynamically, design a repair strategy to fill the possible gap in sets after crossover, and take a scalable reproduction to assign reproductive opportunities. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on multiple social networks. The results show that the proposed GADN outperforms other methods on both opinion and active ratio in most cases.},

  abstract  = {Socialmedia is highly active and full of rumors while the information is widely propagation. Mastering the process information of rumor propagation plays an important role in promoting automated rumor detection. However, the existing methods ignore the rumor evolution and development process, resulting in the loss of details, which is not con-ducive to extracting key information in rumor detection. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical dynamic graph convolution network (H-DynGCN-Enh) to build a dynamic propagation graph for each news differentiation, while taking into account the bi-directional features of rumor propagation and dissemination, fully extracting the key information. In addition, we introduce attention-based graph pooling to design a feature enhancement strategy to avoid redundant information and increase the interaction between comments and original news. Finally, we use the multi-head self-attention mechanism to adjust the weight of dynamic information to obtain global information for detection. The results of two open real-world datasets demonstrate that our model has exceeded the most advanced baseline, the effectiveness of each module has also been fully proved in the ablation experiment.},

  abstract  = {Multi-modal entity alignment aims to identify equivalent entities between two individual multi-modal knowledge graphs, and this technique has an essential role in integrating knowledge from different data sources. However, most previous works directly adopt simple concatenation or weighted sums as their fusion strategy, ignoring the inter-modal interactions of entities, which leads to potential noise introduced from uni-modal features during the feature fusion stage. The reason for this potential noise is that most previous works use separate encoders to encode each uni-modal information and lack inter-modal information interactions, which leads to the existence of highly similar but non-equivalent entities within each uni-modal feature space. This is seen as a potential noise in the feature fusion stage, and as this work follows the convention of one-to-one alignment constraint, this potential noise is bound to impair the model&#39;s performance. This paper proposes IMILEA, an Inter-modal Interactions Learning based Entity Alignment approach for exploring inter-modal interactions, to reduce the harm caused by potential noise in the feature fusion process. In addition, this paper also proposes a strategy of negative sample weighting, which can improve the model&#39;s performance by increasing the model&#39;s attention to the hard-to-distinguish negative samples. Experiments on two public datasets show that the proposed model in this paper provides state-of-the-art performance.},

Because the definition of abnormal and normal behavior is challenging to distinguish directly, and the occurrence of abnormal behavior is rare and random, video anomaly detection becomes challenging. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture MAU-VAD based on the premise that the semantic consistency of appearance features and motion information is high in normal events but low in anomaly events. First, we design a motion feature reconstruction module to reconstruct optical flow, which aims to record the stable motion information in normal events. Afterward, the motion information of the reconstructed optical flow and the appearance information of the corresponding original frame are extracted separately using a two-stream autoencoder, and the extracted motion features and appearance features are constrained and fused to generate predicted future frames. Since the reconstruction quality of optical flow directly affects the generation quality of final future frames, the reconstructed optical flow of abnormal events has a greater impact on the quality of generated future frames, thus improving the efficiency of anomaly detection. Experimental results on three standard public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},

Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to continual learning. To reduce forgetting, some existing rehearsal-based methods use episodic memory to replay samples of previous tasks. However, in the process of knowledge integration when learning a new task, this strategy also suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to an imbalance between old and new knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a novel replay strategy called Manifold Expansion Replay (MaER). We argue that expanding the implicit manifold of the knowledge representation in the episodic memory helps to improve the robustness and expressiveness of the model. To this end, we propose a greedy strategy to keep increasing the diameter of the implicit manifold represented by the knowledge in the buffer during memory management. In addition, we introduce Wasserstein distance instead of cross entropy as distillation loss to preserve previous knowledge. With extensive experimental validation on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, we show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in continual learning setup, outperforming the state of the arts.},

Intrigued by the idea of metric learning, a novel framework based on cross-modal prototype generation is proposed to reduce the misclassification rate of MCI. First, the single modal prototypes are generated from magnetic resonance images (MRI), and then the auxiliary modal is used to correct the original prototypes and generate new cross-modal prototypes. An adaptive mechanism that can dynamically adjust the proportion of the auxiliary modal data is added in the proposed framework to improve the practicability of the cross-modal prototype framework.

Most existing approaches require additional label information to obtain meaningful node representations. However, labeling heterogeneous graphs is tedious and time-consuming, and low-quality labels will harm the efficiency of models. In addition, the number of nodes increases exponentially with the distance from the root node, but the linearly expanding Euclidean space is difficult to match this growth rate. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that leverages the label irrelevance of contrastive learning and the unique expressive ability of hyperbolic space to encode heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, we use the contrast mechanism to obtain semantic information in an unsupervised way. Meanwhile, we design hyperbolic encoders that are more suitable for graph structure to learn the latent information from heterogeneous graphs efficiently. Experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph data sets demonstrate the competitive efficacy of the proposed method.},

To address this issue, we propose a data perturbation method that involves extraction of certain areas of the face with less identity-related information, followed by pixel shuffling and blurring. Our experiments on two rPPG datasets (PURE and UBFC) show that our approach reduces the accuracy of facial recognition algorithms by over 60\%, with minimal impact on rPPG extraction. We also test our method on three facial recognition datasets (LFW, CALFW, and AgeDB), where our approach reduced performance by nearly 50\%.

The probability of successful treatment of gastric cancer and the possibility of recovery from treatment are closely related to the subtype of cancer. To improve the quality of life, it is of great practical significance to correctly distinguish clinically relevant cancer subtypes based on omics data for precise treatment to save gastric cancer patients. However, gene expression data has tens of thousands of feature dimensions, and only a few of them help predict gastric cancer subtype classification. Moreover, the important features selected by existing feature selection algorithms do not achieve good results in predicting gastric cancer subtypes. To this end, this paper proposes a Gradient Boosting Deep Feature Selection (GBDFS) algorithm for gastric cancer subtype classification for the first time, to reduce the feature dimension of omics data and improve the classification accuracy of gastric cancer subtypes. The self-built deep neural network classifier was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and cost of gastric cancer subtype classification before and after feature selection, which proved the effectiveness of the algorithm. In addition, by comparing the other eight existing feature selection algorithms, this paper concludes that GBDFS has an accuracy rate as high as 99.115\%. And the robustness of the algorithm is verified by two classification algorithms of support vector machines and deep neural networks. The best low-dimensional feature subset of GBDFS was selected as a biomarker for gastric cancer subtype classification, with 24 gene features that effectively distinguish gastric cancer subtypes. Finally, bioinformatics analysis such as survival analysis, Gene Enrichment Ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways are done.},

First, we predict the true connections between network nodes through the network embedding prediction model. EA - NEcornrnunity network embedding is used to represent the connections obtained from unreliable data by vectors. Based on these vectors, back-propagation neural network predicts the true connectivity relationships. Second, we develop an ant colony algorithm with specially designed heuristics and evaluation function.

  abstract  = {Carotid plaque classification is of great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of carotid artery disease and the prediction of ischemic stroke. However, the ultrasound image structure of carotid plaques is complex, and manual labeling is time-consuming, which results in lots of unlabeled images. Semi-supervised methods can be well applied in this field by using unlabeled samples to improve model performance. Most of the existing semi-supervised methods are based on pseudo-labels and consistency regularization; however, these kinds of methods will cause error pseudo-labels during sample selection and an imbalanced distribution of pseudo-labels due to cognitive biases in model training. To solve these problems, We propose a method based on feature correction and pseudo-label balance correction, which utilizes a semi-supervised approach. The feature correction module uses the features of labeled data to correct the predicted probabilities of unlabeled data and improve the discrimination of pseudo-labels. The pseudo-label balance correction module can dynamically adjust the sample weight in the loss function according to the number of pseudo-labels to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. Evaluated on 1270 ultrasound carotid plaque images, our method achieved superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods (i.e., Mixmatch, Fixmatch, and Flexmatch) on 10\%, 30\%, and 50\% labeled training data.

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose a new approach for continual learning based on the Visual Transformers (ViTs). The purpose of continual learning is to address the catastrophic forgetting problem. One method for preventing forgetting previous tasks is exemplar replay. However, exemplar replay has limitations such as limited memory capacity, large storage requirements, and difficulty adapting to new tasks, which restrict its practical application. Therefore, we adopted knowledge distillation to implement exemplar-free continual learning. This approach transfers the knowledge of old tasks to the model&#39;s prior knowledge, helping the model to learn new tasks better while not increasing the storage burden. Based on this, we propose a new method for training the ViT model called Feature Attention Distillation (FAD). Specifically, we introduced a feature attention mechanism into the knowledge distillation model to help the student model better retain meaningful feature representations and attention distributions during the learning process of new tasks by passing attention information between the teacher and student models, thereby improving the learning efficiency and performance of the model. In addition, we also introduced a new normalization method called Continual Normalization (CN) into the student model. This method dynamically calculates the sample mean and variance of the current and historical tasks, allowing the student network to adapt better to the feature distribution changes between different tasks, thus improving the model&#39;s generalization ability and robustness. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR100 and ImageNet-32 datasets show that our exemplar-free method is competitive in performance compared to rehearsal-based ViT methods.},

  abstract  = {Commonsense question answering (CSQA) is a challenging learning task that aims to give correct answers to commonsense questions. CSQA models combining large pretrained language models with knowledge graphs are proposed to perform one-way or two-way information fusion to enhance their commonsense reasoning ability. However, existing CSQA models only fuse local information at the word level, ignoring the global semantic information fusion. Furthermore, current CSQA models often introduce noise nodes when constructing the knowledge subgraph. In addition, existing methods neglect the edge information in message aggregation. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a novel CSQA model named MDEQA. In our model, we design the multi-layer attention fusion module to bidirectionally fuse the word-level local information and global semantic information of question context and knowledge subgraph. Moreover, we design the dynamic graph neural network module with improved GAT and aggregating edge information to form the dynamic subgraphs which alleviate the interference of noise nodes on reasoning and enhance the commonsense reasoning ability of our model. Finally, we evaluated our model on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA datasets to compare with other baseline models.},

  abstract  = {In the treatment of ovarian cancer, precise residual disease prediction is significant for clinical and surgical decision-making. However, traditional methods are either invasive (e.g., laparoscopy) or time-consuming (e.g., manual analysis). Recently, deep learning methods make many efforts in automatic analysis of medical images. Despite the remarkable progress, most of them underestimated the importance of 3D image information of disease, which might brings a limited performance for residual disease prediction, especially in small-scale datasets. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Multi-View Attention Learning (MuVAL) method for residual disease prediction, which focuses on the comprehensive learning of 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images in a multi-view manner. Specifically, we first obtain multi-view of 3D CT images from transverse, coronal and sagittal views. To better represent the image features in a multi-view manner, we further leverage attention mechanism to help find the more relevant slices in each view. Extensive experiments on a dataset of 111 patients show that our method outperforms existing deep-learning methods.},

However, many MLS-OCNs encounter the issue of loosely connected feature coding because they use two separate mechanisms for feature encoding and final pattern recognition. This paper proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a multilayer algorithm called deep Moore-Penrose inverse network with refinement (DMPINR). In particular, DMPINR employs an end-to-end learning process based on the Moore-Penrose inverse (MPI) to identify optimal latent space and classify objects simultaneously. To enhance the robustness of representations, the DMPINR technique pulls back the residual error from the output layer to the hidden layers sequentially, recalculating the parameters of these hidden layers using MPI. The experimental results on ten popular OCC datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms many existing MLS-OCNs in G-Mean and F 1 scores.},

  abstract  = {Visual localization is a critical task in mobile robotics, and researchers are continuously developing new approaches to enhance its efficiency. In this article, we propose a novel approach to improve the accuracy of visual localization using Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. We highlight the limitations of global SfM, which suffers from high latency, and the challenges of local SfM, which requires large image databases for accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose utilizing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), as opposed to image databases, to cut down on the space required for storage. We suggest that sampling reference images around the prior query position can lead to further improvements. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method against ground truth obtained using LIDAR and Advanced Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time (A-LOAM), and compare its storage usage against local SfM with COLMAP in the conducted experiments. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 0.068 meters compared to the ground truth, which is slightly lower than the most advanced method COLMAP, which has an accuracy of 0.022 meters. However, the size of the database required for COLMAP is 400 megabytes, whereas the size of our NeRF model is only 160 megabytes. Finally, we perform an ablation study to assess the impact of using reference images from the NeRF reconstruction.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel method called the Structure-Aware Enhanced Multi- Partition Embedding Interaction (SAMI) model for Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE). SAMI leverages both graph attention network and tensor decomposition to learn expressive and structural enhanced representations for KGs. Specifically, it uses the graph attention layers to aggregate nodes&#39; features in a neighborhood as an encoder and utilizes an Enhanced Multi- Partition Embedding Interaction (EMEI) to learn independent local features as a decoder.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of Vision Transformers for sketch recognition. In addition, we also address the problem of semantically different categories appearing similar in sketches. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel loss function for sketch recognition, termed Sketch Online Label Smoothing (SketchOLS). Our experiments on QuickDraw dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach is a robust and effective solution for sketch recognition. Remarkably, our method outperforms existing models even without the injection of additional temporal information.

We propose a federated learning framework based on broad learning that can simultaneously achieve protection of clients&#39; privacy and robustness against Byzantine attacks, i.e. FBL-BP. We apply differential privacy techniques to perturb the local models of the clients, which can protect clients&#39; privacy. The server receives the perturbed local models and then guarantees the Byzantine-resilience of global model through an outlier removal mechanism based on cosine similarity.

Nevertheless, in combinatorial optimization, the Transformer can barely handle some combinatorial optimization problems such as large-scale Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Therefore, we design a more straightforward Transformer-based network structure, termed TSP Transformer, to deal with large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems. To better handle tasks in combinatorial optimization, we have made improvements to the Transformer network structure. We train the TSP Transformer network architecture to predict a distribution over different city permutations with the input of a set of city node graph coordinates, use negative tour length as the reward, and optimize the parameters of the TSP Transformer network using a policy gradient method. The extensive experimental results show that the TSP Transformer network structure can increase the effect by five times compared with the previous work of other authors, and the optimal ratio gap has been reduced from 1.22\% to 0.24\%.},

Such human values include punishing error cases of different severity in varying degrees and making compromises in general performance to reduce specific dangerous cases. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation measure named Meta Pattern Concern Score based on the abstract representation of probabilistic prediction and the adjustable threshold for the concession in prediction confidence, to introduce the human values into multi-classifiers. Technically, we learn from the advantages and disadvantages of two kinds of common metrics, namely the confusion matrix-based evaluation measures and the loss values, so that our measure is effective as them even under general tasks, and the cross entropy loss becomes a special case of our measure in the limit. Besides, our measure can also be used to refine the model training by dynamically adjusting the learning rate. The experiments on four kinds of models and six datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our measure. And a case study shows it can not only find the ideal model reducing 0.53\% of dangerous cases by only sacrificing 0.04\% of training accuracy, but also refine the learning rate to train a new model averagely outperforming the original one with a 1.62\% lower value of itself and 0.36\% fewer number of dangerous cases.},

To address these issues, we present CSAIL: Cosine Similarity based Adversarial Imitation Learning. CSAIL extracts expert policy representations from demonstrations via a novel cosine similarity based loss and recovers a robust and unbiased reward function by the learned representations. Based on the reward, CSAIL mimics the expert policy by the Wasserstein distance optimization method.

However, existing data augmentation techniques in natural language understanding (NLU) may not fully capture the complexity of natural language variations, and they can be challenging to apply to large datasets. This paper proposes the Random Position Noise (RPN) algorithm, a novel data augmentation technique that operates at the word vector level. RPN modifies the word embeddings of the original text by introducing noise based on the existing values of selected word vectors, allowing for more fine-grained modifications and better capturing natural language variations. Unlike traditional data augmentation methods, RPN does not require gradients in the computational graph during virtual sample updates, making it simpler to apply to large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RPN consistently outperforms existing data augmentation techniques across various NLU tasks, including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and paraphrase detection. Moreover, RPN performs well in low-resource settings and is applicable to any model featuring a word embeddings layer. The proposed RPN algorithm is a promising approach for enhancing NLU performance and addressing the challenges associated with traditional data augmentation techniques in large-scale NLU tasks. Our experimental results demonstrated that the RPN algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance in all seven NLU tasks, thereby highlighting its effectiveness and potential for real-world NLU applications.},

Specifically, ShapeRef first establishes a time-series shape reference frame, then proposes the minimum shape difference-based mapping method to describe the mapping process of coordinates, and finally reduces multi-intersection points in the mapping process to achieve uniform mapping of the abnormal time-series waveform. Experimental results show that ShapeRef can effectively represent abnormal time-series waveforms and outperforms several baseline methods in the clustering task of a real industrial equipment waveform dataset.

  abstract  = {Compared to relying only on audio information, incorporating visual information improves speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments. Existing works are prone to design specific architecture for feature extraction, neglecting feature enhancement. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Mandarin audio-visual speech recognition model with a Feature Enhancement Module. Specifically, we design a Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) that uses deconvolution and up-sampling to obtain the twin enhanced data for generating high-resolution feature representation. We further develop the Visual Feature Enhancement Module (Visual FEM) and Audio Feature Enhancement Module (Audio FEM) to enhance feature extraction from both visual data and audio data. We incorporate the proposed modules into the blocks of the Residual Network for accurate audio-visual speech recognition. We conducted experiments on the CAS-VSR-W1k and Chinese Mandarin Lip Reading (CMLR) datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the selected competitive baselines and the state-of-the-art, indicating the superiority of our proposed modules.},

  abstract  = {Mayfly algorithm (MA) is a new type of intelligent optimization algorithm with excellent search ability and a broad application prospect in feature selection. However, as the dimension of the data increases, MA also has the problem of weak search ability and falling into the local optimal solution. To solve these problems, this paper combines the idea of collaborative evolution and proposes an improved Mayfly algorithm (CEIMA) suitable for feature selection problems. The CEIMA algorithm first divides the population into two sub-populations and initializes them in different ways to increase the diversity of the population. During evolution, information sharing is achieved through an information transmission mechanism between sub-populations, achieving collaborative evolution between sub-populations to enhance the global search ability of CEIMA. Finally, the mRMR-m strategy is proposed to mutate the global optimal individual based on feature importance, improving the ability of CEIMA to escape from local optimal solutions. Through a comparison with 7 feature selection algorithms on 12 UCI datasets, the effectiveness of CEIMA is proven.},

  abstract  = {The flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) is a complex problem with significant applications in modern manufacturing. While various metainspired algorithms are widely used in FJSP, they of-ten converge to local optima, especially as the problem size increases. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive hybrid algorithm with three stages of “explore-exploit-escape” (E3HA). In the first stage, we design a Simplified Variable Neighborhood Search (Sim-VNS) algorithm and introduce a Simplified Nopt1 Neighborhood for extensive exploration of solution spaces. In the second stage, we introduce the crossover operation from genetic algorithms to better exploit the elite solutions obtained in the first stage, and we also use mutation operations to improve the quality of regular solutions. Finally, in the third stage, we design a hybrid mechanism of Reverse Learning with Path Relinking (RLPR) and introduce a critical path neighborhood structure to increase the effectiveness of solutions in avoiding local optima and premature convergence. We perform ablation experiments to confirm the effectiveness of each stage of E3HA and test the algorithm on all BRdata and Fdata instances, comparing its performance to relevant existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show the effectiveness and stability of our algorithm for FJSP.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, DNA computing model has gradually attracted attention due to its low energy consumption, high capacity of storing information and good parallelism. DNA computational model is calculated by DNA molecule as the medium, so its core is to design a high quality DNA sequence conforming to various constraints. Designing DNA sequences that meet a series of constraints, such as temperature, H-measure, and continuity, is a typical multi-objective optimization problem. In traditional multi-objective optimization problems, various fitness functions are usually only related to their own solutions, and have no correlation with other redundant candidate solutions. Based on the DNA coding problem&#39;s characteristics, we propose a two-stage constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Our algorithm overcomes shortcomings of traditional algorithms in solving DNA coding problems which are easy to fall into local optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is effective and reliable in solving DNA coding problems when compared to other mainstream algorithms from recent years.},

To address this issue, we propose an Interpretable Convolution Network(ICN) for offline surrogate-assited evolutionary optimization. ICN retains the non-linear expression ability of traditional neural networks, while possessing the advantages of clear physical structure and the ability to incorporate prior knowledge during network parameter design and training process. We compare ICN-SAEA with tri-training method(TT-DDEA) and model-ensemble method(DDEA-SA) in several benchmark problems.

Most of the existing researches only carry out algorithm design on the premise of fully determining the scene information. However, due to the interference of many factors in the real scene, information such as workers and task costs in the scene is usually not completely uncertain. To solve the above problems, a spatial crowdsourcing task pricing algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the algorithm uses the proposed dimension-up gray wolf algorithm and support vector regression(DU_GWO-SVR) to predict the task price, and then sets the price based on the obtained price. In order to solve the instability of average price and matching number caused by dynamic supply and demand, an adjustment mechanism is designed to stabilize the average price of tasks. The experiment uses a real data set-the New York taxi data set, and compares it with the classic greedy algorithm and binary matching algorithm. The experimental results show that the matching rate of the proposed algorithm is above 75\% when the scene information is not completely uncertain.},

However, existing social recommendation methods usually focus on the shallow relations of user-item interactions and social networks to mine potential user preferences, which fail to provide a fine-grained consideration of the inhomogeneous influence and the changes in user interest or item attractiveness over time in high-order interactions of multiple relation types. To address these issues, we propose a novel method named Dynamic Social Recommendation with High-matching Inhomogeneous Relations (DSRHIR) to reveal the influence of inhomogeneity in dynamic interactions on social recommendation from multiple perspectives. Specifically, we first model the short-term dynamic and long-term static representations of both users with social relations and similar relations, and items with correlations. Then, we combine their dynamic and static representations during the interaction and the information from the high-order neighbors of these three relations to obtain a graph-augmented representation. Finally, the graph-augmented representation is used to modulate high-matching user interest and item attractiveness. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DSRHIR.},

Existing industrial detection models generally adopt a pure convolutional structure for ease of deployment. However, the detection accuracy of these models is often insufficient to meet the requirements of the scene. To improve the detection model accuracy and ease of deployment, this paper proposes a convolutional merging Transformer network(CMTRNet). The CMTR-Net model proposes a backbone network (CNN-Former) that uses convolutional modules to replace self-attention, combining the Transformer architecture with a convolutional structure. This approach not only avoids the drawback of self-attention high computation complexity that is detrimental to deployment but also improves the model detection accuracy. Based on CNN-Former, this paper also proposes a feature fusion module that can better fuse the features extracted by CNN-Former. Further-more, based on the CMTRNet model and the characteristics of circuit board defects, this paper proposes a loss function called Melt-IoU, which can make the initial training phase smoother and further improve detection accuracy. Experiments have shown that CMTRNet outperforms existing advanced models on both datasets.},

  abstract  = {Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) is an important research topic in the field of cyberspace security. With the explosion in the number of malicious attacks in recent years, machine learning-based detection method is now the most common and efficient approach. While traditional centralized machine learning needs to transmit data to the central server for training, which not only requires the central server to have large computing resources, but also causes problems such as sensitive data leakage and communication overhead. As a distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) can achieve multi-party collaborative training and aggregate a unified global model without data sharing, which can well alleviate these problems. It is worth noting that existing studies on the use of FL in HIDS are all conducted in the scenario where the data is independent and identically distributed (IID). However, due to the different context of hosts, the data generated by hosts is usually non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) in reality. Therefore, We investigate the impact of Non-IID data with different skew levels on FL in HIDS. On this basis, we propose a data augmentation FL algorithm based on Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to reduce the impact of Non-IID data. We also develop a data collection module using extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to collect a dataset for experiments. Experimental results show that our proposed FL algorithm can effectively improve the performance of HIDS under Non-IID data.},

First, image weighting and data enhancement strategies are used to address the long-tailed distribution, which increases the effective training samples and greatly alleviates the data imbalance problem while reducing the manual labeling cost. Second, an efficient channel attention mechanism is incorporated into the backbone network to mitigate the impact of dimensionality reduction on the channel attention learning effect. Next, the SPPFCSPC module is introduced in spatial pyramid pooling to extract features from the spatial information of the context. Finally, the decoupled detection head is introduced to separate the classification and regression tasks to improve pest identification accuracy and enhance model robustness. The experimental results show that compared with the YOLOv5s model, ECA-YOLOv5s improves accuracy, recall, and average precision mean values by 15.9\%, 17.8\%, and 19.7\%, respectively.

  abstract  = {The high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) could be addressed by optimizing Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) frameworks. In this context, this paper proposes a methodology for ergonomically effective task delegation and HRC for manufacturing applications based on two hypotheses. The first hypothesis states that it is possible to rapidly quantify ergonomically professional tasks using motion data from a few wearable sensors and then delegate the high-risk tasks to a collaborative robot. The second hypothesis is that, compared to typical HRC frameworks involving physical interaction, the ergonomics and safety of an HRC scenario can be enhanced by combining gesture recognition and pose estimation. These remove unnecessary motions that could expose operators to ergonomic risks, decrease the amount of physical effort, and make the robot aware and responsive to the presence and gestures of the operators. The methodology is evaluated by optimizing the HRC scenario of a television manufacturing process, yet it is described how it can be reconfigured for other industrial scenarios. The effect of the temporal and spatial adaptation on the operator&#39;s range of motion was analyzed through three separate experiments. The effectiveness of HRC is measured through the standard key performance indicators (KPIs); however, to evaluate the collaboration and required physical demand, two KPIs are proposed in this paper. These are the rate of spatial adaptation and the rate of reduction in the operator&#39;s motion. The results demonstrated that the methodology enhanced the ergonomics and efficiency of the production process. First, the robot was delegated two tasks identified as the most ergonomically dangerous for human operators. Then the optimized HRC achieved an average rate of spatial adaptation of 29.37\% and a decrease in operator movement of 28.8\% across 14 subjects compared to HRC frameworks that do not include spatial and temporal adaptation.},

  abstract  = {Thyroid nodule is a common clinical disease, although most nodules are benign, the incidence rate of thyroid cancer has risen rapidly in recent years. Even though many methods have achieved automated thyroid nodule segmentation based on deep learning, these methods are based on supervised learning and require a large amount of labeled data for training. However, the labeling work must be carried out by professional doctors, which results in a small number of datasets and difficulty in labeling. To address this problem, this paper proposes a semi-supervised thyroid nodule segmentation model via joint consistency learning and co-training. This model includes two branches: consistency learning and co-training. In the consistency learning branch, based on consistent regularization, the teacher model guides the student model to optimize. In order to make the teacher model more stable, we design a co-training framework to further optimize the teacher model. In co-training branch, the teacher model and TransUNet extract different representations of the same sample and teach each other to prevent consistent but incorrect predictions between the teacher model and the student model. This semi-supervised model can learns useful feature representations from unlabeled data, and effectively trains the model with a small amount of labeled data, reducing the dependence on labeled data during the model training process.},

  abstract  = {Although deep learning methods are popular in recent years to achieve dominant image segmentation performance, the carefully annotated training images are very difficult to obtain in clinical medicine, and the deep learning model training demands a lot of computing resources which are not always available. To overcome these difficulties, it is very necessary to investigate segmentation algorithms which do not require any training data. In this work, we improve a semi-automatic conventional segmentation algorithm, fuzzy connectedness segmentation, by introducing the local information entropy of the ultrasound image into the fuzzy affinity membership function. The proposed semi-automatic local entropy based fuzzy connectedness (LEFC) segmentation algorithm is further modified by incorporating the popular deep learning methods to make the LEFC algorithm fully automatic. The proposed semi-automatic LEFC algorithm achieves better performance than other representative fuzzy connectedness segmentation algorithms with the accuracy and IoU values increased by 5.9~14\% and 5~10.5\%, and achieves very close segmentation performance as compared with the best deep learning model in the experiments (0.2\% lower accuracy and 0.2\% lower IoU compared to CE-Net). Besides, the automatic LEFC algorithm improves the segmentation results obtained by the corresponding deep learning based coarse segmentation modules with the accuracy and IoU increased by 0.2~8\% and 0.1~3.8\%, respectively. Furthermore, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed automatic LEFC algorithm obtains stably good segmentation performance even with limited training data, achieving the accuracy and IoU values (at the stable state) 23.6\% and 18.5\% higher than those of the corresponding U-Net model which is trained with the samesized dataset.},

  abstract  = {Recently, Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) with visual and textual factual knowledge have been widely used in tasks such as knowledge question answering, recommender systems, and entity disambiguation. Since most of the current MKGs still have defects, a multimodal knowledge graph completion technology is proposed, and multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is one of the basic processes. However, visual objects with high object classification scores are usually selected in previous tasks, which may result in the addition of noise from objects that are either irrelevant or redundant, which can adversely affect multimodal relationship extraction. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a Relation Extraction with Knowledge-enhanced Prompt-tuning modal on multimodal knowledge graph (REKP) to address these issues. Specifically, we inject potential knowledge from relational labels into the prompt construction of answer words and optimize their representation with structured constraints. A Transformer architecture with cross-modal attention is then used to fuse the visual and textual representations. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that our REKP model can achieve SOTA performance on the MNRE dataset with multimodal relational extraction.},

In this paper we will demonstrate the computational hardness (in particular, #P-hardness) of determining the relative power of a party in different settings, and provide practical algorithms to compute it. We will use our algorithms to face a case study where we will compare the relative power of parties in real elections.

These hidden priors improved the classification accuracy of deep neural classifiers compared with default uniform priors and default unidirectional backpropagation. They did so at little extra computational cost. Sinc-squared and Cauchy multivariate priors often had the best classification accuracy.

We use the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to construct highly accurate prediction models, and develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for energy and carbon management.

However, these methods do not pay attention to the fine-grained features inside a single token, which can lead to the loss of semantic information in the object detection task. To address this issue, we propose a novel network for the above problem, which consists of three components, (1) Internal Multiscale Token Module (IMTM) focuses on the receptive field size of each token and transforms the token dimension size to effectively extract more multiscale features within the self-attention layer, thereby improving the performance and generalization ability of the model. (2) Differential Filter Module (DFM) uses a convolutional network to focus on high-frequency information in the image, helping the Transformer to learn edge features and establish local context, while improving the model performance through residual connections. (3) Feature Fusion Module (FFM) enhances the local and global information extracted by the network by fusing information from different dimensions. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC shows that our proposed method can achieve a state-of-the-art performance on object detection.},

The system performance in effectiveness and human safety is validated and compared with one of the latest state-of-the-art online coverage path planning algorithms called SimExCoverage-STC. The experimental results confirmed both the high level of safety for humans and the efficiency of the developed algorithm in terms of decrease of path length (by 37.1\%), number (39.5\%) and size (35.2\%) of turns, and time (7.6\%) to complete the disinfection task, with a small loss in the percentage of area covered (0.6\%), in comparison with the state-of-the-art approach.},

These methods mainly focus on learning more effective information through the encoder, while paying less attention to the decoder.

This paper introduces a novel approach called IAC, which aims to learn Implicit Attribute Composition for ZSL. This method is more comprehensive compared to attribute localization that solely focuses on class-level attribute supervision. IAC utilizes subspace representations that efficiently capture the inherent structure of high-dimensional image features. Then, we learn implicit attribute composition through subspace representation learning.

  abstract  = {Depth completion is a crucial computer vision task that aims to fill in missing or incomplete depth values in a depth map. In this paper, we propose SDC: Spatial Depth Completion for Outdoor Scenes. Our approach leverages a two-stage architecture with a spatial feature extractor (SFE) to utilize multi-scale features for accurate depth completion effectively. The proposed method incorporates attention mechanisms, including the Efficient Position Attention Module (EPAM) and Channel Attention Module (CAM), to adaptively fuse depth map features and improve the accuracy of depth completion. Additionally, the Pearson loss function is employed to further enhance the accuracy of the completed depth maps. Experimental results on the KITTI depth completion benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or better results than traditional depth completion methods while significantly reducing the number of parameters. The proposed SDC model shows great potential in practical applications of depth completion, with its ability to effectively fuse multiscale features and compact model size.},

  abstract  = {Efficient power inspection is crucial for maintaining a stable power system. During an inspection, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) usually need to be recharged due to the wide geographical range of inspection and the limited battery capacity of UAVs. This limitation makes the problem more challenging that requires not only optimizing the task execution order, but also taking the chargings of UAVs into consideration. In order to address this complex problem, this work first formulates the UAV power inspection planning problem with charging stations. After that, we propose a new heuristic navigation model, in which UAVs can follow a heuristic rule to decide where to go next based on both its own information and task-related information. To obtain the heuristic rule, we design a set of features to describe the status of the UAVs and task completion. Then a genetic programming (GP) algorithm is introduced to evolve and get the heuristic rule. Finally, by applying heuristic navigation rule, the UAV navigation model can automatically prioritize task and charging order, and generate UAV flight routes that satisfy all constraints. The experiment results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have become a popular method to solve data-driven optimization problems (DOPs), which are common in industry. However, with the development of the Internet of Things, data are collected, processed, and stored in a distributed manner, leading a new optimization paradigm for SAEAs. To make SAEAs adapt to these distributed DOPs, this paper employs the edge computing paradigm to develop a platform that provides technical support for SAEAs with distributed structures, named ECdo. Specifically, the platform utilizes KubeEdge, an open-source edge computing framework, to mount the cluster and combines microservice interface design with the containerization strategy to offer a flexible deployment approach for distributed SAEAs. In addition, an efficient and stable internal communication mechanism is designed for the interaction between distributed components within the platform. To demonstrate the application of ECdo, we take the examples of a class of distributed DOPs, in which the objective and constraints are expensive and need to be approximated by accumulated data. These problems are known as distributed and expensive constrained optimization problems (DECOPs). We implement a distributed SAEA on ECdo to address DECOPs in real-world scenarios. Experiments show that the ECdo can provide the expected implementation for distributed SAEAs with good network tolerance under tough network conditions.},

The ridesharing problem (RSP) is mainly to match drivers to suitable passengers. In practice, passengers appear dynamically, and the departure and the destination locations of these subsequent orders are unknown, resulting in the dynamic RSP (DRSP). To solve this dynamic optimization problem, this paper develops a new genetic programming hyperheuristic (GPHH) method to evolve order dispatching rules (ODRs), which can guide drivers to match suitable passengers in real time. The proposed GPHH method contains a heuristic template for simulation-based hyper-heuristic optimization. The experiment results show that the proposed GPHH method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis revealed some valuable insights, such as the generalizability of the generated rules and the impact of some features on the results.},

The correlation between mixed speech features and speaker embedding is fully exploited, and a dual-path structure is used for local and global perceptual modeling. We evaluate the model on the WSJ0-2mix-extr dataset in terms of its ability to reconstruct signal quality. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline systems on WSJ0-2mix-extr and achieves better generalizability on the Libri-2talker dataset. Furthermore, the proposed model can significantly reduce the word error rate of mixed speech on speech recognition from 79.49\% to 32.73\%.},

Considering the diversity of abnormal events, we use the memory module to record the prototype patterns of normal features and propose feature discretization loss and feature aggregation loss to make a compact representation between features and separation between feature terms to improve the accessibility and prediction accuracy of the memory module.

Multilingual pre-trained language models can be trained on multiple languages, and the model can understand multiple languages at the same time. At present, the search on pre-trained models mainly focuses on rich resources, while there is relatively little research on low-resource languages such as minority languages, and the public multilingual pre-trained language model can not work well for minority languages. Therefore, this paper constructs a multilingual pre-trained model named MiLMo that performs better on minority language tasks, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh and Korean. To solve the problem of scarcity of datasets on minority languages and verify the effectiveness of the MiLMo model, this paper constructs a minority multilingual text classification dataset named MiTC, and trains a word2vec model for each language. By comparing the word2vec model and the pre-trained model in the text classification task, this paper provides an optimal scheme for the downstream task research of minority languages. The final experimental results show that the performance of the pre-trained model is better than the word2vec model, and it has achieved the best results in minority multilingual text classification.

In this paper, we propose KTPose, a novel keypoint-based tokens in Vision Transformer for human pose estimation, which includes an instance-aware keypoint head and a keypoint refinement with transformer. To address the limb deformation issue, the instance-aware keypoint head is devised to capture the discriminative features dynamically based on the coarse localized keypoints. Further, we propose the multi-granularity vision tokens, in which each keypoint is explicitly embedded as a token to simultaneously learn spatial dependencies and constraint relationships from vision transformer for human pose estimation. Extensive experiments are carried out on two benchmark datasets, which demonstrate that KTPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves 76.6AP (?1.06\%) and 75.7AP (?0.93\%) on COCO validation and test-dev sets, respectively.

Therefore, we have made slight modifications to the conventional genetic algorithm (GA) to effectively optimize the gradient signed function of the classic FGSM and generate adversarial examples from the perspective of the black-box attack. To attack multiple given target classes simultaneously, we initialize multiple different subpopulations and ensure that each subpopulation attacks a specified target class. Additionally, we propose two different strategies to migrate successfully attacked subpopulations into unsuccessful ones to ramp up attacks on unsuccessful classes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with the conventional GA when attacking the well-trained VGG19_BN model on the CIFAR-10 database. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the proposed strategies on performance and analyze their respective contributions. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm can successfully attack a greater variety of classes at a faster rate.},

The existing compression work on lower-precision quantization still has a severe accuracy decrease and rarely focuses on the information hidden in the different modules of the model. In this paper, we propose a distillation-aware quantization with mixed precision method combined with quantization and knowledge distillation. We achieve the ultra-low mixed precision quantization with the different sensitivity of different modules of BERT. Moreover, we leverage knowledge distillation to reduce the model accuracy degradation. We extensively test our method on four GLUE tasks.

  abstract  = {Global sea surface wind speed is a key parameter for weather forecasting and climate studies. However, retrieving it from Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) signals reflected from the ocean surface requires complex data processing and modelling. In addition, conventional GNSS-R methods have limited accuracy in the relatively high wind speed range of 12-20m/s. A novel model - GSWR-DARN - is presented here that combines data augmentation techniques with a residual network to improve the performance of GNSS-R wind speed retrieval. The model transforms one-dimensional (1D) data from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) into two-dimensional (2D) data that can be fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while enhancing the interconnectivity between different physical variables. By adding a residual network module, the model achieves higher accuracy and better distribution of wind speed estimates in the 0–20 m/s range than traditional methods. The model is shown to reduce the average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by 22.48\% and increase the average Pearson correlation coefficient by 22\%. It is also shown that the model significantly reduces the error distribution in the range of 12-20m/s wind speed range. The model is compared with other models of varying complexity - including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the CNN model, the ResNet18 model, the ResNet34 model and the Vision Transformer (Vit) model - and it is found that accuracy decreases with increasing number of residual blocks due to inherent characteristics of CYGNSS data.},

However, in a realistic situation, one or more DMs may be unavailable at times in CRP iterations due to technical or non-technical reasons. This paper considers such a scenario wherein the DMs are sparsely present. Hence, working out a model to take care of such pertinent absences that eventually make GDM possible. The bounded confidence of an individual DM is used to facilitate CRP in evaluating the opinions of the unavailable DMs. We propose to assign weight to a DM based on their cumulative presence in the decision process.

To address these issues, a novel transformer, i.e., Spatiotemporal Encode-Again Transformer (SEAT), is proposed for traffic prediction. In the SEAT, two components, spatial-temporal cross attention, and encode-again strategy are designed to learn spatiotemporal features and capture the relationship among forecasting series. We conducted experiments on several public datasets, METR-LA, PeMS-Bay, and PeMS-S. In particular, SEAT outperforms existing models by up to 6\% improvement in RMSE measurement.

  abstract  = {In order to improve the security of IoT information systems, this paper proposes the Blockchain-based Framework for Securing IoT Information (BFSII), which is built on consortium blockchain and the edge IoT architectures. This paper addresses data security in smart hotels as a research scenario. The majority of data generated by IoT devices in smart hotels contains users&#39; private information, which is susceptible to alteration and leakage during transmission and storage. The BFSII solution leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain to enhance data traceability and tamper-proof capabilities. And it uses edge IoT architecture and consortium blockchain to improve system operational efficiency. Sensitive data generated by IoT devices are protected in BFSII. The experiment&#39;s findings show that BFSII can boost smart hotel system security while maintaining operational effectiveness. The information management system of smart hotels is provided with an inventive and secure solution by the BFSII framework.},

However, the traditional implementations of white-box cryptographic algorithms (WBCAs) are inefficient and impractical for IoT devices that require fast encryption and decryption of large amounts of data. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that can accelerate WBCAs employed by IoT devices with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Our framework leverages the inherent multithreading capabilities of GPUs to simultaneously perform a large number of table lookups required in WBCAs. Additionally, we employ pipelined execution strategies to enhance performance further. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it to two well-known WBCAs and evaluate its performance on two IoT devices. The experimental results show that our framework can improve performance by up to 70 times compared with the execution on a single-threaded CPU.},

Although some methods have achieved promising effects, there are still some negative aspects, such as inappropriate feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting the subcellular location of proteins that combines multiple features taken from several data sources. Firstly, we obtain three features, Di-peptide Composition, Moran correlation and Conjoint-Triad, from the amino acid sequence. We also employ node2vec to extract features from protein-protein interaction networks and combine them with gene ontology. To eliminate redundant information between features, we then fuse the multiple features from different data source with an auto-encoder. Finally, we employ a supervised learning model, Wide and Deep, to predict the subcellular location of proteins. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods. This approach provides a promising solution for accurately predicting the subcellular location of proteins.},

To accomplish this task, many computational methods have been proposed, but existing methods fail to make full use of the connection between proteins and other molecules, and can not effectively capture the complex semantics between biological entities related to proteins, resulting the poor performance. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph attention diffusion network (HGADN-PPI) to capture the complex semantics in the biological heterogeneous graph for PPI prediction. HGADN-PPI enhances heterogeneous graph learning from the intra-layer perspective and the inter-layer perspective. Concretely, in the intra-layer perspective, we constructed the heterogeneous graph attention diffusion layer (HGADL) which combines biological semantic information from different paths. To enable information passing from important nodes multiple hops away, we use graph diffusion to establish connections between nodes that are not directly connected. In the intra-layer perspective, we enlarge the receptive field by stacking multiple HGADLs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the selected representative baselines.},

To address these problems, inspired by the process of human learning knowledge, we propose the Feature-aware Fusion Correlation Neural Network (FaFCNN), which introduces a feature-aware interaction module and a feature alignment module based on domain adversarial learning. This is a general framework for disease classification, and FaFCNN improves the way existing methods obtain sample correlation features. The experimental results show that training using augmented features obtained by pre-training gradient boosting decision tree yields more performance gains than random-forest based methods. On the low-quality dataset with a large amount of missing data in our setup, FaFCNN obtains a consistently optimal performance compared to competitive baselines.

Different types of speech tasks are designed to evaluate subjects&#39; verbal ability. Currently, machine learning methods for the detection of PD mostly concentrate on a single type of speech data. To make full use of the information from multiple sources, multimodal learning has been proposed and developed rapidly in recent years. However, most multimodal frameworks fall short of the reliability requirements of medical diagnosis. To solve this problem, a trustworthy model based on multi-type acoustic materials is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of three major components, i.e., pseudo-type generation, decision-making, and opinion combination. The objective of this endeavor is to offer accurate and reliable PD detection, aiding in the diagnostic process. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over state-of-the-art fusion methods and highlight the necessity of each component in the proposed framework.},

Meanwhile, the variability of harmonies generated by previous methods is insufficient. To solve these problems, we propose a novel LSTM-based Hierarchical Variational Auto-Encoder (LHVAE) to investigate the influence of emotional conditions on melody harmonization, while improving the quality of generated harmonies and capturing the abundant variability of chord progressions. Specifically, LHVAE incorporates latent variables and emotional conditions at different levels (piece-and bar-level) to model the global and local music properties. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based melody context vector at each step to better learn the correspondence between melodies and harmonies. Objective experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms other LSTM-based models. Through subjective evaluation, we conclude that only altering the types of chords hardly changes the overall emotion of the music. The qualitative analysis demonstrates the ability of our model to generate variable harmonies.},

  abstract  = {The protection of model intellectual property is becoming an increasingly important issue. However, the existing methods for protecting model ownership, although effective, have limitations. Firstly, they primarily focus on classification models, and secondly, most of the proposed methods reduce the model&#39;s utility. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a task-agnostic model ownership verification framework based on feature fingerprint, called TMOVF, which separates ownership verification from model task. Our key idea is that model knowledge can be uniquely characterized by the extracted features, which may be high-dimensional, complicated, and difficult to compare for each input sample. Nevertheless, these features contain inherent information that cannot be ignored in cases of piracy. To measure the inheritance of our fingerprint, we introduce outlier detection into model ownership verification, which is a first in the field. By reconstructing the outlier detection algorithm, we extract the feature fingerprints of the victim model and the suspicious model, and compute the outliers of their feature fingerprints. By comparing the results, we can verify the ownership of the models. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our framework and demonstrate the inheritability of feature fingerprints in stolen models. Our experiments show that the framework is effective in verifying ownership, regardless of the model task. Additionally, our results demonstrate that our framework is more effective than existing methods.},

Six binary classification models were created by training on variable data window times of paretic upper limb accelerometer feature data, and four preliminary visualizations were proposed to provide health professionals with information on the duration, intensity, symmetry, and variability of upper limb activity. The models were evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores to classify the data into two classes: severe or moderately severe motor function. The AUC scores ranged from 0.72 to 0.94, with higher scores indicating better model performance.

  abstract  = {Every third work-related accident involving death or permanent disability is a falling from height accident. Preventing or mitigating the impact of such accidents, has been a long-standing challenge and using wearable robotics technology in such applications is an emerging research field. In this paper, we propose a novel fall velocity mitigation and upper-body reorientation mechanism using a wearable Cold Gas Thruster (CGT) unit to decrease the impact and therefore the injuries for low heights falls (≤ 10m). The ejecting pressurized cold gas of CGTs generates a reaction force that is used for attitude control of spacecrafts and satellites, and in wearable manned maneuvering units of astronauts. Here, we demonstrate, through a conceptual design in simulation, the application of CGTs in reorienting falling humans and reducing their impact velocity to a safe level ( $\leq 4.8 m/s$ ). The simulation system accounts for constraints of the device design including the weight of the CGT unit (based on its eventual wearability and usability), the height and weight of the human, the safe impact velocity, and the safe impact orientation, evaluated for different fall heights. The simulation uses a pre-existing skeletal model from OpenSim for the human motion modeling, and implements a feedback control architecture to allow point-mass evaluation as well as multi-body dynamic simulation. Analysed over a set of different initial falling postures, the results show that a wearable backpack CO 2 -based CGT unit, with CGTs mounted in specific locations, is capable of achieving a fall impact velocity $\leq 4.8 m/s$ , and maintain an upper body impact orientation within ± 15°, for falling heights ≤ 10m. The conceptual design establishes the feasibility of using CGTs as wearable fall arresting devices and lays the groundwork for their eventual real-world implementation.},

  abstract  = {The traditional approach in developing balance support devices for humans follows two strategies: (i) to simulate these systems in simplified conditions, considering for instance, the human model as an inverted pendulum; or (ii) using them in open-loop configuration, relying on feed forward controllers. Both approaches being focused on device performance tend to ignore the collateral effect that the device generated torques have on human motor control and the changes caused in gait patterns, etc. With the aim of extracting and understanding such effects this paper presents a first study in combining the control of a balance support wearable gyroscope device with a full-body neuro-musculoskeletal human model in the loop in a predictive simulation framework. The SCONE predictive simulation software provides an OpenSim (OS) human model with 9 degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) and 18 muscles (9 per leg). The wearable device is modeled in OS and implemented in SCONE as a pyramid cluster of variable speed control moment gyroscopes (VSCMGs), which includes realistic actuator models for the gyroscopes, and allows redundancy to overcome singularities. The performance of the VSCMG device for balance support in 3D was evaluated in two different simulation scenarios: (i) recovering the vertical position of the human model without any human effort contribution, from an initial 10° backward inclination; (ii) supporting a walking human model, overcoming intermittent force perturbations to the torso in 3D. The second case also demonstrates that the VSCMG device and the human effort parameters can be optimized to keep them working synchronously to fulfil their balancing and walking tasks. The successful synchronization of the intervening controllers enabled us to operate the VSCMG device in three modes, analyzing the effects on the metabolic energy expenditure, the gait and balance patterns of the human model. The results show that the knowledge of such mutual device-human adaptations can indeed lead to crucial insights and help improve the designs of the wearable devices themselves.},

In this work, we recorded electromyography (EMG) and kinematic (acceleration, orientation, angular rate) information of inertial measurement units (IMUs) during reach-and-grasp movements (uni-/bimanual palmar/lateral grasps) in groups of non-disabled people ( $\mathrm{n}=12$ ) and of people with incomplete cervical SCI ( $\mathrm{n}=3$ ). We extracted 12 EMG and 11 IMU feature types of 8 EMG and 45 IMU channels. We applied the feature selection approaches chi-square, maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (MRMR), Random Forest (RF), and Boruta for dimensionality reduction of the feature set and evaluated resulting subsets. We could show for both groups that there was no significant decrease in classification accuracy (RF model) with chi-square and Boruta subsets compared to the baseline set of all features, despite their heavily reduced dimensionalities (&lt;25\% and &lt;74\%, respectively). Accuracies peaked at 98.6 ± STD 0.9\% (control group, Boruta) and 97.7 ± STD 1.1\% (participants with SCI, Boruta). We found the MRMR subsets to be performing significantly worse. We could further show high information interpretability of chi-square and RF scores that indicated the importance of sensors and extracted features for reach-and-grasp classification. We plan to investigate how the approach can be implemented in real-time reach-and-grasp HMIs for persons with SCI.},

  abstract  = {Augmented reality(AR) plays an important role in geography teaching for creating interactive and immersive experiences. Combining object detection algorithms with AR can identify the specified content quickly and thus overlay digital content to the real world. However, finger occlusion in AR interactions has a bad influence on object detection, which will affect the users&#39; experience. In this paper, we focus on the detection of country regions on a globe, and aim to improve the performance of object detection in practical AR development. Firstly, we propose a geographic region recognition approach based on region missing-completion. Specifically, we design a supplementary algorithm PCCNet to infer the obscured country by utilizing the invariance of relative position between countries. Moreover, to reduce manual annotation and enrich the virtual dataset, we design a scalable automatic annotation system based on the Unreal Engine and construct a virtual globe dataset named DGAR. Finally, we build an AR geography-assisted teaching system to recognize the area pointed and play multi-media materials. Experiment results show that our proposed approach effectively improves the recognition accuracy from 88.5\% to 94\%. The practical significance and value of the proposed recognition approach have been confirmed based on the positive user experience with the AR system, highlighting its efficacy in real world scenarios.},

Due to the active evolution of these wheelchair systems wheelchair-mounted robotic arms can be caught as the next level of development. However, the current state of intelligence is far behind the expansion and this lack causes to add extra cognitive load on handicapped users. Most of the available hindrances to autonomous operation could certainly be achieved by replicating natural human behaviors. Under these circumstances understanding human cognition on positioning a wheelchair around a table will drastically ease the autonomous object manipulation tasks by these systems. Hence to understand natural human behavior, a human study with three sub-studies was designed and reveal the prominent factors behind human cognition. Results were analyzed statistically to identify the significance of the considered factors. In lite of the study, approaching and positioning of the wheelchair mainly depend on the object position, obstacle position, and obstacles configuration within the considered workspace. Further orientation mainly depends on the object&#39;s position and approaching direction. Besides, these outcomes would be extremely beneficial in synthesizing human cognition to build human-friendly mobile robots for uplifting users&#39; lives as well.},

While there have been attempts at using vision-based techniques for these tasks, they mostly use planogram compliance for detection of any anomalies, a technique that has been found lacking in robustness and scalability. Moreover, existing systems rely on human intervention to perform corrective actions after detection. In this paper, we present Co-AD, a Concept-based Anomaly Detection approach using a Vision Transformer (ViT) that is able to flag misplaced objects without using a prior knowledge base such as a planogram. It uses an auto-encoder architecture followed by outlier detection in the latent space. Co-AD has a peak success rate of 89.90\% on anomaly detection image sets of retail objects drawn from the RP2K dataset, compared to 80.81\% on the best-performing baseline of a standard ViT auto-encoder. To demonstrate its utility, we describe a robotic mobile manipulation pipeline to autonomously correct the anomalies flagged by Co-AD. This work is ultimately aimed towards developing autonomous mobile robot solutions that reduce the need for human intervention in retail store management.},

However, both of these methods are very computationally expensive. This article proposes using a mixture density network to learn the probability that a rotation angle belongs to the fault-tolerant rotation ranges. A difference filter is used to remove outlying rotation angles predicted by the network, and the remaining rotation angles are grouped together to generate the fault-tolerant workspace. Because this method is highly computationally efficient, it can be used alongside a genetic algorithm to compute the optimal artificial joint limits to maximize the area of the fault-tolerant workspace for a given robot arm. The predicted fault-tolerant workspace is compared to the actual fault-tolerant workspace, which proves the effectiveness of this algorithm. The computational speed of this proposed algorithm is roughly 390 times faster than the traditional method. Finally, a trajectory is placed within the fault-tolerant workspace predicted by the proposed method, and the experimental results show that this trajectory is tolerant to arbitrary joint failures.},

But the localization granularity of IRBL is coarse and the localization accuracy of SFL is easily reduced by the information which is unrelated to the bug. In order to refine the localization granularity of IRBL and improve the localization accuracy of SFL, this paper proposes ISBL (Combine Information Retrieval and Spectrum for Bug Localization), a statement-level software bug localization method based on information retrieval and spectrum. Firstly, the suspicious files are filtered using information retrieval technique, and then the suspicious files are used to reduce spectrum information for statement-level bug localization. To evaluate the performance of ISBL, experiments were conducted on the Defects4J dataset, and MRR and TOP@N were used as metrics for evaluation. As the experimental results show, for MRR, ISBL increased 3.0\% and 3.1\% compared to Ochiai and DStar, respectively; for TOP@1, ISBL locates 4 more bug statements than Ochiai and DStar.},

  abstract  = {Fuzz testing is a widely used technique to detect software defects and vulnerabilities. Coverage-guided fuzzing aims to improve code coverage by generating offspring test cases through mutation, executing the program under test, and retaining interesting seeds for subsequent mutations using customized genetic algorithms. However, existing fuzzing tools rarely consider the similarity between seeds during mutation. Mutating similar seeds frequently generates similar offspring test cases, which results in similar coverage and reduces the efficiency of fuzz testing. To alleviate the impact of this problem on fuzz testing, this paper proposes a fuzz testing method based on seed diversity analysis, which focuses on the characteristics of seeds and uses byte sequences as a feature to measure the similarity between seeds. It collects seeds that can cover new edges and constructs a shorter seed queue with significant differences based on this feature, which replaces the original seed queue for mutation. Based on the proposed method, we implement the prototype tools AFL-Varied and Neuzz-Varied. Compared with AFL and Neuzz on six projects, the edge coverage and basic block coverage can be increased by 214.57\% and 233.33\% at most, respectively.},

Experiments demonstrate the proposed method greatly reduces the requirements of labels in network anomaly detection. For example, on ISCX 2012 dataset, given only 0.05\% training labels our semi-supervised approach obtains nontrivial 81.7\% (2-class) and 64.9\% (5-class) Fl-scores on the validation set, which is far better than the supervised counterparts using the same training data.

The proposed model comprises a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) as the overall framework to obtain global information and strong robustness. Additionally, we integrate Residual Nonlocal Attention (RNA) Module into the framework to adaptively capture nonlocal context dependencies across the input features.

Firstly, due to the limited number of samples in the symbol dataset and the class imbalance problem, this paper proposes a Random Splicing algorithm suitable for P &amp;ID images. It can selectively augment one or more classes of symbols in P&amp;ID images. Then, to address the problem of subtle differences and difficulty in dis-tinguishing between symbols, this paper introduces the CBAM and improves its “series” structure to a “parallel” structure, enhancing the information fusion between channel feature maps and spatial feature maps through concatenation and channel shuffle, after using a $1\times 1$ convolution to achieve channel alignment, resulting in the PCSC_CBAM (Parallel Concat Shuffle Convolution_CBAM). Finally, the YOLOv5+PCSC_CBAM model is obtained by introducing PCSC_CBAM into the Neck of YOLOv5, which can effectively detect symbols in P&amp;ID images and reduce the possibility of false negatives and false positives. The experimental results show that under only 1.97M parameters added, the YOLOv5+PCSC_CBAM model achieves high precision, recall, and mean Average Precision of symbol detection, reaching 95.6\%, 95.0\%, and 97.2\%, respectively.},

Drug-target interactions(DTIs) prediction is a crucial step for in-silico drug discovery and drug repurposing. However, manual identification of DTIs is extremely costly and time-consuming due to the large-scale chemical space. Using virtual screening to identify DTIs can significantly shorten development time and reduce costs. Recently, various attention models have been used to extract the features of drugs and proteins. However, these methods ignore the complex interactions between drugs and proteins. In this paper, we propose a sequence-based model, CHADTI, for DTIs prediction. We use stacked 1D-CNN layers to learn the features of drugs and a pre-trained model(ESM) to embed proteins. We design a novel attention mechanism to extract the complex interactions between drugs and proteins. Finally, We evaluate CHADTI on two datasets, and the results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

Most of the existing methods rely heavily on manually engineered domain knowledge, therefore, lack generalization and are inefficient. Moreover, previous methods mainly ignore the cold-start scenario(also known as the inductive setting), which requires the DDI prediction for new drugs. Previous works indicated that drugs with similar molecular structures may have similar chemical properties. In this paper, we proposed a DDI prediction model, Molecular SubStructure-based Cross-Dependent Network for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction(MSSCD-DDI). MSSCD-DDI generates the representations of drugs from only raw molecular without other high-level features limited by expert knowledge which can not be applied to new drugs. We adopt a cross-dependent scheme to pass messages between the relevance of substructure reactions between two drugs. MSSCD-DDI made effective and accurate predictions, which achieved up to more than 99\% in the transductive setting and 8.39\% improvement than the SOTA method in the inductive setting(cold start scenario).},

  abstract  = {Time series data are pervasive in varied real-world applications, and accurately identifying anomalies in time series is of great importance. Many current methods are insufficient to model long-term dependence, whereas some anomalies can be only identified through long temporal contextual information. This may finally lead to disastrous outcomes due to false negatives of these anomalies. Prior arts employ Transformers (i.e., a neural network architecture that has powerful capability in modeling long-term dependence and global association) to alleviate this problem; however, Transformers are insensitive in sensing local context, which may neglect subtle anomalies. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a local-adaptive Transformer based on cross-correlation for time series anomaly detection, which unifies both global and local information to capture comprehensive time series patterns. Specifically, we devise a cross-correlation mechanism by employing causal convolution to adaptively capture local pattern variation, offering diverse local information into the long-term temporal learning process. Furthermore, a novel optimization objective is utilized to jointly optimize reconstruction of the entire time series and matrix derived from cross-correlation mechanism, which prevents the cross-correlation from becoming trivial in the training phase. The generated cross-correlation matrix reveals underlying interactions between dimensions of multivariate time series, which provides valuable insights into anomaly diagnosis. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods and achieves 6.8\%-27.5\% $F_{1}$ score improvement. Our method also has good anomaly interpretability and is effective for anomaly diagnosis.},

Considerable theoretical and practical algorithms to accelerate approximate K-NN search have been presented. The approximate methods can improve searching efficiency and achieve satisfactory performance. Nevertheless, they are inherently approximation approaches and are not guaranteed to yield exact solutions. To obtain the K-NN results over high dimensional datasets efficiently while guaranteeing the same results as the linear search is a challenging task, attracting a large number of scholars. To this end, in this paper, we focus on improving the exact K-NN search efficiency over high dimensional datasets, and present a framework named LBPC to solve this problem. The lower bound based method and parallel computing are combined in LBPC to accelerate the exact K-NN search. In LBPC, the whole K-NN search task is divided into some sub-tasks and these sub-tasks can be conducted concurrently using the lower bound based method. The LBPC scheme allows users to utilize any lower bound to accelerate the exact K-NN query. In this paper, we use the segment mean to construct the lower bound and provide the theoretical analysis to show its computational efficiency and lower bound property. Various experiments are conducted to analyze the efficiency of LBPC, and the experimental results validate its effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {Text semantic matching is a core problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as information retrieval and question answering, which is significant in intelligent human-computer interaction. However, most deep neural matching models are driven by external knowledge, which lacks fine-grained feature extraction from the sentences, leading to limited performance improvement. Therefore, this paper focuses on generating sentence semantic representations without external knowledge for sentence pair matching. We propose a Gated Attentive Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (GACRNN), which incorporates a Gated Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN), Multi-scale Cross-Channel Attention Block (MC2AB), and bidirectional gate recurrent units (BiGRUs). First, a gate mechanism is introduced in the convolutional neural network to control the information interaction to extract multi-scale features from the sentence. Then, a multi-scale cross-channel attention mechanism is utilized to capture the feature dependencies at different scales in the channel dimension to generate expressive sentence representation. Finally, an extensive evaluation is conducted on two open-domain and two restricted-domain datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baselines in terms of sentence pair semantic matching accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The rapid advancement in blockchain technology has enabled its applications across wide spectrum of fields. The blockchain throughput, which is usually measured by Transactions Per Second (TPS), is one of the key metrics to reflect the performance of the blockchain systems. However, current blockchain systems have low TPS rates that makes them unsuitable for latency critical applications like Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. To address the above issue, the sharding technology, which divides the network into multiple disjoint groups so that transactions can be processed in parallel, is applied to the blockchain systems as a promising solution to improve TPS. This paper considers the Optimal Blockchain Sharding (OBCS) problem which is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) where the decision variables are the number of shards, block size and block interval. Previous works solved the OBCS problem via Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based methods where the action space has to be discretized such that it is not too large for tractability. However, the discretization degrades the solution quality since the optimal solution usually lies between discrete values. In this paper, we treat the block size and block interval as continuous decision variables and propose a sharding control algorithm based on Parametrized Deep Q-Networks (P-DQN) to efficiently handle the discrete-continuous hybrid action space without the scalability issue. Experimental results show that our Parametrized Deep Q-Networks Blockchain Sharding (P-DQNBS) method can effectively improve the TPS by up to 20\%.},

Firstly, we consider the transmission power setting and design a prioritization mechanism to determine the link selection. Secondly, we construct energy consumption models for user devices (UDs), BS and UAVs separately.

The former intends to undermine the gait signal features for fooling the recognizer, resulting that an unauthenticated user can be misrecognized as a specific authenticated victim. The latter usually adapts a common sparse presentation optimization to exactly match the similar gait signals for recognizing the genuine identities. Further, to tractably solve this NP-hard bilevel problem, we absorb the duality theory to reformulate a calculable second-order cone program. Finally, we perform experiments on public datasets to verify the validity of our strategy in adversarial effectiveness and attack costs.

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning is one of the most general paradigms to solve sequential decision making issues on the assumption that the action selection and environmental feedback are instantaneous, however, unfortunately this assumption is rarely true with regard to such ubiquitous delays in real-world system which could degrade the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. The most common solution to solve a fixed delay problem is to design a forward dynamic model which is used to predict the newest state by recursively iterating over long steps so that a predicted state can be got and it would be taken as the agent&#39;s observation to make the newest decision. However, there exists cumulative errors during the iterative process which make long-term prediction inaccurate and further affect agent&#39;s decision. Motivated by the goal to reduce cumulative errors, we propose a new algorithm named Multi-step Prediction model with Delayed Observation(MPDO), aiming at accurately predicting future state at longer horizons for better decision making. Our approach includes two parts: a multi-step prediction model and a strategy training based on proximal policy optimization algorithms(PPO). Our model only needs a small amount of data to conduct dynamic modeling quickly, and the accuracy of prediction and iteration speed are higher than traditional methods. Experiments on Gym and MuJoCo show that MPDO achieves higher performance in such different tasks with different delays compared with other state-of-the-art methods, which verify our method&#39;s effectiveness.},

Currently, numerical methods are commonly used to simulate the evolution of complex systems governed by PDEs.

In recent years, deep learning techniques, specifically Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have gained attention in the scientific community. PINNs have shown promising results in solving PDEs and simulating physical fields. In this study, the improved PINNs incorporate the constraints of PDEs and gradient information, enhancing the interpretability of the neural network model. Furthermore, an adaptive learning method is employed to update the weight coefficients of the loss function and dynamically adjust the ratio of each constraint term, resulting in accelerated training speed. Rogue waves are of significant research value in the field of nonlinear science and have found applications in various domains. In the experiment, we apply the improved PINNs to numerically simulate rogue wave solutions of PDEs. We evaluate the accuracy of the rogue wave simulation by conducting the error analysis of the results.

  abstract  = {In visual intelligent scenarios, large amounts of real-time video data are generated at the end. During the optimization process for different video tasks, frequent data copying between devices and hosts can be limited by data bandwidth, resulting in high system latency. We investigate computing bottlenecks in online video processing to reduce processing latency and improve efficiency. In this paper, we propose a joint video acceleration processing (JVAP) architecture for online edge systems. First, video-compressed streams are transmitted to the GPU for decoding and conversion of data content. Second, we design data pre-processing and post-processing modules to achieve specific functional operators and separately complete operator combinations and stitching. Different computing tasks can reuse the implemented operator library. Third, we modify the data interface of the inference task model to maintain the consistent flow of data in the GPU. We conduct experiments using videos of different qualities and model frameworks of varying scales. The results indicate that the proposed method enhances the average processing efficiency over 11\% with respect to existing representative acceleration frameworks and extends the potential application of online intelligent inference algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Multi-agent collaborative perception depends on sharing sensory information to improve perception accuracy and robustness, as well as to extend coverage. However, most collaborative perception methods ignore the limitations of communication networks, such as limited bandwidth and the possibility of wireless conflicts. To fill this gap, this paper proposes BlindSpotEliminator, a conflict-free scheduler over the cellular-V2X networks for supporting practical collaborative point cloud perception to eliminate blind spots. BlindSpotEliminator first identifies the blind spots for each vehicle, then lists the corresponding conflict relationships based on the distribution of the blind spots and communication conflicts, and finally designs an optimized point cloud data transmission strategy to eliminate the blind spots of each vehicle. Extensive experiments show that compared with greedy algorithm and random methods, BlindSpotEliminator achieves better efficiency, i.e., transmitting 20\% more point cloud data.},
