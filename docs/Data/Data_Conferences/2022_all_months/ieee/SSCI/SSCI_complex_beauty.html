  abstract  = {Black-box optimization (BBO) is a widely used technique for solving a variety of optimization problems including real-world applications with a high-dimensional expensive objective function. Among BBO methods, the Nelder–Mead (NM) method, which is a local search heuristic using a simplex, has been successful due to its simplicity and practical performance on low-dimensional problems. However, the NM method requires $n+1$ and $n$ evaluations to perform its initialization and Shrinkage operations respectively to optimize an n-dimensional objective. This is problematic when the objective is computationally and/or financially expensive because, in such a situation, we usually have a limited evaluation budget but those operations consume most of the entire budget. In this study, to address this drawback, we propose a simple but practical modification of the NM method that efficiently works for high-dimensional low-budget optimization. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the original NM method and the random search baselines on BBO benchmark problems.},

This paper proposes a nature-inspired ripple-spreading algorithm (RSA) to solve such problems. The RSA is devised by mimicking ripple propagation patterns on the perturbed water surface. Based on the properties of the k-CSPP, several strategies are proposed to stop exploring non-optimal or infeasible subpaths at an early stage without losing optimality. In addition, the RSA can solve the $k$ -CSPP with multiple destination nodes within a single run with minor modifications to the termination judgment of the algorithm. An illustrative example of how the RSA solves the $k$ -CSPP is presented, using ripple spreading and triggering phenomena to make its processes more comprehensible. Moreover, extensive experiments against existing algorithms exhibit the outstanding efficiency and robustness of the RSA, especially on large-scale networks. The experimental data imply that the RSA speeds up the problem-solving efficiency at least ten times. The RSA can be expected to make a difference in the real-world problems modeled as the $k$ -CSPP.},

Current interpretability approaches rely on local explanations or produce long explanations that tend to overload the user&#39;s cognitive abilities. In this paper, we address this problem by extracting interpretable, transparent models from opaque ones via a new readability-enhanced multi-objective Genetic Programming approach called REMO-GP. To achieve that, we adapt text readability metrics into model complexity proxies that support evaluating ML interpretability. We demonstrate that our approach can generate global interpretable models that mimic the decisions of complex opaque models over several datasets, while keeping model complexity low.},

The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the MCTS statistical tree is built and the selection policy plays a fundamental role in this. A selection policy that works particularly well, widely adopted in MCTS, is the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees, referred to as UCT. Other more sophisticated bounds have been proposed by the community with the goal to improve MCTS&#39;s performance on particular problems. Thus, it is evident that while the MCTS UCT behaves generally well, some variants might behave better. As a result of this, multiple works have been proposed to evolve a selection policy to be used in MCTS. Although all these works are inspiring, none of them have carried out an in-depth analysis shedding light under what circumstances an evolved alternative of MCTS UCT might be beneficial in MCTS due to focusing on a single type of problem. In sharp contrast to this, in this work we use five functions of different nature, going from a unimodal function, covering multimodal functions to deceptive functions. We demonstrate how the evolution of the MCTS UCT might be beneficial in multimodal and deceptive scenarios, whereas the MCTS UCT is robust in unimodal scenarios and competitive in the rest of the scenarios used in this study.},

Accordingly, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted differential evolution, which adapts the training data selection criterion to enhance the model accuracy and then optimization performance of our SAEA. In detail, the proposed algorithm builds multiple approximation models under different selection criteria. Then, the best-fitting model is utilized to screen candidate solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art SAEAs on a single-objective optimization benchmark suite up to 100 dimensions.},

Faster convergence under strict function evaluation budgets - often in the order of a hundred or fewer function evaluations - is thus expected, overcoming the cold start problem of conventional Bayesian optimization algorithms. In this short paper, we prove that the regret bounds can be further tightened when extending the method to multi-source settings (where each source may depict distinct source-target correlation), while also achieving internal algorithmic complexity that&#39;s only linear in the number of sources. Experimental results, on both synthetic test functions as well as a practical case study, verify our theoretical claim of performance gain.},

The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) suffers a performance deterioration on objective functions with LED because the redundant dimensions lead to modest hyperparameter settings and slow down the adaptation of the step-size. In this study, we focus on the separable CMA-ES (sep-CMA-ES), a variant of CMA-ES that restricts the covariance matrix to be diagonal, and propose a method to estimate the effectiveness of each dimension using the element-wise signal-to-noise ratios in the mean vector update and rank-µ update. Using the estimated effectiveness, we construct two countermeasures for LED, including an adaptation of hyperparameters and a refinement of the update rule in the cumulative step-size adaptation and two-point step-size adaptation, proposing sep-CMA-ES-LED. We experimentally showed that sep-CMA-ES-LED performed well on several benchmark functions with LED compared to the original sep-CMA-ES.},

  abstract  = {Swarm guidance is one of the modern applications of autonomous systems. In it, the controller acts as the transmitter (Tx), and the actuator acts as the receiver (Rx), exchanging control commands through a wireless communication channel to complete the task. The success of the shepherding task, which is a swarm control application, depends on the success of these transmissions through the wireless communication channel that may vary through time due to the Tx&#39;s and Rx&#39;s mobility. Therefore, to save time and energy, the Tx and Rx must adapt to the communication channel changes while ensuring the task&#39;s success in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we model the problem of optimising the mobility of the Tx (controller) to overcome the noise in the commands sent to the Rx (actuator) that acts as a robotic sheepdog in a shepherding scenario with a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, we propose an incremental search method to find near-optimal actions in real-time. Furthermore, two different reward functions are used to help the CU improve its mobility through online learning using Q-learning. The results proved that using Q-learning combined with the incremental search method improved the task&#39;s success rate ( $SR$ ) sometimes to exceed the $SR$ in the ideal communication link scenario, which is double its $SR$ in the presence of noise.},

Experiments with the introduced architectures were applied to the NP-hard problem of sorting permutations by reversals, using four different BAs, namely, simple Genetic Algorithm, Double-point crossover Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, and self-adjusting Particle Swarm Optimization.

  abstract  = {The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a robust framework for representing and solving many challenging and complex problems under constraints. More specifically, a CSP includes a set of variables defined over discrete domains of values, and a set of constraints restricting the values that the variables can simultaneously take. Solving a CSP consists of finding a complete assignment of values to variables such that all the constraints are satisfied. Given that the CSP is an NP-complete problem, finding a feasible solution requires an exponential time cost in practice. To overcome this difficulty in practice, we have proposed a discrete version of our bio-inspired Mother Tree Optimization (MTO) method that we called Discrete MTO-CSP (DMTO-CSP). The Conditional CSP (CCSP) extends the CSP with variables added or removed, dynamically, following some activity constraints. CCSPs can be very relevant in many dynamic applications, such as configuration and planning, where the possible changes are known a priori and can be enumerated. In these applications, we often have to manage a set of constraints together with some users&#39; preferences. This has motivated us to extend the CCSP model to qualitative preferences represented with the CP-net graphical model. We then propose an adapted variant of DMTO-CSP, that we call DMTO-CCSP, to solve CCSPs and CCSPs with preferences. In order to assess the performance of DMTO-CCSP, we conducted several comparative experiments on random CCSP instances generated using a variant of the known RB model. The results demonstrate the efficiency of DMTO-CSP compared to the known backtrack search technique.},

  abstract  = {This paper reports results from experiments using differential evolution (DE) in a high-fidelity simulation model of a contemporary financial market in which various traders are each simultaneously trying to adapt their own trading strategy to be as profitable as possible, given the distribution of strategies currently deployed at that time by other traders in the market. In our model, each trader maintains its own private local population of trading strategies, and uses DE to adaptively improve its strategies over time. Because all traders are simultaneously trying to adapt their strategies, and because the profitability of any one strategy at time $t$ can only be determined in reference to all other strategies also active in the market at time $t$ , the system is co-evolutionary rather than simply evolutionary. Furthermore, the existence of multiple separate DE populations in the system (i.e., one local DE population for each trader) means that technically this is a co-evolutionary metapopulation system. Using DE in a co-evolutionary metapopulation context requires extension of the usual DE approaches used in less challenging applications, chief of which is the introduction of a mechanism to detect and actively prevent convergence within each local DE population. Results are presented which demonstrate that when all traders are using this nonconvergent DE, the overall economic efficiency (i.e., the sum of profitability over all traders) of the market is greatly higher than a baseline established when all traders were using a simple stochastic hill-climbing strategy optimizer instead of DE. Source-code for the experiments described in this paper has been released on GitHub as open-source, freely available for other researchers to use to replicate and extend the results presented here.},

  abstract  = {Many practical optimization problems can be classified as large-scale global optimization problems (LSOP). Various cooperative co-evolutionary (CC) algorithms have been proposed to combat the challenges of LSOPs. When CC algorithms are applied to large scale optimization problems, the effects of inter-connected variables, known as variable dependencies, can cause major performance degradation. Current literature provides different approaches to decomposing large-scale problems with variable dependencies during optimization using a wide range of base optimizers. In this paper, a cooperative particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is used as the base optimizer in a scalability study with a range of decomposition methods to determine ideal divide-and-conquer approaches when using a CPSO. Experimental results demonstrate that a variety of dynamic regrouping of variables, seen in the merging CPSO (MCPSO) and decomposition CPSO (DCPSO), as well varying total fitness evaluations per dimension, results in high-quality solutions when compared to six state-of-the-art decomposition approaches.},

  abstract  = {Countless large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems occur in an ever-growing number of professions. Cooperative co-evolution (CC) has been shown to assist in discovering encouraging solutions to such complicated issues effectively. CC does this by breaking down a massive problem into distinct smaller sub-problems, which, when solved, are combined to form a solution to the original problem. How a problem is broken down is referred to as decomposition. CCs performance on LSGO problems is highly dependent on the decomposition used. Numerous LSGO decomposition methods have been introduced to address this issue; however, finding a favourable decomposition is challenging, hinting there is still room for improvement and further exploration. This paper presents a new particle swarm optimization decomposition (PSOD) strategy for tackling LSGO problems. PSOD, in addition to its parameters, is explored, showing they provide statistically significant importance in their selection for a few of the CEC , 2013 benchmark functions while being arbitrary for others. Further empirical studies compare PSOD&#39;s performance to other leading decomposition algorithms, resulting in PSOD performing best on the fully-separable Ackley function, being interchangeable for a few others, and performing competitively with the rest. PSOD attempts to combine Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cooperative Particle Swarm Optimization (CPSO) to evolve a decomposition while simultaneously optimizing an objective function for improved performance.},

An aircraft maintenance routing problem is one of the scheduling problems in the airline industry. Optimizing aircraft maintenance routing in airlines&#39; daily operations considering maintenance schedules for each aircraft has a big impact on airlines&#39; management. The objective is to minimize the number of aircraft in operation, the ground time for each aircraft, and the dispersion of flight times for all aircrafts. The optimal aircraft maintenance routing has to satisfy maintenance constraints when assigning aircraft to the already determined timetable for each flight and the specified maintenance schedule. The aircraft maintenance routing is a large-scale and complex problem. However, most of the conventional researches have applied mathematical programming to small-scale problems. Therefore, the application of meta-heuristics should be considered and reactive tabu search is one of the meta-heuristics. The effectiveness of the proposed parallel reactive tabu search based method is verified by comparing it with the conventional tabu search and reactive tabu search based methods. Simulations are conducted with the actual timetable of 150 flights to 12 airports per day for three days.},

A metric reflecting the overfitting level might be, however, extremely helpful for the comparison of different architectures and for the evaluation of various techniques to tackle overfitting. Motivated by the fact that overfitted neural networks tend to rather memorize noise in the training data than generalize to unseen data, we examine how the training accuracy changes in the presence of increasing data perturbations and study the connection to overfitting. While previous work focused on label noise only, we examine a spectrum of techniques to inject noise into the training data, including adversarial perturbations and input corruptions. Based on this, we define two new metrics that can confidently distinguish between correct and overfitted models. For the evaluation, we derive a pool of models for which the overfitting behavior is known beforehand. To test the effect of various factors, we introduce several anti-overfitting measures in architectures based on VGG and ResNet and study their impact, including regularization techniques, training set size, and the number of parameters. Finally, we assess the applicability of the proposed metrics by measuring the overfitting degree of several CNN architectures outside of our model pool.},

  abstract  = {Extrapolating beyond-demonstrator (BD) performance through the imitation learning (IL) algorithm aims to learn from and subsequently outperform the demonstrator. To that end, a representative approach is to leverage inverse rein-forcement learning (IRL) to infer a reward function from demon-strations before performing RL on the learned reward function. However, most existing reward extrapolation methods require massive demonstrations, making it difficult to be applied in tasks of limited training data. To address this problem, one simple solution is to perform data augmentation to artificially generate more training data, which may incur severe inductive bias and policy performance loss. In this paper, we propose a novel meta learning-based reward extrapolation (MLRE) algorithm, which can effectively approximate the ground-truth rewards using limited demonstrations. More specifically, MLRE first learns an initial reward function from a set of tasks that have abundant training data. Then the learned reward function will be fine-tuned using data of the target task. Extensive simulation results demonstrated that the proposed MLRE can achieve impressive performance improvement as compared to other similar BDIL algorithms.

Much of the research around protocells is concerned in one way or another with the protocells being ‘viable’, so it is important to have a good formal understanding of what viability actually is. In this work, we use stochastic chemical kinetics, which have been instrumental in accurately simulating various biological processes, to expand on some recent efforts in formalizing the viability of a protocell. We discuss key differences between the stochastic and deterministic models and demonstrate how stochasticity can expand on the formalism of viability. Finally, we argue that a more stochastic interpretation of the notion of viability boundaries is more appropriate for at least some systems where small numbers of reactants play vital roles.},

Here, we produce a minimal protocell model that allows us to explore this dynamic, and in the process see how previously developed methods of analysis in viability theory hold up when applied to a higher dimensional system. One distinction we come across is that an environment made up of conditions revealed as not being survivable by a parametric scan can nonetheless be sustainable for an agent traversing across those different possibilities.

Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) has recently been widely applied to achieve multi-label feature selection. However, when the number of labels is large, existing PSO-based multi-label approaches are computationally intensive. In multi-label classification, many labels usually appear together (for example, “sea” and “ship” labels), which are regarded as similar labels. This work proposes to group similar labels together to form a label cluster. By considering each label cluster as a super label, the number of labels is significantly reduced, and thus using the super labels can significantly reduce the computational cost. The experimental results on nine real-world datasets show that the proposed label clustering mechanism can maintain or even improve the multi-label classification performance while being much more efficient and selecting smaller numbers of features than using a large number of original labels.},

While CL has shown impressive performance for many computer vision tasks, the similar success has never been found in the field of IIR. In this work, we approach this problem by exploring the capability of deriving discriminative representations from pre-trained and fine-tuned CL models. To begin with, we investigate the efficacy of transfer learning in IIR, by comparing off-the-shelf features learned by a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) classifier with features learned by a CL model. The findings inspired us to propose a new training strategy that optimizes CL towards learning IIR-oriented features, by using an Average Precision (AP) loss together with a fine-tuning method to learn contrastive feature representations that are tailored to IIR. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant performance enhancement over the off-the-shelf features learned from a pre-trained DNN classifier on the challenging Oxford and Paris datasets.},

The goal is to create a patient - specific segmentation and rendering algorithm in two aspects, namely geometric modelling and material properties estimation. The spines are isolated from the CT scan data using an in house segmentation algorithm based on U - Net architecture, which are then rendered using the marching cube algorithm. Two rendering parameters (step size and voxel size) are tuned to give the best visual result. The material property are extracted from the gray scale values of the CT scan. The developed algorithm are bench - marked against an open source segmentation software.},

  abstract  = {Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) is a long-standing and challenging problem due to the fact that multi-view dataset are often incomplete in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a new IMC method by learning the consensus representation of incomplete multi-view with embedding a complete graph regularization. Specifically, we first exploit the common representation of multiple views by embedding missing-view indicator matrix into the matrix factorization operation, such that the learned new representation is well shared among all views. Then, we learn the combination relationship between similarity matrices of each view to obtain the complete similarity graph. By combining the consensus representation with the complete graph regularization, our proposed method can simultaneously learn the consensus representation and preserve the local geometric information of both the available and missing instances of multiple views. Experimental results on several widely used missing-view datasets clearly demonstrate the promising clustering performance of the proposed method in comparison with most state-of-the-art IMC methods.},

  abstract  = {In the past decade, a variety of apparel e-commerce sites have appeared. Although such sites enable users simply and easily to purchase fashion items, there frequently occur matters such that ordered items differ from what the user expected. To avoid such matters, fashion coordination sites have also been used, to which users can post photo images of their fashion coordination and appreciate the fashion photo images posted by other users. However, due to the vast amount of information posted on such sites, it is not always easy for inexperienced users to search for reference users (fashion coordinators) and photo images matching their tastes. To support such searching, we construct a prototype for a fashion chatbot that accepts a user&#39;s fashion photo image as input and outputs similar fashion photo images to the input image and account URL links of recommendable reference users (fashion coordinators). In this chatbot, we first conduct a body part segmentation to extract color features of body parts from the input fashion photo image. However, such a way does not properly consider item categories. Therefore, this chatbot also performs a fashion item segmentation to recognize item categories. Then, this chatbot searches for similar fashion photo images and recommendable reference users (fashion coordinators) based on the extracted color features of body parts and the recognized item category information. In this study, such a searching procedure for similar fashion photo images is also validated using 4,571 images posted on a fashion coordination site in Japan. Moreover, we test the chatbot with a use-case scenario.},

  abstract  = {Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques have shown great potential as a surrogate model of expensive physics simulation, with demonstrated ability to make fast predictions, albeit at the expense of accuracy in some cases. For many scientific and engineering problems involving geometrical design, it is desirable for the surrogate models to precisely describe the change in geometry and predict the consequences. In that context, we develop graph neural networks (GNNs) as fast surrogate models for physics simulation, which allow us to directly train the models on 2/3D geometry designs that are represented by an unstructured mesh or point cloud, without the need for any explicit or hand-crafted parameterization. We utilize an encoder-processor-decoder-type architecture which can flexibly make prediction at both node level and graph level. The performance of our proposed GNN-based surrogate model is demonstrated on 2 example applications: feature designs in the domain of additive engineering and airfoil design in the domain of aerodynamics. The models show good accuracy in their predictions on a separate set of test geometries after training, with almost instant prediction speeds, as compared to O(hour) for the high-fidelity simulations required otherwise.},

We propose a Monte Carlo based framework to choose the activation function in lower dimensions, mitigating the need for ensemble training in higher dimensions. To further strengthen the applicability of the Monte Carlo based framework, experiments are presented under two loss functions governed by $L^{2}$ and $L^{\infty}$ norms.

In 2D, constitutive laws for electric displacement and polarization fields are modelled for anisotropic materials without using the data for either of the two fields. Constitutive laws for bi-anisotropic media are modelled in 3D, where the electromagnetic fields are coupled. It is observed that using PDEs as a guiding constraint regularizes the learning procedure efficiently for training the neural network when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. Furthermore, the presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art Gaussian process regression and data-driven deep neural network in the presence of sparse indirect noisy measurement data.

However, the most disadvantage of PINNs is that one neural network corresponds to one PDE. In practice, we usually need to solve a class of PDEs, not just one. With the explosive growth of deep learning, many useful techniques in general deep learning tasks are also suitable for PINNs. Transfer learning methods may reduce the cost for PINNs in solving a class of PDEs. In this paper, we proposed a transfer learning method of PINNs via keeping singular vectors and optimizing singular values (namely SVD-PINNs). Numerical experiments on high dimensional PDEs (10-d linear parabolic equations and l0-d Allen-Cahn equations) show that SVD-PINNs work for solving a class of PDEs with different but close right-hand-side functions.},

  abstract  = {Probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) has been proposed to represent textual documents as mixture proportions of latent topics. Compared to the standard latent semantic indexing (LSI), PLSI has a solid statistical foundation. However, the need of folding new documents into the latent topic space led to the definition of PLSI folding-in. Previous studies have shown that in case of short queries, poor vocabulary results in small sample of words with non-zero frequencies. Therefore, PLSI folding-in tends to produce topic mixtures that are predominated by a single latent aspect. As a result, folding-in is unable to take into consideration different mapping. Thus, Bayesian folding-in was introduced to involve the topic mixtures of the known document and the mixture proportions of topics for a new document were estimated by maximizing the posterior. Hence, the prior was defined as a kernel density estimate using a Dirichlet distribution. Although Bayesian folding-in overcomes PLSI folding-in, there are still some drawbacks since the Dirichlet distribution has negative covariance structure that makes it restrictive, especially in the case of count data. To improve previous works, we propose using generalized Dirichlet (GD) distribution and Beta-Liouville (BL) distribution as kernel densities in a Bayesian framework for information retrieval.},

  abstract  = {Financial options are traded by various market participants, including market makers, hedgers, and speculators. An implied volatility surface is used to price options contracts across different views at maturity and strike price, capturing a comprehensive investor view of future financial market trends. A problem often encountered with sparsely traded instruments such as options on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange All-share index (ALSI) is the lack of volatility surface data available to market participants. We propose an entirely data-driven framework to generate synthetic volatility surfaces using generative adversarial networks (GANs). We use the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution generated by the GAN, using a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) as a benchmark, and the true distribution from the historical dataset as our performance metric. We note that the vanilla GAN outperforms the VAE. We further observe an improvement from incorporating static arbitrage conditions while training GANs since the framework cannot directly learn the static arbitrage condition. The generated distribution of synthetic ALSI volatility surfaces is true to the historical data. Arbitrage-free artificial surfaces produced can be used in stress testing to complement regulatory requirements in financial institutions and in realistic market simulations in alpha models to develop quantitative investment strategies. They can also be used by insurance for the valuation or pricing of exotic or embedded options. We illustrate our framework and show results using ALSI index option market data.},

In this paper we propose a new topological unsupervised learning approach for high dimensional text data streams. The proposed method simultaneously learns the representation of the stream and cluster the data in a smaller dimension space. The evaluation of the proposed OTTC (Online Topological Text Clustering) approach and the comparison with the state of art methods is done by using the framework MOA (Massive Online Analysis), an open-source benchmarking software for evolving data streams. The proposed approach outperforms the classical methods and the obtained results are very promising for clustering high dimensional text data streams.},

A critical challenge encountered is that of limited availability of ground truth information (e.g., labels in classification tasks) as new data are observed one-by-one online, while another significant challenge is that of class imbalance. This work introduces the novel Augmented Queues method, which addresses the dual-problem by combining in a synergistic manner online active learning, data augmentation, and a multi-queue memory to maintain separate and balanced queues for each class. We perform an extensive experimental study using image and time-series augmentations, in which we examine the roles of the active learning budget, memory size, imbalance level, and neural network type. We demonstrate two major advantages of Augmented Queues. First, it does not reserve additional memory space as the generation of synthetic data occurs only at training times. Second, learning models have access to more labelled data without the need to increase the active learning budget and / or the original memory size. Learning on-the-fly poses major challenges which, typically, hinder the deployment of learning models. Augmented Queues significantly improves the performance in terms of learning quality and speed.

To compare SRSOO-WFCM with the traditional Online Fuzzy c-Means (OFCM) algorithm, we made a scalable version of OFCM named SOFCM. The proposed SRSOO-WFCM and SOFCM are incremental algorithms that involve making one sequential run through the data subsets. We employ both loadable and very large datasets to perform extensive experiments that facilitate comparing the proposed SRSOO-WFCM and SOFCM algorithms.

Among the techniques used for dealing with imbalanced data sets, data augmentation (DA) constitutes an alternative, as it can improve the accuracy of prediction for the minority class (usually the relevant one), but usually at the cost of a loss regarding predictions of the majority one. To benefit from both behaviours, we introduce in this study a meta-classifier scheme that works as a mixture of two classifiers, one trained with the original data and the second one trained using augmented data. The experiments carried out with 12 imbalanced data sets, 5 of them obtained from the TCGA database related to cancer survival prediction, show an improvement in accuracy, area under the ROC curve and Matthews correlation coefficient values compared to the results obtained using the original data sets.},

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a data mining technique that splits data matrices by imposing restrictions on the elements&#39; non-negativity into two matrices: one representing the data partitions and the other to represent the cluster prototypes of the data set. This method has attracted a lot of attention and is used in a wide range of applications, including text mining, clustering, language modeling, music transcription, and neuroscience (gene separation). The interpretation of the generated matrices is made simpler by the absence of negative values. In this article, we propose a study on multi-modal clustering algorithms and present a novel method called multi-modal multi-view non-negative matrix factorization, in which we analyze the collaboration of several local NMF models.

However, with the integration of a large number of distributed generations (DGs), the uncertainty of the system increases, and the economy and safety cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling model of energy storage systems (ESSs) considering the two-layer interaction of distribution networks. The model can provide the system with a day-ahead scheduling scheme and ensure that the system operates within the safety limit at the same time. In addition, the model also considers the outlet power limits of the lower-layer substations, so as to avoid the risk of over limit caused by scheduling. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model, a modified actual distribution network feeder in Zhejiang Province, China is used as a test system. After testing, the model can effectively improve the economy and security of system operation.},

This paper advocates the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for time series energy consumption forecasting based on realistic smart meter data. The proposed approach is validated using the open-source, public smart meters data in the United Kingdom under extensive case studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach based on LSTM achieves high accuracy in predicting energy consumption due to the capability of modeling long temporal sequences.

Since household consumption generally constitutes a significant percentage of overall energy usage, managing residential energy consumption is thus vital for achieving better system-wide efficiency. Dynamic pricing programs have emerged as an effective DSM tool in influencing consumers&#39; behavior regarding their energy consumption and relieving the power grid from maximum demand while maintaining its operational integrity. This paper focuses on managing residential peak load demand in Singapore and maximizing renewable energy use. To this end, a Generic Algorithm (GA)-based algorithm is proposed to shift household loads away from peak periods by providing monetary incentives to consumers while reducing daily electricity bills.

However, the independent construction of energy storage equipment will bring high investment costs to WPGs. The sharing of energy storage resources among different types of WPGs provides a new solution to the problem. Therefore, a robust-based market bidding model for the alliance of WPGs considering shared energy storage (SES) is developed to mitigate the energy deviation and improve the expected profit of the alliance through the sharing of energy storage resources between WPGs. Then, the profit allocation approach based on the improved Shapley value (ISV) method considering multiple factors is proposed to allocate the cooperation profit. Simulations illustrate that WPGs can improve their profits by cooperating as an alliance and participating in the energy market through the bidding strategy. In addition, the proposed profit allocation method can allocate each participant with reasonable shares and reflect their real bargaining powers in the cooperation.},

  abstract  = {Renewable power generation is beneficial to handle the global energy shortage problem. However, the intermittent generation output is still the major drawback of renewable energy sources, such as solar energy. Forecasting technology can efficiently deal with these stochastic energy sources, and numerous studies have developed state-of-the-art forecasting models in order to increase the prediction accuracy. Among those, satellite-derived models perform well in short- term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, since they can capture the local cloud motion by using historical satellite images. Nevertheless, the explainability of these novel models decreases as the price of accuracy improvements, especially for those intelligent black-box forecast models. The limited geographical resolution of satellite measurements may also lead to the miss or over-forecast of a solar power ramp, causing higher economic loss and model distrust. It is necessary to understand how the models obtain the forecast results, whereas this problem still attracts little attention nowadays. As a result, this study develops a novel model structure focusing on satellite- derived PV power forecasting. The model can measure the effects of different cloud motion displacement by involving various input combinations. The results denote that the proposed method can improve the model explainability while retaining the accuracy level.},

To overcome these vulnerabilities, countermeasures to DoS attacks needs to be developed. One such countermeasure is the development and deployment of a virtual synchrophasor network (VSN) to improve the reliability of a synchrophasor network to DoS attacks. A cellular computational networks (CCN) is a distributed artificial intelligence framework suitable for complex system modeling and estimation. CCNs have been proved to mitigate the effects of DoS attacks on single PMUs successfully.

Previous works on defenses against adversarial evasion attacks typically involve pre-processing input data at training or testing time, or modifications to the objective function optimized during the training. In contrast, relatively fewer defense methods focus on modifying the topology and functionality of the underlying defended neural network. Additionally, prior theoretical examinations of the geometry of adversarial examples reveal a challenging and intrinsic trade-off between adversarial and benign accuracy. We introduce a novel modification to a traditional feed-forward convolutional neural network that embeds uncertainty within the network&#39;s hidden representations in a learned and data-dependent manner. Our proposed alteration renders the network significantly more resilient than comparably computationally expensive alternatives. Further, the empirical investigation of the proposed defense demonstrates that, unlike prior defense techniques that are comparable to state-of-the-art, the stochastic resonance effect improves adversarial accuracy without significant degradation in benign accuracy.},

Although convolutions offer efficiency by restricting their operations to local interactions, it is at the cost of potentially missing out on the detection of long-range dependencies. Recent studies address this problem by employing additional recurrent or attention layers that increase computational complexity. In this work, we propose Axial-LOB, a novel fully-attentional deep learning architecture for predicting price movements of stocks from LOB data. By utilizing gated position-sensitive axial attention layers our architecture is able to construct feature maps that incorporate global interactions, while significantly reducing the size of the parameter space. Unlike previous works, Axial-LOB does not rely on hand-crafted convolutional kernels and hence has stable performance under input permutations and the capacity to incorporate additional LOB features. The effectiveness of Axial-LOB is demonstrated on a large benchmark dataset, containing time series representations of millions of high-frequency trading events, where our model establishes a new state of the art, achieving an excellent directional classification performance at all tested prediction horizons.},

Aesthetic sensibility, the ability to comprehend the visual appeal of any object, plays a significant role in guiding the cognitive process of a scientific creation. The present study attempts to detect creative individuals in scientific field by analyzing their aesthetic quality judgment using Electroencephalographic (EEG) system. The major aim of the current study is accomplished by first acquiring brain signals from the subjects who were instructed to mentally assess the beauty of the presented stimuli. The acquired signals are pre-processed and transferred to a dual feature extraction module that abstracts spectrogram and brain connectivity based features as a strategy to enhance the diversity of the feature set. Brain connectivity pattern analysis confirms the active involvement of the right dorsolateral prefrontal and left pars orbitalis brain regions when the presented stimuli have been considered as beautiful. Moreover, spectrogram features reveal the activation of theta and alpha frequency bands for the present cognitive task. The dual features abstracted are fed to a novel classifier module referred as Dual Convolution Induced Capsule Network (DC-CapsNet) that categorizes the subjective creative ability from aesthetic sensibility into two classes: high and low. The novelty in the design of the proposed classifier consists of a dual convolution layer working in parallel to handle two types of features, the introduction of a new cross attention mechanism that highlights the relevant portions of the dual features and the addition of a Mish function based dynamic routing algorithm to enhance the prediction capacity of the capsule network. Comparative study performed with baseline models reveals the superior performance of the DC-CapsNet model.},

  abstract  = {Image inpainting tasks have attracted much attention in computer vision. Many existing methods propose to generate the corrupted images by employing generative adversarial networks (GAN) to sample from the data distribution conditioned on the observed regions. However, due to the slowly growing receptive field of the convolutional layers in GAN, it is difficult for these GAN-based methods to effectively model long-range interactions, which is critical for inpainting. Besides, existing approaches generally introduce joint losses to render visually realistic results, while the weights for different losses are fixed during training and may not adapt to the dynamical learning process. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel conditional inpainting generative flow (CIFlow). CIFlow is a flow-based conditional generative method with pixel-wise permutations and channel-wise permutations performed before traditional convolutional layers to effectively model long-range interactions. Moreover, the weights for the joint losses in CIFlow are dynamically adjusted based on the current learning state to provide gradients of the same scale for different losses. Experiments are conducted on real-world datasets and the results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Oriented object detection has attracted extensive attention due to its wide range of applications. Most oriented detectors predefine multi-scale anchors on feature pyramids to cover objects of various sizes, and assign labels for all anchors to train the detectors. Recent advanced label assignment strategies take the quality of anchors&#39; predictions as the indicator to assign positive/negative samples across all pyramid levels. However, since the model is not sufficiently optimized in early training stages, the predictions might be unreliable, which might make the positive samples arbitrarily selected from various pyramid levels, further reducing the detection performance. To mitigate the interference of unreliable predictions, this paper proposes a Level-wise Dynamic Label Assignment (LDLA) algorithm, which decouples the selection of pyramid levels from unreliable predictions and selects positive/negative samples level by level. Concretely, LDLA first estimates the number of positive samples on each pyramid level based on the statistics of anchors instead of the predictions. Afterwards, LDLA defines score functions to measure the quality of anchors, and selects anchors with higher scores from each level as positive samples. Extensive experiments conducted on DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LDLA.},

We compare the results of experiments on the proposed method to the models with fully-connect neural network and Convolutional Neural Network, respectively. The experiment results show that methods and mechanism proposed by this research have a significant improvement in the accuracy of predicting the reflection angle, and the model convergence speed is also faster.

Quality-diversity evolutionary approaches optimise for novelty as well as performance, and can be used to generate a repertoire of diverse designs. This design repertoire could be used as a tool to guide a designer and kick-start the rapid prototyping process. This paper explores this idea in the context of mechanical linkage based robots. These robots can be a good test-bed for rapid prototyping, as they can be modified quickly for swift iterations in design. We compare three evolutionary algorithms for optimising 2D mechanical linkages: 1) a standard evolutionary algorithm, 2) the multi-objective algorithm NSGA-II, and 3) the quality-diversity algorithm MAP-Elites. Some of the found linkages are then realized on a physical hexapod robot through a prototyping process, and tested on two different floors. We find that all the tested approaches, except the standard evolutionary algorithm, are capable of finding mechanical linkages that creates a path similar to a specified desired path. However, the quality-diversity approaches that had the length of the linkage as a behaviour descriptor were the most useful when prototyping. This was due to the quality-diversity approaches having a larger variety of similar designs to choose from, and because the search could be constrained by the behaviour descriptors to make linkages that were viable for construction on our hexapod platform.},

This work introduces a novel implementation of the SO model that scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$ with respect to the number of nodes N, and demonstrates the applicability of the SO model to networks with system sizes several orders of magnitude higher than previously was investigated.

  abstract  = {We introduce organism networks, which function like a single neural network but are composed of several neural particle networks; while each particle network fulfils the role of a single weight application within the organism network, it is also trained to self-replicate its own weights. As organism networks feature vastly more parameters than simpler architectures, we perform our initial experiments on an arithmetic task as well as on simplified MNIST-dataset classification as a collective. We observe that individual particle networks tend to specialise in either of the tasks and that the ones fully specialised in the secondary task may be dropped from the network without hindering the computational accuracy of the primary task. This leads to the discovery of a novel pruning-strategy for sparse neural networks.},

  abstract  = {The NK model is designed to study evolutionary adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes. The factor $K$ determines the number of interacting genes, their degree of pleiotropy and epistasis, and consequently the ruggedness of the fitness landscape. However, in natural organisms, the degree of epistatic interactions and the number of functions a gene can have are to a certain degree determining the ruggedness of the landscape. Still, pleiotropy and epistasis can evolve independently from each other, and are to some degree independent of the ruggedness of the landscape. Here, we propose an extension to the standard NK model to investigate these factors independently of each other. Over the course of evolution the computational model organisms can now change how their genes interact and how they control phenotypic traits. Further, the degree of epistasis and pleiotropy is affected by the ruggedness of the landscape and becomes reduced with increasing ruggedness. While this proves that the extension of the model performs as expected, the adaptations are minor, presumably because only relatively short periods of adaptations with few mutations can be studied.},

  abstract  = {The continuous emergence of novelty is key to the creation of open-endedness. The phenomenon of the waves of popularity of novelties which generates novelties, and leads to their attracting attention and evolving, has been observed in groups of people. The exploration of this mechanism can provide clues to understanding the nature of open-ended evolution. It has been demonstrated that the behavior of people within this context can be successfully captured by an agent-based model that incorporates the adjacent possible space. In this study, we propose an extended model on this basis to create waves of novelty. The proposed model introduces a bias in that it increases the selection probability of agents who interact with influential agents. The introduction of this bias leads to the novelty gaining attention over preferential attachment. The proposed model fits better to real data than existing models, and captures the dynamics and structure of real social networks more effectively. The construction of speciations and niches is necessary for natural biological species to evolve. Similarly, the results of this study suggest that the provision of an advantageous structure in a particular local environment is important for the growth of novelty.},

  abstract  = {When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers play important roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method to co-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the hyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one responsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the control of the robot. The key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it does not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate processes. Similar to nature, our method derives both the “brain” and the “body” of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our approach is more realistic and doesn&#39;t require an arbitrary separation of processes during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the search space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the genome affects “brain” and the “body” at the same time. Additionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very different bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots with different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they won&#39;t crossover with other robots that are too different from them. We evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the search space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process converge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control. The agents in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of regularity and controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the necessary movements.},

Lately, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been shown to be effective in learning dispatching rules for disjunctive scheduling problems. However, research on cumulative problems such as RCPSP is rather sparse. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end DRL method to train high-quality priority rules for RCPSP. Based on its graph structure, we leverage Graph Neural Network to effectively capture the complex features for the internal scheduling states. Experiments show that by training on small instances, our method can learn scheduling policy that performs well on a wide range of problem scales, which outperforms traditional manual priority rules and state-of-the-art genetic programming based hyper-heuristics.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS) is an important combinatorial optimisation problem with a large number of real-world applications such as component production in manufacturing. Genetic programming (GP), as a hyper-heuristic approach, has been widely used to learn scheduling heuristics for DFJSS. Brood recombination has been shown its effectiveness to improve the performance of GP by generating more offspring and preselecting only promising individuals into the next generation. However, evaluating more individuals requires more computational cost. Phenotype based surrogate models have been successfully used with GP to speed up the evaluation in single-objective dynamic job shop scheduling. However, its effectiveness on multi-objective dynamic job shop scheduling is unknown. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted multi-objective GP based on the phenotype of GP individuals for DFJSS. Specifically, we first use phenotypic vector to represent the behaviour of GP individuals in DFJSS. Second, K-nearest neighbour based surrogates are built according to the phenotypic characterisations and multiple fitness values of the evaluated individuals. Last, the built surrogate models are used to predict the fitness of newly generated offspring in GP with brood recombination. The results show that with the same training time, the proposed algorithm can achieve significantly better scheduling heuristics than the compared algorithm. The analyses of population diversity, feature importance, and the number of non-dominated individuals have also shown the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in different aspects.},

Designing these models is often a difficult and expensive process requiring multiple meetings between the expert and clients, in order to understand the modeling requirements. The mathematical model will also typically require further refinements during operation, which will again require the involvement of the expert human modeller. To support this modelling process, we propose an active model learning framework, which uses standard machine learning methods to update the mathematical model. The framework is used to refine a mathematical model by observing corrections made by the client to a proposed schedule generated by the model. The approach is tested on a real-world student nurse allocation problem with multiple complex objectives or soft conditions. Since there is a danger in eliminating solutions when learning hard constraints, we consider all learned constraints as soft and part of the objective function. Our approach is able to learn rapidly client requirements, from minor corrections to the schedules made by the client, which highlights the promise of the approach.},

These robots, deployed from four depots at the four corners of the bridge, must traverse every member of the bridge truss while minimizing distance traveled and balancing tours among robots. This problem maps to the well known NP-Hard Min-Max Multi-Depot k (robot) Chinese Postman Problem. We constructed 20 benchmark bridge instances of four different types of truss configurations using realistic dimensions as a testbed for comparison. Compared to the best known direct encoded genetic algorithm approach, our metaheuristic genetic algorithm produces routes that are on average 25\% better quality, and does so 22 $x$ faster. On the four depot version of the problem, the MetaGA on average performs 42\% better. These results on our benchmarks show evidence our metaheuristic genetic algorithm provides high-quality tours in realistic time for real-world robot bridge inspection scenarios and has the potential to generalize to vehicle routing and the broader class of arc-routing problems.},

  abstract  = {Reaction-diffusion (Turing) systems are fundamental to the formation of spatial patterns in nature and engineering. These systems are governed by a set of non-linear partial differential equations containing parameters that determine the rate of constituent diffusion and reaction. Critically, these parameters, such as diffusion coefficient, heavily influence the mode and type of the final pattern, and quantitative characterization and knowledge of these parameters can aid in bio-mimetic design or understanding of real-world systems. However, the use of numerical methods to infer these parameters can be difficult and computationally expensive. Typically, adjoint solvers may be used, but they are frequently unstable for very non-linear systems. Alternatively, massive amounts of iterative forward simulations are used to find the best match, but this is extremely effortful. Recently, physics-informed neural networks have been proposed as a means for data-driven discovery of partial differential equations, and have seen success in various applications. Thus, we investigate the use of physics-informed neural networks as a tool to infer key parameters in reaction─diffusion systems in the steady-state for scientific discovery or design. Our proof-of-concept results show that the method is able to infer parameters for different pattern modes and types with errors of less than 10\%. In addition, the stochastic nature of this method can be exploited to provide multiple parameter alternatives to the desired pattern, highlighting the versatility of this method for bio-mimetic design. This work thus demonstrates the utility of physics-informed neural networks for inverse parameter inference of reaction-diffusion systems to enhance scientific discovery and design.},

Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are designed to learn the solutions of differential equations (DE) of arbitrary orders; in PINNs the loss functions are obtained as the residues of the conservative form of the DEs and represent the degree of dissatisfaction of the equations. So there has been an open question whether (a) PINNs also exhibit SB and (b) if so, how does this bias vary across the orders of the DEs. In this work, a series of numerical experiments are conducted on simple sinusoidal functions of varying frequencies, compositions and equation orders to investigate these issues. It is firmly established that under normalized conditions, PINNs do exhibit strong spectral bias, and this increases with the order of the differential equation.},

  abstract  = {PDE-constrained optimization is an exceedingly difficult task due to the curse of dimensionality. This is particularly true in aerodynamics optimization as remeshing or deformation of existing meshes is often required. In this paper, we aim to overcome this challenge by proposing a simulation-based optimization framework that can handle various optimization problems efficiently. The proposed approach is able to simultaneous make predictions and perform optimizations. Specifically, the framework consists of a surrogate model to generate high-fidelity solutions and a gradient-based algorithm to address high-dimensional optimization problems. The starting point is to use physics-informed neural network (PINN) to construct surrogate models that output flow fields for airfoils of varied configurations. In this sense, PINN is computationally cheap as no labelled training data from a separate high-fidelity simulation is required. Thus, a trained surrogate model can efficiently generate flow fields for any intermediate optimization scenarios. More importantly, we design the architecture of surrogate models and include design variables as inputs to PINN. This mechanism enables neural network to extract geometric features of various input computational domains. A trained surrogate model can represent solutions on unseen design cases from both seen and unseen categories. In the optimization process, a quasi-Newton algorithm is used and further accelerated by automatic differentiation, a popular algorithm designed to efficiently compute the gradients of objective functions with respect to design parameters. An optimization examples aiming to achieve the maximal lift-to-drag ratio has been presented. The example is a single parameter optimization problem focusing on finding the optimal angle of attack. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and computationally efficient, providing a promising alternative for computationally intensive optimization problems.},

  abstract  = {One of the major tasks in natural language processing is to categorize texts into different categories. Topic models are an important set of tools for categorizing texts and so are mixture models since both models learn patterns from data in an unsupervised manner. The introduction of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) triggered a lot of research in this domain. Recent research investigates the use of distributions other than Dirichlet for the topic proportions in LDA especially generalized Dirichlet and Beta-Liouville distributions in addition to adding useful attributes specific to the task at hand. Improving the quality of topics extracted from these models is important for accurate inference and unsupervised language tasks. Owing to this cause, in this paper, we propose interactive Beta-Liouville mixture allocation (iBLMA) model which combines the clustering capabilities of mixture models with interactive learning which helps the user modify the topic weights of irrelevant words within the topic. We show the efficiency of our model with experiments on two different text datasets.},

However, its application on real-world problems has been less explored due to the large sizes of the resulting expressions, which are prone to over-fitting and are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a method that incorporates customization for real-world data sets based on a combination of two operators of GP. The first operator utilizes the concept of Semantic Backpropagation, a noteworthy method in SGP, to create short expressions which are highly correlated with the outputs. The second operator makes use of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to combine short expressions into the overall expression with good accuracy. The proposed approach is tested on one synthetic data set and two practical applications which are challenging for conventional GP. The experimental results are very promising, with further scope of improvement.},

In this standalone paper we take a look at the algorithms for Kernel Minimum Enclosing Balls and examine their scalability. To that end, we firstly present a detailed investigation of the recently existing scalable methods to compute the kernel minimum enclosing balls. Those methods feature sub-matrices, coresets and density-based sampling approaches. The strength of those methods lies in their simplicity and theoretically proven approximation of the decision boundaries. Secondly, we bring additional value to the scalability of KMEBs by introducing a principle of uniting decision boundaries obtained from multiple kernel balls. This principle can be described as sampling batches of data, performing independent training on those batches and using models fitted to the batches to create the ensemble approach. We present two simple and efficient algorithms that rely on the above-described principle: randomized sampling speedup and characteristic function based partition. We show that former speedup is highly efficient, and we assume that the reason for it lies in KMEBs&#39; outstanding abilities in few-shot learning. Additionally, we compare two introduced algorithms against recent methods from literature mentioned above. We perform the comparison of novelty detection scores on the example of two popular image datasets.},

  abstract  = {DNA Sequencing of microbial communities from en-vironmental samples generates large volumes of data, which can be analyzed using various bioinformatics pipelines. Unsupervised clustering algorithms are usually an early and critical step in an analysis pipeline, since much of such data are unlabeled, unstructured, or novel. However, curated reference databases that provide taxonomic label information are also increasing and growing, which can help in the classification of sequences, and not just clustering. In this contribution, we report on our progress in developing a semi-supervised approach for genomic clustering algorithms, such as U/VSEARCH. The primary contribution of this approach is the ability to recognize previously seen or unseen novel sequences using an incremental approach: for sequences whose examples were previously seen by the algorithm, the algorithm can predict a correct label. For previously unseen novel sequences, the algorithm assigns a temporary label and then updates that label with a permanent one if/when such a label is established in a future reference database. The incremental learning aspect of the proposed approach provides the additional benefit and capability to process the data continuously as new datasets become available. This functionality is notable as most sequence data processing platforms are static in nature, designed to run on a single batch of data, whose only other remedy to process additional data is to combine the new and old data and rerun the entire analysis. We report our promising preliminary results on an extended 16S rRNA database.},

In this paper, a vanilla Long Short-Term Memory model is implemented using different activation functions, including ReLU, ELU, Leaky-ReLU, SELU, and GELU, in the dense layer to forecast short-term solar irradiance. Activation functions introduce the non-linearity and learn the relationship between the input and output values.

Although a majority of GNN architectures are designed in a way that is sustainable to node feature attack, they still suffer from performance degradation under the presence of extreme outlier noise in node features. This is because most strategies dealing with noise rely on the Gaussian noise assumption where an intrinsic Euclidean norm regularization is added to the objective. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN module that is more robust to extreme noise with a Laplace noise assumption. Our proposed module can be used alongside with any existing GNN model to improve the robustness. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the new module in enhancing the performance for various GNN models including GCN, GAT, APPNP under the case of extreme noise, and show great robustness under various types of noise added into the datasets.},

To alleviate this issue, Bag of Features (BoF) pooling has been recently proposed. BoF learns a dictionary, that is used to compile a histogram representation of the input. In this paper, we propose an approach that builds on top of BoF pooling to boost its efficiency by ensuring that the items of the learned dictionary are non-redundant. We propose an additional loss term, based on the pair-wise correlation of the items of the dictionary, which complements the standard loss to explicitly regularize the model to learn a more diverse and rich dictionary. The proposed strategy yields an efficient variant of BoF and further boosts its performance, without any additional parameters.},

However, its depthwise convolution only performs on the spatial domain while neglecting to consider other domains such as the one formed by the channel and width/height dimensions. This paper specifically bridges the gaps by proposing the generalwise separable convolution to generalize the depthwise separable convolution beyond the spatial domain to recruit the widthwise and heightwise convolutions. A sequential combination of pointwise group convolution, channel shuffling, channel splitting, and dimension transposing is required to implement the generalwise separable convolution. By embedding the generalwise separable convolution into a stack of inverted residuals with linear bottlenecks, we propose GSCNet as a lightweight neural backbone for various embedded vision tasks. Our empirical evidence indicates that the generalwise separable convolution is superior to the depthwise separable convolution by feature extraction from domains complementing the spatial domain. Experimental results show that GSCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art mobile CNNs over multiply vision tasks. On ImageNet object classification benchmark, GSCNet achieves 75.5\% top-1 accuracy with 216.98M multiply-adds, which is 28.1\% fewer than that of MobileNetv2 and 29.3\% fewer than that of HBONet.

  abstract  = {When designing interactive human-machine sys-tems, it is often assumed that it is desirable for such systems to behave cooperatively towards a human operator in order to improve trust, acceptance, and usability, but also to increase task efficiency. To design cooperative human-machine interaction (HMI) systems, we have to be able to define and quantitatively describe cooperative behavior, for example, to control, optimize, or evaluate the interaction. Despite the increased interest in cooperative HMI in recent years, an approach that provides a suitable definition of cooperation and also a method for its quantification is still missing. In the present work, we therefore develop a novel definition of cooperative behavior in HMI contexts, based on which we propose to quantify cooperation using recent methods from information theory. We define cooperation as joint, coordinated actions that are mutually adapted such as to facilitate the realization of a goal. Thus, cooperation is characterized by a synergistic effect of joint actions towards the goal. Here, we propose to quantify cooperation using the recently introduced partial information decomposition framework from information theory, which proposes measures to quantify the synergistic contributions of two inputs to a target variable. In particular, we propose to apply the synergy measure to two or more input variables describing agents&#39; actions towards a target variable that describes the current goal state. As a first validation, we applied our approach in a grid-world environment, in which two agents solve a cooperative foraging task. We found that synergy was higher for agents implementing cooperative strategies compared to baseline and non-cooperative strategies, and we found higher synergy in trials with high numbers of cooperative actions. We conclude that the synergy is a promising candidate measure for identifying cooperative behavior in goal-oriented interactions.},

  abstract  = {We propose an autonomous agent with a notion of self, aiming to naturally avoid irreparable failures of its own body, even in environments where uncertainty is not prede-signed. The self is not limited to the agent&#39;s own body; instead, the boundary between the self and others changes through recognition by the agent. In this study, the self and others are defined in terms of controllability and predictability, which are important factors of uncertainty. These definitions allow the self to be extended, which enables the self to include not only the agent&#39;s own body but also objects in the environment. The region of self that the agent recognizes is represented as a self-recognition block, which serves to quantify controllability and predictability. By making the self-recognition block a virtual observable within the agent&#39;s recognition, we enable the agent to explicitly handle controllability and predictability, which are initially hidden. We evaluated the proposed autonomous agent in a task of grasping and storing a target object whose controllability and predictability were unknown before being grasped by a robot. The results showed that the storage trajectory drifted 3.5 cm farther away from the storage box as a phenomenon corresponding to the proprioceptive drift in the rubber hand illusion. Furthermore, the target object was successfully stored without hazardous collisions between the grasped object and the storage box that could lead to the robot&#39;s irreparable failure, confirming the potential of the proposed agent to handle uncertain environments.},

How-ever, DNN&#39;s are vulnerable to human-imperceptible adversarial distortion/noise patterns that can detrimentally impact safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust-by-design deep learning approach, Sim-DNN, that is able to detect adversarial attacks through its inner defense mechanism that considers the degree of similarity between new data samples and autonomously chosen prototypes. The approach benefits from the abrupt drop of the similarity score to detect concept changes caused by distorted/noise data when comparing their similarities against the set of prototypes. Due to the feed-forward prototype-based architecture of Sim-DNN, no re-training or adversarial training is required. In order to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, we considered the recently introduced ImageNet-R dataset and different adversarial attack methods such as FGSM, PGD, and DDN. Different DNN&#39;s methods were also considered in the analysis. Results have shown that the proposed Sim-DNN is able to detect adversarial attacks with better performance than its mainstream competitors. Moreover, as no adversarial training is required by Sim-DNN, its performance on clean and robust images is more stable than its competitors which require an external defense mechanism to improve their robustness.},

  abstract  = {In real-world applications, the process generating the data might suffer from nonstationary effects (e.g., due to seasonality, faults affecting sensors or actuators, and changes in the users&#39; behaviour). These changes, often called concept drift, might induce severe (potentially catastrophic) impacts on trained learning models that become obsolete over time, and inadequate to solve the task at hand. Learning in presence of concept drift aims at designing machine and deep learning models that are able to track and adapt to concept drift. Typically, techniques to handle concept drift are either active or passive, and traditionally, these have been considered to be mutually exclusive. Active techniques use an explicit drift detection mechanism, and re-train the learning algorithm when concept drift is detected. Passive techniques use an implicit method to deal with drift, and continually update the model using incremental learning. Differently from what present in the literature, we propose a hybrid alternative which merges the two approaches, hence, leveraging on their advantages. The proposed method called Hybrid-Adaptive REBAlancing (HAREBA) significantly outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods in terms of learning quality and speed; we experiment how it is effective under severe class imbalance levels too.},

  abstract  = {The No Free Lunch (NFL) Theorem states there are no universally “best” optimization algorithms, including evolutionary dynamic multi-objective optimization (EDMO) algorithms. Due to the lack of a universal optimizer at the theoretical level, the performance of EDMO algorithms rely heavily on experimental comparison of the specific problem. The evaluation of EDMO algorithms require care in designing representative test cases of the problem class, and comprehensive metrics incorporating convergence, diversity and dynamics at the same time. The literature review in EDMO reveals challenges in designing algorithms, developing efficient metrics and producing suitable test cases. In this paper, we focus on addressing the literature gap in developing more robust approaches to evaluating EDMO algorithms that have varying performance on different real-world DMOP problems. We propose a new metric to measure the worst-case performance of convergence, diversity and dynamics. We further extend this to formulate a three-layer generalized evaluation framework and two generalized metrics. Finally, we perform a case study on a transportation application with dynamic traffic changes, to evaluate our new proposed metrics and framework. Our experiments show that the proposed framework offers comprehensive evaluation and a better understanding of the compared algorithms&#39; relative strengths at different levels.},

  abstract  = {By energy usage decomposition, this paper refers to the decomposition of energy use time series data into its major load classes. Specifically, a novel unsupervised learning algorithm is proposed to classify energy usage in a residential unit into fixed loads and one or more classes of shiftable loads. Unlike traditional disaggregation, the algorithm does not require any prior information about the load consumption patterns of individual appliances in the home, thereby fully preserving the home&#39;s privacy. Shiftable loads are characterized by ON/OFF duty cycles. The proposed algorithm is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), where fixed loads are represented in terms of real-valued basis vectors, whereas shiftable loads are divided into binary signals. This binary decomposition approach directly applies $L_{0}$ -norm constraints on individual shiftable loads. The new approach obviates the need for more computationally intensive methods (e.g. spectral decomposition or mean-field annealing) that have been used in earlier research for these constraints. A probabilistic framework for the proposed approach has been outlined.},

An original environment decomposition method is proposed, which is inspired by wave propagation in physics. The working environment is divided into arcs with the same center. Then, an Adaptive Tri-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (denoted, ATOPSO) that combines the advantages between the multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization and the Differential Evolution, is also introduced to solve the multi-objective problem above. The performance of the proposed decomposition method and the path planning algorithm ATOPSO is compared to existing methods and experimented with various scenarios and data.

Among this research, there has been little research on monitoring that takes advantage of the features of 5G communications. To realize such ultra-real-time monitoring, it is necessary that predict and respond to the movement of the measurement target without large-scale computer simulations. Therefore, we focused on Event-based cameras. Unlike conventional cameras, event-based cameras are inspired by living organisms in which each pixel outputs luminance changes asynchronously and have excellent features such as high time resolution, high dynamic range, low latency, and low power consumption. These features have attracted attention in the fields of robot vision and computer vision, and the system is a compatible solution to realize such monitoring. We have also used topological mapping techniques to deal with various problems, and we are convinced that such an approach will also be effective for Event-based cameras. However, a lot of noise must be dealt with when trying to learn topological structures using Growing Neural Gas (GNG). However, Event-based cameras are, in principle, completely different from conventional cameras and require a novel methodology. Eventbased cameras work well with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) because of their principle. Therefore, to realize ultra-real-time monitoring, this paper proposes a model to obtain the topological structure of an Event-based camera with noise reduction by using SNN and GNG.},

However, the application of ESNs to continuous gesture recognition has not been fully explored as only the leaky integrator ESN has been used without hyperparameter optimization. In this study, we attempt to improve the ESN performance on the continuous gesture recognition task by experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameter tuning. The performance of ESN models is significantly enhanced in terms of $F_{1}$ -score to 0.88, which is higher than the previously best performance of 0.87 using an LSTM model on continuous gesture recognition. The significant improvement is in training time, which is approximately 13 seconds for the ESN model compared to 89 seconds for the LSTM model in past research.},

As opposed to the standard GNG algorithm, FastGNG uses a multi-scale batch learning strategy to enhance the learning speed.

  abstract  = {Genetic algorithms are heuristic optimization techniques inspired by Darwinian evolution. Quantum computation is a new computational paradigm which exploits quantum resources to speed up information processing tasks. Therefore, it is sensible to explore the potential enhancement in the performance of genetic algorithms by introducing quantum degrees of freedom. Along this line, a modular quantum genetic algorithm has recently been proposed, with individuals encoded in independent registers comprising exchangeable quantum subroutines [1], which leads to different variants. Here, we address the numerical benchmarking of these algorithms against classical genetic algorithms, a comparison missing from previous literature. To overcome the severe limitations of simulating quantum algorithms, our approach focuses on measuring the effect of quantum resources on the performance. In order to isolate the effect of the quantum resources on the performance, we selected the classical variants to resemble the fundamental characteristics of the quantum genetic algorithms. Under these conditions, we encode an optimization problem in a two-qubit Hamiltonian and face the problem of finding its ground state. A numerical analysis based on a sample of 200 random cases shows that some quantum variants outperform all classical ones in convergence speed towards a near-optimal result. Additionally, we have considered a diagonal Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule to complete the analysis with two relevant use-cases. If this advantage holds for larger systems, quantum genetic algorithms would provide a new tool to address optimization problems with quantum computers.},

  abstract  = {Despite being considered as the next frontier in computation, Quantum Computing is still in an early stage of development. Indeed, current commercial quantum computers suffer from some critical restraints, such as noisy processes and a limited amount of qubits, among others, that affect the performance of quantum algorithms. Despite these limitations, researchers have devoted much effort to propose different frameworks for efficiently using these Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. One of these procedures is D&#39;WAVE Systems&#39; quantum-annealer, which can be used to solve optimization problems by translating them into an energy minimization problem. In this context, this work is focused on providing useful insights and information into the behaviour of the quantum-annealer when addressing real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Our main motivation with this study is to open some quantum computing frontiers to non-expert stakeholders. To this end, we perform an extensive experimentation, in the form of a parameter sensitive analysis. This experimentation has been conducted using the Traveling Salesman Problem as benchmarking problem, and adopting two QUBOs: state-of-the-art and a heuristically generated. Our analysis has been performed on a single 7-noded instance, and it is based on more than 200 different parameter configurations, comprising more than 3700 unitary runs and 7 million of quantum reads. Thanks to this study, findings related to the energy distribution and most appropriate parameter settings have been obtained. Finally, an additional study has been performed, aiming to determine the efficiency of the heuristically built QUBO in further TSP instances.},

  abstract  = {The Bin Packing Problem (BPP) stands out as a paradigmatic combinatorial optimization problem in logistics. Quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are expected to show an advantage over their classical counterparts in obtaining approximate solutions for optimization problems. We have recently proposed a hybrid approach to the one dimensional BPP in which a quantum annealing subroutine is employed to sample feasible solutions for single containers. From this reduced search space, a classical optimization subroutine can find the solution to the problem. With the aim of going a step further in the evaluation of our subroutine, in this paper we compare the performance of our procedure with other classical approaches. Concretely we test a random sampling and a random-walk-based heuristic. Employing a benchmark comprising 18 instances, we show that the quantum approach lacks the stagnation behaviour that slows down the classical algorithms. Based on this, we conclude that the quantum strategy can be employed jointly with the random walk to obtain a full sample of feasible solutions in fewer iterations. This work improves our intuition about the benefits of employing the scarce quantum resources to improve the results of a diminishingly efficient classical strategy.},

  abstract  = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a problem of interpreting sensor data to human movement using an efficient machine learning (ML) approach. The HAR systems rely on data from untrusted users, making them susceptible to data poisoning attacks. In a poisoning attack, attackers manipulate the sensor readings to contaminate the training set, misleading the HAR to produce erroneous outcomes. This paper presents the design of a label flipping data poisoning attack for a HAR system, where the label of a sensor reading is maliciously changed in the data collection phase. Due to high noise and uncertainty in the sensing environment, such an attack poses a severe threat to the recognition system. Besides, vulnerability to label flipping attacks is dangerous when activity recognition models are deployed in safety-critical applications. This paper shades light on how to carry out the attack in practice through smartphone-based sensor data collection applications. This is an earlier research work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking the HAR models via label flipping poisoning. We implement the proposed attack and test it on activity recognition models based on the following machine learning algorithms: multi-layer perceptron, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based defense mechanism against the proposed attack.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a decentralized optimal tracking control problem has been investigated for large scale multi-agent system (LS-MAS) under unstructured environment. Due to the “Curse of Dimensionality” from a large amount of agents and constraints from the unstructured environment, conventional optimal tracking control as well as emerging mean field game and machine learning based design cannot be utilized directly. To overcome those challenges, a novel barrier function has been designed to transform the unstructured environment into a structured environment so that mean field game theory can be used to formulate decentralized optimal tracking control for LS-MAS. Then, the actor-critic-mass reinforcement learning algorithm has been developed to learn the mean field game based optimal solution under structured environment. Specifically, individual agent has three neural networks (NN), i.e., 1) mass NN that learns the behaviors of large population via estimating the solution of Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation, 2) critic NN that obtains optimal cost function by learning the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, 3) actor NN that solve the decentralized optimal tracking control based on the information provided by the mass and critic NN. Next, the learned decentralized optimal tracking control can be transformed from structured environment back to unstructured environment and implemented in real-time through barrier function. Overall, this developed algorithm is named MFG-based barrier-actor-critic-mass learning. The Lyapunov theorem has been used to prove the stability of the closed-loop system. Eventually, a series of numerical simulation has been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a strong alternative to solve optimization tasks efficiently. The use of these algorithms highly depends on the feedback signals provided by the environment in charge of informing about how good (or bad) the decisions made by the learned agent are. Unfortunately, in a broad range of problems the design of a good reward function is not trivial, so in such cases sparse reward signals are instead adopted. The lack of a dense reward function poses new challenges, mostly related to exploration. Imitation Learning has addressed those problems by leveraging demonstrations from experts. In the absence of an expert (and its subsequent demonstrations), an option is to prioritize well-suited exploration experiences collected by the agent in order to bootstrap its learning process with good exploration behaviors. However, this solution highly depends on the ability of the agent to discover such trajectories in the early stages of its learning process. To tackle this issue, we propose to combine imitation learning with intrinsic motivation, two of the most widely adopted techniques to address problems with sparse reward. In this work intrinsic motivation is used to encourage the agent to explore the environment based on its curiosity, whereas imitation learning allows repeating the most promising experiences to accelerate the learning process. This combination is shown to yield an improved performance and better generalization in procedurally-generated environments, outperforming previously reported self-imitation learning methods and achieving equal or better sample efficiency with respect to intrinsic motivation in isolation.},

  abstract  = {The balance between exploration and exploitation is a protracted challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). High dimensional continuous action domains increase the time and resources required to find an optimal policy due to the intractable actions, i.e., infinitely many possible. In this paper, we transfer the existing theories on animal motivational systems to the deep RL paradigm to constitute an efficient, directed exploration strategy for off-policy actor-critic algorithms. We introduce a novel and scalable high-frequency perturbation framework that directs agents to state-action pairs with large value errors through an additive deep explorer network. By maximizing the error induced by the Q-value estimation, our method forces the approximated critic function to learn the values of less-known or unselected actions and prevents premature behavior before sufficiently learning the environment. Moreover, the presented algorithm can benefit from the off-policy setting by extracting useful information from the experiences contained in the experience replay buffer, in contrast to the state-of-the-art exploration techniques, which exhibit poor performance in the off-policy setting due to the separated policy and exploration strategy updates. An extensive set of empirical studies demonstrates that our method considerably diversifies the visited states, outperforms the baselines, and improves the state-of-the-art off-policy actorcritic by a significant margin.},

Stock market data between 2009 and 2019 (a 10-year period) were analysed to determine if a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Moving Average model with eXogenous input (NARMAX) model could accurately predict day ahead stock prices. A NARMAX model was initially developed using a single input variable (Open) and then extended using multiple input variables which included Open, High and Low stock prices. Obtained results revealed that the NARMAX model has strong potential for day ahead price prediction and can be compared against existing techniques for stock market price prediction. Performance evaluation, demonstrated across multiple stock market datasets, demonstrate that NARMAX is efficient in predicting stock market closing price.},

  abstract  = {As a result of current dearth of medical physicians and medical resources in some countries, and also due to the growth of the Internet, an increasing number of people are holding medical question-and-answer sessions online. The goal of this research is to create a medical question-answering system based on a knowledge graph that will allow individuals to acquire answers to medical queries rapidly on the computer. To accomplish it, we propose a new mechanism of intent recognition and entity linking on a medical knowledge graph. After these processes, the system uses Cypher language to search the knowledge graph for the answer based on the extracted query-intent and entity, using the specified rule template that was formed during slot filling. Two models are used in this study to fulfill the tasks of intent recognition and named entity recognition, and the system also enhanced the model&#39;s results with information from the knowledge graph using the template matching method. Additionally, the entity linking procedure has been finished in order to better integrate models into a question-and-answer system. The entity linking function can link non-standard words in user questions to common disease names on the knowledge graph, to better obtain answers from the knowledge graph. The intent recognition used the BERT-TextCNN model, and the accuracy obtained on the CMID public dataset was 0.67. The named entity recognition used the BiLSTM-CRF model, and the accuracy obtained on the cMedQANER public dataset was 0.96. The entity linking process used the ESIM model, and the accuracy obtained on the Yidu-N7K public dataset was 0.96. The system used the above trained models and template matching methods to answer a total of 13 types of questions: ‘Definition’, ‘Cause’, ‘Prevention’, ‘Disease manifestations’, ‘Associated conditions’, ‘Treatment’, ‘Department’, ‘Infectious’, ‘Cure rate’, ‘Taboo’, ‘Physical Examination Program’, ‘Treatment time’ and ‘Food recommend’. To compare the effectiveness of this system with the system that only uses the template matching method, the experiment was designed with 200 questions divided into four groups. ‘whether the question uses the standard entity names in the knowledge graph’ and ‘whether the question uses the feature words in the intent template’ were controlled separately in different groups. The experimental results demonstrate that the correct answer rate of this system is much higher than that of the system based on template matching only when users enter questions without using standard entity names from the knowledge graph or without using feature words from the intent template.},

  abstract  = {Recently, ant algorithms have been employed by generation constructive and generation perturbative hyper-heuristics. However, no research has been conducted to study these algorithms in terms of their parameters and the heuristics that they generate. This paper presents a study of ant-based generation hyper-heuristics that examines the effect of different parameters for achieving good performance for three different assessment criteria namely, generality, optimality and computational effort. This is done via an elementary effects analysis to assess the importance of the different parameters in producing good performance for the different assessment criteria. The paper also presents an analysis of generated heuristics, assessed via three metrics that define a compactness criterion, to assess the potential of bloat, i.e. redundant code, in generated heuristics produced by ant-based generation hyper-heuristics under different generation size limits, the operator limit. This study considers three domains, the travelling salesman problem, movie scene scheduling problem and capacitated vehicle routing problem. The results of the study showed that type of pheromone map and operator limits were most important for generality, with the number of ants and number of iterations being most important for optimality and computational effort. Additionally, the study also demonstrated that ant-based generation hyper-heuristics produce highly compact, readable heuristics even with large operator limits that demonstrate resistance to bloat.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary algorithms (EA) are efficient population-based stochastic algorithms for solving optimization problems. The performance of EAs largely depends on the configuration of values of parameters that control their search. Previous works studied how to configure EAs, though, there is a lack of a general approach to effectively tune EAs. To fill this gap, this paper presents a consistent, automated approach for tuning and controlling parameterized search of an EA. For this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach called ‘DRL-APC-DE’ for online controlling search parameter values for a multi-objective Differential Evolution algorithm. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on widely adopted multi-objective test problems. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs competitively to a non-adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm, tuned by grid search on the same range of possible parameter values. Subsequently, the trained algorithms have been applied to unseen multi-objective problems for the adaptive control of parameters. Results show the successful ability of DRL-APC-DE to control parameters for solving these problems, which has the potential to significantly reduce the dependency on parameter tuning for the successful application of EAs.},

  abstract  = {The Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Solving the NSP involves assigning feasible shift patterns to nurses, satisfying hard constraints while optimizing objectives such as penalty costs. Various approaches have been proposed to tackle the NSP, explicitly using exact or approximate methods, or implicitly using machine learning models. Exact techniques, e.g., Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), are often time-consuming while approximation methods such as metaheuristics trade running time for the quality of the solution returned. In this paper, we propose an exact alternative method to model and solve the NSP using the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) framework. More precisely, we use the Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP) to capture all the constraints related to working requirements, in addition to the quantified nurses&#39; preferences (represented as weights) over shift patterns. Solving the WCSP (corresponding to a given NSP instance) consists of finding an optimal solution satisfying all the constraints while optimizing the objective function (total weight). To solve the WCSP, we have adopted a variant of the Branch &amp; Bound (B&amp;B) algorithm, enhanced with constraint propagation and variables/values ordering heuristics. To assess the time efficiency of this new B&amp;B variant, we conducted an experimental study on several NSP instances. The results show that our algorithm is able to return optimal schedules in acceptable running times.},

F alternates between (i) a construction phase that builds a partial feasible solution by assigning positions to on-time jobs and (ii) a backtracking phase that removes on-time jobs that are causing the tardiness of the current job. F chooses jobs according to a new dynamic priority rule. It stops when it successfully schedules all jobs or when it reaches a threshold runtime. F is unique in two ways. It does not guide its search via a problem-dependent heuristic. In addition, its parameters are problem-independent; thus, require no tuning. Experimental results provide computational evidence that F is superior to existing heuristics such as NEH and Profile Fitting.},

Successful team formation not only requires team members to meet job requirements, but also systematically consider collaboration among them. However, traditional human resource management relies on qualitative methods is difficult to achieve that. In this paper, we propose a heuristic person-job matching algorithm (HPJMA) and an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) to solve the team formation problem (TFP). First, the heuristic person-job matching algorithm determines whether the job seeker meets all the job requirements. The key idea is to put the right applicants on the right positions. Then, the improved genetic algorithm adopts real number coding to form individuals in the population. Moreover, we utilize a heuristic method to obtain the initial population and then use the elite individual retention strategy to speed up the algorithm convergence. In addition, we introduce the population perturbation strategy to avoid getting struck in the local optimal solution. We aim to maximize the matching degree of the team as a whole. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms reach a higher overall person-job matching degree on different scales, compared to the three baseline algorithms. Therefore, the proposed heuristic person-job matching algorithm and the improved genetic algorithm can effectively solve the team formation problem.},

Moreover, the world has witnessed remarkable achievements when combining deep learning with reinforcement learning (now known as Deep Reinforcement Learning) in the areas like robotics, video games, business, and healthcare. One of the strongest parts of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is the ability to solve sequential decision-making problems. The inventory control problem is one such field where DRL can be applied to learn the optimal ordering policy to minimize the total inventory cost. In this paper, a linear supply chain model is considered with stochastic lead time and demand. The problem is then modeled into Markov Decision Processes (MDP). We then designed three different agents: Q-learning agent, Deep Q-network (DQN, also known as Deep Q-Learning), and (R, S) policy-based agent. The Q-learning and DQN agents were trained and evaluated. The (R, S) policy is used as a baseline as it is one of the most popular policies in business organizations. In comparison to traditional reinforcement learning (i.e Q-learning) and rule-based learning (i.e. (R, S) policy), the DQN model performs better in making the optimal ordering decision so that the total cost is minimized.},

Data was collected by engineers at Ford Motor Company from numerous sensors over several drive cycle variations. This study provides evidence of the anomaly detecting capability of our trained autoencoder and investigates the suitability of our autoencoder relative to other unsupervised methods for automatic fault detection in this data set. Preliminary results of testing the autoencoder on the powertrain sensor data indicate the data reconstruction approach availed by the autoencoder is a robust technique for identifying the abnormal sequences in the multivariate series. These results support that irregularities in hybrid-electric vehicles&#39; powertrains are conveyed via sensor signals in the embedded electronic communication system, and therefore can be identified mechanistically with a trained algorithm.

Bayesian optimization is an effective method to discover the optimal point of an expensive black-box function using few samples. In this paper, Bayesian optimization is introduced to solve the copper smelting optimization problem. The surrogate model is constructed based on noisy deep Gaussian processes to cope with the non-stationary process and observational noise of copper smelting. Then, the expected hypervolume improvement is used as the acquisition function, considering multiple objectives when selecting the new sampling point. We conduct experiments on standard test functions and a simulation model of copper flash smelting.

  abstract  = {In many deep reinforcement learning (DRL) applications, agents must perform complex and long-horizon tasks that are still challenging in DRL because of temporally ex-tended tasks with sparse rewards. Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach for control at multiple time scales via a hierarchical structure with subgoals. One of the key issues of goal-conditioned HRL is the definition of subgoals. In this study, we propose a DRL model for learning landmark-oriented subgoals using attention-augmented trajectory memory. In our approach the agent is trained to make decisions based on both 1) current perception, which is a short-term temporal history derived from vanilla long short-term memory (LSTM) and 2) trajectory memory, which represents a contextual summary of long-term historical LSTM states augmented by attention. The experiment on a visual navigation task shows that the short-term LSTM state of the current perception module extracts landmark subgoals as clusters that correspond to lower-level policies, and the long-term context states of trajectory memory extract subgoal transitions that correspond to higher-level policies. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrated superior adaptability to environmental changes,},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes four estimation techniques, namely two linear and two nonlinear ones: Kalman filter observer, extended Luenberger state observer, extended Kalman filter observer and sliding mode observer for a mechatronics system with state feedback control. The laboratory equipment investigated in this study, namely ECP Model 220 Industrial Plant Emulator (ECPM220IPE), is an electromechanical plant, a complex and nonlinear system based on which a broad range of representative servo control applications can be emulated, designed and implemented. For achieving the simultaneous control of all the essential state variables, zero steady-state control error and better quality properties (behavior), all four estimation techniques are designed, implemented and tested using the mathematical models of ECPM220IPE with state feedback control. Their performance and effectiveness are validated through real-time experimental and digital simulation results in the framework of position control of ECPM220IPE by considering two circumstances, rigid body dynamics and flexible drive dynamics.},

The reactive power sub problem is modelled as a quadratic programming problem, and the active power sub problem is modelled as a linear programming problem.

This paper proposes a new approach based on hierarchical reinforcement learning to find an instantaneous reward function for the game of guarding a territory, which is a more complex version of pursuit-evasion games. To have greater control over the generated path, a novel modification to the fuzzy actor-critic learning algorithm is proposed, so the augmented algorithm is able to handle several reward functions with different time horizons.

  abstract  = {In surveillance systems, vast amounts of data are collected from different sources to monitor ongoing video activities. Usually, video data is passively captured by visual sensors and forwarded to the command center, without intelligent Edge functionalities to select essential video information and locally detect abnormal events therein. These shortcomings often seen in practical surveillance scenarios lead to a wastage of storage resources and make data management, retrieval, and informed decision complex and time-consuming. Therefore, endowing visual sensors with video summarization capabilities is of utmost importance for smarter surveillance systems. This study departs from this rationale to propose an efficient neural networks-based video summarization method for surveillance systems. The proposed approach learns how to optimally segment a video by measuring informative features from the data flow, followed by memorability and entropy to maintain the relevance and diversity of the video summary produced on the Edge. Experimental results over benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts and proves the effectiveness of our method for video summarization in smart cities.},

  abstract  = {The mammalian auditory system is capable of extracting auditory features from very small vibrational changes remarkably by adapting to noisy environments over an extraordinary large dynamic range to facilitate intelligent processing. Theoretical studies and biophysical measurements suggest that this outstanding performance of acute sensitivity in sound frequency and sound amplitude is strongly believed to be produced in the cochlea by adapting to the electromechanical feedback signals received by the Outer Hair Cells (OHCs) in the Organ of Corti. A growing consensus speculates that the operation of the mechanisms observed in biology that extract and compress the audio input features with high accuracy can be modelled using Hopf bifurcations. We propose a simple Hopf-based active cochlear filterbank that can approximately reproduce auditory processing observed in a mammalian cochlea and the nonlinear frequency-dependent hearing threshold observed in the auditory nerve fibers. We experimentally demonstrate how the crucial role of the feedback can benefit the background noise cancelling task, by tuning the hearing thresholds based on the activities of higher feedback projections. To prove the concept in hardware, we have implemented the proposed cochlear filter in an FPGA. The tuning curve of the filter can be configured to reproduce various biological data presented in the literature. The resource utilisation and the power consumption of the filter are provided. The proposed active cochlear filterbank can easily be extended to integrate different types of feedback projections such as the thalamus feedback observed in biology. The proposed filter could be a good candidate to use as an artificial hearing sensor that can provide auditory spike trains for the existing and future spike-based intelligent computing machines.},

Neuromorphic photonics are among the most promising emerging approaches, as they can operate at very high frequencies with minimal energy and power consumption. At the same time, such analog architectures also impose a number of limitations arising from noise sources, digital-to-analog (DAC), and analog-to-digital (ADC) conversions that lead to reducing the effective bit resolution for DL models. The main contribution of this work is a photonic-compliant post-training quantization method that effectively allows us to deploy limited precision models without significant performance degradation, enabling us to reduce the cost and complexity of photonic substrates. The proposed method is capable of effectively handling outliers and equally distributing the quantized parameters, improving the accuracy of DL models even when compared with more computationally-intensive methods, such as quantization-aware training approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), employing different photonic configurations, lowering the models&#39; precision requirements down to 4-bits.},

Therefore, we propose a context-based genetically optimized network model for image segmentation in this paper. Genetic algorithms enhance the performance of the deep network model by determining the best parameter values. The proposed three-level deep network is adaptable to image context by extracting visual and context-rich features and optimally integrating them to obtain final pixel labels for scene images. The genetic algorithm ensures optimal parameter values in all three levels to obtain a globally optimized network model to achieve the best segmentation results.},

  abstract  = {Tree image segmentation is an important task of analysing the forest cover in ecosystems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) particularly U-Nets are popular methods for image segmentation, but they often require rich expertise from both the problem domain and the neural network domain to design effective model architectures. Recently, automatically designing U-Nets has shown promise, but none of them has been proposed for tree image segmentation. When designing U-Nets, the encoding and decoding schemes are the keys to the success of the search, which have not been fully investigated yet. Therefore, this paper investigates a new approach based on genetic algorithms (GAs) to automatically design/learn U-N ets for tree segmentation from remote-sensing images. The new encoding scheme enables chromosomes of a GA to represent potential U-Net models of variable length based on blocks. The decoding scheme decodes chromosomes to potential U-Net models with the characteristics of U-Nets. More importantly, the new designs allow the new approach to effectively and efficiently search for U-Net models of variable lengths by only optimising several key parameters. The results show that the proposed approach achieves better performance than a well-known manually designed U-Net by automatically learning the U-Net model with a significantly smaller number of parameters on one tree image segmentation dataset.},

Previous works have mainly focused on minimizing a single loss function constructed on the basis of consideration of the multiple performance requirements for an ATFG model. However, as a proxy, the loss function does not always yield optimal performance when minimised. Moreover, it is unlikely that there is a single model that can be optimal in terms of all relevant quality indicators. In this paper, we formulate the training of an ATFG model as an indicator-aware multi-objective optimization problem and propose a novel approach, namely Evolutionary Multi-objective Indicator-aware audio-driven talking face Generation (EMIG), to solve this problem. EMIG explicitly uses the quality indicators in the design process of ATFG models and can be easily adapted to the preferences of users. Experimental studies demonstrate the potential advantages of evolutionary multi-objective optimization for solving the task of ATFG and the effectiveness of EMIG over five state-of-the-art ATFG methods.},

The traditional adversarial game-playing programs that work by searching in the space of game states have been actively explored in the literature for this purpose. However, most approaches proposed for playing adversarial games have been tested only in static game environments with fixed goals for winning. In this study, we extend the static environment of Hero Academy, a turn-based, multi-action, adversarial game, to a more dynamic game-playing environment, and study the behavior and performance of tree search and evolutionary algorithms in playing that game. Our simulations show that, while evolutionary algorithms continue to dominate tree search algorithms, tree search algorithms can become relatively more competitive under certain dynamic scenarios. Equally important is that evolutionary algorithms are able to alter their approach to playing and winning a game in the face of dynamic changes in the environment, whereas tree search algorithms are unable to do so. The findings of this study should contribute to further advance our understanding of strategic decision-making in adversarial situations, particularly when goals and targets may change dynamically.},

This paper proposes a Fully Complex-valued, Fully Convolutional Multifeature Fusion Network $(FC^{2}\mathbf{MFN})$ for building semantic segmentation on InSAR images using a novel, fully complex-valued learning scheme. $FC^{2}$ MFN learns multi-scale features, performs multi-feature fusion, and has a complex-valued output. For the particularity of complex-valued InSAR data, a new complexvalued pooling layer is proposed that compares complex numbers considering their magnitude and phase. This helps the network retain the phase information even through the pooling layer. Experimental results on the simulated InSAR dataset [1] show that $FC^{2}$ MFN achieves better results compared to other state-of theart methods in terms of segmentation performance and model complexity.},

  abstract  = {Hundreds of contiguous bands of remotely sensed hyperspectral image (HSI) capture the spectral signatures of observed objects or materials on the earth&#39;s surface. Although the HSI data is able to provide huge information with great details, it poses challenges to image analysis because of the high computational cost due to the large dimensionality of the feature space, redundancy in information, and curse of dimensionality. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes an information-theoretic feature selection approach for selecting an informative feature subset considering the maximum of the minimum approach. The minimum of conditional mutual information based estimation is used to select a feature among the selected feature subset. This selected feature with the corresponding candidate feature is then exploited using the mutual information and joint mutual information based valuation to find the maximum relevance of the candidate features with the target classes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach, called joint-conditional mutual information for selecting informative feature (JCIF), is assessed by implementing it in some synthetic data and three remotely sensed HSI data. Several known feature selection algorithms are also used for comparison purposes. The results of the experiments with K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine classifiers reveal that JCIF performs better in selecting informative features.},

  abstract  = {Physical activity is recognized as an essential component of overall health. One measure of physical activity, the step count, is well known as a predictor of long-term morbidity and mortality. Step Counting (SC) is the automated counting of the number of steps an individual takes over a specified period of time and space. Due to the ubiquity of smartphones and smartwatches, most current SC approaches rely on the built-in accelerometer sensors on these devices. The sensor signals are analyzed as multivariate time series, and the number of steps is calculated through a variety of approaches, such as time-domain, frequency-domain, machine-learning, and deep-learning approaches. Most of the existing approaches rely on dividing the input signal into windows, detecting steps in each window, and summing the detected steps. However, these approaches require the determination of multiple parameters, including the window size. Furthermore, most of the existing deep-learning SC approaches require ground-truth labels for every single step, which can be arduous and time-consuming to annotate. To circumvent these requirements, we present a novel SC approach utilizing many-to-one attention-based LSTM. With the proposed LSTM network, SC is solved as a regression problem, taking the entire sensor signal as input and the step count as the output. The analysis shows that the attention-based LSTM automatically learned the pattern of steps even in the absence of ground-truth labels. The experimental results on three publicly available SC datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully counts the number of steps with low values of mean absolute error and high values of SC accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Chest X-rays show elements of bilateral symmetry of the lung field, which can be disturbed by various lung diseases. These bilateral differences are taken into account by physicians during routine radiology examinations and form the basis for diagnosing various lung diseases. While for other medical computer vision tasks such as pelvic fracture detection the bilateral symmetry of the domain is already considered, this has not yet been sufficiently explored in the evaluation of chest X-rays to aid in the diagnosis of lung diseases. To this end, we developed a symmetry-aware deep learning architecture for the classification of bacterial and viral pneumonia, demonstrating the effectiveness of symmetry-aware models on lung conditions. Our work builds upon the idea of Siamese networks, which independently process the left and right lung and fuse the two learned representations in downstream layers for classification. Two different feature map fusion methods are implemented, by integrating a difference merging layer, and by concatenating the feature maps. It is shown that the performance of the network can be improved by symmetry-motivated adaptation of the architecture in terms of AUROC and F1 score by up to 0.8\% and 2.0\%, respectively, without the introduction of extended loss functions. In addition, our analysis of the activation maps illustrates that the focus of the network improves compared to the baseline model. Our proposed architecture focuses on the lung lobes without a region of interest crop, pinpointing the effectiveness of symmetry incorporation. By incorporating the prior medical knowledge of the bilateral symmetry of the lung field, a more data-efficient algorithm can be developed, leading to comparable performances with fewer data samples.},

Determining a relationship between opinion and demographic elements will aid in developing ways to close the gap between perception and readiness to implement healthcare technology for patients. The concept of telemedicine becomes more critical due to the onset of pandemics such as COVID-19. In addition, with telemedicine being a viable option to reduce cost and inconvenience for the patient, while delivering care that is effective and efficient, having patient buy in will be a key element. This study aims to identify the perception about telemedicine and telecare based on the posts by Twitter users eighteen months before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We leveraged VADER sentiment analysis model to identify the sentiment of the public using the tweets they posted. Out of approximately 1,073,817 tweets included, 491,695 unique tweets from 10,495 unique users met the inclusion criteria Among all countries, United States dominated the tweet volume. Among all the states in US, it is interesting to note that district of Columbia dominated the tweet volume. Among tweets from top five English speaking countries, interestingly after March 2020, the average sentiment of all countries seems to converge to the same value. Results indicate that before COVID-19 outbreak, people had neutral perception or sentiment towards telemedicine, while after the onset of increased cases and high alert situations, people tend to support Telemedicine and the overall perception started to grow towards the positive side.},

Third, the basic movements of humans were used for training. Finally, the encoder and the Transformer were trained separately.

CEVRP considers both the cargo capacity of EVs and the battery capacity of EVs, resulting in the difficulty of the construction of feasible solutions. In this paper, we propose an extended ant colony optimization (EACO) algorithm, which uses a pheromone matrix to record the routing information of customers and charging stations for solution construction. Two route construction methods: coarse route construction method and fine route construction method, are developed to generate a customer service sequence with recharging stations. In the coarse route construction method, cargo capacity constraints are ignored and the selection of recharging stations depends on the remaining battery power after the routing of customers only. In the fine routing construction method, the cargo capacities are considered to better evaluate the remaining battery power of vehicles if a return to depots is necessary in the current construction step. After the construction of routing, the giant tour is split and local search is applied to improve solution quality. Experiments show that the proposed EACO is moderate effective. The fine routing construction shows higher exploration ability and performs better than coarse routine construction.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling (DJSS) is an important problem with many real-world applications. Genetic programming is a promising technique to solve DJSS, which automatically evolves dispatching rules to make real-time scheduling decisions in dynamic environments. Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) is a notable variant of genetic programming methods. Compared with Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP), LGP has high flexibility of reusing building blocks and easy control of bloat effect. Due to these advantages, LGP has been successfully applied to various domains such as classification and symbolic regression. However, for solving DJSS, the most commonly used GP method is TGP. It is interesting to see whether LGP can perform well, or even outperform TGP in the DJSS domain. Applying LGP as a hyper-heuristic method to solve DJSS problems is still in its infancy. An existing study has investigated some basic design issues (e.g., parameter sensitivity and training and test performance) of LGP. However, that study lacks a comprehensive investigation on the number of generations and different genetic operator rates, and misses the investigation on register initialization strategy of LGP. To have a more comprehensive investigation, this paper investigates different generations, genetic operator rates, and register initialization strategies of LGP for solving DJSS. A further comparison with TGP is also conducted. The results show that sufficient evolution generations and initializing registers by diverse features are important for LGP to have a superior performance.},

This problem is referred to as the project portfolio selection and scheduling problem (PPSSP). In the context of the Australian Department of Defence (DoD), the PPSSP arises as part of the future force design (FFD) process. Recently, a novel PPSSP formulation was shown to demonstrate the characteristics required to address the modern FFD problem. However, the FFD process is inherently multi-objective while the aforementioned problem formulation was limited to only maximisation of the total portfolio value. This study proposes a bi-objective extension of this model and provides an empirical analysis of three multi-objective meta-heuristics to address 81 instances of the proposed problem. Further insights about the solutions, used to aid the decision maker when selecting a portfolio for implementation, are provided using knee-point analysis and scalarisation.},

  abstract  = {Recently large-scale sparse multi-objective optimization problems are increasingly concerned by researchers. Different from large-scale multi-objective optimization problems, most of the decision variables (Decs) of the large-scale sparse multi-objective optimization problems are equal to zero. Among the existing large-scale sparse evolutionary algorithms, SparseEA and SparseEA2 dynamically mask some of the real decision variables to zero by setting Mask which can accelerate convergence. When determining Mask updates, the SparseEA and SparseEA2 algorithms both use a static fitness. However, static fitness is limited by the number of iterations so that it is difficult to cover the global information. To address this issue, we design an adaptive fitness for Mask updates. Moreover, we increase the number of decision variables per flip according to the number of decision variables, and gradually decrease the flip probability as the number of iterations increases. In the case of real Decs cross, we only cross the real Decs with the same Mask as the parents. We experiment on eight benchmark problems and three real-world application problems, and the simulation results show that our algorithm is significantly more efficient than the other four currently available sparse large-scale multi-objective algorithms.},

They are valuable to businesses as it enables them to better understand their customer base. The creation of personas from survey data requires establishing the client requirements, building a quantifiable personality scale, developing personality questions for a survey, and human subjective analysis. In this work, we have utilised clustering to automate the persona development process. We have developed a real-world survey for children (from 17 countries) which included 25 personality-based questions (based on the OCEAN model), 22 questions that captured purchase behaviour, and other general features from the children&#39;s land-scape. There were 63,969 completed questionnaires with a high proportion of categorical features, which were preprocessed to allow different segmentation methods to be tested. Preliminary results with simple K-means and a Euclidean distance function demonstrated that this was inappropriate for the survey data set. A novel distance function for K-means clustering has been developed, which can handle a mixture of feature types and to allow the importance of each feature to be varied, using a linearly weighted distance method. The function also incorporates the haversine distance function to provide a distance between two locations, enabling potential cultural differences to be exam-ined.We have also implemented Gaussian Mixture Model on the same feature set to compare the results and see the limitations of Gaussian Models Our novel approach generated clusters based on a combination of features including personality, consumer behaviour and location which has demonstrated key cultural differences across the globe. Results from our novel approach show that location distance is one of the key features when constructing personas as culture (location) has a significant effect on the way children answer survey questions.},

  abstract  = {With the increase of Machine Learning (ML) adoption throughout many industries, the need for efficient methods to continuously design, develop, and deploy ML models has also grown. To address this issue, several ML pipelines have emerged with the goal of creating development environments which facilitate the deployment, evaluation and maintenance. In this paper, we advocate that most existing pipelines are not well suited for the initial stages of ML development, due to their high setup and maintenance overheads. As such, we propose a lightweight Quick Machine Learning framework, QML, which is capable of reducing the setup overhead and operating in the low infrastructure environments that are most common-place in experimental ML projects. To demonstrate QML&#39;s usefulness, we present a case-study where a lightweight ML pipeline was developed, and subsequently validated on a standard ML classification problem. Lastly, we assess the differences between our pipeline and an alternative lightweight workflow, based on DAGsHub. With this comparison, we conclude that our approach increases ML task automation as well as feature support, while falling short only in the Experiment Tracking category. To enable the broader community to experiment and assess QML, as well as the Lightweight Pipeline, this project has been made publicly available 1 1 https://github.com/WALEX2000/qml1 https://github.com/WALEX2000/qml1 https://github.com/WALEX2000/qml1 https://github.com/WALEX2000/qml},

We use Pseudo-Inverse learning based dual weight learning for storing variable length sequences as multiple limit cycles in a single M-ary Hopfield neural network. We propose a novel recall mechanism based on energies of End-of-Sequence markers to retrieve the stored sequence (complete sequence) and sequence id, corresponding to the trigger state. We present results of experiments on a large dataset of variable length sequences constructed from movie clips (i) to establish the efficacy of the proposed retrieval mechanism for sequence retrieval under zero error tolerance, given any particular state of the sequence as trigger state to the network, (ii) to demonstrate trade off between number of cycles and average length of cycle which the network supports for storage and retrieval (iii) to demonstrate that the system retains O(N) storage capacity for variable length sequences modelled in its limit cycles.

  abstract  = {Computational natural language processing (NLP) is indispensable in a humanized ambience intelligence environment. NLP facilitates ambient intelligence by making machines understand, and be understood by, humans. This in turn makes machines behave more human-like than they typically are today. Technological advances in machine learning (ML), and especially deep learning (DL), have been a key enabler of NLP research. This paper begins with a survey of recent developments of ML/DL for NLP. It then identifies some of the most promising techniques reported in recent literature. These most promising techniques are then assembled into a reusable toolkit for computational NLP. The adaptable nature of the assembled toolkit allows it to be reused in a broad range of NLP applications. The paper then describes experimental evaluation of our implemented solutions for comparative analysis. Two specific NLP applications form the basis of comparative evaluation. The first involves identifying one of M English sentences that does not make sense. The second, which is harder than the first, involves choosing from among N sentences the one that best explains why a presented sentence is invalid. Human baseline accuracies for these applications are 99.1\% and 97.8\%, respectively. The observation that these results are somewhat less than perfect demonstrates that even humans can occasionally find these tasks difficult. It further underscores the difficulties involved in some of these computational NLP applications. Experiments conducted on benchmark data show that advanced ML/DL can achieve near-human performance in both computational NLP applications with accuracy scores of 96.1\% and 93.7\%, respectively.},

We present a Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) for identifying the candidates&#39; unsafe regions within given safety properties. The Meta-heuristic capability of the NSA algorithm made it possible to estimate vast unsafe regions while validating a subset of these regions. We utilize a parallel execution of partitioned input space to produce safe areas. The NSA based on the prior knowledge of the safe regions is used to identify candidate unsafe region areas and the Marabou framework is then used to validate the NSA results. Our preliminary experimentation and evaluation show that the procedure finds candidate unsafe sub-requirements when validated with the Marabou framework with high precision.},

This means that a security analyst will have little to no explanation or clarification on why an IDS model made a particular prediction. A potential solution to this problem is to research and develop Explainable Intrusion Detection Systems (X-IDS) based on current capabilities in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this paper, we create a novel X-IDS architecture featuring a Self Organizing Map (SOM) that is capable of producing explanatory visualizations. We leverage SOM&#39;s explainability to create both global and local explanations. An analyst can use global explanations to get a general idea of how a particular IDS model computes predictions. Local explanations are generated for individual datapoints to explain why a certain prediction value was computed. Furthermore, our SOM based X-IDS was evaluated on both explanation generation and traditional accuracy tests using the NSL-KDD and the CIC-IDS-2017 datasets. This focus on explainability along with building an accurate IDS sets us apart from other studies.},

However, with increased popularity of online social networks, it is becoming many times easier to spread such videos and achieve virality. Recent advancements in deep learning has further fuelled this menace as the so called deepfake videos are hard to differentiate from the genuine ones. While deepfake video detection techniques attempt to identify the fake videos from real videos, these are now being subjected to adversarial attacks, thus undermining their efficacy. In this paper, we show that accuracy of deepfake detectors can be considerably improved by incorporating an adversarial learning step during model building. We use a recently proposed deep network architecture, namely VGG19, as deepfake detector supplemented with adversarial training using Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM). To further improve non-adversarial accuracy ensemble of models were used. Extensive experiments on a large deepfake video corpus under different white box adversarial attacks demonstrate significant adversarial robustness of the proposed method.},

Due to the increasing amounts of data generated by monitoring tools as well as more and more sophisticated attacks, these ML methods are gaining traction. Knowledge graphs and their corresponding learning techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with their ability to seamlessly integrate data from multiple domains using human-understandable vocabularies, are finding application in the cybersecurity domain. However, similar to other connectionist models, GNNs are lacking transparency in their decision making. This is especially important as there tend to be a high number of false positive alerts in the cybersecurity domain, such that triage needs to be done by domain experts, requiring a lot of man power. Therefore, we are addressing Explainable AI (XAI) for GNNs to enhance trust management by exploring combining symbolic and sub-symbolic methods in the area of cybersecurity that incorporate domain knowledge. We experimented with this approach by generating explanations in an industrial demonstrator system. The proposed method is shown to produce intuitive explanations for alerts for a diverse range of scenarios. Not only do the explanations provide deeper insights into the alerts, but they also lead to a reduction of false positive alerts by 66\% and by 93\% when including the fidelity metric.},

In clustering-based CF, clusters composed of users with similar preference pattern are extracted and items with high preference degree in the cluster to which user belongs are recommended. Rough C-means (RCM) is a clustering method that incorporates a perspective of rough set theory into hard C-means (k-means) to deal with the uncertainty inherent in data. Furthermore, online RCM (ORCM) and its application to CF (ORCM-CF) have been proposed for large-scale datasets. ORCM introduces online learning to RCM and loads an object one by one and gradually updates the parameters. In RCM and ORCM, although it is necessary to set the number of clusters in advance, it is difficult to set the appropriate number of clusters. In this study, we propose adaptive ORCM (AORCM), which aims to automatically generate the appropriate number of clusters by adaptively adding and merging clusters during online learning.

Frequency Fitness Assignment (FFA) is a module that can be plugged into most optimization algorithms. It replaces the objective values in the selection step with their encounter frequency during the search so far. The search effort is therefore distributed evenly over the whole range of the objective values. Recently, it was shown that using FFA can significantly improve the performance of algorithms on hard problems such as Trap and Jump functions and the NP-hard MaxSat problem. However, the objective functions of all of these problems have relatively small ranges. This work is the first to explore the impact of FFA on metaheuristics for solving Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) instances, whose objective values tend to cover a wider range. We plug FFA into the (1+1) EA to obtain the (1+1) FEA. We perform extensive experiments on 18 instances from TSPLIB using two different unary search operators. We find that the (1+1) FEA does not get stuck in local optima and can solve many more instances to optimality than the (1+1) EA. However, it tends to be slower in reaching good intermediate solutions. Its performance decreases with the problem scale and the number of different possible tour lengths.},

  abstract  = {Fitness landscape analysis (FLA) refers to a set of techniques that allow for the characterisation, visualisation and comprehension of the trends of objective functions within their decision spaces. Two of the important features estimated through FLA are ruggedness, i.e. the number and distribution of optima within the decision space, and neutrality, i.e. the width, distribution and frequency of areas with one objective function value. Recent studies have proposed the application of FLA to the training problem in supervised learning. The present paper extends previous results on ruggedness and neutrality to investigate the loss landscape of LeNet-5. More specifically, we demonstrate that the neutrality threshold is an important metaparameter and that its optimisation is required to correctly assess the ruggedness and neutrality of a problem. Furthermore, this study investigates the difference between the landscape perceived by a learning algorithm and the actual landscape. The obtained numerical results indicate that the division of datasets into batches causes an increase in perceived ruggedness. As a result, modern training algorithms that make use of division into batches, such as Adam, overestimate ruggedness.},

  abstract  = {Cryptocurrencies have emerged as an alternative financial asset in the last decade, with their market growing exponentially in recent years. The price of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile and is prone to rapid swings within short periods of time. This behaviour makes them a high-risk and high-return financial asset. The efficacy of neural networks in forecasting the high frequency financial time series has become widely accepted in the research community. This work explored the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a neural network based non-linear sequence model, to propose a novel algorithmic trading strategy for cryptocurrencies. The proposed novel high frequency algorithmic trading strategy built over an LSTM based short-term price forecasting is used for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This simple, yet effective trading algorithm uses the network&#39;s price forecasts to make buy and short selling decisions for cryptocurrency based on certain set criteria. The proposed trading strategy gives positive returns when backtested on Bitcoin hourly prices taken from yahoo! finance. We also verified the effectiveness of the trading strategy for Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, based on the positive backtesting returns. As an extension to the study, the proposed strategy is applied on an even higher frequency (minute by minute) Bitcoin price data, and the strategy gives positive backtesting returns in this extended study. We also provide fuzzy intervals for the algorithmic return of our strategy and compare those with corresponding intervals on a simple buy and hold strategy.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new procedural content generation method which learns iterative level generators from a dataset of existing levels. The Path of Destruction method, as we call it, views level generation as repair; levels are created by iteratively repairing from a random starting level. The first step is to generate an artificial dataset from the original set of levels by introducing many different sequences of mutations to existing levels. In the generated dataset, features are observations of destroyed levels and targets are the specific actions that repair the mutated tile in the middle of the observations. Using this dataset, a convolutional network is trained to map from observations to their respective appropriate repair actions. The trained network is then used to iteratively produce levels from random starting maps. We demonstrate this method by applying it to generate unique and playable tile-based levels for several 2D games (Zelda, Danger Dave, and Sokoban) and vary key hyperparameters.},

Search-based action planning, introduced in the game F.E.A.R. in 2005, has an exponential time complexity managing at most several tens of NPCs per frame. A close study of the plans generated in first-person shooters shows that: (1) states are vectors of enumerated values, (2) both initial and final states can be totally defined, (3) actions are both post-unique and unary, (4) plans are totally ordered, and (5) actions occur only once in plans. (1) to (5) satisfy the Simplified Action Structure (SAS) linear time planning framework SAS- $\mathbb{T}_{1}$ . We strengthen previous claims on this framework saying that the associated linear time algorithm $\mathbb{P}$ is capable of managing several millions of NPCs per frame by testing it on three new realistic benchmarks that are based on commercial video games.},

A framework is proposed to aggregate vegetation indices described by fuzzy sets to assess vegetation health.

The control and flow of the activation rules is driven and optimized by an agent-based modeling. Case studies highlight the applicability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract  = {As an increasing number of search-and-rescue (SAR) missions begin to incorporate robotic agents and algorithms to cover search areas, the task of selecting an appropriate algorithm or robot for a specific mission becomes critical. This is particularly challenging since the search time or area coverage performances of SAR algorithms may vary significantly from one operating environment to another. While previous works have evaluated the performance of various SAR algorithms, few have examined how this performance changes as a function of the complexity of the search area or environment. In the presented work, we seek to overcome this knowledge gap by (a) developing the notion of algorithm competency, and (b) generating a competency profile for a specific biologically-inspired SAR algorithm (Lévy walk search) that relates the algorithm&#39;s performance to the complexity of the search environment. Our simulation-based study leverages several existing measures of network topological complexity. Our results show that we can successfully generate competency profiles that indicate positive correlation between the area coverage time and certain complexity measures of the environment. We have also found that some algorithms work better in low complexity environments, while other algorithms outperform them in more complex environments, indicating that competency profiles can aid in the selection of appropriate algorithms.},

The problem is rather difficult to deal with due to diverging interests of agents and the large scale of multi-agent systems. To solve this problem, a hedonic coalition formation method is proposed under the framework of hedonic games. Firstly, a law of diminishing marginal reward (LDMR) is designed, which serves as a preference relation for each agent to join or leave a coalition. Then, it is proved that a Nash equilibrium always exists for coalition partition if the LDMR holds for each agent. Moreover, an individual utility function is designed to calculate the utility of each agent with respect to given tasks. Finally, a distributed hedonic coalition formation algorithm is designed to induce each agent to make its decision, where each agent selects its preferred coalition and shares the local information with its neighbor agents. Results show that disjoint coalitions will be formed for the agents under the decision-making algorithm. The proposed approach has a good performance in scalability and improving coalitions&#39; utility.},

RVFL assumes that all the samples are equally important, however, this may not be satisfied in the real world scenario. Moreover, RVFL ignores the geometric and discriminative information of the data. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a graph embedded intuitionistic fuzzy weighted random vector functional link (GE-IFWRVFL) network. The proposed GE-IFWRVFL model assigns weights to each data point based on the membership and non membership functions. Membership values are assigned based on the distance of each sample from the class centre and non-membership values are assigned based on the sample distance as well as the heterogeneity of the samples. Also, the proposed GE-IFWRVFL exploits the geometric data relationship of the data under the Graph Embedding (GE) framework to enhance the generalization performance. A novel regularization term is incorporated in the proposed GE-IFWRVFL model to handle the topological structure of the data. Similar to intuitionistic fuzzy RVFL (IFRVFL) model, the proposed GE-IFWRVFL optimizes the output layer weights assigning appropriate weights to each sample. The performance of the proposed GE-IFWRVFL model is evaluated over 25 UCI and KEEL datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the better generalization performance of the proposed model compared to the baseline models.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely acclaimed for image classification tasks in the last decade. Despite the recent success, training a CNN for large datasets from scratch is still a challenging task due to the long training time and the uncertain iterative learning process of the fully connected layer. In this paper, a novel Convolutional Ensemble Network (CEN) is proposed which can overcome some of the CNN&#39;s problems due to slow iterative training process. The proposed network aims to improve two crucial things (1) training time and (2) classification accuracy. In the proposed approach, images are passed to network&#39;s convolution and pooling layers to extract the features and then features are passed to an ensemble layer for ensemble weight calculation. In ensemble layer, bootstrapped samples are created randomly using extracted features, further diverse classifiers are trained on each of the sampled features. Finally, the network&#39;s output, errors are calculated. The whole process is repeated for different number of iterations and a systematic comparative analysis of results is conducted for standard CNN and proposed CEN. Three benchmark datasets such as MNIST, F-MNNIST and CIFAR-10 are used to evaluate the proposed approach. The accuracy scores achieved for MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR10 are 99.08\%, 91.5\%, 89.76\% respectively. Extensive experiments and detailed comparative analysis of results in conjunction with the statistical experiments show that CEN can achieve better accuracy than the standard CNN in lesser iterations.},

Inspired by its structure, this paper offers a novel ensemble deep learning algorithm, the ensemble deep ESN (edESN), for load forecasting. First, hierarchical reservoirs are stacked to enforce the deep representation similar to the DESN. Then, instead of computing the readout weights based on the global states, the edESN trains a different readout layer for each scale. Finally, the network combines the outputs from each scale as the final prediction. The edESN is evaluated on twenty publicly available load datasets. This paper compares the edESN with eleven forecasting methods, and the comparative results demonstrate the proposed model&#39;s superiority in load forecasting.},

  abstract  = {Segmentation, a process of partitioning an image into multiple segments to locate objects and boundaries, is considered one of the most essential medical imaging process. In recent years, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved many notable successes in medical image analysis, including image segmentation. Due to the fact that medical imaging applications require robust, reliable results, it is necessary to devise effective DNN models for medical applications. One solution is to combine multiple DNN models in an ensemble system to obtain better results than using each single DNN model. Ensemble learning is a popular machine learning technique in which multiple models are combined to improve the final results and has been widely used in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose to measure the confidence in the prediction of each model in the ensemble system and then use an associate threshold to determine whether the confidence is acceptable or not. A segmentation model is selected based on the comparison between the confidence and its associated threshold. The optimal threshold for each segmentation model is found by using Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimisation (CLPSO), a swarm intelligence algorithm. The Dice coefficient, a popular performance metric for image segmentation, is used as the fitness criteria. The experimental results on three medical image segmentation datasets confirm that our ensemble achieves better results compared to some well-known segmentation models.},

The entire cascade is first trained on the actual data distribution by removing many negative data based on the probability thresholds and the desired class ratio.

For emotion recognition, several machine learning algorithms were evaluated and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) performed better than the other models. Hence, CNN-LSTM was used to classify the emotion of each tweet as either anger, fear, joy, or sadness. Each tweet has a longitude and latitude stored with it that was geocoded to give the exact location, which was used to compare the states within the USA, and finally compare the USA as a whole with Canada, and Mexico. Sentiment analysis shows that all countries have experienced an increase in negative tweets. Emotion recognition shows that compared to Canada and Mexico, USA has experienced a steep drop in emotional health.},

In the literature review, we identified various solutions that can facilitate passive localization using radio, motion sensors, RFID, NFC, and air quality sensors. However, radio devices are the most effective and inexpensive solution for occupancy detection. Passive localization (PL) is an emerging area of indoor occupancy detection. It has various applications in perimeter security, elderly monitoring, and the intelligent healthcare sector. In PL, the target is localized using the target-induced shadowed links within the wireless network. Researchers investigated various approaches for passive local-ization using analytical geometry and fingerprinting techniques. However, the existing fingerprinting and geometric schemes are computationally expensive and need a dense wireless network for greater accuracy. We have obtained better accuracy in the proposed PL scheme within a sparsely deployed wireless network. The performance of the proposed PL scheme is compared with the state-of-the-art Geometric filter (GF) scheme.

  abstract  = {This paper proposes refrigerated showcase fault detection by an autoencoder with the adaptive kernel size tuning (AKST) using Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC) and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum. Refrigerated showcase data may include outliers that store values differing from actual values because of various reasons such as incorrect sensor settings and radio frequency interference. The conventional fault detection methods by an autoencoder using Least Square Error (LSE) as a loss function are affected by the outliers when the outliers are included in learning data. On the contrary, the conventional fault detection methods by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using MCC as a loss function can ignore influence of the outliers. Moreover, faults rarely occur in refrigerated showcases. The methods by an ANN using MCC require fault data for learning. A fault detection method by an autoencoder using the MCC that is a combination of the above two methods can ignore influence of the outliers and doesn&#39;t require fault data. However, there is a parameter named kernel size in the MCC. It is required to tune the parameter properly and the parameter tuning requires engineering. The proposed AKST method reduces the engineering of the kernel size tuning. Effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by comparison with comparative methods by an autoencoder using LSE and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), an autoencoder with fixed kernel size using the MCC and SGD, an autoencoder with the AKST using the MCC and Adam, and an autoencoder with the AKST using the MCC and AdaGrad.},

Cloud computing paradigms have extensive requirements on data rates in a communications channel. The current trend is to use edge computing techniques to process data files primarily on the edge of a network. The present paper compares neural networks and wavelet transforms which apply compression methods to environmental parameter datasets. Three selected parameters (temperature, air pressure and wind speed) were compressed at ratios of 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:12. In addition, three different types of wavelet were compared in the wavelet transform. The results showed that the best RMSE compression result can be achieved by using a Biorthogonal wavelet, which compressed up to 93\% of the volume of data. In using a neural network to compress data, much depends on the nature of the data and also the amount of training data. With appropriately selected data, a volume reduction of 88\% and value of RMSE 0.5356 can be achieved.},

  abstract  = {Classification of resting state - functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data using deep learning algorithms is a challenging problem. Previous studies using latent space transformations to project the data into a discriminant space have shown promising results. However, their reliance on mathematical modelling of the latent space have limited their performance and generalization ability. Learnable latent space transformations have provided a new approach to solve such problems. In this paper, Adaptive Latent Transformation (ALT) method is proposed to address the shortcomings in literature. The ALT proposes an adaptable latent space transformation that can project the input data into a discriminant latent space of any pre-determined dimension using a learnable projection function. The ALT latent space transformation function is integrated into a convolutional neural network algorithm and its weights are updated using the backpropagation based learning strategy to minimize the error in the classification performance. Further, to prevent overfitting of the deep network classifier a novel Confidence based Sample Selection Strategy (CSSS) is proposed to selectively train the network with information-rich samples. The performance of the ALT classifier is evaluated using the ADHD200 rs-fMRI benchmark dataset over a 10 fold cross-validation study.},

Error-related potentials (ErrPs) are a particular brain signal elicited when one commits or observes an erroneous event. However, due to the noisy properties of the brain and recording devices, ErrPs vary from instance to instance as they are combined with an assortment of other brain signals, biological noise, and external noise, making the classification of ErrPs a non-trivial problem. Recent works have revealed particular cognitive processes such as awareness, embodiment, and predictability that contribute to ErrP variations. In this paper, we explore the performance of classifier transferability when trained on different ErrP variation datasets generated by varying the levels of awareness and embodiment for a given task. In particular, we look at transference between observational and interactive ErrP categories when elicited by similar and differing tasks.

Hence, manual diagnosis of MDD is an arduous and subjective task. Despite the aid of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the detection, developing intelligent systems are required to improve clinical utility, performance, and efficiency. In this study, we focus on the automated detection of MDD via raw EEG data using convolutional neural networks (CNN). For this objective, we first extracted the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of EEG records for five distinct band powers and created an image representing the frequency oscillation of every channel during a resting state. Afterward, we applied three approaches to determine whether a subject is MDD or a Healthy individual. In the first approach, a 2D-CNN model was developed for each band power to detect MDD separately. Second, the outcomes of the developed models were used to establish a Choquet fuzzy integral fusion to classify subjects using all of the previous models. The third approach was dedicated to introducing a 3D-CNN architecture. This model received three-dimensional data by putting different band powers&#39; images together. The two last approaches achieved a 95.65\% accuracy and 100\% sensitivity to detect MDD. The proposed approaches can help clinicians as straightforward, efficient, and intelligent diagnostic tools for detecting MDD.},

  abstract  = {Creativity, the ability to develop and express ideas in novel ways, plays a central role in scientific innovation and discoveries. The present work attempts to assess the creative potential of individuals in scientific domain using fNIRS based evaluation technique. The first step of the proposed approach involves the acquisition of hemodynamic data from subjects who were instructed to solve the presented mathematical problem using a non-conventional strategy. In the second step, the acquired data are pre-processed and converted into a brain connectivity network (BCN) using Pearson&#39;s correlation methodology to investigate the topologically significant Brodmann Areas (BAs) engaged in a creative thought process. The acquired BCNs are analyzed using two centrality induced features (closeness and betweenness) that reveal the active involvement of left posterior supramarginal gyrus (BA 40), left anterior prefrontal cortex (BA 10) and bilateral regions of posterior middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) in the said cognitive task. After this, the abstracted centrality based features are classified into two categories (creative and non-creative) using a novel Capsule Graph Neural Network (CapsGNN). The attractive feature of the proposed classifier lies in its ability to learn local and global properties of the brain connectivity patterns using a dual convolution induced feature-fusion technique. Moreover, the utilization of a Logish activation function and the introduction of a new Sigsoftmax based routing algorithm also contribute towards the novelty of the proposed classifier model. Comparative analysis performed with the state-of-the-art techniques infers the superlative performance of the proposed CapsGNN classifier. Thus, the biological aspiration acquired from the present study can offer new insights for the generic development of computational approaches to scientific creativity.},

As a variant of the classical knapsack problems, multi-objective knapsack problems (MOKPs), exist widely in the real-world applications, e.g., cargo loading, project and investment selection. There is a special class of MOKPs called multiparty multiobjective knapsack problems (MPMOKPs), which involve multiple decision makers (DMs) and each DM only cares about some of all the objectives. To the best of our knowledge, little work has been conducted to address MPMOKPs. In this paper, a set of benchmarks which have common Pareto optimal solutions for MPMOKPs is proposed. Besides, we design a SPEA2-based algorithm, called SPEA2-MP to solve MPMOKPs, which aims at finding the common Pareto optimal solutions to satisfy multiple decision makers as far as possible. Experimental results on the benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

When there are a large number of experts, the process is called a Large-Scale Group Decision-Making process. In this kind of environment, there is a great variety of attitudes when discussing the set of alternatives. For instance, there may be experts who may be more aggressive or more peaceful. Aggressiveness is directly related to the degree of cooperativeness of the experts because if an expert is aggressive it implies that he/she will be less cooperative. Consequently, this paper develops a Large-Scale Group Decision-Making method that classifies experts according to their cooperativeness. This classification is based on using sentiment analysis to detect the degree of aggressiveness of each expert. Thus, it is possible to determine whether a specific behavior implies similar valuations and also to detect which experts are more cooperative and are able to reach a consensual ranking of alternatives and which ones would be less willing to cooperate to reach a consensual decision.},

  abstract  = {Multi-attribute decision making methods often rely on complicated mechanisms to represent the preferences of the decision makers. The need to employ these mechanisms coupled with the effort to come up with suitable preferences means that these methods are used sparingly and only in important decisions. However, often times, decision makers need to make choices under time pressures and without the possibility to consider their scenario in exhausting detail. In this paper a new multi-attribute decision-making approach is presented. The main idea is to have a single solution recommended to the decision maker from the Pareto front of decisions. The recommendation mechanism is based on using a weighted sum approach on the attributes of the decisions. The idea is to weigh the attributes so that averaged over multiple scenarios, where a similar decision needs to be made, the values for the objectives would be as low as possible. This paper serves as a showcase of this approach, framing it within the context of a possible centerpiece of a system for dynamic alternate airport selection. The approach was examined on a custom data set and employed the NSGA-II algorithm to search for the weights. The approach shows promising results that could be improved by using a more sophisticated selection method.},

  abstract  = {Scalability in disciplines is an important consideration for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). Very few benchmark problems for multi-objective MDO exist in the literature, none of which are readily scalable. In this study, we introduce a new scalable benchmark problem that extends an existing well-known multi-objective benchmark problem. We show that scaling the number of disciplines in the problem, implying an increasing number of decision variables, does produce substantive changes in convergence ability. We also show that the accuracy of the multidisciplinary analysis (MDA) solver has an impact on the convergence ability of the multi-objective optimization algorithm, which is particularly noticeable when moving from 7 to 14 disciplines. Modification of standard (non-MDO) multi-objective benchmark problems is a promising approach to developing scalable multi-objective MDO benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {The goal of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is to select one or a few preferred solutions in an iterative manner from a set of Pareto-optimal solutions obtained by a generative or simultaneous evolutionary multi-and many-objective optimization (EMO and EMaO) algorithm. In each iteration, the decision-maker (DM) formulates a suitable scalarized optimization problem using preference information that guides the DM to arrive at the most desirable solution set. Visualization of trade-offs among multiple objectives and their interactions with constraints can provide crucial decision-making information. In this paper, we propose a visualization-assisted MCDM approach that utilizes interpretable Self-Organizing Maps (iSOM) on a well-known MCDM technique known as Pareto Race. The proposed method, applied to one test and two real-world problems involving three to five objectives, demonstrates the usefulness of the iSOM-visualization method in implementing Pareto Race decision-making approach. The study opens up further avenues for integrating iSOM visualization approach with other MCDM techniques.},

  abstract  = {The Dial-A-Ride Problem (DARP) consists of de-signing pick-up and delivery routes for a set of customers with special needs. Particularly, it arises in door-to-door transportation services provided to elderly and impaired people. DARP&#39;s main objective is to accommodate as many customers&#39; constraints as possible with minimum operation costs. DARP involves realistic precedence and transit time constraints on the pairing of vehicles and customers. This paper proposes a neural network forecasting approach for DARP with time windows (DARPTW). It develops and compares the results of two-layer and a three-layer artificial neural networks (ANN) which forecast demands, service and travel times based on real-life data provided by a transportation company. Experimental results show that three-layer ANN with hyperbolic tangent (tanh) and sigmoid linear unit (selu) activation functions, coupled with a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer provide the best forecasting results. This paper also develops a data-driven hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search (DD-HALNS). DD-HALNS selects the local search operators according to their updated success&#39; rates, which are, in turn, guided by a learning mechanism from previous successful moves and cost savings. It applies four hybridization features: simulated annealing, tabu lists, genetic crossovers, and restarts. Experimental results on DARPTW benchmark instances highlight DD-HALNS’ ability to improve best known routing solutions, while its application on real life instances, from the Canadian city/region of Vancouver, confirms its implementability.},

Our aim is to offer shipping companies alternative routes that take into account various criteria, including costs, route safety and CO 2 emissions, so that they can make informed decisions about their itinerary. This work, conducted in collaboration with the start-up MaritimeAPI, is highly topical: Maritime transport represents about 3 percent of CO 2 emissions in the world. Today, a large number of organisations and countries wish to reduce CO 2 emissions in order to slow down climate change. Our proposed decision tool wraps around the Application Programming Interface (API) of the company Seametrix. This API generates shortest routes for a user-defined set of parameters, governing access to areas affected by piracy, emission restrictions or the price of passage. We use a combination of machine learning and mathematical calculations, operating on the API outputs, to obtain seven distinct criteria, deemed relevant by domain experts. Using multiobjective optimization over the API parameters, we then illustrate how the existing API can be employed to explore the trade-offs between these criteria. Finally, we discuss the use of preference elicitation to support practitioners in the selection of a final solution, and contrast the results from this a posteriori approach to those obtained using a priori preference elicitation.},

Based on these predictions - and additional contextual information such as the course of the road, (traffic) rules, and interaction with other road users - the highly automated vehicle (HAV) must be able to reliably and safely perform the task assigned to it, e.g., moving from point A to B. Ideally, the HAV moves safely through its environment, just as we would expect a human driver to do. However, if unusual trajectories occur, so-called trajectory corner cases, a human driver can usually cope well, but an HAV can quickly get into trouble. In the definition of trajectory corner cases, which we provide in this work, we will consider the relevance of unusual trajectories with respect to the task at hand. Based on this, we will also present a taxonomy of different trajectory corner cases. The categorization of corner cases into the taxonomy will be shown with examples and is done by cause and required data sources. To illustrate the complexity between the machine learning (ML) model and the corner case cause, we present a general processing chain underlying the taxonomy.},

However, the majority of prediction methods suffer from the problems of structured 2D or 3D grid data and complex spatial-temporal relationships in traffic data. To deal with the above issues, this paper proposes a novel orthogonal spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (OSTGCN) to forecast traffic flow, which allows direct inputs of graph-based traffic networks. The proposed OSTGCN model consists of two major parts, i.e., i) an orthogonal spatial-temporal block to capture long-range spatial-temporal dependency from traffic data, which can be further strengthened by multi-orthogonality fusion; and ii) a graph convolution block based on a non-binary adjacency matrix to capture spatial patterns among neighbor nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that, OSTGCN can improve the prediction performance of baselines by at most 6.42\% and guarantee an acceptable accuracy with a long prediction interval.},

In this paper, a novel Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar-based occupancy detection utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is introduced. The proposed methodology tackles disadvantages posed by visual and sensor-based methods when privacy, computational complexity, line-of-sight requirements, and robustness are concerned. The system uses time-domain raw radar data signals to form visual heatmaps based on signal intensity variation caused by presence of a target. The heatmaps developed for each data frame acts as an input to the neural network. Visually generated signal based heatmaps differentiate three classes of vehicle occupancy: vacant, driver seat and rear passenger occupancy. The adapted CNN architecture is an implementation of transfer learning where a version of the VGG-16 pretrained model consisting of 16 convolutional layers is used. A validation accuracy of 96.88\% is achieved with a dataset containing 1000 heatmap images for each class. The results conclude that radar generated time domain heatmaps efficiently detect vehicle occupancy employing transfer learning even with smaller datasets.},

This was illustrated using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer. The research presented in this paper extends this work by investigating the use of SAWO-NN with more advanced weight optimizers, namely, gradient descent with momentum, RMSprop and Adam. A genetic algorithm was used to evolve the primary and supplementary architecture sets and which weight updates they are used for. The approach was evaluated for data classification (UCI benchmarks and KDD Cup 1999 intrusion detection dataset) and regression (U CI benchmarks and UCLA graduate admission dataset) applications. SAWO-NN was found to improve the performance of neural networks using these optimizers, with statistically significant results. SAWO-NN&#39;s performance was also found to be competitive to state of the art approaches applied to the same datasets.},

MLC is increasingly gaining interest in different application domains such as text mining, computer vision, and bioinformatics. Several MLC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, resulting in a meta-optimization problem that the user needs to address: which MLC approach to select for a given dataset? To address this algorithm selection problem, we investigate in this work the quality of an automated approach that uses characteristics of the datasets - so-called features - and a trained algorithm selector to choose which algorithm to apply for a given task. For our empirical evaluation, we use a portfolio of 38 datasets. We consider eight MLC algorithms, whose quality we evaluate using six different performance metrics. We show that our automated algorithm selector outperforms any of the single MLC algorithms, and this is for all evaluated performance measures. Our selection approach is explainable, a characteristic that we exploit to investigate which meta-features have the largest influence on the decisions made by the algorithm selector. Finally, we also quantify the importance of the most significant meta-features for various domains.},

The goal is to evolve feature extraction functions that are able to improve the clustering results of three different unsupervised clustering algorithms: KMeans++, DBSCAN and Mean Shift. In order to test whether the feature extraction functions evolved by the GE are effective, the clustering algorithms are also used with no feature extraction and with randomly generated feature extraction functions. The results of experimentation show that using a GE to evolve a feature extraction function is more effective than using no feature extraction or randomly generated feature extraction, with the exception of K-Means++ when applied to the Oral lesion dataset where GE feature extraction performed equally as good as when no feature extraction is used. A possible reason for this might be that the grammar for the GE needs additional operators to generate color specific features. Future work includes applying transfer learning to the GE.},

Hyper-heuristics are known as problem-independent methods utilized to solve different instances from varying problem domains. In the literature, there has been effective hyper-heuristic designs providing a certain level of generality in problem solving. Still, the relevant existing research indicates that there is no single hyper-heuristic which performs always the best on different problem solving scenarios. Algorithm selection has been investigated essentially to address this issue, mainly for the problem-specific algorithms, by automatically identifying the (near) best algorithm(s) for each given problem instance. This paper performs algorithm selection on selection hyper-heuristics, for the first time, delivering cross-domain algorithm selection. For this purpose, a suite of problem-independent features is initially introduced. Then, algorithm selection is examined across 9 single-objective combinatorial optimization problems with 6 online selection hyper-heuristics. The experimental results carried out on these problems indicated that algorithm selection is effective for choosing hyper-heuristics while offering improved generality and robustness.},

We call this method $\text{PushGP}+\text{EP}+\text{ARM}$ . With $\text{PushGP}+\text{EP}+\text{ARM}$ , no human effort is required in the knowledge extraction and utilization processes. We compare the proposed method with PushGP, as well as a method using subprograms manually extracted by a human. Our $\text{PushGP}+\text{EP}+\text{ARM}$ achieves better train error, success count, and faster convergence than PushGP.

  abstract  = {Represented by evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence, nature-inspired metaheuristics have shown superiority in solving complex optimization problems for decades. In spite of the source codes of state-of-the-art metaheuristics provided in existing libraries such as PlatEMO, it is still difficult for researchers unfamiliar with metaheuristics to select a suitable one for solving their problems. Since no metaheuristic can per-form the best on all problems, selecting a suitable metaheuristic is very critical for handling real-world applications. Therefore, this work suggests a set of problem-oriented labels for tagging metaheuristics, where metaheuristics are not simply classified into disjoint categories but tagged with multiple labels. By referring to the labels of a metaheuristic, researchers can easily know whether it is capable of solving a given type of problems. The proposed labels can highly facilitate the selection of metaheuristics.},

  abstract  = {Many wireless sensor networks (WSNs) need to cover targets in their sensor fields and ensure connectivity and fault tolerance to the base station. This is a challenging task when planning the network deployment. Sensors can help extend lifetime but also need to be well positioned to be effectively used. This paper seeks to design an efficient node localization scheme while meeting the requirements of the target coverage and connectivity in the network. The problem is approached in two phases. The first phase solves the K-Coverage constraint, which is a metric closely related to lifetime, using two novel heuristic methods named KGCA and IKGCA. The second phase ensures the connection to the base station using a modified version of Dijkstra algorithm. Experimental results show notable improvements in solution quality and running time for the proposed approaches compared to an existing approach to the problem,},

  abstract  = {Machine learning models are gradually gaining acceptance for deployment in science and engineering in recent years as industries mature and become more comfortable with data-driven methods, spanning the whole spectrum from data collection through to data engineering and data modelling. However, unease remains about the accuracy of predictions from these surrogate models when applied in industry, especially as these methods are often utilized as a black-box. Demand for uncertainty quantification has thus increased, especially in critical processes where one requires information about the degree of uncertainty in the prediction to better manage associated risks. Statistical methods such as Bayesian networks and deep ensembles have correspondingly been developed as possible solutions in recent years. While these methods are applicable across multiple domains, they can be computationally expensive or difficult to implement, and fail to capitalize on inherent physics present in many real-world problems. In this work, we thus propose to exploit our prior knowledge of the system, and use physics-based rules and relationships to estimate the degree of uncertainty in the model predictions. We compare the obtained results on a metasurface model system to state-of-the-art methods such as deep ensembles and hyperparameter ensembles. The promising results on this model system suggest that metrics to measure compliance to physics-based rules and relationships can indeed be a useful proxy for estimating these data-driven models&#39; uncertainty, with these relations performing as well as conventional ensemble-based approaches.},

  abstract  = {Accurate wind power (WP) forecasting plays an important role in the safe and stable operation of power systems, in the context of a high proportion of WP. In this paper, a two-stage WP very short-term probabilistic forecasting model is proposed. Firstly, the different frequency components are obtained based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) of historical data. Secondly, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based WP very short-term deterministic forecasting model was developed. An optimized kernel density estimate (OKDE) is established to fit the errors by means of band width (BW) constraints, and the quantile is calculated at different confidence levels. Finally, the deterministic forecasting results are combined with the quantile to calculate the probabilistic forecasting interval. Case Studies are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) combined with variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have reached state-of-the-art performance in spatiotemporal forecasting tasks. This is particularly the case for traffic forecasting, where GNN models use the graph structure of road networks to account for spatial correlation between links and nodes. Recent solutions are either based on complex graph operations or avoiding predefined graphs. This paper proposes a new sequence-to-sequence architecture to extract the spatiotemporal correlation at multiple levels of abstraction using GNN-RNN cells with sparse architecture to decrease training time compared to more complex designs. Encoding the same input sequence through multiple encoders, with an incremental increase in encoder layers, enables the network to learn general and detailed information through multilevel abstraction. We further present a new benchmark dataset of street-level segment traffic data from Montreal, Canada. Unlike highways, urban road segments are cyclic and characterized by complicated spatial dependencies. Experimental results on the METR-LA benchmark highway and our MSLTD street-level segment datasets demonstrate that our model improves performance by more than 7\% for one-hour prediction compared to the baseline methods while reducing computing resource requirements by more than half compared to other competing methods.},

  abstract  = {The present work utilizes Algorithm Selection for automatically specifying the parameter tuning method for a given tuning task. The idea of parameter tuning is motivated by the premature algorithm designs and their sub-optimal or poor parameter value choices. The decisions both on the designs and the parameter values are largely given based on the experiences of the developers or the target problem domain experts after a limited number of trials. While the existing tuning approaches tend to offer improvements over the default parameter values for varying algorithms, they can be computationally expensive. Additionally, there is no a single, ultimate parameter tuning strategy. These facts suggest to choose the most effective tuning algorithm for a specific scenario. This study utilizes an existing Algorithm Selection system to address this problem. The idea is to allocate potentially the most effective tuning method for a given task instead of relying on a single tuner. On that note, a group of well-known parameter configuration approaches are accommodated as the candidate methods to tune NSGA-II for solving a suite of multi-objective optimization benchmarks, refer-encing a recent article. The computational analysis revealed that Algorithm Selection outperforms those constituent parameter tuning methods when each is used as a standalone manner. Additionally, the dis/-similarity analysis carried on the problem instances / benchmarks give hints on the diversity level of the benchmarks. Furthermore, a similar inspection reported on the parameter tuning procedures show the behavioural resemblance between them.},
