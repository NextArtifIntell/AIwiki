  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new method of translational manipulation for redirected walking through pitch-oriented viewpoint manipulation, which is known to change the walking speed of a user. Pitch viewpoint manipulation adds a slope to the virtual reality environment. In reality, walking on a slope increases or decreases the walking speed, and this study conducts an investigation based on the assumption that similar fluctuations would occur in a virtual reality environment. Through an experiment, the variation in walking speed by dynamically manipulating the viewpoint in the pitch direction for a 5 m walking section, and the perception threshold, which is the range in which the viewpoint can be manipulated without being noticed by the user, were investigated. The results showed that the walking speed significantly decreased with pitch gains of -0.5° in the downward direction, and 3° and 5° in the upward direction. It was discovered that perceptual thresholds of 0.17° and -1.12° in the upward and downward directions, respectively, were imperceptible, indicating that the viewpoint could be manipulated without being perceived.},

A hole was drilled in the center of the rat&#39;s femur to simulate a fracture. Firstly, the frequency response is obtained by adapting a Fast Fourier Transform to the resulting reflected wave, which is then cross spectrum to highlight characteristic frequencies. Next, we use the frequency and BMD healthy bone data to construct a pseudo-individual without considering overlap. Finally, we determine the degree of healing process for each individual. In our previous studies, it has the lack of reliability since there was only one data set that was set to be a bone hole was a problem, so the objective was to increase the number of data and improve reliability. The reliability of bone hole selection is demonstrated by comparing data increased frequencies data for pseudo-individuals with increased data frequencies to the healing process of pseudo-individuals used BMD from previous studies.},

  abstract  = {Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality. In recent years, the frequency of births with Down syndrome has been increasing in Japan. One of the reasons for this is the trend toward late childbearing. Many children with Down syndrome often have gait problems such as Genu valgum and Genu varum. In order to solve such gait problems, custom- made insoles need to be created. This is because the shape of the feet and the way of walking vary from patient to patient. In addition, it is necessary to investigate whether these custom-made insoles are suitable for the patients with Down syndrome or not. Currently, the evaluation is done visually by doctors and physical therapists, however the criteria for judgment are unclear. Therefore, we worked to develop a system to determine whether custom-made insoles would improve Genu valgum and Genu varum. Since the children with Down syndrome rarely walk straight when taking gait videos, we focused on performing gait analysis in 3D instead of 2D, which has been performed previously. In this study, we estimated the joint position coordinates of a person from a walking video using 3D pose estimation in order to quantitatively evaluate the gait condition of children with Down syndrome. Additionally, by detecting the time of knee joint loading and measuring the knee joint angle, we were able to propose a system that can confirm symptoms such as genu valgum and genu varum. This system is expected to be easier than the existing 3D analyzers for gait analysis of patients with Down syndrome. As a future work, the accuracy of the system itself needs to be evaluated using an existing 3D motion analyzer that measures with markers.},

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a method that does not degrade the accuracy of facial expression recognition even if a part of the face is occluded. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of the facial expression recognition for only the region around the eyes using the CK+ dataset. The 3-D CNN and 2-D CNN with synthetic or subtracted eye images as the input image were adopted in the experiment The experimental results showed that the accuracy of facial expression recognition using the 3-D CNN or 2-D CNN with subtracted eye images were improved. Therefore, the temporal variations of facial expression are effective for the facial expression recognition using only the region around the eyes.},

Enzymes can be used in the chemical industry, but in the recombinant production of enzymes, some enzymes aggregate during production. In- solubilized enzymes that has lost its catalysis function cannot be used in industry. Therefore, the search for new enzymes that can be used for industrial purposes is one of the important strategies. However, the search for new enzymes takes time and costs money. In previous research, a model for predicting protein solubility from the amino add sequence of a protein was constructed using machine learning. This has made it possible to predict the solubility of a protein before it is produced. In this study, a model is constructed to predict protein solubility not only from the amino acid sequence but also from the amino acid sequence and the secondary structure information of the protein. We attempt to improve the prediction accuracy of the model by providing the model with information that is thought to influence solubility.},

To solve this problem, we are developing a graphic description language and a drawing assistance system that enables visually impaired people to create figures independently.

  abstract  = {In Japan, drunk driving is prohibited under the Road Traffic Law, and penalties are set at a breath alcohol concentration of 0.15 mg/l. However, 300 cases of drunk driving occur annually even when the breath alcohol concentration is below the standard value. This suggests that even small amounts of alcohol consumption may cause a decline in brain function. In this study, we evaluated the brain function caused by low-intensity drinking using event-related potentials, a type of electroencephalogram (EEG). The results showed that breath alcohol concentration increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) at 10, 30, and 50 minutes after drinking compared to before drinking. Event-related potentials during these time periods also changed significantly (p &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, there was no significant difference in expiratory alcohol concentration during the first 70 minutes after drinking, but there was a significant change in event-related potentials. The present study suggests that low alcohol intake at low loads causes a decrease in brain function.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interface is mainly developed for clinical rehabilitation. Numerous studies have shown that it can also be applied to neuromarketing to assist customers in making decisions. By identifying the P300 component of the event-related potentials (ERPs), it can be known whether the target commodity or target stimuli is interesting to the consumer. However, when the target stimuli appear more frequently and people’s responses to stimuli vary, it is challenging to locate the target stimuli based on the P300 in practical applications. Moreover, a significant P300 component can only be obtained by stacking and averaging multiple ERPs in normal conditions. In this study, we propose a group electroencephalogram processing method to estimate the timing of evoked stimulus appearance without compromising real-time performance using convolutional neural networks. In addition, this method can be used to estimate the group’s attention to the target and standard stimulus. The results show that the effectiveness of the proposed processing method for stimuli presentation time estimation and group attention state estimation are 87.10\% and 96.55\%, respectively.},

In addition, the proposed method does not require any specially prepared data for model training or network modification.

  abstract  = {Most adversarial attack defense methods rely on obfuscating gradients. These methods are easily circumvented by attacks which either do not use the gradient or by attacks which approximate and use the corrected gradient Defenses that do not obfuscate gradients such as adversarial training exist, but these approaches generally make assumptions about the attack such as its magnitude. We propose a classification model that does not obfuscate gradients and is robust by construction against black-box attacks without assuming prior knowledge about the attack. Our method casts classification as an optimization problem where we &quot;invert&quot; a conditional generator trained on unperturbed, natural images to find the class that generates the closest sample to the query image. We hypothesize that a potential source of brittleness against adversarial attacks is the high-to-low-dimensional nature of feed-forward classifiers. On the other hand, a generative model is typically a low-to-high-dimensional mapping. Since the range of images that can be generated by the model for a given class is limited to its learned manifold, the &quot;inversion&quot; process cannot generate images that are arbitrarily close to adversarial examples leading to a robust model by construction. While the method is related to Defense-GAN, the use of a conditional generative model and inversion in our model instead of the feed-forward classifier is a critical difference. Unlike Defense-GAN, we show that our method does not obfuscate gradients. We demonstrate that our model is extremely robust against black-box attacks and does not depend on previous knowledge about the attack strength.},

We propose to improve model robustness to adversarial attacks by learning feature representations that are consistent under both data augmentations and adversarial perturbations. We leverage contrastive learning to improve adversarial robustness by considering an adversarial example els another positive example, and aim to maximize the similarity between random augmentations of data samples and their adversarial example, while constantly updating the classification head in order to avoid a cognitive dissociation between the classification head and the embedding space. This dissociation is caused by the fact that CL updates the network up to the embedding space, while freezing the classification head which is used to generate new positive adversarial examples. We validate our method, Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Features (CLAF), on the CIFAR-10 dataset on which it outperforms both robust accuracy and clean accuracy over alternative supervised and self-supervised adversarial learning methods.},

Previous mathematical definition of adversarial examples only involves the overall perturbation amount, and we propose a more practical relevant definition of strong adversarial examples that separately limits the perturbation along the signal direction also. We show that linear classifiers can be made robust to strong adversarial examples attack in cases where no adversarial robust linear classifiers exist under the previous definition. The results suggest that designing general strong-adversarial-robust learning systems is feasible but only through incorporating human knowledge of the underlying classification problem.},

  abstract  = {Emotions are central to physical and mental health and general well being. There is a great need to affordably and non invasively track moment to moment changes in emotional states and their conversion into chronic conditions. Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) is a widely used sensor for measuring blood volume changes, heart rate, and is embedded in numerous biofeedback systems and applications. Nonetheless, the role of BVP features relating to emotion detection is lacking in current studies. While engineers have become more interested in the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and its regulation by the autonomic nervous system, there is a need to design systems that can investigate their variations due to real life stressors and how people respond to emotions differently. The study employs the database for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) in assessing emotional responses of subjects according to valence arousal scale to music videos. We demonstrate a novel approach to augmenting original features and normalized features of blood volume in peripheral vessels. The features of HRV include tachogram, multi-scale entropy (MSE), power spectral density (PSD), and statistical moments derived from BVP. We further propose embedding age and gender of participants as a weight to the augmented features. We finally used multilayer perceptron (MLP) as classifier to evaluate our approach. Obtained results show an 8.4\% and 7.3\% improvement in F1-score in the valence and arousal dimension respectively. Such advances may aid in building closed-loop emotion detection and intervention systems.},

In this paper, we propose machine learning based models to predict the legal penalty of criminal cases. Particularly, we focus on drunk driving cases as they are frequent, and the regulations are clear. Unlike western text which words are separated by spaces, words in Chinese text are continuum. In our proposed method, we first use a word segmentation method to separate the Chinese words in text and apply a pre-trained model to convert words into vectors. In the vector space, words with similar meanings have short distance with each other. As the amount of each penalty varies greatly, resulting a data imbalance problem. Therefore, we adapt the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm as a solution. Finally, we apply deep learning-based models, including Bi-GRU and TextCNN to perform penalty prediction, and compare their advantages and disadvantages.In the experimental result, for drunk driving case penalty prediction, our propose SMOTE + TextCNN solution can reach 73.96\% of accuracy. If we allow the prediction to be plus or minus one month from the actual, the accuracy is 95.60\%. As for the computation time, our proposed method can predict the penalty of 1,524 drunk driving cases per second.},

Therefore, automatic analysis of panoramic dental images is desired. We have previously proposed a teeth recognition method based on Faster R-CNN and an optimization approach that performed a 94.2\% accuracy. However, it shows a relatively low accuracy in panoramic images with prostheses. This paper proposed a new method to improve the accuracy by detecting prostheses separately. It first detects four types of prosthetic teeth using YOLOv5. Then, it recognizes the teeth and the prosthetic teeth simultaneously based on the proposed optimization approach using a prior knowledge model. The proposed method achieved a maximum recognition accuracy of 97.17\%. It shows the usefulness of optimization using prior knowledge models in combination with prosthetic tooth detection.},

  abstract  = {Currently VANETs still face many serious security issues. One of which is attacks from worms. To prevent the propagation of worms, different immune strategies have been proposed. One problem with these strategies is that they adopt a greedy strategy or random strategy to select immune nodes. These strategies do not consider the dynamic changes of the network topology caused by vehicle movement, which means that the strategies cannot effectively prevent a worm from spreading. In this paper, we propose a dynamic immune strategy. Considering the dynamic changes of VANETs, we use machine learning methods to predict vehicle positions at the next moment and combine the position information of vehicles at different times to evaluate the influence of a vehicle. We provide a method for computing the influence of vehicles. The vehicles with a large influence are selected as immune nodes. We compare the proposed immune strategy with several typical strategies, preemptive immunization, interactive immunization, blacklist isolation and degree immunization. The results show that the proposed method can prevent the spread of worms more effectively than existing techniques.},

In transfer learning, using a large amount of data for pre-training is beneficial to improve the robustness of the model. Data differ significantly when the domain changes in Sensor-Based human activity recognition (HAR). Currently, in HAR, data usage is relatively independent, lacking source domains with massive data and rich labels. This paper proposes a new pre-training method using multiple domain datasets to construct a domain-robust pre-training model. We divide the pre-training dataset into basic and complex activities scenarios by considering the difference in activity classification. We evaluate the classification scenarios that are most beneficial for sensor-based HAR based on the constituted dataset and using deep convolutional networks. We show that our method verified the influence of the source domain on transfer learning in sensor-based HAR. By constructing a sizeable correlated source domain, our method can enhance the generalization ability of the network model. This paper also demonstrated that large-scale and basic activity classification datasets can be better used as pre-training models to participate in HAR classification tasks.},

However, the simply compressed model is often vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to a conflict between robustness and efficiency, especially for IoT devices exposed to complex real-world scenarios. We, for the first time, address this problem by developing a novel framework dubbed Magical-Decomposition to simultaneously enhance both robustness and efficiency for hardware. By leveraging a hardware-friendly model compression method called singular value decomposition, the defending algorithm can be supported by most of the existing DNN hardware accelerators. To step further, by using a recently developed DNN interpretation tool, the underlying scheme of how the adversarial accuracy can be increased in the compressed model is highlighted clearly. Ablation studies and extensive experiments under various attacks/models/datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework.},

The model was learned by using temperature characteristics measured by biological phantoms composed by agar. Errors of the model’s prediction accuracies for the phantoms were around 0.45 degree at the largest point. We measured the temperature characteristics of the pork-based phantom as a material similar to human tissue and used the model to make predictions.

As an important part of stock data, the adjusted closing price often reflects the attention of market funds to a stock, helping predict the market movement of the next trading day, especially for short-term investors. With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the machine learning algorithms are widely applied to predict stock trends. However, the noisy, nonlinear, and chaotic nature of stock price changes makes the prediction not accurate enough. Hence, we proposed a hybrid prediction model combining improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the adjusted closing price of the stock. In this paper, nonlinear methods are presented to optimize the velocity inertia weight and learning factors of traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO). Meanwhile, IPSO is used to optimize the hyperparameters of LSTM neural network to improve its prediction accuracy. The experiments proved that the proposed IPSO-LSTM outperformed the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), LSTM, and PSO-LSTM on the prediction of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Furthermore, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJI) and Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) were chosen to verify the accuracy and robustness of the model we put forward.},

It is observed that when engineers design circuits, they usually mark important nets by annotation, called net attributes. This paper proposes a PCB netlist partition approach based on net attributes. Our partition approach takes the netlist as input, and module partition set as output. Firstly, the modules are pre-partitioned using net attributes. Further, the special patterns in circuits are discovered, and the scattered resistors, capacitors and other components caused by pre-partitioning according to net attributes would be allocated to initial modules by classifying and module matching rules. Our method is evaluated on 11 PCB netlists, and experimental results show that our proposed netlist partition approach outperforms the state of the arts, which can achieve 80\%–96\% partition accuracy.},

Effective pork price forecasting contributes to social stability and unity, not only to ensure farmers’ income, but also to ensure the relation between supply and demand. This paper synthesizes various indicators related to pork prices in the Chinese pork market, and respectively establishes XGboost, SVM and Random Forest models to make preliminary upward and downward forecasts for the samples. The best forecasting results are used to add price forecasting features, and then the LSTM model optimized by the attention mechanism is used to forecast specific prices.

Traditional stock forecasting models are based on statistical regression models, which are difficult to characterize the influential relationships between multiple variables and predict stock price trends with large errors. In recent years, with the development of neural networks, neural networks have become a common method for stock forecasting, which include Back Propagation (BP) neural network, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. However, most of the previous stock price prediction models only use the basic stock market data, ignoring the influence of stock market investor sentiment on stock prices. A new stock price prediction model is proposed to address the above problems. First, the investor sentiment before the stock opening is calculated by fine-tuning the BERT model, then the calculated investor sentiment and the basic stock quotation data are aggregated, and finally the LSTM model is used to predict the closing price of the next stock trading day. We validate the effectiveness of the model on a real dataset of three Chinese listed companies.},

  abstract  = {The traffic menace in India’s metropolitan cities causes many travelers to suffer daily. In traffic control, simple and old forms of signal controllers, known as electro-mechanical signal controllers, are used till-date which use dial timers that have fixed, signalized intersection time plans. As the time is fixed, the people in the lane with the greatest number of vehicles must wait the most, leading to wastage of time, money, and natural resources such as petrol and diesel. The proposed system is a traffic light system with feedback in real-time. The vehicles present in a specific lane are detected using a camera and then the deep learning algorithm, YOLO (You Only Look Once) detects the total number of vehicles in a lane which is used for feedback control of the lights. The traffic lights controller changes its parameters in response to traffic length in a lane, optimizing the road use and the signal timing of an intersection will benefit from being adapted to the dominant flows changing over the time of the day. The experiment analysis reveals that response time for green light in real-time increases in the lane with a greater number of vehicles and is decreased for the lane with lesser number of vehicles keeping the total time the same, so effective in managing traffic.},
