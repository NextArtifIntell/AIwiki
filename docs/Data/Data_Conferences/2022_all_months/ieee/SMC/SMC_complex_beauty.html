  abstract  = {Product reviews are more and more important for potential customers to decide on their purchases in electronic commerce nowadays. The helpful vote is a critical indicator of how much impact the review has on other customers. Therefore, the prediction of helpful votes is an essential task. Linear and Tobit Regression are general methods of the prediction. Those methods share the same objective function and come from the initial assumption that the helpful votes on any dataset follow a normal distribution. However, the assumption is not usually confirmed, and the distribution of the helpful votes often follows other distributions. Consequently, the prediction results might not be fully appropriate. This paper proposes a model that follows the best approximate distribution of helpful votes to predict the number of helpful votes. On top of that, considering the elapsed time since reviews were written, we propose an adaptive window size sampling method to evaluate the model on review datasets sorted chronologically. To validate the proposed model, we conducted extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed model.},

  abstract  = {Session-based recommendations already play an important role in platforms such as e-commerce and streaming media, which are designed to predict the next interaction item based on a given session. Most of the current recommendation models only use the interaction sequence of the session to capture the potential conversion patterns between items, often ignore the user’s multi-type interaction behavior that reflects the user’s fine-grained preferences. At present, most models of multi-type interaction behaviors only learn user-item multi-type interaction behaviors and item-item dependencies relatively independently, and ignore the problems of item cold start and data sparsity. These issues motivate us to propose a new model MKGTN in this paper, we apply multi-type user-item interaction behaviors and item-item dependencies to session recommendation via MLP. Simultaneously, using a multi-task learning MLT paradigm involving learning knowledge embeddings as an auxiliary task to facilitate the main task of SR. Evaluations on three datasets show that MKGTN outperforms state-of-the-art multi-action interaction models, demonstrating the superiority of our model’s performance.},

  abstract  = {Recent years, people have been gradually influenced by online socialization. The emergence and development of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has shown great advantages in mining implicit data and expressing node relationships, etc. However, due to the arbitrary nature of establishing neighborly relationships, the judging reliability of trusting relationships between neighbors is a difficult issue. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative approach to obtain the valid neighbor relationships based on real user-item interactions and friend trust relationships in the dataset. The proposed method can address the impact of invalid neighbors on the social model and achieve the effect of enhancing neighbor perception. For neighbor interaction in the graph neural network model, this paper establishes the direct connection between users and items through mapping of multilayer perceptron firstly. Then it integrates neighbor similarity and neighbor sampling to mitigate the interference information of invalid neighbors and achieves the effect of enhancing the perceived information of neighbor interaction. Finally, this paper establishes the item social space and user social space with enhanced neighbor perception according to the dyadic nature and organically integrated them to enrich the social data. Comparison experiments are carried out based on two publicly available datasets Epinions and Ciao, the recommended method performs better than other social recommendation models with the MAE and RMSE values being improved by 0.81\%-1.09\% and 1.15\%-1.41\% respectively.},

  abstract  = {Recommendations in the educational environment aim to help learner access their personalized demands efficiently. Unlike commodity recommendation, limited to the ethics of pedagogy and the high cost of bad recommendations, the credibility and interpretability of the education recommendation system are more worthy of attention to achieve recommendation accuracy. However, few studies focused on the interpretability of recommendations. Thus, this study proposes an Open Recommendation framework for Interpretability based on the Bayesian principal component analysis (PPCA), ORec4Int. ORec4Int helps learners understand the recommendation by building a mapping between educational resources and the latent factors/features of learners. The interpretability will enhance his/her trust in the education recommendation system. Finally, We not only evaluate the recommendation performance of ORec4Int based on one real-world dataset but also compared its performance in interpretability and the education expert solution. Results show that ORec4Int can approach the performance of education expert solutions. Ultimately, ORec4Int is faster, more efficient, and less costly.},

  abstract  = {For companies to have a competitive advantage, they need to extract relevant information from data and for that, they need to complement their own data with other data sources. Data marketplaces are platforms on which data providers and data consumers do business. However, every data interaction incurs a monetary cost. Therefore, data consumers are interested in buying a set of interesting views that fit their (goal and) budget. Views allow data to be represented visually, enabling users to make sense of patterns and insights. Besides allowing for easier cost control, buying a set of views bundled together increases the chance of finding what consumers want over buying them view-by-view. Selecting the suitable views to compose an interesting bundle is non-trivial, due to the vast number of view combinations that potentially meet the data consumer’s needs. In this paper, we address the problem of view bundle recommendation in data marketplaces, in which the utility of a bundle depends on the interplay among candidate views. We propose the use of Self-Organizing Maps as a means to compute this interplay and use a Genetic Algorithm to design near-optimal bundles. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach can effectively aid data consumers to find relevant view bundles under budget constraints.},

  abstract  = {Recent literature suggests that self-regulation techniques like biofeedback can be used to enhance the embodiment of artificial limbs. In this study, we developed and preliminarily tested an embodiment training protocol based on a Spatial Augmented Respiratory Cardiofeedback (SARC) implemented through a computer screen - visualizing a 3D model of a prosthetic hand (Hannes) - and a thoracic band for monitoring the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) of the users. The feedback was based on the respiratory-driven modulation of a composite index of the individuals’ cardiac autonomic state after an initial calibration based on slow breathing (at a rate perceived as “comfortable”). Alongside the assessment of the SARC use feasibility, this pilot study evaluates the virtual hand embodiment obtained in two task conditions. In both conditions, the virtual limb gradually appears when the cardiofeedback exercise is performed correctly. Otherwise, the virtual limb parts gradually disappear (“unstable” condition) or they remain visible (cumulative” condition). In the latter case, the virtual hand maintains its “reality-based” stability, supporting the subject’s motivation. Ten volunteers without disabilities were presented both conditions on 10 trials each (2min per trial). Their experience and their proprioceptive drift (estimating their real hand position as close to the artificial one) were assessed as measures of virtual prosthesis embodiment. The questionnaire results preliminarily highlight the feasibility of the SARC. Furthermore, a significantly stronger drift for the virtual prosthesis occurred in the cumulative condition, orienting further investigations.},

A within-subject experiment (n=18) was conducted, in which all participants played three VR games and responded to the post-game questionnaire. Through video recordings of the front and right side of them, 3D skeleton modeling was reconstructed by using OpenPose and the conversion relationship between the four coordinate systems under computer vision. After the results of operations such as skeleton standardization and motion segmentation, clustering algorithms are used to cluster similar users, and Spearman’s Rank Correlation Coefficient is used to study the influence of user characteristics on motion arc. Our results indicated that in an unconstrained game, the tutorial makes the motion arc increase, while in a constrained game, the change of motion arc is more complex. It is also found that the participants’ instructions learning has the greatest impact on the average motion arc, followed by individual factors (including age gender, etc.) and sports experience.},

  abstract  = {Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a higher cognitive dysfunction that can occur after a stroke. It is defined as an impairment in finding, reporting, reacting to, and directing to stimuli presented opposite to the damaged side of the brain. So far, we have developed an immersive virtual reality system that releases the attention biased to the non-neglected side and guides it to the neglected side to improve the symptoms of neglect. However, it improved neglect symptoms evaluated using a paper-and-pencil test on a desk (i.e., Behavioral Inattention Test), and it did not improve neglect in daily life evaluated using a standardized evaluation tool [i.e., Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS)], which is a rating index of neglect in actual daily life. Therefore, establishing a method for improving neglect in daily life is necessary. This study was designed to develop a platform for improving neglect in daily life as an initial investigation of rehabilitation methods for patients with USN. To improve neglect, the following three elements were derived from previous studies that should be included in rehabilitation: object search by moving around, reproduction of the complexity of daily life, and own body movement in the neglected side with visual confirmation. The patient moves around the room and visually explores and touches the objects presented in the mixed reality (MR) space. Using this system, we conducted a validity test on a patient with USN. The results showed that the patient improved from moderate to mild neglect in the CBS. Thus, the applicability of proposed MR system was suggested in terms of improving neglect in patients with USN in daily life environment.},

  abstract  = {Before fully autonomous driving technology is developed, drivers are not free from the responsibility of Take-Over Request (TOR). Even with level 5 automation, a driver still can play a role as a final decision maker for various driving and non-driving functions, even though most of the tasks will be conducted by the vehicle. In this regard, the performance of the driver’s reaction to the request from the car is crucial in autonomous driving throughout and it is highly dependent on the driver’s attention. It is important to understand the state of the driver during autonomous driving and utilize this information in the driver-vehicle interaction system to enhance safety. Accordingly, it is important to extract features from information about the driver and the surrounding environment in order to increase the accuracy of the model that predicts the driver’s state. This paper aims to examine a method of predicting an attentional status based on the driver’s emotional state and explore the possibility of applying brain-computer interaction (BCI) with consideration of the driver’s type to increase accuracy. As a result, the prediction model for attentional state with emotional information was developed, and the driver’s characteristics and types were investigated. Based on the results, a driver-vehicle interaction system was proposed for the context of the autonomous vehicle in the future. Although the prediction model for attentional status was not powerful, it can be developed by considering more critical features such as driver’s characteristics and types. In addition, it can be used as a constraint for effective interaction when a driver uses the BCI system to deliver his/her decision to a vehicle.},

Team emergent states such as situational awareness, trust, emotions and mutual understanding influence the attributes of teams. This study examines the relationship between PC and collaboration. It also investigates how the cognitive state influences this relationship. Seventeen teams, each with three members, participated in a collaborative simulated task, while their electrocardiogram (ECG) activity was recorded via a chest strap device. Short-term time-domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) were derived for each participant. PC was established using the mean of the cross-correlation (CC) between dyads within a team. A linear regression model was employed to examine the relationship between PC and self-reported measures of team collaboration. This in turn will be applied to investigate how cognitive state between team members influences that relationship. The results have shown a statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) positive relationship between PC and collaboration. In conclusion, PC has the potential to be an objective method to quantity teamwork effectiveness where it can be assessed via self-reported collaboration.},

  abstract  = {Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) is an ensemble of manned and unmanned vehicles operating as a team to achieve the same set of goals. Such teaming is highly beneficial, notably in overcoming the limits of direct communication link to the unmanned vehicles, as well as in enhancing capabilities of a manned vehicle by leveraging multiple accompanying unmanned vehicles. However, this can in times overstrain the command and control capacity of the human operator(s) on board of the manned vehicle(s), unless if the unmanned vehicles possess some “understanding” of the human operators’ decision-making behaviors, in which case, they can act like real “team players” to proactively support the manned vehicle, instead of waiting passively for successive commands. In this study, we investigate the possibility of learning decision-making behaviors of a human operator on board of a manned vehicle in charge of commanding multiple accompanying unmanned vehicles. We base our investigation on a rescue mission involving a manned helicopter and several unmanned aerial vehicles to collect training and validation data using software-in-the-loop simulations. By extracting meaningful features and by performing a clustering on the features on the training dataset, we validate and analyze the learned pattern of commanding the unmanned vehicles.},

  abstract  = {Traffic flow prediction (TFP) is of great significance in the field of traffic congestion mitigation on the Internet of Vehicle(Iov). To be capable of a trade-off between data privacy protection and accurate prediction, we introduce a training paradigm based on Federated Learning (FL). However, the implementation of federal learning in practice is confronted with high communication and data heterogeneity. In this paper, Principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced to minimize the scale of data transmission on both the client and server. Due to the errors arising from the compression and reversion of the transmission model, we add an additional error term in the local objective function. To address the imbalanced data distribution and to accelerate the federal learning convergence, we then propose a mechanism that incorporates Bayesian optimization to dynamically determine the weights of clients during aggregation. With extensive experiments on real data, it can be demonstrated that communication costs can be minimized by 60-70\% while ensuring fewer errors.},

  abstract  = {Advances in utilisng motion simulators for skill training and related applications have yielded numerous benefits, such as safety, availability, and serviceability, environmentally friendly, and economically beneficial. To give simulator users a sense of realistic feeling of driving, an accurate motion cueing algorithm (MCA) is essential, in order to respect the simulator platform limitation and avoid motion sickness. The use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in MCA designs leads to respecting the constraints and considering the future dynamic behaviors of the simulator. However, the tuning process of the MPC prediction horizon and control horizon still need to be improved. These horizons are normally selected manually by the designer. Previous studies on meta-heuristic algorithms produce a large prediction horizon with a heavy computational load or a small prediction horizon that sacrifices the stability and accuracy of the simulator system. In this study, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is adopted to yield optimal prediction and control horizons in MPC-based MCA models. The results are compared with those from the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in terms of sensation error and computation time. The GOA technique depicts the fastest process time to promptly detect proper MPC horizons. It does not affect the simulator&#39;s efficiency in utilising the workspace, as evidenced by the correlation coefficient and root mean square error between sensation from a real-world vehicle and the simulator.},

However, due to the high degree of randomness and the complex contextual factors, it remains a difficult challenge. While several works based on machine learning and deep neural network have been proposed in recent years to address these challenges, most of them mine sequence features based on discrete points and overlook the fact that shape similarity plays an important role in inferring the future values. In this paper, we propose a seq2seq model with Shape Attention and Dilated Convolution (SADC) to tackle this problem. SADC contains two important phases: (1) Embedding with multi-scale dilated convolution. We first define the shape as a set of discrete points in a fixed-length window. The features hidden in the shape are then learned using multiple dilated convolutions with different kernels. (2) Inferring with shape attention. During this phase, we first present the shape attention, which aims to provide support information for inferring future values by generating the embedding vector of each prediction window based on shape similarity. The PreNet network is then built to predict the values using the embedding vector for each prediction window. The experimental results conducted on two datasets show that the performance of SADC model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on time series forecasting.},

  abstract  = {Time series classification is a challenging research area where machine learning techniques such as deep learning perform well, yet lack interpretability. Identifying the most important features for such classifiers provides a pathway to improving their interpretability. Several Feature Importance (FI) identification methods remove the contributions of features, i.e. observations at certain time steps of, from the input and evaluate the change in the classification result to measure the importance of features. As time series features cannot simply be deleted, current techniques generally rely on replacing features with constant or random values. While effective, this approach risks unexpected results in the classification and thus feature importance estimation-as the replacements used may be different to what the classifier encountered in the training phase. This is referred to as the Out-Of-Distribution problem. The OOD problem has been recognised in image and language models but have not received much attention in the context of time series classification. This work addresses the OOD problem in FI identification for time series classifiers. Specifically, we propose a method based on Conditional Variational Autoencoder to generate possible sets of within-distribution inputs, which are used to evaluate feature importance through marginalisation. Experiments on publicly accessible datasets are carried out showing that the method identifies the most important features with higher accuracy than existing methods, providing the basis for improved explainability of time series classifiers.},

In the case of the classification task, this phenomenon destabilizes the model’s performance and negatively affects the achieved prediction quality. Most current methods apply statistical learning and similarity analysis over the raw data. However, similarity analysis in streaming data remains a complex problem due to time limitation, non-precise values, fast decision speed, scalability, etc. This article introduces a novel method for monitoring changes in the probabilistic distribution of multi-dimensional data streams. As a measure of the rapidity of changes, we analyze the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence. During the experimental study, we show how to use this metric to predict the concept drift occurrence and understand its nature. The obtained results encourage further work on the proposed methods and its application in the real tasks where the prediction of the future appearance of concept drift plays a crucial role, such as predictive maintenance.},

A model competently tackle Video Q&amp;A task that needs to be able to: 1) construct long-term and neighborhood dependencies in frame sequences to extract global and local contextual features that can reflect multi-scale temporal dependencies, and deduce the temporal-aware refined features, and 2) identify static and dynamic features from pertinent moments of a video, while filtering away question-irrelated dependencies of feature sequences, to yield the most precise and reasonable temporal-aware overall contextual features.

Bidirectional complementary attention module stacks multi-head self-attention layer and convolutional layer in different orders to designed two kinds of attention units, which is able to make bidirectional multi-step reasoning based on complete global information and accurate local information to obtain temporal-aware refined features. Adaptive temporal-aware module is used to filter away question-irrelated dependencies in the feature sequence to yield the most precise and reasonable temporal-aware overall contextual features.

Furthermore, there exists occlusion and motion blur that inevitably lead to poor estimation performance. To address these problems, we propose a method that leverages an attention mask for occluded joints and encodes temporal dependency between frames using transformers. First, our framework composes different combinations of sparsely annotated frames that denote the track of the overall joint movement. We propose an occlusion attention mask from these combinations that enable encoding occlusion-aware heatmaps as a semi-supervised task. Second, the proposed temporal encoder employs transformer architecture to effectively aggregate the temporal relationship and keypoint-wise attention from each time step and accurately refines the target frame’s final pose estimation. We achieve state-of-the-art pose estimation results for PoseTrack2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets and demonstrate the robustness of our approach to occlusion and motion blur in sparsely annotated video data.},

  abstract  = {The recently emerging event camera has grown into a new type of sensor in the realm of vision, with benefits such as low power consumption, high dynamic range (HDR), microsecond time resolution, and no motion blur. While event cameras offer numerous advantages over conventional cameras, they only capture changes in intensity and give up lots of environmental details. This paper proposes an end-to-end UNet network called SCSE-E2VID to synthesize gray images from asynchronous events. We design an event fusion block to feed more related events to the encoder, allowing the network to extract more valuable features. The famous attention module called Spatial and Channel ‘Squeeze &amp; Excitation’ Block (SCSE) is utilized to remove artifacts and better extract spatiotemporal features for the decoder. Besides, we add parallel convolutions in the upsampling block and refine the output features, which supplement content in reduced channels. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed SCSE-E2VID, we implement quantitative and qualitative comparisons based on the public IJRR and HQF datasets. The results show that our method achieves better performance in terms of perceptual similarity and structural similarity when compared with state-of-art methods and demonstrates comparable performance in terms of squared error.},

  abstract  = {The Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) task aims to retrieval pedestrian images with the same labels across different modalities. VI-ReID is a very challenging task due to the huge intra-modality variation and cross-modality gap. Existing methods are mainly based on the feature alignment to mitigate the modality’s gap, however, using only feature-level constraints does not mitigate cross-modality gap well. We propose a fusional modality and distribution alignment learning network (FMADALNet) to mitigate modality’s gap and align modality’s distribution to learn modality-shared feature representations. FMADALNet contains a lightweight fusional modality generation module (FMGM). FMGM constructs a fusional modality that incorporates heterogeneous image features and contains only modality-shared information to mitigate modality gap at the pixel-level. In addition, to mitigate the differences in the distribution of the different modalities, we design a Hetero-center Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss (HcMMD), which reduces the differences in the distribution of the different modalities in a displaying manner. Extensive experimental results on two public datasets show that our proposed method achieves impressive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {An effective task offloading strategy in the mobile edge computing enables terminals to migrate their tasks to the edge server, accelerating the execution of terminal tasks. However, most researches on task offloading are limited to the single edge server, while in practice, it is difficult for a single edge server to support joint offloading requests from multiple terminals. Edge gateways can be flexibly deployed around terminal devices to further reduce the computing load of edge servers. Therefore, we jointly study the task offloading problem in the multi-gateway-assisted mobile edge computing scenario. Constrained by discrete environmental variables, the offloading process jointly optimizes user scheduling, task offloading rate, and gateway resource allocation, with evaluation indexes defined by the average task delay and energy consumption. Aiming at minimizing the long-term cost of the whole system, we design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with dynamically adjusted offloading strategies and allocated resources with only the partial state information. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can obtain the optimal computation offloading policy in an uncontrollable dynamic environment. Compared with the other four benchmark algorithms, it has better system cost performance, and can quickly converge to the optimum. Meanwhile, In order to ensure the relative load balance on multiple gateways, we design a low-complexity balanced offloading strategy among multiple gateways and verify its performance.},

In a 1, 929 older cohort from Southern Italy, the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and clinical data were collected with blood tests. A NN was built with a hyperparameter tuning technique using accuracy as a performance parameter to select the best model. Confusion matrices, Garson and Olden’s variable importance were evaluated. Older age, female gender, high BMI, and high blood pressure were associated with physical frailty. In frail subjects, the lipid profile and RBC levels were significantly lower than their counterpart. On the contrary, serum levels of interleukin-6 and CRP were higher in the frail group. Frail subjects show higher consumption of spaghetti soup, pecorino cheese, fennel and chocolate, while a lower consumption of ham. The NN model has a respective training and testing accuracy of 86.49\% and 85.77\%. NN performs well on the train. The test dataset makes few mistakes and can predict healthy subjects with high specificity. According to Garson’s method, age, gender, foods rich in fats, and smoking habits are essential in predicting the frailty condition. In contrast, Olden’s method underlined the higher consumption of legumes and unrefined cereals.},

  abstract  = {In cognitive radio systems, there are cases where malicious users transmit interference power to prevent secondary users from transmitting information. Due to the destructive behavior of malicious users, spectrum utilization efficiency will be reduced. The applications of game theory to study this confrontation relationship are reasonable. Based on the Continuous Blotto Game (CBG) model under the condition of one-shot perfect information confrontation, this paper constructs an anti-jamming game model for power allocation confrontation between secondary users and malicious users, and simulates the competition between two players under fixed resource constraints. An evolutionary learning approach is proposed, which improves the performance of the power allocation strategy through the repeated game of two players, and can obtain the same effect as the Nash equilibrium strategy under certain conditions. Our approach realizes the optimal power allocation on the information transmission channel in interference countermeasures without knowing the power allocation strategy of malicious users, thereby realizing the optimal utilization of spectrum resources. The simulation results show that, compared with the greedy algorithm and random algorithm, our algorithm has a more obvious effect on improving the spectrum utilization of secondary users.},

How to manage conflict in data fusion is still an open issue in D-S evidence theory. In this paper, a new correlation belief function is proposed to modify the basic belief assignment before combination in closed-world. The method transfers the belief from a certain proposition to another related proposition to avoid the loss of information when data are fused, which effectively solves the problem of conflict management in D-S evidence theory. The advantage of the proposed method is that it does not lose belief value in main propositions related to decision-making and also expresses the conflict information effectively. Several numerical examples and experiments with real data sets from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository are adopted to verify the rationality and validity of the proposed method.},

Scheduling of parallel applications with data dependencies in heterogeneous systems is an NP-complete problem. Using replication to improve system reliability can lead to increased application execution time. From the perspective of increasing the reliability of real-time heterogeneous system considering communication overhead and the timing requirements, this paper proposed a fault-tolerant scheduling algorithm based on local maximum reliability replication strategy (FTSA-BLMR). Our algorithm first sets the maximum number of replications for each task. Then it continuously replicates the task with the highest system reliability for the current task set to obtain a new task set. The tasks in the new task set will be scheduled and the scheduling results will be recorded. Finally, the scheduling result will be selected as the final scheduling sequence, which has maximum system reliability and meets the deadline. The experimental results indicate that our algorithm can improve the system reliability by 40\% compared with DB-FTSA when the deadline constraint is strict.},

However, for a framework to function as a decision-making system, unless a clear definition of the task of placing information out of an infinite world exists, logical consistency cannot be ensured, and thus, the function may be incomputable. The introduction of paraconsistent four-valued logic can prevent incorrect state setting and analysis with insufficient information and provide logical validity to analytical methods that vary the analysis resolution depending on the degree of coarseness of the available information.

We aim to make the network compatible with LNs of different sizes to improve the overall performance of the network. First, the network extracts image features from multiscale input data. Then, we use an attention-based fusion module to study the relationship between features at different scales and adaptively fuse image features. Furthermore, a feature consistency loss is proposed by us to enhance the similarity between image features at different scales.

To address this issue, we present a heterogeneous population graph convolutional network with hierarchical attention mechanisms, including intra-level and inter-level attention. Specifically, the intra-level attention layer is aimed at learning differences and similarities between the sexes, while the inter-level attention layer is responsible for information integration by assigning weights to different features. The objective is to obtain node embeddings describing individual characteristics completely and provide discriminative inputs to classifiers.

  abstract  = {The clinical diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) mainly relies on behavioral scales. However, patients with DOC often have severe dyskinesia, which may lead to misdiagnosis of patients in the minimally conscious state (MCS) as patients in vegetative state (VS). In this paper, we propose an emotion-induced paradigm based on audio-visual stimulation, which can collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for consciousness detection without performing behavioral expression tasks. This paradigm exposes patients to emotional videos and stimulates them through video clips, which is more comfortable than event-related potential (ERP), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and other paradigms. It effectively reduces the mental burden required by the patients. In terms of algorithms, a graph isomorphic network (GIN) is adopted to automatically classify VS and MCS, using emotional EEG signals from patients with DOC. The accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity of our method are 93.70\%, 93.77\%, 89.44\%, and 95.21\%, respectively. Compared with the existing consciousness detection methods, our method has superior performance in consciousness detection for patients with DOC. The experimental results show that our method is feasible in distinguishing MCS and VS, and it is an effective extension of consciousness level detection in patients with DOC.},

  abstract  = {There is a growing need for sparse representational formats of human affective states that can be utilized in scenarios with limited computational memory resources. We explore whether representing neural data, in response to emotional stimuli, in a latent vector space can serve to both predict emotional states as well as generate synthetic EEG data that are participant-and/or emotion-specific. We propose a conditional variational autoencoder based framework, EEG2Vec, to learn generative-discriminative representations from EEG data. Experimental results on affective EEG recording datasets demonstrate that our model is suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, classification of three distinct emotion categories (positive, neutral, negative) based on the latent representation achieves a robust performance of 68.49\%, and generated synthetic EEG sequences resemble real EEG data inputs to particularly reconstruct low-frequency signal components. Our work advances areas where affective EEG representations can be useful in e.g., generating artificial (labeled) training data or alleviating manual feature extraction, and provide efficiency for memory constrained edge computing applications.},

  abstract  = {The considerable potential of gamma cameras in Nuclear Medicine Imaging has sparked attention. They facilitate early cancer screening and several investigations. By leveraging recent advances in high-energy astrophysics, focusing X-ray and gamma-ray optics enables us to break the paradigm of low resolution and demonstrate a methodology for imaging small organisms with high resolution. This work aims to develop a method for imaging small animals with gamma rays that does not require parallel collimators nor pinholes and conducts a first of its kind Monte Carlo analysis of its aspects. In the present work, we introduce and elaborate upon our efforts to develop a high-resolution SPECT system augmented with a Laue lens [1] for small-animal/organ imaging and tumour detection. We examine the performance parameters of a Multi Lens-Based SPECT system equipped with modular partially curved detectors and Laue lens arrays. The Laue lenses and their detectors are placed in tilted planes in a modular fashion such that their fields of view converge. A tracking Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was used in the SPECT gamma camera environment to determine the distribution of diffracted high energy photons. The developed environment compensates for potential absorption and attenuation events by incorporating physical interactions. We explore the resolution and possibilities that the proposed device can offer to obtain real-time images of tumours in the sub-millimetre range. For this purpose, we have simulated a phantom sphere of 0.03 mm radius with a total activity of 0.1 mCi. The simulation results demonstrated the modular SPECT’s capacity to discriminate between two adjacent volumes as small as 0.00013 cc placed at 0.1 mm offsets from centre to centre, which is significantly better than any existing SPECT or PET system. In terms of system resolution and sensitivity, the resulting performance factors are correlated to those of the previously proposed single lens-based SPECT [1] and the conventional LEHR SPECT. The modular Lens-Based SPECT has shown a superior resolution in the submillimeter range and a comparable sensitivity compared to existing LEHR. Moreover, the sensitivity was boosted with the modified geometry compared to the single lens-based SPECT and to LEHR with three hits detected per 42 source photons, corresponding to a sensitivity of 81 cps/MBq. The system&#39;s novelty relies on the ability to view the data from every lens separately to capture a specific view of the object, or it can be integrated to generate a three-dimensional image from the three modules, including exact information about the object&#39;s size and location.},

However, due to the similar characteristics of nematodes in different age groups, the general method is difficult to estimate accurately. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a method of label distribution learning, and uses fluorescence microscopy images to estimate the age of C. elegans. First, the logical age label are mapped to the label distribution. Secondly, the distribution learning loss function is used to make the neural network learn the relationship between the label distribution and corresponding image. Finally, the distribution learning loss function and the classification loss function are combined to strengthen the learning of the neural network. Experiments show that the accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE) of the method in this paper are improved compared with the baseline. In the experiment of estimating the age on different parts’ data set, it was also concluded that the fluorescent image of the torso of C. elegans can better reflect the age characteristics than the head and tail.},

  abstract  = {Raindrop removal for in-vehicle camera images is useful for surveillance and analysis system such as intelligent driving or case diagnosis. As in rainy days, images taken by in-vehicle cameras such as monitor or drive recorder often suffer from noticeable image degradation, and make it difficult to identify the objects on the road. With the uncertainty of raindrop distribution and the complexity of raindrop status, the attached raindrops of in-vehicle camera images can have different effects. And the large-diameter raindrop will greatly reduce the image quality. However, most of the popular deraining algorithms have been successful in recovering images with small raindrop noise and tiny image distortion, but fails to restore those with raindrops covering large areas. We propose a single image raindrop removal network based on Generative Adversarial Network for in-vehicle camera images. We incorporate two overlapping attention layers into the deraining network, which adopt task-driven visual attention and content perception mechanism. The former obtains features by recursive neural network to guide network more interested in the raindrop regions and the surrounding structures, while the content perception schema extracts the features far from raindrops. Moreover, we collect a new benchmark for In-Vehicle Camera Image Deraining (IVCRID), it chooses in-vehicle camera images from various deraining dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed deraining network outperforms other state-of-the-art raindrop removal methods in image recovering test on the IVCRID dataset and also has the best performance on the experiments of traffic objects detection.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) is a new imaging technique that uses microbubbles (MBs) to improve the spatial resolution of ultrasound (US) imaging. For ULM, it is critical to accurately localize MB position. Recently, deep learning-based methods are adopted to acquire MB localization, which shows promising performance and efficient computation. However, detection of high-concentration MBs is still a challenging task. To further improve the localization accuracy, a dual generative adversarial network (DualGAN)-based ULM imaging method (DualGAN-ULM) is proposed in this paper to overcome the problems of long data processing time and low parameter robustness in current ULM imaging methods. This method is trained using simulated data generated by point spread function (PSF) convolution and uses dual generation adversarial strategy to enable the generator to perform accurate localization under high-concentration MB conditions. Meanwhile, the localization and reconstruction capabilities of five ULM methods, namely Centroid, CS-ULM, mUNET-ULM, mSPCN-ULM and DualGAN-ULM, are evaluated in this paper. The experimental results reveal that DL-based ULM methods (DualGAN-ULM, mSPCN-ULM, and mUNET-ULM) outperform compressed sensing-based localization methods (CS-ULM) and Centroid in terms of localization accuracy and localization dependability. DualGAN-ULM performs better than mSPCN-ULM and mUNET-ULM, making it a more realistic ULM method.},

Compared with the task of detecting salient object in well-light images, the detection of salient object in low-light scenes requires not only acquiring the spatial visual saliency of images under low light conditions, but also accurately identifying the multi-scale objects of interest. Mountain Basin Network (MBNet) is proposed for salient object detection to discriminate the pixel-level saliency of low-light images. To further refine the object localization and pixel classification performance, the proposed model integrates a high-low feature aggregation module (HLFA) to synergize the information from a high level branch (named Bal-Net) and a low level branch (named Mol-Net) to fuse the global and local context, and the hierarchical supervision modules (HSM) is embedded to assist in obtaining accurate salient objects, especially the small ones. Furthermore, multi-supervised integration strategy is leveraged to optimize the structure and boundaries of salient objects. Meanwhile, to facilitate further research and evaluation of the visual saliency models, we construct a new low-light dataset, which includes 13 categories with a total of 1000 low-light images. The experimental results show that the proposed model has state-of-the-art low-light saliency detection performance compared with seven existing methods.},

We propose a knowledge graph representation learning model that integrates ordered relation paths and entity descriptions in response to the above problems. The model can integrate the triple representation in the knowledge graph, the semantic representation of entity description, and the representation of ordered relation paths for training.

However, there are a lot of supervised and semi-supervised datasets, which are already labeled. To fully utilize the label annotations, we propose Unified Momentum Contrast (UniMoCo), which extends MoCo to support arbitrary ratios of labeled data and unlabeled data training. Compared with MoCo, UniMoCo has two modifications as follows: (1) Different from a single positive pair in MoCo, we maintain multiple positive pairs on-the-fly by comparing the query label to a label queue. (2) We propose a Unified Contrastive (UniCon) loss to support an arbitrary number of positives and negatives in a unified pair-wise optimization perspective. Our UniCon is more reasonable and powerful than the supervised contrastive loss in theory and practice. In our experiments, we pre-train multiple UniMoCo models with different ratios of ImageNet labels and evaluate the performance on various downstream tasks. Experiment results show that UniMoCo generalizes well for unsupervised, semi-supervised and fully-supervised visual representation learning. Besides, we surprisingly find that UniMoCo performs best with 60\% ImageNet labels for COCO and VOC transfer learning. The code is available: https://github.com/dddzg/unimoco.},

Indeed, the complementary and heterogeneous information between modalities influences the prediction results. Recent research proposals employ a single neural network to obtain mutually independent representations of all modalities. However, a problem that may limit previous work from reaching a higher level is that this does not consider the modal heterogeneity problem between different modalities. This, in turn, may lead to the presence of additional noise in the representations before modal fusion. For this reason, we propose a new framework, MICS, which adopts a suitable strategy for each modality and provides a better representation for fusion. Also, we design a multimodal comparative learning interaction module for the fusion phase, which plays a crucial role in the information interaction between modalities. Our extensive experiments on two publicly available and popular benchmarks, MOSI and MOSEI, show that MICS can better focus on the characteristics of different modal data and has significant advantages over previous complex baselines.},

  abstract  = {The quality of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction algorithm Structure from Motion (SfM) is affected by the input image’s resolution and CMOS’s noise level. We propose a denoisable Super Resolution (SR) method to improve resolutions while denoising for SfM’s input images taken by a CMOS device, improving its performance on noisy images. The conventional deep learning SR algorithm does not consider denoising during the learning process. This results in the disability of simultaneously reducing noise and improving resolution. In our methods Add Noise before Downsampling (An-Ds) and Downsampling before Adding Noise (Ds-An), instead of expanding the training data, we extract the noise from a real-world noise dataset and selectively add it to low resolution (LR) images of the SR training set. Thus the SR algorithm can simultaneously improve resolution and reduce noise. Moreover, selectively adding noise also remain SR’s performance on clean images. We trained two representative SR algorithms (SRCNN and EDSR) using traditional and our designed methods to process both clean and noisy images. Without changing the SR network’s structure, improvements of 0.17 dB in Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR) by Ds-An and 0.14 dB by An-Ds (approximately 20\% of improvement in three years) were observed in noisy images’ experiments by EDSR. Meantime, there is only a little loss (less than 0.01 dB) on the clean images. The SfM’s results show a better reconstructed 3D model using our methods. Compared to non-preprocessing and conventional preprocessing, key metrics such as Mean Reprojection Error (MRE) reduced 51.9\% and 12.6\%, and 2D key-points matching rate improved 41.7\% and 217\%, respectively.},

  abstract  = {At present, online social networks have become the main platform for people to express their opinions and interact with them, which has a great impact on the evolution of opinions. Therefore, the research on the evolution of opinions in online social networks has become a current hotspot. Opinion dynamics is an important tool to study the evolution law of opinions in the network. In the opinion dynamics model for online social networks, agents often can only interact with others who have links on the network. However, in reality, the interaction of agents’ opinions is not limited to agents with links on the network. Therefore, due to the lack of sufficient interaction, the traditional model cannot reflect the true final state of public opinion evolution. In view of the above situation, we propose a novel cross-link interaction mechanism which enables agents interact opinion with others without the limit of network inks and use machine learning methodology to get the cross-link interaction distance. After that, we introduce the mechanism to the bounded confidence opinion dynamics model. With this mechanism, the interaction of the agent will be more reasonable and more like social behavior. The simulation results show that the proposed model fits the real data better than traditional models and even under a very small bounded confidence value, agents opinions will still be around high-influence agents’ opinions.},

Although the maximum rate of the number of users which are reliably dealt with in the system (identification capacity) and the exponential behavior of the average error probability (error exponents) of the legitimate users have been revealed via information theoretic approaches, optimum error exponents has not been shown when there exists a nonlegitimate user in the system. In this paper, we formally define the reliability function as the optimum error exponent for legitimate users for a given rate of the number of legitimate users and a given error exponent for the nonlegitimate users. It is shown that the reliability function can be completely characterized by the well-known random coding exponent and the hypothesis testing error exponent.},

  abstract  = {To solve the problem of low delivery rate, high network load and high average forwarding delay caused by blind forwarding of messages in mobile social networks considering the selfish attribute of nodes, the optimistic path analysis (OPA) algorithm is proposed. OPA puts forward the concept of encounter intensity based on the historical encounter records and gives its calculation formula. Encounter intensity uses time as an important basis, which can more accurately reflect the possibility of two nodes meeting next time. At the same time, based on the intensity of encounter, the “small world principle” is used to limit the number of hops of routing paths, and finally a set of preferred paths for the message from the source node to the destination node is constructed, which is used as a basis to determine whether the message is forwarded or not. Simulation results show that compared with classic routing algorithms, OPA can effectively increase message delivery rate, reduce network load and forwarding delay.},

  abstract  = {Multiple traveling salesmen problem with visiting constraints (VCMTSP) is a general version of the classical multiple traveling salesmen problem (MTSP), where each city can be only accessed by a number of salesmen. To cope with this new problem, we adapt the genetic algorithm (GA) for MTSP by using a dual-chromosome representation scheme with one chromosome denoting the visiting sequence of cities and the other representing the assignment of cities to salesmen. To further promote the effectiveness of GA in solving VCMTSP, we modify three popular crossover operators, namely the cycle crossover (CX), the order crossover (OX), and the partially mapped crossover (PMX). Similar to the execution for traditional TSP, the three crossover operators are all executed on the city sequence chromosome, while the adaption of them lies in the modification of the salesman assignment in the second chromosome. To this end, a correction mechanism according to the accessibility matrix is conducted to make the generated solutions after crossover feasible. Extensive experiments conducted on totally 16 VCMTSP instances generated from the benchmark TSPLIB set demonstrate that the adapted GA could effectively cope with VCMTSP, and the GA with the modified PMX achieves the best overall performance.},

  abstract  = {We propose a novel approach for solving the Automatic Step-size Adjustment problem in Newtown-Raphson Consensus based distributed optimization algorithms (abbreviated as ASAN). The approach leads the agents in the network to autonomously, continuously and automatically choose their local stepsizes as the distributed optimization process unfolds. In practice, it is based on first evaluating the reliability of the next predicted local optimum by using the information collected at each node as the optimization process is being executed, and then using this reliability assessment to locally adjust the step-size accordingly. By letting each node adjust its own step-size separately by means of local inspection of local variables, the approach does not add communication overheads (a feature that is beneficial especially for systems with limited communication possibilities). Moreover, the strategy does not require information about the current topology of the communication network, nor information about the local cost functions, serving thus situations for which both the network structure and the local cost functions are time-varying. Besides the overall concept, the paper introduces different heuristic reliability evaluation algorithms to analyse the temporal dynamics of the local data, and compares the approach against an oracle-based implementation that selects the best constant step-size for each specific network and set of local costs by means of Monte Carlo analyses. The paper statistically shows that the proposed heuristic leads to convergence rates that are most often better (and in general not worse) than the ones of the oracle-based optimization scheme, without though the need for knowing information about the communication topology or local costs.},

In this paper, we consider the DOPs with the following features. First, decision variables of a problem are naturally distributed in several spatial-distributed edges. Each computing node is responsible for one subproblem, and it can only access its corresponding local data and perform local objective evaluation. Second, some decision variables appear in different groups simultaneously, which are called overlapping variables. Third, the computing nodes can only communicate following a certain network topology. They need to work together to solve the overall problem. Because of its divide-and-conquer nature, cooperative coevolution (CC) has good potential for handling such distributed problems. Therefore, we develop a new distributed CC framework to solve them. First, a new CC architecture based on the ring network without any central node is designed. Second, an asynchronously communication strategy with low communication frequency and volume is proposed. Third, a competitive selection strategy is adopted to achieve consistency in asynchronous evolution. We define a set of distributed benchmark problems and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

These are the entity e-tuple $\mathcal{E}$ and the intertwined update function $\phi$. Focusing on implementing data structures in C#, $\mathcal{E}$ is implemented as a list of objects according to current software engineering practice and as an array of pointers according to theoretical considerations. Cellular automaton simulations with 10 9 entities over one iteration reveal that the object-list with dynamic typing and multi-state readiness has a drastic effect on running time and memory usage, especially dynamic typing as it has a big impact on the evolution time. Pointer-arrays are possible to implement in C# and are more running time and memory efficient as compared to the object-list implementation, however, they are cumbersome to implement. In conclusion, avoiding dynamic typing in object-list based implementations or using pointer-arrays gives evolution times that are acceptable in practice, even on desktop computers.},

Thus this paper proposes to identify and use decision patterns during the process of developing architecture description models. Five decision patterns built upon meta-model and associated decision points are identified, including the downselecting, partitioning, connecting, permuting, and assigning patterns. Each provides a mathematical framework to shape the important decision-making elements. A mixed use of decision patterns for an air and missile defense SoS architecture design is simply illustrated in the end. As a preliminary study, this paper demonstrates the potential of developing decision patterns to support and ease the architecture model development.},

To efficiently improve the data throughput of links between end devices and cloud servers, this paper proposes a user-space driver for gateways that places the packet-forwarding behavior in the user space of the gateway OS and achieves high throughput by bypassing the kernel and simplifying the packet delivery path. In addition, to obtain more significant data throughput in small packet-intensive scenarios, we integrate packet assembling methods for the driver, which assembles received small packets into a large one before forwarding it. Our evaluation shows that the user-space driver has tens of times throughput compared to the kernel driver. Furthermore, our driver cooperated with the packet assembling method shows a significant advantage compared to the latest related work in small packet-intensive scenarios.},

  abstract  = {SAT problems are fundamental in representing and solving combinatorial applications. Over the past years, many sophisticated SAT solvers have been proposed. Due to the topic’s relevance, a SAT competition is scheduled yearly to promote solving hard SAT instances. There is no unique solver to tackle all SAT problems efficiently. Indeed, some solvers work best for some SAT instances but perform poorly for others. This limitation has been addressed, in the literature, by identifying a pool of solvers that complement each other for efficiently tackling a given set of SAT instances. This pool of solvers is called a portfolio. Several studies have been conducted to find the optimal portfolio maximizing the number of solved SAT instances, minimizing the overall running time, or a trade-off between both. In this context, we present a new approach that first finds the suitable portfolio meeting each of these objectives. Then, the approach predicts the best solver for any new SAT instance. Our approach is based on Greedy search techniques, clustering, and deep learning. More precisely, we investigate two different scenarios. In the first one, our goal is to find the best portfolio capable of solving the largest number of instances within a given time limit. Both the Greedy-based method and clustering are used in this case. The second scenario aims to find the optimal portfolio to minimize the penalized average running time. The latter objective captures a good trade-off between the objective in the first scenario and the overall average running time. In addition to Greedy search and clustering, we consider a variant of the Beam-search technique to address this scenario. To assess the performance of our approach regarding the two scenarios, we conduct multiple experiments on the SAT2021 competition datasets that include SAT instances together with participants’ solvers’ results for each instance. The outcomes from the conducted experiments are encouraging and promising.},

However, the current pre-trained language model is mainly concentrated in the Chinese and English fields. For low resource language such as Tibetan, there is lack of a monolingual pre-trained model. To promote the development of Tibetan natural language processing tasks, this paper collects the large-scale training data from Tibetan websites and constructs a vocabulary that can cover 99.95\% of the words in the corpus by using Sentencepiece. Then, we train the Tibetan monolingual pre-trained language model named TiBERT on the data and vocabulary. Finally, we apply TiBERT to the downstream tasks of text classification and question generation, and compare it with classic models and multilingual pre-trained models, the experimental results show that TiBERT can achieve the best performance.

  abstract  = {Existing multimodal stress/pain recognition approaches generally extract features from different modalities independently and thus ignore cross-modality correlations. This paper proposes a novel geometric framework for multimodal stress/pain detection utilizing Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices as a representation that incorporates the correlation relationship of physiological and behavioural signals from covariance and cross-covariance. Considering the non-linearity of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices, well-known machine learning techniques are not suited to classify these matrices. Therefore, a tangent space mapping method is adopted to map the derived SPD matrix sequences to the vector sequences in the tangent space where the LSTM-based network can be applied for classification. The proposed framework has been evaluated on two public multimodal datasets, achieving both the state-of-the-art results for stress and pain detection tasks.},

Most of the existing methods only consider the text content, ignoring the role of the information in the additional images; for the fusion between multiple modalities, their adequate information cannot be fully utilized, and the graphic and text information have not fully interacted. Therefore, we propose a multi-level image-text fusion method (MLFRD), which can effectively obtain local and global information about events, improve the connection between text and images, and improve the performance of rumor detection. MLFRD consists of three parts, a multimodal feature extractor to extract textual and visual features from posts, the extracted features are sent to a multilevel feature fusion network for efficient fusion, and finally to a rumor detector for rumor discrimination. We conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets, and MLFRD can better fuse features between multiple modalities for rumor detection and outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {Fake news that combines text and images has a better story-telling ability than text-only fake news, making it more deceptive and easier to spread maliciously. Therefore, multi-modal fake news detection has become a new hot topic. There are two main challenges in this task. First, the traditional pre-training model BERT has more parameters and a relatively slow training speed, which limits the level of extracted text features. Second, in the multi-modal form, the fusion process is only a simple splicing of visual and textual features of news, and the obtained multi-modal features are insufficient to express the complementarity between multi-modal data and may have redundant information, potentially leading to biased detection results.In order to solve the above issues, we propose ALB-MCF, using ALBERT and Multi-modal Circulant Fusion(MCF) for fake news detection. ALB-MCF consists of four main modules: a multi-modal feature extractor, a multi-modal feature fusion, a fake news detection and a domain classifier. Specifically, the multi-modal feature extractor innovatively uses a pre-trained ALBERT model to extract text features and a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract visual features. Then, the text features and the visual features are fused into a multi-modal feature representation by MCF, which improves the fusion capability while avoiding an increase in parameters and computational cost. Finally, the multi-modal features are fed into the detector to detect fake news. The role of the domain classifier is mainly to remove event-specific features while retaining shared features between events, thus providing effective detection of emerging events. We have conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrated that our model can handle multi-modal data more effectively, thus improving the accuracy of fake news detection.},

In the proposed bNeSiFC, a new similarity metric termed EDS is introduced to compute the pair-similarity for constructing the transition probability matrix of mLRW. The boosted NeSiFC outperforms over the basic NeSiFC in terms of a faster computation in finding the most similar neighbors through the incorporation of the newly proposed metric EDS. Also, we introduce a novel fuzzy membership degree computation method for the proposed bNeSiFC, which is much clearer and easy to interpret than the one used for the basic NeSiFC. Comparative analysis of the experimental results with eight different real-life datasets establishes the superiority of the bNeSiFC over the NeSiFC and other existing approaches.},

However, their major drawback is that they are “black box” and opaque classifiers. Taking into consideration the increasing demand for interpretable classification models, this paper introduces a novel meta-feature extraction scheme. This scheme is based on fuzzy sets, and it can be applied on the feature maps of a CNN. Initially, representative image prototypes are selected based on their deep feature map representation. Then, it constructs information granules from the feature maps, describing the content of each image class. It uses fuzzy sets to linguistically characterize the similarity between the deep feature maps of an image and the deep feature maps of the image prototypes. Thus, a classification outcome can be interpreted based on the features characterizing the different image classes involved in a classification problem. The experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme is performed on five publicly available image datasets. The results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art classifiers, while providing an understandable interpretation of the classification result.},

Fault injection attacks are a type of physical attack on the hardware components of an IoT system. These attacks cause the IoT system software to behave abnormally, which the adversaries exploit. Typically, these attacks have been detected through the use of a separate hardware detection mechanism, which is expensive and itself vulnerable to attack. The purpose of this paper is to propose a machine learning based approach to detect the attacks by monitoring specific run-time software parameters in the live environment of an IoT system. The proposed approach generates a labelled dataset by injecting instruction-level faults into the software executable, which is then used to train a machine learning model that can predict whether the IoT software system is currently being affected by a fault injection attack. Using a software fault injection tool to create a labelled dataset enables the use of supervised machine learning techniques, which produce more accurate prediction results than unsupervised techniques. The machine learning model can be used in the live environment of an IoT software system to monitor specific run-time software properties in order to detect the effects of a fault injection attack on the software. Additionally, the model classifies the type of fault introduced into the software as a result of the attack, which can be used to determine the necessary corrective action.},

Then, we design an adaptive global brightness adjustment strategy to optimize the global luminance of the output image. Since only adjusting brightness can cause color distortion of output images, we propose an adaptive chroma adjustment strategy to ensure color consistency across all areas of output images. A series of experiments show that our method can remove shadows of digitized documents, outperforming some state-of the-art methods.

We, in this work, attempt to develop an adversarial example generation method for attacking neural-based image quality assessment (IQA). Specifically, instead of employing conventional additive adversarial noise generation methods, we propose an image content deformation approach, avoiding the loss of adversarial noise after compression. The deformation component is designed as neural layers. The given image is firstly deformed and then undergoes compression; an existing IQA evaluates the compressed image. The deformation layers are trained by back-propagating the differences between the targeted IQA score and the originally-evaluated one. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can produce compression-resistant adversarial images for image quality evaluators. The generated adversarial examples could effectively attack neural-based image quality evaluators with less distortion.

  abstract  = {Developing fresh produce yield forecasting service is essential for estimating fair prices to protect against overpriced agricultural commodities and minimize the bid ask spread which not only benefits the retailers and customers but also protects farmers. Forecasting the fresh produce yield is achieved using state of the art deep learning (DL) models. Those models are trained and built using data retrieved from Santa Barbara region in California using an ensemble of Attention Deep Feedforward Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Deep Feedforward Neural Network with embedded GRU units. The ensemble takes as input the soil moisture and temperature parameters as well as vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from images retrieved from multiple satellites. The effect of adding the VIs as input parameters on the forecasting performance of the deep learning model is assessed and the most effective VIs are selected. In addition, interpolation techniques are used to estimate the missing VIs due to the low frequency of capturing the images by the satellites. A comparative analysis is conducted to choose the most effective technique, which is found to be Cubic Spline interpolation. One VI, which is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), proves to be the most effective index in forecasting the yield. Based on the aggregated error measure (AGM) score, the yield forecasting performance of the DL ensemble is enhanced by 12.51\% after adding the complete interpolated NDVI to the input parameters used in training the model.},

In this paper, a linear programming model for optimal human-robot collaborative disassembly is established. The goal is to maximize disassembly profit. An improved Moth-Flame optimizer (MFO) is proposed and the crossover part of the algorithm is improved based on this problem’s characteristics. Experiments with practical cases involving multiple products of disassembly are used to test the model and algorithm.

  abstract  = {As a new paradigm, industrial Internet provides information sharing of various elements and resources in a whole industrial production process. It makes industrial production processes intelligent and provides low-cost and efficient scheduling. Manufacturing planning for multi-plant enterprises in industrial Internet brings many big challenges due to numerous optimization variables and limits of manufacturing capacities of plants, production resources, etc. Current studies fail to jointly consider the cost of different products in multiple heterogeneous plants, and ignore machine-level scheduling of manufacturing tasks. This work designs an improved framework for multi-plant enterprises, based on which a constrained non-linear integer program for reducing the total cost including production cost and transportation one is formulated. It jointly considers many complex nonlinear constraints, e.g., limits of replacement times, storage space, substitution and pairing production. It investigates machine-level task scheduling where different machines have heterogeneous manufacturing capacities. To solve it, this work proposes an algorithm named Genetic Simulated annealing-based Particle Swarm Optimization (GSPSO). Realistic data-based experiments demonstrate GSPSO reduces the cost of a multi-plant system by at least 23\% than its typical peers.},

In addition, it is proved that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to the traditional iterative solution of SDRE. A suboptimal control policy can be attained under proper conditions.

  abstract  = {The multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) have a wide range of real-world applications. Designing an effective algorithm has an important and practical significance. Due to the huge search space and limited time, it is generally difficult to obtain the optimal solution of this kind of problem by traditional exact and heuristic algorithms. Recently, learning-based algorithms have achieved good results in solving MOCOPs, but the quality and diversity of found solutions can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a Weight-Specific-Decoder Attention Model (WSDAM) to better approximate the whole Pareto set. It embeds a weight-adaptive layer into the decoder to concentrate on the information of different weight vectors. During the model training, the weight vector is sampled from the Dirichlet distribution, which can further strengthen the learning of boundary solutions. We evaluate our method on two classic MOCOPs, i.e., the multiobjective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP) and multiobjective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP). The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art learning-based methods in both solution quality and generalization ability.},

Then it analyzes the influence mechanism of consumers’ sensitivity to price change, product cost and consumers’ valuation of product quality on product pricing and enterprise profit.

One of the most critical steps in the development of HCSs is the experimental validation. This step has not received enough attention within the published research. This study reports evaluation and validation of an operational HCS located in the Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation (IISRI) at Deakin University, Australia. The system, owning a low-cost structure with an effective arm length of over 5m, is capable of generating a maximum sustained acceleration of 9G with an onset rate of 5G/sec. The experimental validation of system is implemented using an Advanced Wireless Human Dummy (AWHD) which is fully instrumented. The results of experimental validation show that the system can reliably generate the reference centripetal acceleration with lowest error at the human spine location.},

  abstract  = {Motion signal should be generated via the AV control system targeting the maximum motion comfort for the users. Nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) is recently used in AVs to achieve this critical task. However, nonlinear MPC has lots of hyperparameters, including weights and MPC horizons, that should be tuned systematically to reach the system’s high efficiency. The energy usage and motion comfort have a direct relationship. The generation of high-fidelity motion cues for AV users leads to higher energy usage. Hence, there is a need for the use of a multi-objective optimisation technique to tune the weights wisely to satisfy the appropriate energy usage and motion comfort for the AV users. In this study, multi-objective NSGA-II is employed, for the first time, to tune the weights of a nonlinear MPC-based controller in AVs. The proposed method is designed and developed using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. The simulation results show minimum energy usage by generation of smooth motion signals, delivering maximum comfort to AV users.},

To benefit from machine learning methods and train them when working with these types of images, traditional approaches tend to apply some standard transformations, such as reshaping the image or randomly choosing a small image patch. This process can seriously degrade the information received by the model and therefore, it risks learning non-discriminatory information. To address these problems, we propose a sliding tile-based approach for the task of writer identification in music scores in two stages. The first stage benefits from symbol detection for the sole purpose of identifying optimal regions containing musical information. And a second stage uses this music content information to compute the final classification at the full-page. We present an ablation study together with a new database containing musical scores extracted from the music department of the National Library of France - BnF named REMDM Autographs. We present the results of our explorations for two databases, the new corpus, and the well-known public CVC-MUSCIMA database. When comparing the performance of the tile approach versus the full-page approach, we see an undeniable performance improvement of more than 45\% in both databases.},

In a previous work, we defined a method to model the static context of navigation using ontologies and take it into account in the command law when performing a local navigation task. In this paper, we extend our model of the context of navigation, and define a software architecture able to update the context dynamically, by using sensor information. The method is tested with real-time experiments on driving simulator. They show that the Context of Navigation can be effectively updated during the navigation and leads to a smarter vehicle’s behavior on the road.},

Considering traffic safety, many studies have been devoted to the exchange of information among various road users, such as CAVs and pedestrians. In a platooning scenario, when a pedestrian is detected by a CAV, the leader CAV shares the information with its followers to provide a safe and courteous environment thanks to its connectivity. However, the possibility to improve traffic efficiency while meeting the safety requirements has rarely been addressed in current research. Yet, in industrial areas, where automated vehicles and pedestrians frequently interact, combining safety and efficiency is crucial. The present paper addresses this challenge by first analyzing the intersection of CAVs and pedestrians in no-traffic-signal scenarios. The optimal state is proposed to reduce the time loss. Then, the paper uses a reinforcement learning-based method to make CAVs arrive at the optimal state, to improve traffic efficiency. The experimental results based on virtual reality show that the proposed method increases traffic efficiency while ensuring traffic safety.},

This paper presents a contrast-enhanced automatic cognitive impairment screening system combining paused-encoder based on the automatic transcription. We use the pre-trained automatic speech recognition model and adapt it to generate transcripts of the elderly’s speech. The pattern of pauses in speech is a commonly-studied acoustic feature since it can provide additional information besides the semantic information for the model prediction. The back-translation with contrastive learning is used to improve the encoded model further. The model also fine-tunes with the pause-encoded transcriptions to detect the cognitive impairment. Our result shows excellent performance with an accuracy of 81\% in detecting Alzheimer’s disease. Also, the accuracy is acceptable on a more challenging task of detecting mild cognitive impairment, the middle stage between healthy and Alzheimer’s.

Several works have been striving to use machine learning to create models for hospitalization predictions. Most of them require specialized knowledge in the health area, mainly in the stages of data preparation and selection of features. This feature engineering is not always perfect and may fail to select relevant features for the model training process. In this paper, to fill this gap, we explore three sources of information to extract features, i.e., medical specialty, event description, and the International Classification of Diseases. In addition, we introduce a dataset composed of 38,524 records of medical events from 34,930 patients. To assess and set a baseline for this new dataset, we have used two well-known ensemble methods (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting). The best results, AUC = 0.82, were achieved by combining the models generated from the three feature set tested and gradient boosting. We believe that researchers will find this dataset a valuable tool in their work on hospitalization prediction. It will also make future benchmarking and evaluation possible.},

  abstract  = {Protein-protein interaction(PPI) site prediction is a deep-level exploration of the mechanism of life activity, but relying solely on experimental methods to identify PPI sites is hugely costly. This method is advantageous among the developed computational methods using structural information. For the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of protein structural information, the absolute values of solvent accessibility derived from the program named DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) were primarily used and then normalized using the highest exposure area of the amino acid type determined in the past. It is difficult to obtain suitable RSA when protein structure information cannot be obtained by homologous transfer, and thus the use of RSA is limited. We used the latest deep learning prediction tools to mine potentially valuable information from long-range interactions inside protein sequences and used it for protein RSA prediction. In a deep graph convolutional neural network, we incorporate the predicted relative solvent accessibility (PRSA) into the original structural information and then combine the sequence information and evolutionary information to form graph node features. We showed that our proposed method significantly improves the performance of AUPRC and MCC by over 9.5\% and 21\% compared to other sequence-based and structure-based methods. Furthermore, it was demonstrated by analyzing the method that the PRSA plays a crucial role in PPI site prediction.},

However, these methods encode the labels as one-hot vectors, which ignore the semantic relevance between the labels. Moreover, the loss function they employ does not consider the unbalanced label distribution, resulting in overfitting labels with high frequencies. To alleviate the above problems and improve the performance of multi-label biomedical document classification tasks, we propose a model to learn Label Independence And Relevance (LIAR) and integrate them efficiently. LIAR uses BioBERT to fully extract information from biomedical literature to generate textual representations and uses it to construct a one-hot vector and learn label embeddings, respectively. Meanwhile, we construct a new loss function that can adaptively weight and integrates the one-hot vector distribution and label semantic similarity to compute the loss value and Assign Weights (AWLoss) to labels of different frequencies to alleviate the shortcomings of the loss function in the above model. LIAR outperformed the state-of-the-art method by more than 1\% on all three benchmark datasets.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other types of dementia have become a public health priority worldwide. To lessen the burden of AD diagnosis, an automatic screening system that can be deployed in large-scale and cost-efficient screening methods will be needed. This paper presents a speech assessment system for cognitive impairment detection, detecting whether elders have AD or suffer from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on their audio recordings taken from neuropsychological tests. The audio waveform first is transformed to Mel-spectrogram and done the downsampling. With the combination of Transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, we can do the feature extraction and get a better representation for the classifier. We conducted experiments on 120 subjects with a balanced distribution of ordinary aging, MCI, and AD patients to validate our study. Our experiments achieve an accuracy of 91\% and 79\% for classifying groups of AD and MCI from ordinary aging people, respectively.},

In order to simplify this algorithm for an on-chip implementation, we investigate the impact of various number representations and approximate arithmetic operators on the quality of image filtering. We employ Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to evolve approximate implementations of a 20-bit signed multiplier which is then applied in the image filter instead of the conventional 32-bit floating-point multiplier. In addition to using several techniques that reduce the huge design cost, we propose a new mutation operator for CGP to improve the search quality and obtain better approximate multipliers than with CGP utilizing the standard mutation operator. Image filters utilizing evolved approximate multipliers can save 35\% in power consumption of multiplication operations for a negligible drop in the image filtering quality.},

Most existing methods use traditional object detection methods as the basic framework is improved to a limited extent. Previous methods often ignore the special characterization relationship between support and query images. This paper fully investigates the effect of support images on detection performance and proposes a new FSOD method called Multi-relational Semantic Distillation (MSD). Our approach aims to improve FSOD performance by building a multi-relational semantic representation model with support and query features. In addition, we propose a support enhancement (SE) module based on the self-attention mechanism to enhance the useful information in the support features to mitigate the negative impact of low-quality support images. To verify the effectiveness of MSD, we conduct sufficient experiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets. Experiments show that MSD achieves competitive results at low shots compared to other state-of-the-art few-shot detectors.},

Compared with other meta-learning methods, the effect of metric-based meta-learning methods is more advantageous. Despite the success of metric-based meta-learning approaches, the adaptability of metric methods to data distribution is still insufficient, which leads to classification results more dependent on the accuracy of encoder networks and are susceptible to noisy features. In this paper, we realize the filtering of noisy features and the correction of data distribution by adaptive learning of metric weights and data distribution biases, and propose corresponding loss functions to evaluate and update our adaptive module and encoding network.

After our study and research of the Prototypical Network, we found that the prototype calculation method and loss function are relatively simple, which can be improved better. We present our few-shot classification algorithm in this paper, which is inspired by Prototypical Network and center loss function. Based on the Prototypical Network, we propose our Adaptive Weights Model(AWM) to give each sample a better weight parameter, so that we can get a more reasonable prototype. Based on this model, bad samples(Contain a lot of noise) will get a smaller weight, while good samples(Contain very little noise) will get a larger weight. Based on the center loss function, we propose our Adaptive Sample’s Distribution Model(ASDM), which enables us to optimize the distribution of samples. Then, we did a lot of experiments based on our model. The results show that the our model is effective. Few-shot learning is becoming more and more important in machine learning. However, most few-shot learning algorithms only rely on deep neural networks to process samples. Here, we offer a different idea to give more reasonable weights to the samples.},

In this study, we have used a semi-supervised learning method Meta Pseudo Labels which allowed us to train models with a limited amount of labelled data extracted from chest X-ray images. The approach has demonstrated promising results achieving 92.5\% of accuracy on the data labelled only for 16\%.

In this article, we consider a UAV transmission hub (UTH) to communicate with the macro base station (MBS). MTs can offload tasks to MBS for processing through UTH, and the MEC server in MBS allocates computing resources to MTs.

The scheme considers the continuous generation of dynamic tasks, and the optimization objectives is to minimize the long-term average system cost. The simulation experiment datas verify the performance of DDPG-Based offloading and resource allocation decision scheme.

Such a series of procedures that build the game environment is designed to detect locations of target objects. We also show that the updatable target network can make the agent reach stability faster and improve training results prominently, which utilizes good samples.

Manipulation primitives are used as actions for RL, which can reduce the gap between control instruction and robotic actions and speed up the convergence of the RL model.

  abstract  = {Flocking control is a challenging problem, where multiple agents, such as drones or vehicles, need to reach a target position while maintaining the flock and avoiding collisions with obstacles and collisions among agents in the environment. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has achieved promising performance in flocking control. However, methods based on traditional reinforcement learning require a considerable number of interactions between agents and the environment. This paper proposes a sub-optimal policy aided multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm (SPA-MARL) to boost sample efficiency. SPA-MARL directly leverages a prior policy that can be manually designed or solved with a non-learning method to aid agents in learning, where the performance of the policy can be sub-optimal. SPA-MARL recognizes the difference in performance between the sub-optimal policy and itself, and then imitates the sub-optimal policy if the suboptimal policy is better. We leverage SPA-MARL to solve the flocking control problem. A traditional control method based on artificial potential fields is used to generate a sub-optimal policy. Experiments demonstrate that SPA-MARL can speed up the training process and outperform both the MARL baseline and the used sub-optimal policy.},

Many studies have proposed the introduction of external knowledge to enhance deep learning models which have achieved good results, but as most of these studies only consider using single-hop relationship information from knowledge graphs or simply introduce partial knowledge graphs, fail to effectively mine knowledge paths to understand the relationships between diseases. To this end, we propose a new approach, which uses existing medical knowledge graphs for multi-hop reasoning to guide the self-attention based transformer model for disease prediction. Specifically, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to perform path reasoning in the knowledge graph to obtain explicit disease progression paths and fusion them with the original Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. After embedding we capture the implicit relationships between the deep knowledge and the original EHR information through several transformer encoders based on the self-attention mechanism to better extract features. At the same time, multi-hop knowledge is more interpretable than single-hop knowledge in terms of disease prediction. Experimental results on the real-world medical dataset MIMIC-III show the superiority of the proposed approach compared to a series of state-of-the-art baselines. 1 1 The code has been uploaded to https://github.com/15536385781/DKRDP},

  abstract  = {The written notes in the Electronic Health Records contain a vast amount of information about patients. Implementing automated approaches for text classification tasks requires the automated methods to be well-interpretable, and topic models can be used for this goal as they can indicate what topics in a text are relevant to making a decision. We propose a new topic modeling algorithm, FLSA-E, and compare it with another state-of-the-art algorithm FLSA-W. In FLSA-E, topics are found by fuzzy clustering in a word embedding space. Since we use word embeddings as the basis for our clustering, we extend our evaluation with word-embeddings-based evaluation metrics. We find that different evaluation metrics favour different algorithms. Based on the results, there is evidence that FLSA-E has fewer outliers in its topics, a desirable property, given that within-topic words need to be semantically related.},

  abstract  = {Electrical stimulation is a powerful tool for targeted neurorehabilitation, and recent work in adaptive stimulation where stimulation can be adjusted in real-time has shown promise in improving stimulation outcomes and reducing stimulation-induced side effects. Mapping the relationship between electrical stimulation input and neural activity response can help reveal their interactions and can give us tools to iterate and improve on our stimulation protocols. Here, we introduce methods for identifying low-dimensional subspaces of human intracortical responses to electrical stimulation in invasive electroencephalography. In epilepsy patients (n=4) undergoing clinical monitoring, we applied a stimulation protocol of varying amplitude and frequency in 5-second intervals to capture a range of responses to different stimulation conditions. We characterized these responses using time-frequency spectral power, applied baseline subtraction and outlier removal procedures, and performed principal component analysis across frequencies. We identified that intracortical responses to different stimulation conditions can be represented in a 3-dimensional subspace, accounting for more than 95\% of the variance. Using support vector machine classification, we demonstrated separability of intracortical responses in different stimulation conditions across subjects, where this separability was contingent on applying baseline subtraction and outlier removal. Our results represent a first step towards building a predictive model of neural response from stimulation input, an important prerequisite for adaptive closed-loop stimulation for targeted neurorehabilitation.},

  abstract  = {Silent speech Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) try to decode imagined speech from brain activity. Those BCIs require a tremendous amount of training data usually collected during mentally and physically exhausting sessions in which participants silently repeat words presented on a screen for several hours. Within this work we present an approach to overcome those exhausting sessions by training a silent speech classifier on data recorded while speaking certain words and transferring this classifier to EEG data recorded during silent repetition of the same words. This approach does not only allow for a less mentally and physically exhausting training procedure but also for a more productive one as the overt speech output can be used for interaction while the classifier for silent speech is trained simultaneously. We evaluated our approach in a study in which 15 participants navigated a virtual robot on a screen in a game like scenario through a maze once with 5 overtly spoken and once with the same 5 silently spoken command words. In an offline analysis we trained a classifier on overt speech data and let it predict silent speech data. Our classification results do not only show successful results for the transfer (61.78\%) significantly above chance level but also comparable results to a standard silents speech classifier (71.48\%) trained and tested on the same data. These results illustrate the potential of the method to replace the currently tedious training procedures for silent speech BCIs with a more comfortable, engaging and productive approach by a transfer from overt to silent speech.},

For this purpose, mathematical methods and computational tools were used here to evaluate the effect of using the BCI for sustained attention training, programmed with different levels of difficulty for two groups of subjects. As a result, it was possible to identify differences in connectivity patterns between both groups, mainly the flow outflow characteristic in the left temporal region of subjects who performed the training using the game programmed with greater difficulty level. With this preliminary result, we concluded that the proposed strategy for sustained attention training by applying different speed control in a BCI-based game resulted in the generation of different patterns, capable of distinguishing the users in the two groups.

However, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of these signals. In this work, we generate artificial EEG signals and compare them with real EEG measurements. We analyze the signals in the time and frequency domain and conduct a survey addressed to experts in the field of EEG signal analysis. Finally, we assess whether augmenting EEG data with generated data improves the classification performance. The artificial EEG signals were generated by a progressive Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (Wasserstein GAN) with gradient penalty, that was trained on attention recognition data. To investigate the effect of data augmentation, the Shallow Filterbank Common Spatial Pattern network (shallow FBCSPNet) was chosen. The analysis shows that the simulated EEG signals appear realistic in both time and frequency domain. The survey found no significant differences in EEG typical features between real and simulated, but the estimation of noise level tended to be higher for the simulated signals. The data augmentation for the classification resulted in a moderate improvement in accuracy and F-score. Overall, the results show that the quality of the simulated EEG signals is comparable to the quality of the real EEG signals.},

  abstract  = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective and promising therapy to control Parkinson’s tremor movement in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). This paper proposes a new alternative medication that has several advantages, including compatibility with individual needs and low side effects. There has been a rapid improvement in the literature on the development of the dynamic computational model of neuroscience, alongside the development of DBS. A combination of DBS and model-based control strategies opens up a new vision for Parkinson’s disease treatment. Despite the numerous studies on basal ganglia (BG) modeling, researchers are required to employ adaptive and robust strategies to eliminate Parkinson’s patients’ tremors. This paper proposes a new adaptive optimal fast terminal sliding mode control (AOFTSMC) method to mitigate tremors by tuning GABA thorough DBS. This approach represents finite-time convergence law, a new method to stimulate the inner nuclei of BG in a robust and optimum manner that leads to removing tremors of PD fluctuation signal in the presence of uncertainties. Finally, simulation results of the basal ganglia model under the addressed approach are adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

What’s more, an improved proximal policy optimization algorithm combined with fuzzy logic is proposed for realizing the trial-and-error reinforcement learning. Specially, the reward function with fuzzy logic is formulated to meet the requirements of suspension performance under different road conditions, in which the fuzzy logic is designed to fuzzily the process the collected road information, real-time update the weight matrix coefficients, and adjust the optimization objectives adaptively.

  abstract  = {Self-driving vehicles, also known as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), are steadily becoming very popular due to their huge benefits. They can improve safety, convenience and transport interconnectivity as well as reduce congestion, pollution and emissions. The generation of the comfort motion signal for AVs passenger via the calculation of accurate motion cues with lower motion discomforts is important to promote the adoption of Avs in society. Model predictive control (MPC) is currently used in AVs for tracking the motion signal with good accuracy. However, the higher efficiency of MPC is directly related to the right setting of the weights. In addition, the tracking of time-varying longitudinal velocity is not possible without using linear time-varying (LTV) MPC. In this study, an LTV MPC system is designed and developed as a highly efficient motion tracking mechanism for AVs to reduce the motion tracking error and motion discomfort. In addition, biogeography-based optimisation (BBO) is employed to determine the optimal weights of the LTV MPC controller, which further reduces the motion tracking error and increases the motion comfort for users. The empirical study demonstrates that a BBO-tuned LTV MPC controller decreases the mean square error of motion tracking by 4.79\% as compared with that of a manually-tuned version. Moreover, the mean square errors of the lateral deviation and relative yaw decrease by 91.22\% and 19.14\% as compared with those from a manually-tuned LTV MPC counterpart, respectively.},

Having control over self-modifying code, however, is still an open challenge since it is a balancing act between providing as much freedom as possible so as not to limit possible solutions, while at the same time imposing restriction to avoid security issues and invalid code or solutions. In the present study, I provide a prototype implementation of how one might curb self-modifying code by introducing control mechanisms for code modifications within specific regions and for specific transitions between code and data. I show that this is possible to achieve with the so-called allagmatic method - a framework to formalise, model, implement, and interpret complex systems inspired by Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of individuation and Alfred North Whitehead’s philosophy of organism. Thereby, the allagmatic method serves as guidance for self-modification based on concepts defined in a metaphysical framework. I conclude that the allagmatic method seems to be a suitable framework for control mechanisms in self-modifying code and that there are intriguing analogies between the presented control mechanisms and gene regulation.},

These agents have to communicate in order to implement evolving and adaptive genetic operators to accelerate the convergence towards the optimal solution. This cooperative approach is applied to solve the patient scheduling problem in emergency department (ED). This problem is NP-difficult due to the permanent interference between three types of arrival: already programmed patients, non-programmed patients and urgent non-programmed patients. Our scheduling problem has to integrate several dimensions such as medical dimensional, patient dimensional, temporal dimensional. The multi-dimensional aspect of the chromosome is crucial to model the different dimensions of the ED. The main goal of the simulation results is to assess the performance of the proposed agent driven multidimensional chromosome. The simulation results confirm that the intra and inter chromosomal interactions allow to avoid the blind aspect of the genetic operators and impacts the quality of solutions. The agents’ cooperation and its ability to improve efficiently the quality of the solutions by exploring intelligently the research space are confirmed by the drop in average total patient waiting time by 15.09\%},

Therefore, to address this issue, adaptive evacuation signage systems that alter evacuation information depending on situational changes have been proposed. This study addresses this problem by employing the black-box optimization technique using multi-agent simulation as the objective function. We assume a realistic evacuation environment consisting of central cores with complex aisles and broad surrounding space. Then, we simulate guiding a crowd of evacuees. The two problem settings for the visual evacuation signage assignment are guiding a crowd to a specific target and minimizing the total evacuation time. Our approach generated near-optimal solutions for the first set and a reasonably good solution for the second set.},

This paper introduces a new, vision-based, covert attack and detection method, called VCAD-GAN, which can be applied to the navigation system of various autonomous vehicles. VCAD-GAN injects a faulty signal into the actuator channel to drive the vehicle out of the lane. To conceal the deviation effects, VCAD-GAN manipulates the camera output using a generative adversarial network such that the vehicle is shown on the road’s center-line and aligned with it. The generator of VCAD-GAN reconstructs a synthesized top view of the road, while the discriminator classifies it as authentic or fake and sends feedback to the generator. A hybrid adversary detection system is also developed for VCAD-GAN using a customized deep neural network, global positioning system data, and an offline map. To evaluate the performance of VCAD-GAN, various 3D simulations were conducted. The simulation results show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract  = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, from games to complex tasks. In several DRL applications, the agents must perform long-horizon tasks in partially observable environments. However, owing to the high performance of DRL, the decision-making process for the long-horizon task is unclear and difficult to interpret. Although memory-based models and the Transformer model have been proposed to overcome the interpretability issue, challenges of limited flexibility, lack of stability, and high computational cost remain. To address these concerns, we propose a low-computational-complexity and scalable DRL model that uses attention-augmented memory (AAM) to interpret the long-horizon decision-making process. AAM adds long short-term memory states of past observations to the memory and uses a soft attention bottleneck to combine them into a single contextual vector. The agent is then trained to make decisions based on this AAM together with the current observation. The AAM model is applied to the navigation problem of the Labyrinth [1], and attention and saliency maps are generated to show the areas highlighted by the agent in the current observation and the areas it attends to from memory. The resiliency of the model was evaluated using saliency and it was discovered that the proposed method is more resilient to the noise of visual observations compared with the baseline model. In summary, the proposed method demonstrates an interpretable and noise-robust DRL approach for long-horizon tasks.},

A Multi-Agent Safety System (MASS) is presented as a solution in this paper which uses commercial, wearable technologies with high data sharing acceptance rates such as the Apple watch to collect and share real time ECG signals with the Cobot. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is selected as a dimension reduction tool because it is well established and meets the requirements for reliability in the development of a human-centric, safety system. Five Machine Learning (ML) classifiers (KNN, NB, RF, DT and GBM) are used with binary classification to predict whether the human is Distracted (Event 1) or Not Distracted (Event 0) to determine if this will pose a safety risk to the Human Robot Collaboration (HRC) System. Decision Tree (DT) classifier with 4 Principal Components (PCs) is evaluated at 98\% Accuracy and 99\%AUC and is the recommended model for future development of the MASS. A road map is also presented to ensure the longevity of MASS while signifying the inclusion of real time data which can close the demographic data gap and help to improve the privacy, efficiency and contextual reliability of the MASS model in the Industry 5.0 workplace.},

  abstract  = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used in the field of speech enhancement due to their huge potentials in reducing the noise mixed in the signals. Most of existing GAN-based speech enhancement approaches either operate on time domain or exploit the magnitude spectra in time-frequency domain, but lack consideration of direct optimization of the phase. In this paper, we propose a GAN architecture for speech enhancement based on gated linear units (GLUs) and Dual-Path Transformers (DPTs), which simultaneously deals with the amplitude and phase information on the time-frequency domain. The generator of the proposed GAN architecture is designed following an autoencoder structure fed by the real and imaginary parts of the time-frequency frames. The encoder of the generator is constructed by multiple cascaded convolutional GLUs (ConvGLUs), while the decoder consists of two groups of cascaded deconvolutional GLUs (DeconvGLUs), one for the real part of the spectrogram and the other for the imaginary part. The GLUs are adopted since they are potential in avoiding the gradient vanishing issue dwelling in deep architectures by providing a linear path for the gradients while retaining non-linear capabilities. Aiming at capturing the long-range dependent features in speech, we place DPTs between the encoder and the decoder of the generator, which contains multi-head attention modules and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs). Moreover, the DPT structure is also merged with multiple one-dimensional convolutional layers in the discriminator of the GAN. Such a design not only improves the speech enhancement performance of GAN by focusing on multiple features of speech, but also reducing the volume of model parameters of GAN. Experimental results suggest that the proposed GAN architecture outperforms the existing benchmark GANs in terms of both objective speech intelligibility and quality with less computational complexity.},

Existing methods typically assume the complete citywide traffic data can be obtained in real-time, which is impossible in applications. Furthermore, many recent works only consider one single kind of spatial correlation in traffic network when building graph representations. This work proposes an adversarial learning framework named Multi-Graph Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (MGC-GAN) to address the aforementioned challenges. To generate citywide traffic flow predictions using limited traffic data, we construct three kinds of graphs using easily accessed geographical and semantic information to model the complex spatial correlations in citywide transportation networks. Following that, a parallel GCN layer is designed to separately process multiple graphs. In addition, we design the Parallel Graph Convolution and Temporal Convolution Module (PGTCM) to effectively capture the heterogeneous spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments are carried out on two citywide traffic datasets, demonstrating that MGC-GAN outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

Task scheduling is one of the critical technologies in Ray, in which the number of resource nodes could be auto-scaling, i.e., automatically increasing or decreasing according to the workload. The adopted scheduling strategy is simple, which leaves much space to be optimized. In this paper, we consider designing a reinforcement learning method to optimize the scheduling problem in Ray. We propose an attentive reinforcement learning method, designing an attention-based state encoder that could efficiently extract the system state in the situation of the varying number of resource nodes. At the same time, an action mask mechanism filters invalid actions. Further, to improve the learning efficiency in the environment with the varied number of nodes, we design a curriculum learning method, which trains the method by gradually increasing the number of nodes in the scheduling process. Finally, we use the real data generated by the Alibaba Cluster Trace Program to test in the simulation platform CloudSim. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively scales down the completion time of tasks compared to the original algorithm in Ray.},

  abstract  = {Path planning on grid-based obstacle maps is an essential and much-studied problem with applications in robotics and autonomy. Traditionally, in the AI community, heuristic search methods (e.g., based on Dijkstra, $\text{A}^{*}$, or random trees) are used to solve this problem. This search, however, incurs a high computational cost that grows with the size and resolution of the obstacle grid and has to be mitigated with effective heuristics to allow path planning in real-time. This work introduces a learning framework using a deep neural network with a stackable convolution kernel to establish a hierarchy of directional traversability representations with decreasing resolution that can serve as an efficient heuristic to guide a multi-resolution path planner. This path planner finds paths efficiently, starting on the lowest resolution traversability representation and then refining the path incrementally through the hierarchy until it addresses the original obstacle constraints. We demonstrate the benefits and applicability of this approach on datasets of maps created to represent both indoor and outdoor environments to represent different real-world applications. The conducted experiments show that our method can accelerate path planning by 40\% in indoor environments and 65\% in outdoor environments compared to the same heuristic search method applied to the original obstacle map, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this method.},

  abstract  = {With the advancement of society and technology, consumers are becoming more personalized and more willing to buy new products. To meet the diverse needs of consumers, the design and development of product lines have become an important strategic issue of enterprises. Based on the consumer choice model, this paper aims at the design and development of product lines and the purchase behavior of consumers. A two-stage pricing model is constructed under the condition of bundled sales of products and services. This paper analyzes the impact that enterprises should consider products with value-added services and consumers’ purchasing behavior on product line two-stage pricing. Research shows that the level of product value-added services and the degree of enterprise strategy will have an impact on the price of the product line and the enterprise’s profit. When the service level is higher, the enterprise’s product line price and profit will increase, and when the enterprise discount higher, the enterprise’s total profit and product line price will decrease.},

  abstract  = {In industrial processes, operating performance assessment is of great practical significance for guiding the production adjustment for operators. From the perspective of classification, operating performance assessment is considered as a multi-class classification problem. As a well-known one-class classifier, support vector data description (SVDD) are oriented to vector data and cannot deal with tensor data directly. Moreover, SVDD gives the target data set a spherically shaped description, which is a binary output. However, practical industrial data of different operating performance grade may have overlapping region, which is a knotty problem for classification. To handle above issues, a distributed operating performance assessment method based on probabilistic support tensor data description (PSTDD) is proposed in this work. First, the plant-wide process variables are selected and divided into several blocks. Then, a PSTDD model is developed in each block. Based on the assessment results of different blocks, a global assessment index is designed. If the process is running at non-optimal condition, the root cause are traced by variable contributions. Experimental results on a real hot strip mill process (HSMP) illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to the traditional distributed SVDD.},

Specifically, the CBDA introduces three improved factors that are the chaotic map, evolutionary population dynamics mechanism and binarization strategy to make the algorithm more suitable for the problem. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed CBDA on 24 well-known data sets from the UCI repository, and the results demonstrate that the proposed CBDA outperforms other comparative algorithms on the majority of the tested data sets.},

In this sense, decision support tools are of utmost importance for agents of social assistance programs. Thus, this paper proposes an approach based on feature engineering and machine learning to classify the violence suffered by a child. For this purpose, it was used a dataset obtained from a Chilean organization of social assistance for children. After the training and validation processes, the best machine learning models reached areas under the curve between 0.84 and 0.97, surpassing the state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract  = {Single image novel view synthesis allows the generation of target images with different views from a single input image. Pixel generation methods are one of the main approaches for novel view synthesis, with previous methods typically using the input images to infer the target image in the new view. However, only features from input images in the source view might not be sufficient to generate a good target image, especially when only a single input image is available. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based novel view synthesis approach that fuses features from an input and a warped image to collaboratively generate pixels in the new view. The warped image here is an intermediate output generated by projecting pixels of the input image onto the target view via an estimated depth. Since the estimated depth and the generated warped image are not perfect, errors will be introduced when generating target pixels. To alleviate these and to ensure better channel information between the features from input and warped image, channel attention blocks are employed. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our method produces excellent view synthesis results and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

Therefore, few-shot remote sensing image scene classification has been studied extensively. However, obtaining effect information from the limited amount of labeled samples is a great challenge. Most methods only extract features from a single perspective of remote sensing images. Such information is scarce and even misleading. To address the problem, we propose a multi-view feature fusion (MVFF) method. Specifically, first, train two feature extractor networks on the original image dataset and remote sensing image dataset, respectively. And each model extracts features before and after average pooling, and we obtain four kinds of features for a remote sensing image. Second, we calculate fusion weights from support set features using Multi-Head Feature Collaboration (MHFC) method and four classifiers. Third, we utilize the weights to fuse predictive probability matrices and thus obtain the labels of query set samples. We implement experiments on three benchmark remote-sensing image datasets to validate the performance of our method. And the results demonstrate that our approach effectively handles few-shot remote sensing image scene classification.},

The vehicle can obtain environmental information through different sensors, map it to the virtual coordinate system of the vehicle body to make decisions, and finally generate control instructions. However, a series of factors, such as complex road scenes, defective and irregular target sparse sampling, and large coding space, pose challenges to accurate, efficient, and stable perception results. To overcome the most challenging problem of dynamic target tracking, this paper designs a two-stage detection model based on non-uniform polar voxelization sampling of irregular 3D point cloud, which is used with local registration-based search to achieve efficient multi-target tracking. Non-uniform voxelization not only balances the spatial sampling and encoding efficiency of the point cloud for the backbone, but also adapts to the feature aggregation of the detection head, thereby achieving double acceleration. Finally, we tested our model on KITTI Tracking data. The comparison results show that the calculation speed of the final model is greatly improved and the tracking accuracy is competitive in all categories.},

  abstract  = {Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems are an emerging technology that supports reading and interpreting medical images. Since 3D brain MR images are high dimensional, dimensionality reduction is necessary for CBIR using machine learning techniques. In addition, for a reliable CBIR system, each dimension in the resulting low-dimensional representation must be associated with a neurologically interpretable region. We propose a localized variational autoencoder (Loc-VAE) that provides neuroanatomically interpretable low-dimensional representation from 3D brain MR images for clinical CBIR. Loc-VAE is based on $\beta-$VAE with the additional constraint that each dimension of the low-dimensional representation corresponds to a local region of the brain. The proposed Loc-VAE is capable of acquiring representation that preserves disease features and is highly localized, even under high-dimensional compression ratios (4096:1). The low-dimensional representation obtained by Loc-VAE improved the locality measure of each dimension by 4.61 points compared to naive $\beta-$VAE, while maintaining comparable brain reconstruction capability and information about the diagnosis of Alzheimer’ s disease.},

Many state-of-the-art detectors address this problem from different perspectives, but a comprehensive solution has not yet been obtained. In this paper, a solution is proposed that consists of two branches, one for channel-wise local feature learning and one for spatial-wise global feature learning. The combination of the local features, global contextual features, channel-wise attention features, and spatial attention features of the 3D point cloud is obtained through the two branches. Specifically, a generic spatial self-attention model is proposed that uses skeleton convolution to enhance the extraction of spatial features and combines it with a self-attention mechanism to improve the learning of global features. Further, the proposed skeleton attention mechanism focuses on object contour and rotation invariance of the point cloud. Through sufficient experimental validation, all module proposed in this paper are shown to have a substantial effect on performance and the visualization results demonstrate the importance of our approach.},

  abstract  = {In the recent 3D object detection methods for point clouds, the combination of point-based methods and voxel-based methods is gradually becoming a trend. Point-based methods retain the accurate position and pose information in the raw points and voxel-based methods get multi-scale structure information through the 3D backbone. However, because of the sparsity and irregularity of point clouds, both representations ignore the context information, which is important for the detection of sparse and small objects. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-stream feature aggregation network to extract features from three representations of the point cloud for object detection. Specifically, we exploit multi-stream features extracted from point, voxel, and perspective view (PV) respectively on a parallel way, where the complementary information between different perspectives can be used to enrich the feature representations, especially for the perspective view containing rich semantic context information. Secondly, to eliminate redundant information and better exploit the correlation between different feature representations, we design an attention-based multi-stream feature fusion module (MSFF) to combine features from three information streams. Besides, we introduce a new voxel RoI pooling with the self-attention in the second refinement stage, which can further strengthen the connection between local features in the proposal to obtain accurate classification and localization predictions. Our method achieves progressive results on the KITTI dataset, especially in the cyclist category, which improves the baseline significantly by 5.56\%, 4.73\%, 5.16\% AP in the test set for easy, moderate, and hard levels respectively.

The proposal stage focuses on voting to generate proposals, including the coordinates of proposals and the corresponding feature vectors. In order to obtain the local structure information, then calculate the multi-scale attention, and trace the multi-scale features of the proposal, an additional proposed coding contrast branch is introduced, which uses the proposed feature coding contrast loss to jointly optimize the feature representation and multi-scale attention modules.

Personalized therapies can be applied that meet the individual needs of patients, this can make the healthcare of cancer patients safer and more cost-effective. However, personalized therapy requires a reliable model of tumor dynamics and the effect of the drug applied during the therapy. Examining the effect of certain drugs on in vitro cell cultures helps us to gain understanding of the drug mechanism and create pharmacodynamics models. In vitro experiments provide a more cost-effective, ethical and more controllable way to examine the effect of chemotherapeutic agents.

In vitro experiments were carried out on Brcal– / –; p53 mice breast cancer cell line. The chemotherapeutic agents used were Doxil and Doxorubicin at different concentrations. Parameter identification was performed by fitting to data measured at 12 time points in 5 days. We examined how the presence or absence of necrotic rate n and an additional Hill coefficient affect the value of sum square error (SSE). We showed that the models that contain tumor cell necrosis and a general Hill function have the best performance for Doxil.},

We define medical lexicon construction as a high-quality phrase mining task.

Since there are multiple ectopic parathyroid glands, namely the position of the glands is not fixed. The clinical diagnosis and localization of HPT are difficult, which can easily results in underdiagnoses and misdiagnoses. This paper collected and produced two versions of datasets for the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of HPT in PASCAL VOC and COCO formats, respectively. Statistical analysis shows that 84.5\% of the HPT lesions in the ultrasonic images are medium-scale and large-scale targets. We proposed a hybrid detection network that employs CSPDarknet, spatial pyramid pooling net (SPPnet) and deformable transformer for automatically detecting HPT. We further introduced several attention networks combined with the CNN backbone to improve the network structure. Extensive experiments have been carried out on the datasets by combining various attention networks and the hybrid detection network. The experimental results illustrate that the inclusion of the channel attention mechanisms can improve the performance of HPT lesion detection more effectively than other hybrid networks, especially for large lesion objects. It implies that the channel-wise features are more critical for HPT detection than the global features and the spatial location features.},

  abstract  = {This article discusses the feasibility of classifying various situations for collaboration among medical staff engaged in surgery from videos taken in operating rooms. In video processing for medical use, especially for supporting surgery, many previous studies have attempted to recognize, from intraoperative videos, surgical phases constituting the workflows of specific surgical operations. However, it should also be significant to analyze, from videos obtained from observation cameras in operating rooms, how medical staff engaged in surgeries collaborate, with the aim of improving the efficiency and safety of collaboration among medical staff. The type of collaborative situations that occur are not predetermined but rather depend on actual behavior of medical staff during surgeries. Therefore, this study attempts to segment videos of surgical operating rooms into different collaborative situations by clustering the video frames based on similarities in the arrangements of medical staff. The arrangements are represented by the distributions of medical staff in the operating rooms as well as their observed postures observed in the video frames. In the results of our experiment with the video of a real surgery, some meaningful clusters of collaborative situations for medical staff could be obtained.},

  abstract  = {Online medical diagnosis refers to diagnosing diseases and providing treatment suggestions on the websites. It develops rapidly and has become a new choice for patients to seek medical treatment. Although manual online medical diagnosis is reliable, it has problems such as low efficiency, heavy burden on doctors, and long waiting time for patients. Relying on machines for automatic disease diagnosis is highly efficient, which, however, has low accuracy and reliability. In general, online medical diagnosis usually has two stages: inquiry and diagnosis. Inquiry stage refers to asking about the patient’s physiological, where the questions are usually streamlined, and thus can be handled by the machine. Diagnosis stage is to diagnose the disease and provide medical recommendations, which has strict requirements for accuracy and safety, and thus should be handled by the human. Inspired by this, in the paper we propose a human-machine collaboration based online medical diagnosis system, i.e., HM-MDS. In inquiry stage, the system employs the machine. It uses the BERT+CRF to identify symptoms in the patient’s dialogue and uses a DQN-based method to ask about symptoms. In diagnosis stage, the system employs both the machine and the human. The machine generates a pre-diagnosis result by calculating disease probability. Then the human doctor gives the final diagnosis result by checking the pre-diagnosis result and revising it if necessary. Obviously, HM-MDS can effectively save human doctor’s time as well as patient’s time, while ensure the accuracy of the diagnosis result. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset. The results show our approach improves the online medical diagnosis’s reliability as well as patient satisfaction, and ensures diagnosis accuracy. The time cost for a reliable medical diagnosis is reduced to 36\% compared with pure manual work.},

The method of searching pictures through pictures has been widely used in many online shopping platforms. In order to help customers find similar clothes accurately, we crawl images from some online shopping websites to build a new dataset to conduct clothing retrieval task. We also propose a new clothing retrieval neural network model, which integrates the advantages of Triplet Network, Perceptual Loss and Capsule Network, and extends the triplet sample learning mode to add multiple negative samples for training. In our proposed model, Vision Transformer and two newly proposed attention mechanisms are applied to the Capsule Network to strengthen the features in each capsule. The Perceptual concept helps the model to extract color and texture features, and connect them. Our newly modified loss function can help the model retrieve better results. The overall training does not need landmark annotation which makes model increase complexity. In the experiments, our model is compared with other state-of-the-art models and shows better performance.},

Recently, the human skeleton, which is compact and intuitive for representing actions and body movements, has been widely used in numerous HAR frameworks. Despite the great success of the skeleton-based HAR, several challenges remain, such as intra-class variability and inter-class similarity. In this paper, we address this task by first proposing a discriminative representation of the action-snippet (i.e., the very short sequence) that captures meaningful characteristics of human pose and body transition. We then employ adequate deep sequential neural networks (DSNNs) to thoroughly learn the temporal relation of action-snippets in a whole sequence. In experiments, the results show that the proposed approach achieves high recognition rates on benchmark datasets while maintaining good computational efficiency (i.e., lightweight networks and high recognition speed).},

This article will take the matching problem of video and music as the starting point in optimizing the music retrieval mode. To improve the multimedia website recommendation mechanism, a video and audio cross-domain recommendation model KATLN is proposed. We have incorporated the ideas of domain adaptation and attention mechanism, obtained rich item feature representations, captured users’ finer-grained interest preferences, and improved the accuracy of modeling. Through experiments, it can be seen that, compared with the existing mainstream algorithms, the KATLN proposed in this paper has outstanding performance and is more prominent in accurately grasping user preferences.},

  abstract  = {The accuracy of the initial field is crucial to the forecast results of numerical weather prediction (NWP). Data assimilation (DA) is a method to provide the initial field to the NWP. Currently, the hybrid 4DVar-EnKF DA method is the primary DA method used by operational NWP centres. The technique requires the derivation of the tangent linear and adjoint models for the nonlinear model, but it’s challenging to get the tangent linear and the adjoint models. Furthermore, this method usually adopts empirical coefficients to combine the four-dimensional variational assimilation (4DVar) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which reduces the accuracy of assimilation results. This paper builds a hybrid DA system based on a deep learning model (DL-HDA) in response to the above problems. First, we establish a forecast model based on the bilinear neural network (BNN) and use the tangent linear and adjoint models of the BNN for the 4DVar. Then, we utilize the ResNet model to combine the analysis of the 4DVar and the EnKF. The experiments are carried out on the Lorenz-96 model, and then the DL-HDA is compared with the traditional method. The experimental results show that the DL-HDA can improve the precision of assimilation results and decrease the system’s running time.},

Yet, the telehealth worker supervision is mandatory to ensure proper sampling procedure is followed and high-quality swab samples are taken. To reduce the load on the health workers in telehealth, we propose a system that eliminates the need for any human supervision by guiding the testers throughout the self-test to ensure the collection of high-quality swab samples. The proposed system takes a live video stream of the frontal face of a user as input and provides real-time instructions to do the self-test correctly with corrective actions when detecting wrong steps. This is mainly done using a collection of deep learning (DL) models. The system uses a novel swab position classification model, Small-MobileNetV2 with Depth-Wise Attention (S-MBNV2-DWAtt), to detect whether a swab is in one of the nostrils or not, which is an optimized version of MobileNetV2 in terms of parameter count and inference speed. The depth-wise attention block allows it to focus on specific parts of the images where the swabs would possibly lie. Lastly, a large-scale synthetic dataset is created to increase the generalization to a variety of swabs and users and a small real dataset is collected to finetune the model on scenes that are similar to the deployment scenarios. The proposed swab position classification model is found to have outstanding performance in terms of both accuracy and speed; it outperforms the ResNet and VGG architectures by 22.83\% and 35.11\% respectively on a real-world test set while operating at 25 FPS on CPU.},

  abstract  = {Pocket Switched Networks (PSNs) are an evolution of mobile ad-hoc and Delay Tolerant Networks in which there is no assumption made about the existence of a complete path between two nodes wishing to communicate, thus making routing even more challenging. Various routing algorithms have been proposed over the years like Epidemic, Spray and Wait, ProPHET, etc. There is a separate class of routing algorithms that exploit social structuralism to selectively forward messages to the best candidates. One such algorithm is BUBBLE Rap, which takes into account the notion of popularity and communities to make forwarding decisions. However, popularity as a sole deal-breaker is a rigid policy. We propose a decentralized community convergence-based message forwarding approach viz., De-COP that makes use of the familiarity metric which is dictated by the characteristic of a community to make message forwarding decisions. When familiarity is used for forwarding messages in converged communities, the messages are delivered with low latency and high probability. A community is defined as converged when the change in its membership is gradual. The forwarding node also takes into account the butter availability at the target node to reduce delay and message loss probability. The results were obtained using ONE simulator on two popular datasets, i.e., Infocomm06 and Cambridge to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed De-COP approach in terms of improved delivery probability and message overhead ratio compared to ProPHET and BUBBLE Rap.},

Function reordering is an essential step for profile-guided optimization. The state-of-the-art function reordering method performs on a unidirectional function call graph where nodes and edges define functions and caller-callee pairs. Each edge is labeled by its call frequency. However, we demonstrate that a bidirectional function call graph can represent the memory call better. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm SARSA to choose the appropriate order of functions by maximizing the total numbers of the function call through a bidirectional function call graph. In this paper, we use a self-developed tool to reordering functions. We first illustrate how our RL-based algorithm generates a new function order. Then we evaluate three algorithms on various applications, including Redis, Protobuf, and SPEC CPU benchmark. Our experiment results indicate that the new algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms in various applications, improving the resulting performance of practical applications. Especially on Redis, the performance is improved by 4.2\% on SARSA, which is better than C 3 (3.4\%) and ph (2.8\%).},

Specifically, this paper compares the combat SoS to an ecological network and develops a functional dependency network based effectiveness, resilience, and order-degree analysis method. Compared with the previous order-degree research, the proposed combat SoS architecture modeling and calcuation based on fucntional dependency network can reflect the rules of data exchanging more realistically. Based on the application to a notional anti-ship combat SoS, the order-degree is able to reflect the relationship between SoS resilience index and cost-effectiveness index (CEI) in the given scenarios.

  abstract  = {Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems have a great impact on improving people’s lives. One of the popular BCI implementations is the Event-Related Potential (ERP)-based spelling system which decodes electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to identify a target character. The effectiveness of BCI systems highly depends on the single trial decoding accuracy; however, the EEG signals are contaminated with diverse artifacts which leads to a poor signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, various filtering algorithms (e.g., FFT, CSP, Laplacian, PCA) have been applied to find the optimal subset of feature spaces in the temporal and spatial domains. These preprocessing steps could efficiently discard the artifacts and have shown superior performance with typical linear classifiers. However, there is a risk that the informative subspace can be also eliminated by the unsupervised learning process, and this algorithm is not proper to be employed in the end-to-end deep-learning architectures where all modules are differentiable. This study aims to propose a generalized deep neural network model by denoising the ERP signals and initializing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model parameters based on the autoencoder. Proposed CNN models indicate - 98.2\% spelling performance and - 91.5\% single trial accuracy which outperformed the state-of-the-art CNN models.},

  abstract  = {Drowsy driving causes severe road traffic accidents and significantly threatens road driving. Recently, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based drowsiness state classification has gained attention in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI). Because of the inter-and intra-subject variability of EEG signals, EEG-based drowsiness state classification is still challenging in developing an estimator applicable to unseen subjects. Generally, calibration sessions are required to tune the model with subject-specific data. In this paper, we propose an EEG-based driver drowsiness state (i.e., alert and drowsy) classification framework that improves the generalization performance to unseen subjects. Style features of multi-domain instances are mixed to generate unseen domains, and the distance of labels within classes is minimized to learn robust representations. Experiments were conducted on EEG data acquired from a drowsy driving experiment in a simulated-driving environment. Our proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 77.26\%, an F1-score of 0.6266, and a recall of 0.6813 across eleven subjects in leave-one-subject-out cross-validation.

  abstract  = {Mental stress is a significant factor in the development of a wide variety of psychological, emotional, behavioral, and physical illnesses. It is critical to accurately quantify mental stress, which needs reliable neuroimaging to monitor stress levels. In this work, we used a modified Stroop Color Word Task (SCWT) with time constraints and negative feedback to elicit two distinct degrees of stress in the workplace. We then used salivary alpha amylase (SAA) concurrently with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify the level of stress. We propose Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to decode the two classes of mental stress based on the fNIRS time series. Five-fold cross validation, two LSTM layers, as well as many trainable characteristics were used to construct the network. The induced mental stress increased the level of salivary alpha amylase significantly (p&lt;0.001) by 32.09\%. Likewise, we found that LSTM classified mental stress with an average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, equal to 72.5\%, 72\%, and 73\% respectively. The findings indicated that the developed LSTM could be used to effectively classify mental stress using fNIRS time series.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that controls computers by reflecting users’ intentions. Especially the electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI systems have been developed because of their potential utility. In BCI studies, controlling the drone swarm is one of the important issues since it improves work efficiency and safety. Also, current research has investigated how the drone swarms are controlled by imagining their formations using visual imagery (VI)-based EEG signals. The raw EEG signals and the spectrogram are widely used as input representations for decoding EEG signals. However, the decoding performance of the VI-based EEG signals is low to control the drone swarm due to noise in the raw EEG signals and information loss problems that may arise in the spectrogram. In this paper, we develop the EEGgram generator that extracts spectrogram-like features from the raw EEG signals minimizing information loss problems. Also, we propose the EEGgramNet, which could extract the significant information from VI-based EEG signals using both the spectrogram and the EEGgram as inputs. The proposed method outperforms an accuracy of 0.643, which is 8.4\% higher than that of the best conventional method. Hence, we demonstrate the possibility of constructing a VI-based BCI system to control the drone swarm by imagining its formations.},

  abstract  = {Many people experience motion sickness. In order to analyze a driver’s motion sickness state and prevent accidents, a method of estimating the degree of motion sickness based on bio-signals is emerging. The brain-computer interface (BCI) systems using electroencephalogram (EEG) are used as the most direct method of estimating motion sickness conditions. However, EEG-based systems suffer from variability between subjects and over time, so a calibration process is required for every use. To address this problem, we mitigate the need for calibration through cross-subject transfer learning between the target data and the multi-subjects source data. All experiments were conducted in a domain adaptation setting. Meanwhile, we assume that there is an ordinal relationship between motion sickness scores. Thus, we performed an ordinal classification task so that the feature vectors were mapped by reflecting the ordinal characteristics according to the motion sickness state. In this paper, we propose a motion sickness classification BCI framework in combination with ordinal classification, resting-state prototype-based ordinal distance learning, and a subject-specific embedding module. Taking into account constraints of ordinal rank, the feature extractor is trained with prototype-based ordinal distance learning to measure the relative distance between the resting-state and motion sickness state. We further utilize an embedding module that encodes subject-specific information combined with task discriminative features to be effective for domain adaptation tasks. The proposed framework achieved the highest performance (accuracy 60.21\%) through comparative experiments with other models.},

The overall architecture has been realized by developing control modules with the ROS environment, while the OpenVibe framework has been adopted to process the EEG signals.

Here we further explore the attributes to solve the matting problem in a pure classification way, which outperforms its regressive counterpart. We delved into the characteristics of $\alpha$ on alpha mattes. Then we chop the continuous alpha value from 0 to 1 into 21 segments, each of which accounts for one class. The 21 classes are encoded by a simple number from 0 to 20 and each class represents a corresponding alpha value. Thus each pixel in image belongs to one class. Our model can be trained with both classification loss and regression loss. The latter loss is implemented with soft-argmax, which makes the selection of maximum index differentiable. Through softargmax, our model can be aware of the distance relationship among all classes. Moreover, we find this strategy enables the two kinds of losses to promote each other during training, which allows our model converge further.},

However, most of these studies have been focused on applications like security and monitoring, smart devices, the internet of things, etc. On the other hand, HAR can help adjust and control wearable assistive devices, yet there has not been enough research facilitating its implementation. In this study, we propose several models to predict four activities from inertial sensors located in the ankle area of a lower-leg assistive device user. This choice is because they do not need to be attached to the user’s skin and can be directly implemented inside the control unit of the device. The proposed models are based on Artificial Neural Networks and could achieve up to 92.8\% average classification accuracy.},

However, there are still some challenges with this technology. First, the memory has insufficient representation capacity for features. Second, there is a contradiction between feature fusion and reconstruction. As feature fusion copies the abnormal patterns into the reconstructed frames, the abnormal frames are effectively reconstructed, reducing the detection performance. In response to these challenges, we use a memory update threshold to improve the representational power of memory. We also propose a dual-encoder anomaly detection model to restrict anomaly feature propagation. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.},

Convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved a remarkable result in image classification. However, training a high-performing model is a very complicated and time-consuming process because of the complexity of image recognition applications. On the other hand, transfer learning is a relatively new learning method that has been employed in many sectors to achieve good performance with fewer computations. In this research, the PyTorch pre-trained models (VGG19_bn and WideResNet -101) are applied in the MNIST dataset for the first time as initialization and with modified fully connected layers. The employed PyTorch pre-trained models were previously trained in ImageNet. The proposed model is developed and verified in the Kaggle notebook, and it reached the outstanding accuracy of 99.77\% without taking a huge computational time during the training process of the network. We also applied the same methodology to the SIIM-FISABIO-RSNA COVID-19 Detection dataset and achieved 80.01\% accuracy. In contrast, the previous methods need a huge compactional time during the training process to reach a high-performing model.

However, without the assistance of heterogeneous information, it is difficult to obtain detailed human parsing directly. At present, although some studies have introduced heterogeneous data to guide human parsing task, such as pose estimation and edge prediction, the correlations between these heterogeneous data has not been effectively utilized. To avoid the distribution gap among heterogeneous data, we proposed a Heterogeneous Interactive Attention Network (HIANet), in which we exploit the attention between heterogeneous data to capture long-distance context dependence. And the supplementary cues with plentiful interaction can mutually guide multi-source features to correct their respective prediction errors, further refine the result of human parsing. Extensive experiments on three human body parsing datasets are conducted, especially on the LIP dataset, where the mean accuracy and mean Intersection-over-Union of the proposed HIANet are improved by 2.86\% and 3.90\% compared with PGECNet, respectively.

  abstract  = {Optical flow estimation is an essential task in computer vision. Standard cameras are prone to blurred images or over-saturated regions under extreme conditions. The event camera is a novel vision sensor inspired by the biological retina. It has the advantages of high time resolution, low delay and high dynamic range. We propose a new event representation and a novel deep learning network E-HANet (Event-based Hybrid Attention Network) for event-based dense optical flow estimation. To take full advantage of the complementarity between positive and negative events, we introduce the stacked positive and negative event slices as input. The feature extractor based on the channel attention is able to model the features from different event slices and fuse them by weight. We then present the hybrid attention weighting module to globally aggregate motion features. Compared to the event-based state-of-the-art, our approach reduces the average end-point error by 3\% on the MVSEC dataset and 20\% on the DSEC-Flow dataset.},

  abstract  = {Sarcasm is a sophisticated expression, commonly used on social media, e.g., Reddit and Twitter. The presence of sarcasm in social media text flips the polarity of sentiment, thus hindering the performance of works that require true sentiment, e.g., sentiment analysis and opinion mining. However, current works fail to exploit commonsense knowledge in the sarcasm detection task. In this paper, we revisit sarcasm detection from a novel perspective, which models commonsense knowledge as well as context semantics to reason with sarcasm. More specifically, we propose a commonsense-aware model with a heterogeneous graph attention network that leverages commonsense knowledge, enabling it to better understand implied sentiment behind the literal meaning. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from Reddit and Internet Argument Corpus. Experimental results show that our proposed approach yields superior performance with commonsense knowledge integrated.},

  abstract  = {The rapid development of social media makes it easy for people to acquire information while also providing a platform for publishing and spreading fake news. Fake news brings plenty of explicit and implicit risks to social stability, making fake news detection an issue that deserves attention. Recent methods based on graph neural networks (GNN) achieve impressive results in fake news detection, but their performance is still limited in practice due to the absence of high-order relations between nodes. In this paper, we propose a Sentiment-Aware Hypergraph Attention Network (SA-HyperGAT) for fake news detection. SA-HyperGAT can better leverage different kinds of information from news contents and user comments with hypergraphs, which can capture higher-order dependency between words and sentences compared with general graphs. Specifically, we first construct two hypergraphs with distinct types of nodes and hyperedges to utilize structural information of news contents and sentimental information of user comments. Then we adopt a hypergraph attention network with a dual attention mechanism to learn the composed representations of two hypergraphs for the final prediction. Our proposed SA-HyperGAT outperforms competitive baselines on two real-world datasets. Extensive experimental results prove the effectiveness of each component in SA-HyperGAT.},

First, a dynamic explosion amplitude mechanism based on the evolution speed of the population is designed. The evolution speed of the population is dynamically adjusted by evaluating the evolution speed of the fitness in each iteration process, and the global and local search information is controlled. Secondly, the small-hole imaging reverse learning strategy combined with the idea of optimal-worst reverse learning is proposed. This strategy increases the diversity of the optimal-seeking positions and improves the ability of the algorithm to jump out of the local optimum; Finally, the current position is updated according to the position and speed of each firework, and the globally optimal fireworks and personally optimal fireworks are updated simultaneously to improve the individual heuristic learning ability. Through the simulation experiments on the CEC2015 test function and comparison with related algorithms, the results show that the algorithm performs better in convergence speed, computational accuracy, and stability.},

Hessian free (HF) optimization is an efficiency second-order algorithm to minimize the object function in LF models. An HF-based second-order LF model can achieve better accuracy representation results than first-order ones with affordable computational burden. However, its low rank representation ability relies on a more complex training process, multiple hyper-parameters work cooperatively to decide the results. Thus, these hyper-parameters should be turned with care since they are mutually influenced. The heavy hyper-parameters turning work reduces the practicability of a second-order LF model. To address this issue, this study incorporates the principle of particle swarm optimization into the second-order LF model to propose an adaptive second-order LF (ASLF) model. Experimental results on three HDI matrices reveal that ASLF model can be fine-tuned adaptively with acceptable computation burden.},

In order to deploy charging plies in the existing parking lots more reasonably, this paper intends to propose a fine-grained layout model based on the Voronoi diagram and further develop an adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) approach. First, a point-based method is used to estimate charging demands. Second, combined with the Voronoi diagram, this paper proposes a fine-grained layout model of charging piles in parking lots with the goal of maximizing the social benefit. Third, the APSO is developed to solve the optimization problem. Finally, the performance of the model and the proposed algorithm is analyzed through an example in terms of the satisfaction of user needs, the benefits of parking lots, and the density of the charging piles. The numerical experimental results verify the universality and rationality of the proposed model, and thus the proposed model can provide a certain decision-making basis for theoretical and practical research into the new energy vehicle industry.},

  abstract  = {Reversible circuits are the essential building blocks of quantum computers and have zero energy dissipation. However, there is no general rule on how to synthesize an effective circuit with minimal cost. Many researchers have placed a high value on the design of algorithms for reversible circuit synthesis as it is the fundamental component to implement in many paradigms, such as Shor’s algorithm. In this paper, the knowledge navigated quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm (KNQTS) is proposed to synthesize several benchmark functions. KNQTS is a quantum-inspired algorithm with the concept of getting closer to the best solution and keeping away from the worst solution, and it has a great search ability. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm uses self-adaptive, global-best guided and Quantum-Not gate mechanisms to make all procedures more efficient and avoid sticking to the local optimum. This paper also compares the KNQTS approach’s experimental results with those obtained via other metaheuristics and previous algorithms. Finally, the result shows that the proposed KNQTS method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves the same functionality at a lower cost. The solutions are optimal or near-optimal.},

We contribute to this problem by introducing an intermediate which connect the NG method to the smoothed function. On the one hand, this connection reveals that applying the NG method to a function is the same as applying the gradient method to the corresponding function smoothed by the noise; and on the other hand, it allows us to establish the convergence behavior of the NG in a global sense. Moreover, we also consider what conditions make the global minimizer of the smoothed function not far from the original global minimizer.},

As a common defects, missing-cap defects of insulators will not only affect the structural strength of power insulators, but also bring a certain effect to the stable power transmission. With the rapid development of machine learning, some machine learning-based defect recognition methods have been proposed for fast and high-precision power inspection. However, the handcrafted features could not effectively express the aerial images against complex inspection environment to affect detection performance of the shallow learning algorithms. And the detection precision of deep learning algorithms will be affected by the unbalanced small-scale defects. Therefore, the fast and high-precision power inspection still faces a certain challenge in the smart grid. To address the above issues, fusion with the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and transfer learning, a novel fault diagnosis algorithm of power insulators is proposed to provide a fast and accurate power inspection scheme. To remove complex backgrounds, a fast insulator location algorithm based on the lightweight YOLOV4 model is proposed which is served for the following defect recognition. On the basis, to imitate human vision, a defect recognition algorithm is proposed based on multi-feature fusion. Meanwhile, to ensure the feature expression ability of transfer learning on power insulators, a novel optimization strategy of transfer learning is proposed to improve the recognition precision.

  abstract  = {Remote Attestation (RA) is a security service by which a Verifier (Vrf) can verify the platform state of a remote Prover (Prv). However, in most existing RA schemes, the Prv might be vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) attacks due to the interactive challenge-response methodology while there is no authentication about the challenge. Worse, many schemes cannot effectively detect mobile malware that can be inactive during the on-demand attestation launched by the Vrf. In this paper, we propose a self-measurement RA for SGX-based platforms, which can effectively mitigate DoS attacks and defend against mobile malware. To this end, a two-way identity authentication is first enforced between the Prv and Vrf with the help of a blockchain system, in which a shared session key is also generated. Secondly, trigger conditions of measurements on the Prv’s side are time points generated by the Prv self instead of Vrf’s requests. The Vrf can retrieve multiple self-measurement results during one execution of the protocol to monitor the Prv’s platform over a period of time continuously, which can detect mobile malware effectively. Our scheme utilizes SGX to provide the runtime protection for sensitive information such as session key, self-measurement code, time points of self-measurements, and self-measurement results, making a higher security guarantee. In addition, the session key, time points of self-measurements, and self-measurement code can be changed or upgraded, making our scheme more flexible and scalable. The simulation implementation and results show that our scheme is feasible and practical.},

  abstract  = {Trusted requirements affect the trusted attributes of software, and have an important impact on whether trusted software can meet the trusted requirements. However, despite the continuous development of society and technology, the work of obtaining and analyzing trusted requirements has not become easy, has become more and more difficult. In the process of obtaining trusted requirements, a series of problems, such as low efficiency and inaccurate acquisition of requirements, serious software quality problems, budget overruns and delivery delays, have become increasingly prominent. In view of the above problems, this paper integrates the concept of meta-requirement into trusted requirement. Based on the respective characteristics of meta-requirement and trusted requirement, this paper puts forward the concept of trusted meta-requirement, and introduces the basic elements and characteristics. Then the trusted meta-requirements and some rules involved in it are formalized by the combination of first-order logic and set theory in order to improve the accuracy of the description and analysis of trusted requirements.},

However, while detection of typical failures, e.g., those related to battery voltage, can be performed in an automated manner, more complex scenarios require expert knowledge and human monitoring. In this paper, we evaluate recurrent neural network-based (RNN) energy consumption forecasting using other telemetry features. We aim to find models well suited for anomaly detection methods working on the analysis of error between forecasted and actual values. We compare the results of RNN architectures on our data and public vehicle energy datasets. We demonstrate that RNN-based forecasting, together with a proper selection of telemetry features used in prediction, can be effectively utilized on AGV telemetry data as a first step in anomaly detection schemes.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, great attention has been paid on Electric Vehicles (EVs) in terms of environmental pollution. Here, EVs can greatly reduce the environmental pollution, compared with traditional Internal Combustion Vehicles (ICVs). However, since EVs cannot be replenished fast like ICVs, the rigid deployment of charging infrastructure and its limited charging capability, leads to service congestion particularly due to a large number of EVs being parked with charging demand. Compared to CSs with rigid extension in location and charging facilitates, the Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charging service provides a spatial and temporal advance in flexibility, with potential to supplement with G2V charging mode, which can supplement or even replace the G2V Charging Mode. In this paper, we propose a hybrid V2V charging scheme, consisting of direct and asynchronous V2V charging modes, to achieve a great charging flexibility and alleviate the burden for grid load. Here, we estimate the Minimum Waiting Time (MWT) under each mode, as guidance to switch between modes and optimize charging service under each mode. Results show that our proposed hybrid V2V charging scheme outperforms literature works, in terms of average waiting time and number of full charged EVs.},

In this paper, we present a real scenario in which Autonomous Guided Vehicles (AGVs) equipped with Collaborative robots (Cobots) are used as transportation and production units, and therefore, a set of communication services must be implemented. The challenges associated with moving AGVs are discussed, and the associated requirements that apply to wireless communication are presented.

  abstract  = {Nowadays, autonomous mobile robots support people in many areas where human presence either redundant or too dangerous. They have successfully proven themselves in expeditions, gas industry, mines, warehouses, etc. However, even legged robots may stuck in rough terrain conditions requiring human cognitive abilities to navigate the system. While gamepads and keyboards are convenient for wheeled robot control, the quadruped robot in 3D space can move along all linear coordinates and Euler angles, requiring at least 12 buttons for independent control of their DoF. Therefore, more convenient interfaces of control are required.In this paper we present HyperPalm: a novel gesture interface for intuitive human-robot interaction with quadruped robots. Without additional devices, the operator has full position and orientation control of the quadruped robot in 3D space through hand gesture recognition with only 5 gestures and 6 DoF hand motion.The experimental results revealed to classify 5 static gestures with high accuracy (96.5\%), accurately predict the position of the 6D position of the hand in three-dimensional space. The absolute linear deviation Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the proposed approach is 11.7 mm, which is almost 50\% lower than for the second tested approach, the absolute angular deviation RMSD of the proposed approach is 2.6 degrees, which is almost 27\% lower than for the second tested approach. Moreover, the user study was conducted to explore user’s subjective experience from human-robot interaction through the proposed gesture interface. The participants evaluated their interaction with HyperPalm as intuitive (2.0), not causing frustration (2.63), and requiring low physical demand (2.0).},

  abstract  = {Quadruped platforms have become an active topic of research due to their high mobility and traversability in rough terrain. However, it is highly challenging to determine whether the clattered environment could be passed by the robot and how exactly its path should be calculated. Moreover, the calculated path may pass through areas with dynamic objects or environments that are dangerous for the robot or people around. Therefore, we propose a novel conceptual approach of teaching quadruped robots navigation through user-guided path planning in virtual reality (VR). Our system contains both global and local path planners, allowing robot to generate path through iterations of learning. The VR interface allows user to interact with environment and to assist quadruped robot in challenging scenarios. The results of comparison experiments show that cooperation between human and path planning algorithms can increase the computational speed of the algorithm by 35.58\% in average, and non-critically increasing of the path length (average of 6.66\%) in test scenario. Additionally, users described VR interface as not requiring physical demand (2.3 out of 10) and highly evaluated their performance (7.1 out of 10). The ability to find a less optimal but safer path remains in demand for the task of navigating in a cluttered and unstructured environment.},

Production processes are expected to be designed around operator’s needs, for a more sustainable contribution of industry to society. In this broad context, in this paper we consider the problem of monitoring operator’s condition and, specifically, detecting any mental or physical fatigue they might be experiencing in workplaces. Indeed, if the onset of any source of fatigue is monitored, it is possible to introduce assistive strategies that preserve productivity, on the one side, and operator’s wellbeing, on the other side. To achieve this goal, we detect mental and physical fatigue conditions via physiological monitoring, by means of a wearable device that measures cardiac activity. We design an experimental protocol such that test participants are exposed to mental and physical fatigue. Their heart rate variability is then extracted and analysed to discriminate among rest, mental fatigue, physical fatigue and joint mental and physical fatigue. The achieved results show that statistically significant differences can be found in time-domain metrics. Moreover, the analysis of the empirical distribution functions shows, for each metrics, the conditions that exhibit the greatest differences and, hence, that can be distinguished more accurately. However, results show also that, in the presence of physical fatigue, it is difficult to detect the presence of additional mental fatigue.},

Discussion data containing approximately 5,000 utterances were subjected to entropy and content analysis. The results showed a distinct difference in cognitive patterns in discussions conducted on various platforms, as online discussions require more cognitive effort for technological equipment operation. Online meeting solutions were found to be less developed than those generated in offline meetings. According to the results obtained, we propose a series of high-level platform-neutral steps for small-scale problem-solving.

Thereby, the dynamics of the human body can significantly influence the entire system behavior and thus it is important to consider during the design process. For the modeling language Modelica no simulation library for this application is available, so far. The language is especially suitable for the simulation across different domains, which makes a DHM in Modelica useful. In this paper a DHM predicting the dynamic behavior of the human body during human-machine interaction is implemented in Modelica. It consists of a multi-body skeleton model, an inverse kinematics algorithm for the limbs and a controller for the skeleton joints inspired by human motor control. The capability of the proposed simulation approach to take the relevant dynamical properties of the human body and motor control into account is demonstrated in a use-case simulation.

  abstract  = {Accurate prediction of water quality indicators can effectively prevent sudden water pollution events, and control pollution diffusion. Neural networks, e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) and encoder-decoder network, have been widely used to predict time series data. However, as the water quality data increases, it becomes unstable and highly nonlinear. Accurate prediction of water quality becomes a big challenge. This work proposes a hybrid prediction method called VBAED to predict the water quality time series. VBAED combines Variational mode decomposition (VMD), Bidirectional input Attention mechanism, an Encoder with bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and a Decoder with temporal attention mechanism and LSTM. Specifically, VBAED first adopts VMD to decompose the ground truth time series, and the decomposed results are used as the input along with other features. Then, a bidirectional input attention mechanism is adopted to add weights to input features from both directions. VBAED adopts BiLSTM as an encoder to extract hidden features from input features. Finally, the predicted result is obtained by an LSTM decoder with a temporal attention mechanism. Real-life data-based experiments demonstrate that VBAED obtains the best prediction results compared with other widely used methods.},

In recent years, neural networks represented by Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Encoder-Decoder (ED) frameworks have been shown to be suitable for prediction of time series data. However, traditional statistical methods cannot capture nonlinear characteristics of the water quality, and deep learning models often suffer from gradient disappearance and gradient explosion problems. This work proposes a hybrid water quality prediction method called VBEG, which combines V ariational Mode Decomposition (VMD), B iLSTM, an E D structure, and G enetic Simulated annealing-based particle swarm optimization (GSPSO). VBEG first adopts VMD to deal with nonlinear features in the original time series. Then, VBEG combines BiLSTM and the ED structure to capture bi-directional long-term correlations, and realize dimensionality reduction, respectively. Furthermore, VBEG adopts GSPSO to optimize its hyperparameters. Experimental results with real-life datasets demonstrate that the proposed VBEG outperforms two current state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The consumption disaggregation is of paramount importance to the management and efficient use of electricity. Thus, new supervised and unsupervised approaches to nonintrusive load monitoring have been proposed by research groups around the world. In this sense, the present paper proposes an approach based on the DAMICORE clustering algorithm. For that, an experimental bench composed of six appliances was used, which had their individual and combined current signatures acquired. Therefore, scenarios in which there is an overlap in the consumption were considered. Based on the current measurements, the signals were windowed (1 and 1/2 cycle) and, subsequently, features at the time and frequency domains were extracted. These features were then submitted to the clustering stage to identify the state of each appliance. Due to the balancing of the dataset, the accuracy was calculated to determine the DAMICORE performance. Thus, it was possible to observe that the use of 1-cycle windows allowed obtaining a better average accuracy (80.16\%) when using all extracted features. However, when considering only the most relevant feature types per appliance, there was an improvement in the average accuracy, reaching 87.83\% and proving to be better than the state-of-the-art approaches.},

Firstly, the power cost model for residential users and the specific charge-discharge models of electric vehicles and energy storage equipment is constructed. Then the whole energy scheduling process is formulated as a multi-variable mixed integer linear programming (MV-MILP) problem, whose objective is to minimize the power cost of end-users. The differential evolution algorithm is adopted to solve the problem, and the scaling factor adaptation is further used to accelerate the convergence.

Establishing such trust demands the machines’ adaptivity to the cognitive workload (CWL) of the humans. The CWL is conventionally measured as self-reported scores from a NASA-TLX questionnaire, susceptible to individual subjectivity. In contrast, logged brainwaves are useful for measuring the CWL objectively. However, there is a literature gap of mapping the brainwaves to a CWL factor - i.e., physical demand. As a feasibility, we thus proposed an activity ratio (AR) to measure the physical demand from the brainwaves. Statistical analyses indicated significant correlations between the AR and self-reported scores of the physical demand, compared to a well-known engagement ratio. This finding implied the feasibility of the AR to measure the physical demand.},

In this article, we thus provide an analysis of EEG features such as various band powers and connectivity based features to evaluate the meditation effects. Also, we provide a classification framework to classify the meditation states from the baseline EEG states. We report our results on an in house dataset of 20 participants(10 experienced and 10 novice) who underwent a two-week long mantra meditation practice. Strikingly we have found out that, as the novice participants practice meditation overtime, the accuracies of machine learning classification between the baseline EEG versus meditative EEG of the novice increase significantly, as an indication of their enhanced meditation experiences. Also, we found out that even such short and regular meditation practices, the cognitive abilities of novice meditators get enhanced which are evaluated through Brain-Based Intelligence Test (BBIT) psychometric tests and the results that got reflected in their EEG correlates.},

The model can simulate or predict the performance in each run of the task. An average $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ score of 94.15\% and 94.11\% was achieved on validation data for simulation and 1-step ahead prediction, respectively.

  abstract  = {Digital platforms could facilitate meditation practice by discriminating the participants’ mental state in real time based on neural activities. However, the search for neural correlates of meditative states yields contradictory results in the literature. To identify the neural signature of meditation, we propose a Random Forest classifier to discriminate between a Focused Attention Meditation (FAM) and a problem-solving task, based on two-second samples of EEG data. Two types of classifiers are considered: individual classifiers, trained on EEG data from the considered subject, and general classifiers, trained on inter-individual data. Our results show that the individual classifiers achieve superior performance with an average accuracy of 93\% over 14 subjects. The general classifiers display a lower accuracy (74\% and 54\% depending on whether the data from the tested subject was included in the training set). This study suggests that automatic detection of meditative processes greatly benefits from intra-personal training. The most discriminating EEG features between the two tasks are the Beta mean band amplitude and the Theta-Gamma phase-amplitude coupling, particularly in the occipital and left centro-temporal brain regions. Our findings favor personalized classifiers for FAM.},

A large-scale prior map usually means huge amount of calculation for point cloud processing, which leads to the long time required for global localization. To deal with this problem, we propose a fast point cloud global localization method based on point clouds segmentation and learning-based descriptor. On the one hand, cylindrical filtering, ground-point removal and point cloud segmentation are adopted to eliminate a large number of useless points and retain points with rich structures, which improves the efficiency of point cloud registration. On the other hand, reliable 3D point cloud descriptor, two-phase search strategy for place recognition and geometric consistency verification are used to ensure the localization accuracy. Experiments prove that the proposed method achieves good localization effect on both KITTI and MVSEC datasets. Under the condition of ensuring the high localization accuracy, the time for point clouds to complete the global localization is greatly reduced.},

In most popular tracking paradigms, we find that the local receptive field introduced by the convolutional neural network prevents the tracker from focusing on the long-range dependency. Although the Vision transformer brings the global receptive field in downstream tasks, its computational burden remains unaffordable. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective Multilayer Perceptron-based Tracking (MLPT), including the global receptive field. The MLPT contains three Components: Feature Correlation (FC) module, Global Information Encoder (GIE) module and Corner Head(CH). Firstly, the FC module is proposed to effectively converge the template and search region features for generating delicate features. Secondly, the GIE is designed to integrate the channel and spatial-information dealed with channel-encoding the token-encoding, separately. Specially, the same kernel is utilized for token-encoding in all channels so that our model has the global receptive field. Then, the CH is applied to establish a simple flexible way via computing the box corners coordinates for tracking. Finally, the MLPT, to our knowledge, is the first baseline of MLP-based architecture for object tracking. Extensive experiments are conducted on four challenging datasets, including GOT-10K, LaSOT, UAV123, and TrackingNet. The results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) optimization scheme is proposed for collision-free path planning taking into account the ship dynamics and International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) explicitly. It utilizes three potential fields which are designed based on COLREGS and the experience of navigators. Different tuning parameter sets are tested in a single encounter scenario including give-way, head-on and overtaking, and multiple ship encounter with 5 target ships is evaluated. The simulation shows promising results where the own ship can perform evasive action according to different encounter types following COLREGS Rule 13-15 and achieve the target positions while maintaining a safe distance during the collision avoidance period. The shortest distances between the own ship and target ships in multiple encounter scenario are all larger than 250m, which further proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

Thus, there is a gap on considering human and machine reliability concurrently in HMS. To fill the gap, this study investigated the feasibility of such concurrent consideration by using a virtual environment (VE) approach to simulate an HMS. In a developed VE, each human participant performed a task of exploring an invisible surface to perceive its shape, followed by his/her response to a recommendation about the shape made by the VE setting (the machine). Related to human reliability, the perception might be disrupted through a mismatch between the actual shape and force feedback delivered to the participant’s hand. Associated with machine reliability, the recommendation could be incorrect to induce a fault in the setting. Thus, the shape of the invisible surface became an instrument to combine human and machine reliability. The outcomes of the study confirmed the feasibility of combining human and machine reliability in the HMS. Moreover, human reliability might be dominant in the HMS to accomplish the task.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic identification of a robot manipulator is a canonical problem in robotics and is usually solved by employing the least squares technique, considering the so-called base parameters of the robot. Such parameters, however, differ from those to which we really want to have access, such as the center of mass and the moments of inertia with respect to this center. Furthermore, the solution obtained by this technique can lead to unsuitable parameters from a physical point of view, which requires a later stage of physical feasibility analysis. In this article, we seek to overcome these drawbacks by identifying the parameters of a 7-DoF lightweight robot using only population-based metaheuristics. We make a study between different techniques and compare them with Bayesian optimization, another black-box approach. We also propose a new algorithm called Probabilistic Differential optimization and show that this algorithm is more efficient than the others considered and can find a physically feasible solution because of its probabilistic exploration ability. We also study the need for more than one excitation trajectory to overcome measurement noise and overfitting, and finally obtain accurate parameters of the Kinova Gen3 arm equipped with a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper.},

A simplified 1 degree-of-freedom mathematical model of a monohull marine vessel based on the lumped parameter approach is considered along with the canting keel system. Then, in order to compensate for unknown plant dynamics as well as time-varying load disturbances, a simple sliding-mode controller is proposed. Simulation results are finally given to illustrate the potential of the approach.},

  abstract  = {The cooperation between humans and robots is of great importance e.g. in medical, industrial or service applications. Here, the task to be pursued by the robot often depends on the current goal of the human. In cases where a direct communication of the human’s goal is impractical or even impossible, an estimation of the human’s goal is necessary. This estimation as well as potential process or measurement noise introduces uncertainty that needs to be taken into consideration during the planning of the robot’s actions. To this end, we propose an automation comprising an Unscented Kalman filter as state estimator, a model based intention recognition algorithm to estimate the human’s goal and a model predictive belief space controller based on Belief i-LQG explicitly considering the estimation uncertainty. We report on a simulated scenario featuring a mobile robot platform cooperating with a human. It demonstrates the ability of the proposed automation to actively reduce uncertainty about the system states and the human’s goal while successfully pursuing the overall cooperative task.},

In Humanitude, the patients are assisted through various techniques to stand up independently by utilizing their motor functions as much as possible. Humanitude care techniques encourage caregivers to increase the area of contact with patients during the sit-to-stand motion. However, Humanitude care techniques are not accurately performed by novice caregivers. Therefore, in this study, a smock-type wearable sensor was developed to measure the proximity between caregivers and care recipients during sit-to-stand motion assistance. A measurement experiment was conducted to evaluate the proximity differences between Humanitude care and simulated novice care. In addition, the effects of different care techniques on the center of mass (CoM) trajectory and muscle activity of the care recipients were investigated. The results showed that the caregivers tend to bring their top and middle trunk closer in Humanitude care compared with novice simulated care. Furthermore, it was observed that the CoM trajectory and muscle activity under Humanitude care were similar to those observed when the care recipient stands up independently. These results validate the effectiveness of Humanitude care and provide useful information for teaching techniques in Humanitude.},

  abstract  = {Early depression detection research employs machine learning models trained on crowd-sourcing data. The training data easily suffer from label noise due to weak self-perception of people and uncontrollability of collection process. The noise issue is seldom discussed in the previous depression detection work. In this work, we firstly introduce the influence-based relabeling method in the depression detection task to revise noise labels, and further move one step forward to propose a threshold ratio function to control the relabeling sample size. The relabeling sample size is usually ignored in the previous influence function, so that the relabeling is sometimes overwhelming, leading to great change on the distribution of the training data, and model performance decline. Our proposed method aims at avoiding giant change on the training data. To achieve this, we design an adjustable ratio threshold for the samples to be relabeled. The ratio is adjusted according to the trained model performance. If the model has good performance on the validation set, the relabeling ratio tends mild, otherwise, the relabeling can be aggressive. In the experiments, we recruited 205 participants and collect the usage data from smartphones and wearable bands, including participants’ response to the questionnaire Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. We discuss several main stream denoising methods and compare four most recent methods in the depression detection task. The proposed model achieves a best testing F1 score of 86.3\%.},

This work proposes a new lexicographic bi-objective MAPF considering different task types, where agents are divided into two kinds to perform critical and acritical tasks. This is common in practical intelligent warehousing scenarios where a critical/acritical-task-performing agent (called c-agent and a-agent, respectively) may represent a full-load/no-load one or the one conducting urgent/non-urgent tasks. The primary objective is to minimize the sum-of-costs of c-agents, while the secondary objective is to minimize the sum-of-costs of a-agents. Two MAPF algorithms are modified to fit and solve the concerned problem for the first time. Moreover, four improvement strategies are embedded to the proposed algorithms and proved to be effective in solving MAPF problems with different task types.},

  abstract  = {Indoor thermal comfort in smart buildings has a significant impact on the health and performance of occupants. Consequently, machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to solve challenges related to indoor thermal comfort. Temporal variability of thermal comfort perception is an important problem that regulates occupant well-being and energy consumption. However, in most ML-based thermal comfort studies, temporal aspects such as the time of day, circadian rhythm, and outdoor temperature are not considered. This work addresses these problems. It investigates the impact of circadian rhythm and outdoor temperature on the prediction accuracy and classification performance of ML models. The data is gathered through month-long field experiments carried out in 14 classrooms of 5 schools, involving 512 primary school students. Four thermal comfort metrics are considered as the outputs of Deep Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine models for the dataset. The effect of temporal variability on school children’s comfort is shown through a “time of day” analysis. Temporal variability in prediction accuracy is demonstrated (up to 80\%). Furthermore, we show that outdoor temperature (varying over time) positively impacts the prediction performance of thermal comfort models by up to 30\%. The importance of spatio-temporal context is demonstrated by contrasting micro-level (location specific) and macro-level (6 locations across a city) performance. The most important finding of this work is that a definitive improvement in prediction accuracy is shown with an increase in the time of day and sky illuminance, for multiple thermal comfort metrics.},

Therefore, methods of detection of misconfigurations of said inverters using operational data at transformers are presented and compared. These methods include preprocessing by dimensionality reduction as well as detection by supervised learning approaches. The data used is of high reliability as it was collected in a lab setting reenacting typical and relevant grid operation situations. Furthermore, this data was recreated by simulation to validate the simulation data, which could also potentially be used for detection applications on a bigger scale.

To help the adoption of the digital twin concept, a general architecture that may be tuned to the needs of the physical application is required.Within this paper, we propose an architecture for digital twins in IEC61499 based distributed control systems. Using this architecture, we construct the model based on known physics and sensor data to be used in the digital twin for simulation purposes. This demonstrates itself as an effective method for constructing the model of a digital twin for the purposes of dynamic simulation and control. With this base architecture in place, we may now work towards expanding the capability of the set-up to that of a full digital twin.},

  abstract  = {In recent engineering applications using deep learning, physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a new development as it can exploit the underlying physics of engineering systems. The novelty of PINN lies in the use of partial differential equations (PDE) for the loss function. Most PINNs are implemented using automatic differentiation (AD) for training the PDE loss functions. A lesser well-known study is the use of finite difference method (FDM) as an alternative. Unlike an AD based PINN, an immediate benefit of using a FDM based PINN is low implementation cost. In this paper, we propose the use of finite difference method for estimating the PDE loss functions in PINN. Our work is inspired by computational analysis in electromagnetic systems that traditionally solve Laplace’s equation using successive over-relaxation. In the case of Laplace’s equation, our PINN approach can be seen as taking the Laplacian filter response of the neural network output as the loss function. Thus, the implementation of PINN can be very simple. In our experiments, we tested PINN on Laplace’s equation and Burger’s equation. We showed that using FDM, PINN consistently outperforms non-PINN based deep learning. When comparing to AD based PINNs, we showed that our method is faster to compute as well as on par in terms of error reduction.},

  abstract  = {Since vaccination started, the COVID-19 scenario has improved. On the other hand, although the number of deaths has significantly dropped, the number of new cases is still a concern. Thus, patient tracking and follow-up are essential tasks, and chest X-ray examination is the first-order tool. While several studies using CXR and computing have been developed, they did not translate into clinical applications yet. One of the reasons is the computational effort required to run huge deep learning models and its high cost to be adopted in community clinics. Therefore, this work proposes a lightweight (few computational resources needed), fast (training and inference time), and reasoned solution for automatic COVID-19 detection and assessment of its severity. Our method is based on extracting features by Binary Pattern of Phase Congruency (BPPC) in segmented CXR images. Radiomic features are extracted from the segmented CXR image, and an SVM-based selection process is used to build two models of a shallow Feed-Forward network. The results surpass previous studies, with an average accuracy for COVID-19 detection of 98.71\%. For images without evidence of infection but with a positive PCR test, an accuracy of 94.74\% is reached. In a second task, the severity level of COVID 19 is estimated with an AUC of 98.92\%. This high performance helps improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and severity assessment of COVID19 infection, proving to be a viable option in transitioning from a research field to a clinical environment.},

  abstract  = {Currently, deep learning is widely used in the field of medicine, which in turn includes radiology. This paper considers the problem of the classification of X-ray images and the lack of images of specific classes. The classes included COVID-19 and Normal X-ray scans. To solve the problems, we propose few-shot learning that is based on different Residual Convolutional Neural Network models with different complexities. The method is designed for the datasets that have small amount of samples of a specific class and a larger amount of instances of another class. The utilization of few-shot learning can solve the issues of the balance of X-ray datasets. The Residual Convolutional Neural Network models we used are as follows: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152. The architectures had been used to extract the features from the images that were used later. The latter model has the highest complexity, while the former has the lowest complexity, respectively. The obtained results include the highest accuracy of 97.7\% for 10 shots of COVID-19 positive X-ray images. The accuracy was achieved using ResNet-101 model. The highest result for ResNet-152 model was 95.6\%. However, on average, the model achieved the highest accuracy. ResNet-50 model provided the least accurate results, however, it is less complex which provides faster performance. One can also notice that with the higher number of COVID-19 positive shots that were used for training, the accuracy also gets higher. To provide transparency to our solution, we furthermore created t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding visualization. This showed us that the system could separate the two classes into two distinct clusters. Overall, the results imply the efficiency of the solution that was proposed in the study.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound imaging is widely used in prenatal diagnosis of fetuses to monitor fetal development, which is of great clinical significance. The main purpose of prenatal diagnosis is to measure some biological parameters of fetuses, such as Abdominal Circumference (AC), Crown-rump Length (CRL), Femur Length (FL), Biparietal Diameter (BPD), Head Circumference (HC) and so on. However, the artifacts, noise and skull loss in fetal ultrasound images create some challenges to the automatic measurement of fetal HC. In order to improve the accuracy of automatic measurement of fetal HC, this paper proposes Feature Channel Spatial Unet(FCS-Unet) with post processing. Firstly, the fetal head positioning is carried out through Faster R-CNN to find out the coordinates of the fetal head positioning box. Then for fetal head circumference segmentation, Feature Pyramid Networks(FPN) is used to replace the encoder of Unet. And in the skip connections, channel and spatial module are incorporated through sum operation. In the post-processing section, the white pixels outside the head positioning box in the resulting binary images are zeroed and turned to black. Finally, HC is calculated by the least square ellipse fitting method which can obtain the ellipse parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method is helpful to maintain the details of the fetal head, which has a good robustness to the low signal-to-noise ratio ultrasound images. To a certain extent, our method can improve the accuracy of automatic measurement of fetal HC.},

  abstract  = {Analyzing the dynamics of neural activity patterns using an electrophysiological approach is important for understanding the basis of information processing in a brain. In this study, we attempted to extract units of neuronal activity representing certain information and to discriminate activity pattern evoked by electrical stimulus and spontaneous activity without stimulation. We applied X-means clustering to the triplet of “2D-spacial coordinates and timestamps” of neuronal electrical spike bursts and the extracted single spatiotemporal neuronal activity pattern was converted into a standardized $8\times 84$ 2D-spatial pattern map. Most 2D-spatial patterns emerged repeatedly during recording time, corresponding to a representative motif. Then we gathered similar 2D-spatial patterns (primary clusters) into one ”pattern repertoire” and attempted to classify these pattern repertoires depending on the stimulus inducing the pattern repertoire by VGG16 deep convolutional neural networks (deep CNN). For that, we prepared two types of $224\times 224$ images by converting the 2D-spatial pattern maps, the spatial information priority neural activity pattern image (SIP-NAP image) and the time information priority neural activity pattern image (TIP-NAP image). As a result, over 80\% of high discrimination accuracy was obtained for both types of VGG16 input images, especially 99.7\% for TIP-NAP image. It suggested that spatiotemporal features contributing to the discrimination between spontaneous and evoked response activities were extracted by 3-D-crustering. In addition, it is shown that the spatial pattern of neuroelectric activity is able to be discriminated with high accuracy by combining transfer learning and SIP-NAP / TIP-NAP image translation method, even with a small amount of training data.},

  abstract  = {Acoustoelectric impedance tomography (AET) is a new non-invasive medical imaging procedure used to map the electrical properties of biological tissues with higher spatial resolution than traditional electrical impedance tomography (EIT). It exploits the acoustoelectric effect where modulated ultrasonic pressure changes the local tissue conductivity. This provides additional information to reconstruct a tomographic image, and has a stabilizing effect on an otherwise highly unstable inverse problem.In this paper, a novel approach to solving the AET inverse problem for image reconstruction is proposed. In the algorithm, the acoustoelectric effect is assumed to create small perturbations in the local resistance of the medium under observation. A lumped model consisting of a finite mesh of resistors approximates the medium under observation, through which boundary voltage differences between the excited and unexcited medium are calculated. A variation of the Modified Newton Raphson (MNR) algorithm is then proposed, where each pattern in the algorithm is created from small perturbations of the tissue conductivity. A total of eight simulation scenarios are evaluated, where the conductivity perturbations are in the order of 1\%, 2.5\% to 5\% of the nominal tissue conductivity. The algorithm can successfully reconstruct the images in the presence of random noise. The obtained images are compared against traditional EIT where the percentage error is calculated for each simulated tomographic image. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach is superior to traditional EIT as it constructs more distinct and high contrasting images with less percentage error.},

However, trustworthiness evaluation is challenging due to the absence of comprehensive models, systematic methods, and efficient tools. We present iTrustEval a framework for software trustworthiness evaluation with an intelligent analytic hierarchy process (AHP)based method. In iTrustEval an extensible trustworthiness model enabling on-demand integration with industrial trustworthy standards (such as ISO 25010 and Automotive SPICE in the current model) is proposed; an AHP based method is designed for the bottom-up measuring data fusion (where a hybrid missing-value recommendation engine is developed using both temporal-attenuation-mechanism based history data recommendation and matrix factorisation-based recommender system); and a prototypical tool has been developed. The applicability of iTrustEval is validated through a case study, and the results show it is sound in efficiency and effectiveness.},

However, it brings additional communication overhead due to limited bandwidth, and increases delay of tasks. To solve it, this work first proposes an offloading architecture including multiple CAVs, roadside units and cloud. We minimize the total cost of a hybrid system by jointly considering task offloading ratios, and allocation of communication and computing resources. Furthermore, a mixed integer non-linear program is formulated and solved by a novel meta-heuristic algorithm called Self-adaptive Gray Wolf Optimizer with Genetic Operations (SGWOGO). SGWOGO achieves joint optimization of computation offloading among CAVs, roadside units and cloud, and allocation of their resources. Finally, real-life data-driven simulation results demonstrate that SGWOGO achieves lower cost in fewer iterations compared with its several state-of-the-art peers.},

Growing Neural Gas with Utility Factor (GNG-U) has been presented as a method for learning the topology of a 3D space environment and applying it to non-stationary or dynamic data distribution. However, when a node is added to an existing network after several errors with sampling data have accumulated, it is difficult for a standard GNG-U to considerably boost learning speed. As a result, we propose a revolutionary growth strategy that dramatically accelerates learning and convergence. This method immediately adds a sample of data as a new node to an existing network based on the likelihood of node addition estimated by the distance to the third closest node and the first and second closest nodes at maximum. Experiment findings show that the proposed algorithm’s network can quickly adapt to represent the topology of non-stationary input distributions.},

The majority of the existing studies focus on designing efficient agents and policy optimization for ATSC, but neglect to observe more detailed states of the environment. In this paper, an adaptive traffic signal control strategy, named as A2C RTQL, is proposed for scheduling the traffic signal in an intersection, by combining the real-time lane-based queue lengths with deep RL agent. First, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) shockwave theory is employed for obtaining the real-time queue lengths in each lane. After that, by defining the obtained queue lengths as the inputs, A2C RTQL strategy is designed for traffic signal control based on the advanced actor-critic (A2C) agent, where the lanes are divided into multiple parallel environments based on the phases of traffic signal. Simulation results demonstrate the optimality and efficiency of the proposed strategy compared with other methods in SUMO under simulated peak-hour traffic dynamics.},

The emerging implantable neural sensing and stimulating (INSS) technology enables simultaneous delivery of chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) and recording of electrical brain activity from deep brain structures while patients live in their home environment. Long-term intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) iEEG signals recorded by INSS devices represent an opportunity to investigate brain neurophysiology and how DBS affects neural circuits. However, novel algorithms and data processing pipelines need to be developed to facilitate research of these long-term iEEG signals. Early-stage analytical infrastructure development for INSS applications can be limited by lacking iEEG data that might not always be available. Here, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing the Deep Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for synthetic iEEG data generation. We trained DCGAN using 3-second iEEG segments and validated synthetic iEEG usability by training a classification model, using synthetic iEEG only and providing a good classification performance on unseen real iEEG with an F1 score 0.849. Subsequently, we demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the synthetic iEEG in the INSS application development by training a deep learning network for DBS artifact removal using synthetic data only and demonstrated the performance on real iEEG signals. The presented strategy of on-demand generating synthetic iEEG will benefit early-stage algorithm development for INSS applications.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, focusing on the relationship between tendon tension and force applied to the fingertip, we develop a ring-type sensor that estimate fingertip force from tendon tension. To establish the measurement principle, mechanical models were constructed in three steps for sensor structure, deformation of finger and sensor, and finger kinematics. By integrating those mechanical relationships, we derived a relation expression between ring-type sensor output and fingertip force. In addition, we conducted experiments in which the developed ring-type fingertip force sensor was attached to the index finger and force was applied to the fingertip. As the results, it was confirmed that the fingertip force could be estimated by using the derived relational expressions both when the finger was extended and when it was bent. The results showed the validity of the mechanical models and the effectiveness of the sensor. These results provide important insights that will be useful for future sensor design and applications.},

  abstract  = {With the advent of the information society in recent years, ideas are becoming more and more valuable, and divergent thinking is becoming more and more important. Although there are methods to present visual stimuli to improve divergent thinking, these methods mainly present visual stimuli to the central visual field. The purpose of this study is to test hypotheses about changes in the number and variety of divergent thinking ideas under conditions in which visual stimuli, called geometric Figure animations, are presented in the peripheral visual field. The evaluation experiment was conducted with the participation of 32 university students. We asked them to perform the Alternative Uses Test (AUT) under two conditions: presenting and non-presenting geometric Figure animations in the peripheral visual field. The performance of divergent thinking was evaluated by measuring the number of responses, fluency, and flexibility of the AUT. The scores were standardized because the AUT differed in difficulty depending on each AUT topic. The results showed that all scores were higher in the presenting condition than in the non-presenting condition, and the effect size of the mean difference in flexibility was moderate. On the other hand, according to the results of the questionnaire, most of the participants did not feel that the geometric Figure animations provided any cues for divergent thinking. This suggests that the flexibility of divergent thinking might be improved unconsciously by geometric Figure animations presented in the peripheral visual field.},

  abstract  = {Recently, state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods train the neural network by calculating cluster-level or instance-level contrastive loss for learning discriminative features with unlabeled data. However, due to the divergence of the individual cluster, the previous methods did not fully utilize inherent feature of clustered samples for contrastive learning, which merged an unreliable instance into a wrong cluster by simply using cluster centroid or hard instance. To solve this issue, we propose a novel Cluster-aware Diversity Samples Mining (CDSM) framework based on the compactness and independence of individual cluster to generate diverse samples for updating memory dictionary of each cluster, so as to reduce the effect of noisy labels and improve the robustness of the model performance. Significantly, the proposed Cluster-aware Diversity Samples Mining method gradually creates more reliable clusters to generate more robust pseudo labels by refining the memory which is of central importance to our outstanding performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CDSM framework achieves performances of 85.6\%, 73.7\% and 31.0\% in mAP on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17, respectively.

Trained latent space carries the visual semantics for generated images. Past studies observed that arithmetic operation and linear interpolation in latent space could change the visible facial attributes, such as beards and glasses, in image space. In this work, the visual concepts in the latent space are observed, allowing to change the emotion attribute per facial expressions in the image space. We observed interpolation of a sample while disentangling the emotional attributes to edit the emotion-related facial expressions in the synthesized images. For the experiment, the Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) are utilized for image synthesis, and Extended Cohn Kanade (CK +) facial expression dataset is applied as the input. Our results showed that manipulating the latent space of the well-trained GANs can edit the emotional aspects of the image space. Moreover, editing facial expressions in the latent space is helpful for the recognition task to improve accuracy. Empirical results showed that the facial expressions classifier improved its performance in the recognition sadness class from 20\% to 80\% on the imbalance dataset.},

This criterion is based on the Fisher criterion used for linearly separable data and applied to nonlinear data. Some semi-supervised learning methods, which are related to the proposed method, are also explained. We show that the proposed method is effective for linearly inseparable data through experiments.

  abstract  = {Image-text matching plays a crucial role in connecting vision and language. The details of the objects in the image, the positional relationship, and the correspondence between the background and the text description are the keys to image-text matching. Previous studies either only extract the salient objects of the image, or only pay attention to the location of the object, ignoring the detailed features and background features of the object, and the extraction of the overall semantic information of the image is not comprehensive enough. Accordingly, this paper proposes a model based on Bert and Self-Attention Mechanism (BSAM), we segment the image area, use the self-attention mechanism to enhance the weight of the key area, pay attention to each object and their detailed features and background features, the image regions are mapped into original region features and new features with other region relationships, and the global information of the image is inferred based on the relationship between each region and background features. The text extracts word features and new features with other word relationships through the Bert model. We propose the Cross-Attention and Similarity -Attention Filtering (CA-SAF) module to align all relevant image regions and words, enhance matching pairs with high weights, and filter matching pairs with lower weights. Extensive experiments on two datasets, Flickr30K and MS COCO, show that the BSAM model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

However, the rich information which is contained in the self-expression matrix is unexplored since existing approaches use the self-expression matrix only as a tool for learning inter-sample relationships and clustering. In addition, such models treat outlier and noise points equally with other points, which inevitably degrades the clustering performance. To overcome these issues, we develop a progressive deep subspace clustering approach by extracting delayed fitting probabilities from the module and then use the probabilities to defer the fitting of unreliable points. Specifically, we calculate the probabilities that each sample lies in each subspace based on the results of the self-expression matrix and spectral clustering, and then estimate the reliability of the cluster assignment of each sample as delayed fitting probability to reweight the loss of each sample. Experiments on five benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression, and aberrant changes in epigenetic regulation can be detected in cancer development or progress. In this study, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and electronic medical records were combined to identify effective DNA methylation biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC). Statistical analytics and deep learning approaches were integrated to explore associated novel biomarkers. These identified biomarkers could facilitate accurate diagnosis of CRC and monitor disease progression for a testing subject, and provide suggestions for appropriate medical treatments. Firstly, DNA methylation profiles were analyzed through a standard pipeline to discover significantly differential methylation biomarkers as primary biomarkers. Incorporating Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), associated comorbidities of CRC were identified and associated disease genes were considered as secondary biomarkers. The intersection of primary and secondary biomarkers was performed to obtain CRC-relevant biomarker candidates, and gene ontology annotations were used to calculate candidate biomarker-to-biomarker distances. Based on the formulated gene-pair distance matrix for all candidate biomarkers, we applied clustering algorithms to categorize candidate biomarkers into different functional groups. Corresponding coefficients for each biomarker within a functional cluster were ranked through an attention-based recurrent neural network. The weighting coefficient for each biomarker was further taken as a reference for designing a practical testing toolkit. Finally, we obtained 11 important biomarkers from 5 functional clustered groups which were established by the 141 biomarker candidates screened from 450k DNA methylation probes.},

  abstract  = {The development of monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) has slowly begun in recent years. At present, the sensors used for VSLAM include monocular, binocular, or depth. For visual mapping, two problems will be encountered and the mapping cannot be performed. One is when there are not enough feature points, the camera&#39;s pose at the next moment cannot be estimated, such as a wall. The other is the VSLAM of dynamic environment changes may not be recognized as the same object because the feature matching needs to be coded through its surrounding environment, so it is easy to lose track when encountering changes in light. Compared with binocular and depth, monocular vision lacks depth information, but because it is cheap and easy to install, it needs to be used by multiple people. The current research proposes adding other information, including the camera height, the scene of the reference object and depth estimation by learning methods. The study uses the OpenVSLAM architecture to estimate the camera height scale, and proposes the mechanism be based on the change in the average scale of the first five key frames, with the average scale being updated at the same time to correct the current scale. Through this method, the drastic changes in scale are corrected, and the accuracy of trajectory positioning is improved. We also evaluate our proposed method on a real KITTI Dataset and demonstrate the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible for monocular visual SLAM.},

Both flux and torque errors pass through the modified discrete multiple vector voltage switch table to obtain the required vector voltages, and the proposed NN PID controller is used to convert the speed error into a torque command. Notably, the motor speed is evaluated from the magnetic flux, which is calculated using two-phase currents and voltages. The speed-sensorless control not only accelerates the feedback control but also rotates more stably. The NN PID controller generates a torque command according to the speed error, which is obtained by subtracting the estimated predictive speed from the actual speed. The advantages of the proposed system are that it reduces the flux and torque ripples and increases the control stability by filtering out the external interferences. The Verilog hardware description language is used to implement the proposed PDTC ASIC system, and a field-programmable gate array development board is used to verify the designed functions.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new feature extraction method for Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based motor imagery (MI) classification. Current researches mostly classify different MIs by detecting the event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomenon from the EEG signals. Due to the poor spatial resolution of the MI-EEG signals, the cortical area (source) activating the MI cannot be located accurately with the EEG (sensor) signal, which might degrade the classification accuracy. This study adopts the EEG source imaging (ESI) technique to estimate the cortical area where source ERD happens from the EEG signal. An improved ESI method based on the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) algorithm, in which an average LCMV filter and an average baseline covariance are constructed for the ESI, is proposed to locate the activated cortical area from the noisy EEG signals. The source ERD features are then extracted. Analytical results show that, for subjects with obvious average source ERD phenomenon, their activated cortical area in a single-trial MI can be well located. MI classification results also support the feasibility of the proposed method for MI-EEG signal processing.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), such as the P300 speller, can provide a means of communication for individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations. BCIs interpret electroencephalography (EEG) signals in order to translate embedded information about a user’s intent into executable commands to control external devices. However, EEG signals are inherently noisy and nonstationary, posing a challenge to extended BCI use. Conventionally, a BCI classifier is trained via supervised learning in an offline calibration session; once trained, the classifier is deployed for online use and is not updated. As the statistics of a user’s EEG data change over time, the performance of a static classifier may decline with extended use. It is therefore desirable to automatically adapt the classifier to current data statistics without requiring offline recalibration. In an existing semi-supervised learning approach, the classifier is trained on labeled EEG data and is then updated using incoming unlabeled EEG data and classifier-predicted labels. To reduce the risk of learning from incorrect predictions, a threshold is imposed to exclude unlabeled data with low-confidence label predictions from the expanded training set when retraining the adaptive classifier. In this work, we propose the use of a language model for spelling error correction and disambiguation to provide information about label correctness during semi-supervised learning. Results from simulations with multi-session P300 speller user EEG data demonstrate that our language-guided semi-supervised approach significantly improves spelling accuracy relative to conventional BCI calibration and threshold-based semi-supervised learning.},

  abstract  = {Active BCIs often rely on the performance of various imagery tasks that can be detected and decoded as commands for operating an external device. An increase in the number of these commands would significantly improve the functionality of the system and, as a result, quality of life for the user. This study focuses on augmenting the practicality and performance of such systems by investigating the mental task of singing imagery. Singing imagery is the simple act of imagining singing a song in your head and is a common experience for most people. However, despite its intuitive and straightforward nature, the potential of singing imagery for improving the performance of active BCIs or increasing their number of commands has not been fully investigated.In this study, along with various binary analyses, singing imagery is combined with a set of conventional tasks in BCI design (i.e., the motor imagery of large body parts like hands, feet, and tongue) for 4-class, 5-class (adding a “rest” state), and ultimately 6-class scenarios to evaluate the possibilities of enhancing the active BCI systems. Incorporating a singing imagery task in the 4 and 5-class combinations yielded up to 6.6\% and 6.7\% improvements in classification accuracy for the two cases, respectively. Furthermore, for the 6-class scenario, accuracies as high as 49.8\%, which is well above the chance level of 16.7\%, were achieved.The preliminary results, obtained from five participants, suggested that singing imagery could be a viable option for improving the classification accuracy or increasing the number of commands.},

MI BCI systems typically provide feedback in an egocentric rather than an allocentric reference frame. This study aims to see if presenting stimuli in an allocentric reference frame is comparable to presenting egocentric stimuli. We used dynamic visual stimuli in egocentric and allocentric reference frames to induce motor imagery in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Eight participants imagined grasping actions with their left and right hands while observing egocentric or allocentric stimuli. The allocentric and egocentric reference frame tasks had comparable inter-rater agreement and precision, indicating that allocentric visual feedback is as effective as egocentric one for MI BCI.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could enable persons with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) to intuitively control assistive motor devices for regaining lost grasping function. Previous studies, mostly performed in non-disabled persons, have already shown that complex upper limb movements can be decoded from the low-frequency time domain of the electroencephalogram (EEG).In this work, we attempted to translate these results to persons with cervical SCI and investigated whether executed reach and attempted grasp actions could be decoded from their EEG signals. For this, we chose three different reach-and-grasp actions, two unimanual and one bimanual, towards objects of daily life. During participants’ self-initiated, executed reach and attempted grasp actions, we recorded EEG using mobile, water-based electrodes. We measured two participants with subacute cervical SCI who had preserved shoulder movements and elbow flexion but no wrist and hand functions. Both repeated the session three times. We also recorded the EEG of 10 non-disabled persons performing the same tasks (control group). We extracted and analyzed movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) from the EEG’s low-frequency time domain. Consecutively, we assessed the decoding capabilities of two linear (shrinkage based linear discriminant analysis (sLDA), linear support vector machine (SVM)) and two non-linear (Random Forests (RF), naive Bayes (NBC)) classification models for the discrimination of the grasp actions.We could show that sLDA, SVM, and Random Forest yielded comparable classification results on average with 63.4\% ± SD 9\% for participants with SCI and 69.7\% ± SD 9\% for the control group (chance level 29.3\%). Our results indicate that it is feasible to decode executed reach and attempted grasp actions from MRCPs of persons with subacute cervical SCI. Future measurements will provide additional data to assess the generalizability of our results in a larger group of people with cervical SCI.},

  abstract  = {At present, there are about 70 million deaf people using sign language in the world, but for most normal people, it is difficult to understand the meaning of the sign language expression. Therefore, it is of great importance to explore the ways of recognising the sign language. In this paper, we propose a dynamic sign language recognition method based on the modified long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Firstly, we use Leap Motion to collect the features of Chinese Sign Language (CSL). LSTM has a good effect in processing time series data, but the parameters of its hidden layer are shared, making it important information lost when dealing with long time series. The attention mechanism can give different attention weights to different features according to the correlation between the input data and output data, so as to enhance the model’s attention to key information. Therefore, we combine LSTM with attention mechanism for dynamic sign language recognition. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the modified LSTM model is 99.55\%, which is higher than that of LSTM model. Finally, we developed a sign language human-computer interaction system, which verifies the real-time performance and effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.},

The incomplete utilisation of original input data limits GCNs’ ability to obtain the skeleton’s correlation. This paper proposes a graph instinctive attention convolutional network (GIAN) to solve this problem. In particular, it contains an instinctive attention module that uses self-attention to obtain the correlation within the original input skeleton. Then, parameter attention is used to further refine the relationship between different skeleton joints. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the GIAN outperforms most of the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {To reduce the number of traffic fatalities, research and development of safety systems is currently under way. However, drivers are still required to judge traffic situations and operate vehicles safely. Therefore, the aim of this study is to clarify the effect of pedestrian information provided by a human–machine interface (HMI) on driving characteristics under different traffic conditions when vehicles turn right at intersections and drive straight where a pedestrian is crossing. The system is designed to present information on pedestrians to the drivers through the HMI. The experimental results reveal that the presentation of pedestrian information by the HMI increases the time to collision (TTC) and decreases closest distance to the pedestrian at intersections and on straight roads. Thus, it is effective for drivers to ensure safety. In contrast, results reveal that the presentation by the HMI has no effect on increasing the TTC or decreasing the closest distance to the pedestrian in the two types of driving situations; one case where the ego vehicle makes a right turn at the intersection just after the oncoming vehicle turns left, and another case where the ego vehicle goes straight with good visibility. Therefore, for a more effective HMI, a suitable design or timing of pedestrian information should be considered, depending on various traffic environments.},

The controller is developed to address the motion planning problem for robot manipulators in the presence of obstacles. The proposed control scheme includes a parametrized NMPC structure used as an approximator for the RL framework’s value function and action-value function. In the NMPC structure, the cost function, system constraints, and the manipulator’s model are parameterized. The Q-Learning algorithm based on the Temporal Difference method adjusts the parameters of the NMPC to increase the closed-loop performance of the whole control scheme. The controller has been applied to a 6-degrees-of-freedom (DoF) model of a robot manipulator, aimed at moving its end-effector to reach the desired pose when static obstacles are in the robot’s workspace. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed controller can effectively control the end-effector’s pose in such a way as to avoid any collisions between the manipulator and the obstacles. It is shown that the learning capability of the proposed NMPC-based RL framework can enhance the efficiency of the control loop up to 21\%.},

It has the intrinsic quality of imposing a constant ground reaction force on a specimen. A new control strategy is introduced to extend the functionality of the UGKR with GRF control. It consist of a model-based control strategy with feedback and gain adaptation based on model identification. The presented control strategies are tested on mechanical hinges and cadaver specimens to verify its performance. The results show that the presented control strategies are capable of meeting the control specification of a force error less than 10 N as reported in literature.

When applying position control to a large scale robot, these quantization errors cause steps in the control input that possibly excite structural oscillations. To prevent this phenomenon, a state observer is designed that provides smooth estimated states with high accuracy for systems with quantized output. It is realized by observing the error dynamics of the measurement signal. The resulting observer is updated at each time instance where the quantized value of the measured signal changes. By using a corrected value of the output as well as an orthogonal projection, the updated estimation error leads to smooth estimated states. The design of this triggered observer does not have more design parameter than a conventional Luenberger observer and is therefore readily to implement. However, the overall estimation error is smaller in a direct comparison to such a Luenberger observer which is shown in simulations using a model of a mechanical drive system.},

  abstract  = {Chronic lung disease (CLD) is the most common and serious lung disease in premature infants. In this study, we predict the severity (mild or severe) of neonatal chest X-ray images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enable early intervention to provide personalized treatment and improve prognosis. Thirty subjects were tested in a leave-one-out cross validation experiment using 30 chest X-ray images of 11 patients with mild disease and 19 patients with severe disease at 7 days of age. To improve the prediction accuracy, we proposed to limit the input image of the CNN to the lung field region and to use a pre-training model for transfer learning. Four different experiments were conducted, comparing the results with different input images (whole image or lung field region) and with and without transfer learning. The results showed that the best accuracy was obtained when the entire image was used as input and no transfer learning was performed, with an Accuracy of 0.667.},

  abstract  = {Baseball elbow is a pitching elbow disorder caused by repeated pitching movements. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is one of baseball elbow disorders, and is an intractable osteochondral injury that tends to occur in elementary and junior high school students. If it can be found in the early stages, it will be completely cured by conservative treatment, which is to set a period to stop playing baseball. Since there is almost no pain in the early stage, the hurdles for consultation are high and there are many cases in which the condition becomes severe. Periodical medical check of baseball elbow is effective, however, the number of implementations is several times a year due to the shortage of specialists who can make a diagnosis. In this study, for the purpose of developing computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) of early-stage OCD, we propose an OCD detection method using ultrasound images of the elbow. The proposed method first segments the humerus capitellum using fully convolutional network (FCN). Secondly, the segmented region is classified into OCD +/- classes using fine-tuning VGG16 to detect OCD. The proposed method was applied to 125 child baseball players including 61 OCD children and 64 healthy children. 5-fold cross-validation was conducted. The average detection results were 76.8\% for accuracy, 100\% for precision, 52.3\% for recall, F1-score was 0.673, and AUC was 0.851.},

  abstract  = {Human-assist robots are designed to reduce the burden on the body when lifting objects and assist the elderly, disabled, and other people with muscle weakness in their daily activities. They also avoid accidents and assist motions by recognizing what kind of motion the user is about to make. Therefore, human-assist systems need to estimate the motion intention of a user in real time. The sooner the assist robot can accurately recognize the user’s motion, the sooner the assist robot can plan which motion to assist and how to assist it to guarantee success. If the user’s intended motion and its phase are estimated in the early stage of the motion, the assist robot can Figure out how the user is moving by comparing with standard motion models to assist the motion as necessary. This paper proposes a method to estimate the user’s intended motion and its phase simultaneously in real time based on integrated information consisting of the user’s posture, motion, EMG signals, and the surrounding environment. Two kinds of artificial neural networks are applied in the proposed method. Damping neurons are used in the artificial neural network to estimate the motion phase effectively. The intended lower-limb motions and their phases in daily living motion are estimated in real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated by performing experiments of lower-limb motion.},

To effectively extract joint local and global context information, we propose a joint biomedical event extraction model named BGHGCN, which consists of Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), improved BiAffine Graph Parser (IBGP), GCN and hypergraph convolutional networks (HGCN). Our model employs BiLSTM to learn word sequence features and uses improved BiAffine Graph Parser to enrich dependent syntax features. Afterwards we use GCN to extract local features from IBGP and BiLSTM. Specifically, we introduce HGCN to jointly extract local and global context information with a new fusion mechanism of local feature and incidence matrix, which can effectively extract structural features of hypergraph including node and hyperedge features. Finally, we evaluated our model on two biomedical event datasets MLEE and GE to compare with other baseline models.},

Although the proposed alternative serves with a rather robust and outlier-resistant regression, a nonlinear equation system has to be solved in an iterative way. The present study serves with a comparison between the Newton’s and Broyden’s method solving the nonlinear system in the iterative procedure in case of a test example and in case of real life economic data regarding unconditional economic $\beta$ convergence of the EU countries and regions.},

Unfortunately, this is a time-consuming process and requires extensive domain knowledge. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, such procedures can be done automatically using deep learning architectures. In this study, we designed a deep convolutional network to classify electromyogram signals. Furthermore, a support vector machine-based classifier was also implemented as a reference system. The goal of this study was to develop a control architecture, in which the user interface is equipped with a cheap commercial brain-computer interface system for mobile robot control. We collected a considerable amount of electromyogram signals during different facial expressions that can be used as intervention signals. Finally, we implemented an online real-time control method based on the deep convolutional network. The system enables the user to drive a mobile robot platform solely with electromyogram signals.

To protect such systems, multiple proposals have been made to detect threats and mitigate vulnerabilities and malware intrusions. A common approach is utilizing hardware redundancy to deal with system faults, however, implanted medical devices work under tight power and area constraints that may not always allow for redundancy.In this paper, we build on an existing multi-modal based mitigation scheme for securing medical devices and propose self-healing capabilities that would allow the device to automatically reestablish functionalities compromised due to external threats.},

  abstract  = {Metaheuristics are crucial for solving complex optimization problems effectively in many fields. With the recent increased interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the issue of how metaheuristics interact with XAI has attracted much attention. Most metaheuristics have stochastic search processes, and the jaguar algorithm (JA) is a unique algorithm that has exact search paths. JA shows potential abilities both in exploration and exploitation, but still faces limitations. Therefore, this study proposes a new metaheuristic based on JA and invents precision hunting behavior (PH-JA), which inherits the concept of JA and significantly strengthens its search efficiency. PH-JA improves the solution quality by adaptively detecting the current environment’s trends during movement and precisely hunting prey. Then, PH-JA makes the best of the historical information to reduce the computational cost. PH-JA is an explainable metaheuristic and has systematic operational procedures in that each movement is performed according to the present situation rather than random elements. Therefore, the path to a solution is interpretable and can return the same result with the same input. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of PH-JA, which is better than other classical and state-of-the-art metaheuristics in terms of solution quality and evaluation costs.},

  abstract  = {Gradient-based repair aims to repair infeasible solutions to feasible ones using the gradient information of the constraints. As an effective constraint handling method, gradientbased repair has received extensive attention and has been applied in various evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Nevertheless, due to the complexity of constraints in practical problems, a single infeasible solution often needs to be repaired multiple times until it becomes a feasible solution or reaches the maximum number of repairs. As far as we know, existing related research on gradient-based repair mainly applies this method directly to EAs, while there is little work in the evolutionary computing community on how to improve gradient-based repair. Currently, the multiple repairs for a single individual are independent. That is, the current repair does not consider the previous repair experience. However, only using gradient information to repair infeasible individuals may result in oscillations in the search process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a heuristic gradient-based repair method (HGR) which exploits the previous repair information of an individual to alleviate this issue. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/DMiC-Lab-HFUT/HGR-SMC2022.},

  abstract  = {We propose an adaptive scouting strategy which is a refinement of our previous work to further improve the performance of the fireworks algorithm (FWA). The proposed strategy makes full use of the currently obtained fitness landscape information to avoid inefficient searches. Specifically, we introduce two new modifications to our previously proposed scouting strategy to more quickly adjust the balance between exploration and exploitation in the face of various optimization scenarios. The first modification is that the initial explosion center migrates with better generated spark individual instead of being fixed on initial firework individual, i.e., the next round of the initial explosion center will move to the recently generated spark individual when the current tracing direction has no potential. The other is to actively reduce the explosion amplitude of subsequent explosion operation when a potential spark individual is generated. Otherwise, increase the explosion amplitude to escape from the trapped local area quickly. To evaluate the performance of the new proposed strategy, we designed a series of comparative experiments and used 28 functions from the CEC 2013 test suite as the benchmark. The experimental results confirmed that the adaptive scouting strategy shows better performance and faster convergence speed especially for complex multimodal optimization problems.},

  abstract  = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has fast developed nowadays especially in the deep learning field that most of the deep neural networks pursue the better problem-solving ability by making the network models deeper, larger, and more complex. However, too large and too complex AI algorithms/models require too large computational burden, which is not reality in academic researches nor the right way to real human intelligence. Moreover, in another research branch of AI named evolutionary computation (EC), which is inspired by the biological evolution of nature and swarm intelligence behaviours, will the EC algorithms become more efficient with larger and more complex algorithm model when solving complicated optimization problems like the large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs)? To this concern, this paper investigates whether some existing large-scale optimization EC algorithms can further improve their performance in solving LSOPs by only increasing the population size. We select 12 representative algorithms for investigation, including 4 standard EC algorithms and 8 well-known large-scale optimization algorithms. Then, we adopt the widely-used IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2010) LSOPs benchmark test suite to compare the performance of the same algorithms with different population sizes. The experimental results show that simply increasing the population size does not necessarily improve the performance of algorithms in solving LSOPs.},

The focus is made on recent interval techniques that consider i) a $H_{\infty}$ constraint within the design procedure of the interval observer, and ii) that do not require the cooperative property. Such approaches allow to formulate robustness constraints against sensor misalignment errors, noises and other unknown inputs, and to cope with less restrictive synthesis conditions.

  abstract  = {Inside medical environments, hand hygiene is very important to avoid healthcare-associated infections. The traditional method to measure hand sanitization guidelines consists of having an external observer watching the medical personnel, which can introduce bias and can only make the observations for a fixed amount of time. Some alternatives have been proposed, using different sensors and machine learning to replace the role of the observer, placing many sensors, or assuming that hand hygiene occurs in a fixed place, like a gel dispenser. In this paper, we report on our approach to detection and tracking of medical staff, as well as measuring their hand disinfection compliance using minimal equipment, obtaining only 2D images from one camera to avoid cluttering hospital space or changing the personnel’s regular behavior. The procedure is based on detecting a person in each frame, analyzing different zones with different sizes inside the same image to optimize the detection and extract as much data as possible; then tracking each recognized person and finally recognizing the hand sanitization by the motion pattern of the wrists, achieving promising results for this task in this setup.},

  abstract  = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been very successful in many civilian and commercial applications, including disaster relief, search and rescue, precision farming, archaeology, cargo transport, and surveillance. In most of these applications, mapping is a required phase that needs to be performed as an initial step. While mapping has attracted much attention in the last decades, much of the works rely on single drones. In this context, we propose a multiple UAV system for efficient mapping, minimizing mission time and cost. The system includes offline and online planning, and a good balance between both to reduce on-board processing. Offline planning includes area decomposition, take-off location finding, and path planning. Online planning will then be used to react to any unforeseen event that might occur during the plan execution. These incidents include a sudden change in weather conditions, communication loss or drone malfunction, and the presence of a nearby flying obstacle. Each of the main offline and online planning tasks are formalized as a Multi-Objective optimization (MOO) problem where requirements need to be met while objectives have to be optimized. In this regard, we consider several evolutionary techniques to tackle these MOO problems. To assess the performance of these techniques, we conducted several experiments and reported the related results. One finding is that MOEA/D outperforms NSGA2, while the latter requires less processing time.},

  abstract  = {Problem solving in complex situations or systems requires an appropriate and reliable understanding of the problem. We propose a framework that combines the Iceberg and Situational Awareness models. The goal is to raise decision makers&#39; awareness so that, depending on the system layers, problems can be perceived as events and trends within the system structure. Depending on what has been perceived, decision makers are then able to understand the impact of problems or their underlying causes and conditions. The appropriateness of the perceived and integrated information depends on whether it helps decision makers answer their questions and whether it corresponds to reality. Reliability depends on the completeness and certainty of the information presented. The perception of system properties is influenced by the (in)transparency of the real system and the prevailing paradigm and mindset of the observer. So, we propose a system taxonomy within the framework. This summarizes system properties of simple, complicated and complex systems and the resulting behavioral characteristics identified in the literature. Decision makers can use the taxonomy to explore the properties of real systems to develop an appropriate system model and assess its reliability, or to evaluate existing system models whether, or to what extent, they are suitable for decision support. This is because, based on these models, decision makers develop a corresponding understanding of the problem, upon which their decisions for possible solutions are based.},

  abstract  = {Spatio-temporal prediction has a wide range of applications in many fields, e.g., air pollution, weather forecasting, and traffic forecasting. Water quality prediction is also one of spatio-temporal prediction tasks. However, it faces the following challenges: 1) Water quality in river networks has complex spatial dependencies; 2) There are complex nonlinear relations in water quality time series; and 3) It is difficult to realize long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, this work proposes a spatio-temporal prediction model called a Graph Attention-based Spatio-Temporal (GAST) neural network. GAST investigates spatial and temporal dependencies of water quality time series. First, we introduce a temporal attention mechanism to capture time series dependencies, which can effectively handle nonlinear relationships in time series. Second, we adopt a spatial attention mechanism to extract spatial dependencies of river networks and fuse temporal features of spatial nodes. Third, we adopt a temporal convolution residual mechanism based on the spatio-temporal fusion, which improves the accuracy of long-term series prediction. This work adopts two real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed GAST and experiments demonstrate that GAST outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Firstly, utilizing the Tchebycheff aggregate objective function (AOF) weighted with a group of evenly distributed weight vectors, the proposed algorithm transforms the original CHPEED problem approximately into a series of single-objective sub-problems. Given this, the solutions, i.e., the Pareto optimal solutions(POS), corresponding to each weighted subproblem respectively, represent the corresponding tradeoff preference between the fuel cost and the emission. Such tradeoff preferences are helpful for decision-making in practical engineering. Besides, in the proposed algorithm, an effective constrained optimization strategy is hybridized to meet the equality constraint, which leads to promising results in the simulations to encourage further studies.},

On the other hand, the learning of positional encoding in the Transformer structure is often ignored in Transformer-based GANs. Capsule networks are usually considered to be able to learn position information in image features. Therefore, this paper constructs a Progressive Growing Transformer network with Capsule Embedding GAN (PGTCEGAN).

  abstract  = {The term “esports” is used to refer to game-based competitions considered as sports events. Esports currently involves a qualitative instruction that relies on individual experience and intuition, such as instruction from professional gamers. By contrast, sports observe a shift from qualitative to high-quality instruction using quantitative evaluation indices. Therefore, in esports, evaluation indices must be quantified to improve the training quality. This study focuses on crossing situations in soccer games. Crossing is a play in which a player passes from the side to the goal. It is important in soccer because of its high possibility of leading to a goal. Therefore, the quality of cross training in soccer must be improved to increase the scoring probability by crossing. As a feasibility study, this work aims at a quantitative evaluation of crossing in soccer games. The important factors for a successful cross are the positional relationship and the speed of each player at the time of the cross. A crossing scene is modeled to obtain a cross score based on these factors. First, when the velocity and trajectory of the cross ball are determined, the area is defined in which the offensive and defensive players can touch the ball. This area is calculated, and the value of how close to the center the ball trajectory passes in relation to the area is determined for each player. Using these values, the Cross Score (CS) was obtained by constructing a cross evaluation formula. To confirm the validity of the obtained evaluation values, a system that can obtain the evaluation values using image processing was developed. Then, 264 videos of crossing scenes in a soccer game were obtained, and CS was calculated for each of them. The correlation coefficient between the cross score and the percentage of successful crosses is 0.923, showing a strong correlation and confirming CS validity. As an example of application of the CS, it is possible to judge whether a cross is good or bad by displaying the CS on a heatmap using quantitative values. This enables visual and quantitative feedback using CS, suggesting the possibility of improving the quality of training.},

In order to facilitate the screening of graphic materials, we also propose a video content structuring method based on multiple cues, which can accurately segment the video into theme units.

Due to the diversity in stakeholder expertise, scenarios must be available at different levels of detail. Further, the chance of writing syntactically or semantically incorrect scenarios is high. Due to the high reliance of V&amp;V on scenarios, their correctness is crucial. Therefore, present-day scenario-description languages (SDLs) need to be supported by technologies to help authors compose scenarios and provide a mechanism for easy translation into executable forms for virtual or real-life testing. This paper addresses these issues by building on the existing two-level abstraction WMG-SDL in the following ways, (1) introducing a human-readable, natural language SDL, replacing the former Level-1 SDL, and complementing the more detailed Level-2 SDL, which is now syntax aligned with the ODD Taxonomy defined in ISO 34503, and (2) providing a tool consisting of a parser and a validator to assist writing syntactically and semantically correct scenarios. Our tool may be used within a graphical scenario editing interface or on the command-line. Further, for developers, an object-oriented interface for parsed scenarios enables further development and integration with off-the-shelf ADS simulation and language tools. The tools and technologies described in this paper are to be made open-source.},

  abstract  = {Developing models of complex systems, such as Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) that operate in uncertain, reactive environments is challenging because of complexity and uncertainty in their operational environments. Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is a mathematically principled framework that is suitable for developing such models. A POMDP model is typically defined with respect to a specific task performed in the environment and the resulting policy is obtained based on the defined task and information available about the environment. This implies that if changes occur in the task and/or environment, the model and policy need to be updated. One efficient way to achieve this end is to reuse the experience from the initial task(s) to perform similar task(s) instead of designing new models from scratch. This technique is referred to as Transfer Learning (TL). In this paper, we propose a novel TL technique that uses a customized Q-learning algorithm for policy transfer in POMDPs. We use this technique to transfer policies from a POMDP model, initially designed for a simple AV lane-keeping task within a freeway environment, to a similar task in a more complex environment, where random and risky behaviors from neighboring vehicles in the environment can be expected.},

  abstract  = {Automated driving functions make mobility safer and more comfortable. The perception of these functions relies on sensors that capture the vehicle’s environment. A sound configuration of the sensor’s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters is crucial for a high perception performance. Simulation is a method of increasing importance for the evaluation and optimization of sensor sets since it enables fast and cost-effective procedures. This paper presents a method for evaluating and optimizing cameras during traffic scenarios in a simulation based on their raw sensor data quality. We present a framework using the CARLA simulator and evaluate the coverage and visibility of the surrounding objects during virtual traffic scenarios. For this purpose, we propose a general metric to measure the acquired information content of camera systems. We compare our metric to the performance of a state-of the-art object detector to investigate the ability to represent detection performance. The suitability of the metric for the optimization of intrinsic hardware parameters and extrinsic mounting parameters is explored. We show in our experiments that the metric correlates strongly with a benchmark perception function’s performance. Furthermore, we prove that sensor configurations optimized by our metric outperform a baseline sensor set in terms of object detection performance.},

  abstract  = {The presence of respiration-locked sensory cortical activity has been documented in various mammalian species in recent years, including cognitively-relevant gamma oscillations (30-80 Hz). This work builds on previous evidence suggesting that respiration has a direct influence on oscillatory activity in human sensory, motor and association cortical areas. The entrainment of cortical activity patterns by respiratory phase suggests a direct influence of respiration on cognitive processing, which represents a possible neuronal mechanism behind the well-documented but unexplained effects of respiratory exercises on emotional and cognitive functions. We explore possible interpretation of those findings in the context of the cinematic view of cognition, in particular cortical phase transitions. In addition to traditional Fourier-based correlational analysis of cortical signals, we introduce Hilbert analysis, which allows to monitor rapid phase synchronization-desynchronization transitions. Our results support the hypothesis that respiration-locked cortical activity is linked to phase transitions in the cortex, measured by discontinuities of the instantaneous phase of the analytic signal determined by the Hilbert transform. Taken together, these findings suggest that respiration acts as master clock exerting a subtle but unfailing synchronizing influence on the temporal organization of dynamic cortical activity patterns and the cognitive processes they control.},

After extensive research and implementation on ample fields of application, numerous challenges to assure reliable and quick data processing have resulted in the hybrid BCI (hBCI) paradigm, consisting on the combination of two BCI systems. However, not all challenges have been properly addressed (e.g. re-calibration, idle-state modelling, adaptive thresholds, etc) to allow hBCI implementation outside of the lab. In this paper, we review electroencephalography based hBCI studies and state potential limitations. We propose a sequential decision-making framework based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to design and to control hBCI systems. The POMDP framework is an excellent candidate to deal with the limitations raised above. To illustrate our opinion, an example of architecture using a POMDP-based hBCI control system is provided, and future directions are discussed. We believe this framework will encourage research efforts to provide relevant means to combine information from BCI systems and push BCI out of the laboratory.},

  abstract  = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a neuroimaging technique that could be used to research one’s hemodynamic response to the world. A popular method to analyze the fNIRS signal is to use the grand averaging method, which collapses oxygenated hemoglobin (HBO) over a predefined time of interest (TOI) window. A drawback of the grand averaging method is that it collapses information about the fNIRS signal (e.g., temporal), thus one is not able to observe the temporal dynamics of the signal. Therefore, we propose to use multidimensional signal analysis (i.e., Tucker decomposition [TD] method) for fNIRS signal analysis, which can compress the signal and reveal the changes in the signal across time and space. We used TD on a three-way tensor with temporal, spatial, and subject modes constructed from an fNIRS dataset collected from infants that observed entities (i.e., human hand and mechanical claw) performing various action sequences (i.e., functional and nonfunctional events). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the subject dimension to identify significant differences across conditions. We compared the performance of the grand averaging and TD method. Results from the TD method were able to replicate the results from the grand averaging method and identify additional patterns missed by the grand averaging method. Findings from this study demonstrate the TD method as an alternative fNIRS signal analysis method.},

We experimentally verified a method for estimating the difficulty level of a task by focusing on alpha and beta waves.

In this study, we aimed to find a deep learning-based multimodal framework for integrative analysis of multiple biosignals with the highest performance in classifying the level of carsickness. To do so, we first generated a dataset consisting of five different types of biosignals collected under real driving conditions: electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration (RESP), photoplethysmogram (PPG), and galvanic skin response (GSR). Then, we compared six deep learning-based unimodal classification models which have shown competency in signal classification. Lastly, we compared four different fusion methods for multimodal classification frameworks using either all five biosignals or three signals, which include RESP, ECG, and PPG. As a result, we found out that the fusion method combining self-attention and the tensor fusion network outperformed other unimodal and multimodal models with categorical accuracy of 76.26\% regardless of the number of biosignals used.},

However, there are several limitations of current telepresence robots, such as the high weight, complexity of the system that prevents its fast deployment, and the limited workspace of the avatars mounted on either static or wheeled mobile platforms. In this paper, we present a novel concept of telecommunication through a robot avatar based on an anthropomorphic swarm of drones; SwarMan. The developed system consists of nine nanocopters controlled remotely by the operator through a gesture recognition interface. SwarMan allows operators to communicate by directly following their motions and by recognizing one of the prerecorded emotional patterns, thus rendering the captured emotion as illumination on the drones. (a) The LSTM MediaPipe network was trained on a collected dataset of 600 short videos with five emotional gestures. The accuracy of achieved emotion recognition was 97\% on the test dataset.As communication through the swarm avatar significantly changes the visual appearance of the operator, we investigated the ability of the users to recognize and respond to emotions performed by the swarm of drones. The experimental results revealed a high consistency between the users in rating emotions. Additionally, users indicated low physical demand (2.25 on the Likert scale) and were satisfied with their performance (1.38 on the Likert scale) when communicating by the SwarMan interface.},

  abstract  = {Current complex socio-technical systems are in need of transparent communication between stakeholders and the technical system. Even more so, interaction becomes a key aspect to form cooperative systems like highly automated driving. In order to facilitate such interaction, common procedures and interaction patterns help to solve known repeating interaction problems. Interaction patterns have been extensively researched in recent years. They provide the benefit to standardize and describe an interaction activity between a human and a technical system. Previous forms of describing these interactions follow a somewhat open format, which increases the difficulty when reusing the proposed pattern, besides making the pattern’s representation at times too complex, which further hampers its reusability. This paper proposes a more flexible, semi-standardized approach to describe patterns for human machine cooperation. This method analyzes the interaction and groups the actions of both the human and the technical system into “interaction blocks”. These interaction blocks can then be re-arranged to adapt the interaction design to new applications or be reused and combined with other blocks to form new patterns. This paper sketches the concepts, and presents a couple of examples, which further demonstrate the benefit of using and designing an interaction with a pattern as a base.},

  abstract  = {This work presents a framework for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) in assembly tasks that uses multimodal sensors, perception and control methods. First, vision sensing is employed for user identification to determine the collaborative task to be performed. Second, assembly actions and hand gestures are recognised using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify when robot collaboration is needed and bring the next object to the user for assembly. If collaboration is not required, then the robot performs a solo task. Third, the robot arm uses time domain features from tactile sensors to detect when an object has been touched and grasped for handover actions in the assembly process. These multimodal sensors and computational modules are integrated in a layered control architecture for HRC collaborative assembly tasks. The proposed framework is validated in real-time using a Universal Robot arm (UR3) to collaborate with humans for assembling two types of objects 1) a box and 2) a small chair, and to work on a solo task of moving a stack of Lego blocks when collaboration with the user is not needed. The experiments show that the robot is capable of sensing and perceiving the state of the surrounding environment using multimodal sensors and computational methods to act and collaborate with humans to complete assembly tasks successfully.},

  abstract  = {Cross-modal hashing utilize the advantages of hash codes to enable flexible retrieval across different modalities, greatly improving the retrieval efficiency of heterogeneous modes. However, most existing approach do not fully take modal intrinsic semantic properties and semantic category structure into consideration during learning the latent subspace. In addition, previous theory works commonly focus on binary pairwise similarity, without investigating the rich semantic contained in the label matrix. To alleviate these problems, in this study, we present a novel cross-media retrieval approach, termed SEmantic preserving Asymmetric discrete Hashing (SEAH), which constructs an asymmetric scheme to learn the binary codes from the common representation to maintain the similarity. Specially, we incorporate label matrix and hash codes into a mutual mapping framework, the learned hash codes are more discriminative. Moreover, we introduce the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) algorithm for optimization, which make it easier to solve the objective functions. Comprehensive systematically experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance gain and outperforms the several state-of-the-art works.},

  abstract  = {Data-driven deep learning achieved excellent performance for human action recognition. However, unseen action recognition remains a challenge for most existing neural networks. Because the action categories, collection perspectives, and scenarios considered during data collection are limited. Compared with class-unseen action recognition, view-unseen action recognition in videos is under-explored. This paper proposes view-robust neural networks (VR-Net) to recognize unseen actions in videos. The VR-Net consists of a 3D pose estimation module, skeleton adaptive transformation neural networks, and classification modules. We first extract 3D skeleton models from the video sequence based on existing pose estimation methods. Next, we propose a skeleton representation transformation scheme and achieve it based on Convolutional Neural Networks (VR-CNN) and Graph Neural Networks (VR-GCN), resulting in the optimal skeleton representations. Futhermore, we explore an associate optimization scheme and a fused output method. We evaluate the proposed neural networks on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., NTU RGB-D dataset (NTU), Kinetics-400 dataset, and Human3.6M dataset (H3.6M). The experimental results show that view robust neural networks achieve the top performance compared to state-of-the-art RGB-based and skeleton-based works, such as 93.6\% on the NTU (CV) and 94.6\% on the Kinetics-400 dataset (Top-5). The proposed neural networks significantly improve the recognition performance for unseen action recognition, such as 86.8\% on the H3.6M (View 2).},

In essence, the recycling of waste products by enterprises is to obtain most valuable parts and components from obsolete products to gain profits.

However, it has problems such as sensitivity to outliers, poor ability to induce the sparsity of the gradient domain of MR image. In this paper, minimax-concave total variation regularization based on $L_{p}-$norm (MCTV-L p ) is proposed to overcome these drawbacks. Specifically, the TV-L p regularization is constructed using the exponent ${p}(0\lt{p}\lt 1)$, which is defined as the $L_{p}-$norm of the gradient. Then TV-L p is combined with the minimax-concave penalty of the $L_{p}-$norm to construct the MCTV-L p . Finally, the sparse reconstruction model based on minimax-concave total variation (MCTV-SRM) is proposed, where the objective function is formulated as the sum of the regularization of MCTV-L p and the data-fitting term of $L_{2}-$norm. Moreover, an optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is given to solve the related optimization problems iteratively. Results on different datasets with different experimental settings show that the proposed method is better adapted to MRI reconstruction and the relative error and PSNR are significantly improved than several typical methods, while can reconstruct MR images with clear details and textures.},

Using synthetic and real data can alleviate the burden of creating a dedicated dataset at the cost of domain-shift that is mostly addressed during training, while treating the problem directly on the data has been less explored. Towards this goal, two methods to alleviate domain shift are proposed, firstly by enhanced generation and sampling of synthetic data and secondly by leveraging color information of unlabeled point clouds to color synthetic, uncoloured data. Obtained results confirm their usefulness in improving semantic segmentation result (+3.43 into mIoU for a network trained on S3DIS zone 1). More importantly, the devised coloring method shows the ability of a point-based network to link color information with recurrent geometric features. Finally, the presented methods are able to bridge the domain-shift gap even in cases where inclusion of raw synthetic data during training impedes learning.},

Particularly, the MMF-Net introduces a multimodal (MM) module that could highlight the vessel structure from the original fundus image to constrain the AN image features, which reduces the influence of background noise. In addition, the MMF-Net exploits a multiscale transformation (MT) module to extract the vessel information efficiently from the multimodal feature representations. Finally, A multi-feature fusion (MF) module is applied in MMF-Net to split and reorganize the pixel feature from different scales to improve the robustness of AN segmentation. Experiments on two public benchmark datasets show that our method has achieved superior performance and surpassed other existing state-of-the-art methods in the accuracy of AN segmentation.},

Accurate segmentation of H&amp;N tumors can improve the early diagnosis rate of cancers for timely treatment. H&amp;N tumor segmentation challenge is the equidensity between the tumor and surrounding tissues, which shows low contrast in CT. In contrast, PET images can reflect the distinction between the lesion region and normal tissue through metabolic activity but show low spatial resolution. With the underlying assumption that each modality contains complementary information, we introduce a novel L2-Norm Scaled Transformer (NSTR) multi-modal segmentation method in PET-CT images. The proposed network comprises the Embedding block, L2-Norm Transformer blocks, 3D Deformable down-sampling blocks, and Feature fusion module, which can fully exploit the high sensitivity of PET images to tumors and the anatomical information of CT images. Our method proposes a powerful 3D fusion network that uses a U-shaped structure to exploit complementary features of different models at multiple scales to increase the cubical representations between different modalities. We conducted a comprehensive experimental analysis on the HECKTOR PET-CT dataset. The results indicated NSTR has powerful featured representation capability and surpasses the state-of-the-art H&amp;N tumor segmentation methods in DSC, Jaccard, RVD, and HD95.

To overcome this issue, a novel scheme is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of semantic segmentation when the training data is generated from a 3D point cloud. The key features of the proposed scheme are filling in the missing data by inpainting and domain adaptation by histogram matching. To evaluate the proposed scheme, datasets composed of real images captured during a variety of seasons, weathers, and times were created. Experimental results showed that ICNet trained upon our dataset could provide accurate results for visual navigation.},

  abstract  = {Applying reinforcement learning (RL) methods for real world applications pose multiple challenges - the foremost being safety of the system controlled by the learning agent and the learning efficiency. An RL agent learns to control a system by exploring the available actions in various operating states. In some states, when the RL agent exercises an exploratory action, the system may enter unsafe operation, which can lead to safety hazards both for the system as well as for humans supervising the system. RL algorithms thus must learn to control the system respecting safety. In this work, we formulate the safe RL problem in the constrained off-policy setting that facilitates safe exploration by the RL agent. We then develop a sample efficient algorithm utilizing the cross-entropy method. The proposed algorithm’s safety performance is evaluated numerically on benchmark RL problems.},

  abstract  = {Rarity is known to be a factor in the price of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Most investors make their purchasing decisions based on the rarity score or rarity rank of NFTs. However, not all rare NFTs are associated with a higher price, especially for play-to-earn gaming NFTs. In this paper, we studied the top-ranked play-to-earn gaming NFTs on Axie Infinity. We found that, in addition to rarity, utility is also a significant factor influencing the price. Furthermore, we use utility as a predictor to predict the price of Axies using the XGBoost regressor. Our results reveal that, compared to using rarity-based predictors only, leveraging utility-based predictors can improve the prediction accuracy, thus highlighting utility as a price determinant for play-to-earn gaming NFTs.},

Thus, considering the hierarchical nature of the problem, this work aims to develop a a predictive model which takes into consideration the hierarchical structure of public expenditure in order to assure financial coherence and achieve improved results. Experimentally, this work uses time series of public expenditure execution in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. The experiments were conducted on two axes in order to establish a multilevel analysis considering conciliatory approaches of the hierarchical levels of expenditure and the predictive models. By applying these methods, valuable public expenditure forecasts in the State of Pernambuco considering different hierarchical levels were produced.},

  abstract  = {Extreme environments, such as space and underwater, are difficult for humans to enter because they involve risks, hence it is necessary to employ autonomous robots instead of humans. When robots fail in extreme environments, it is essential for the robot to automatically recover control following the rules of failure because humans cannot repair the robot directly. Reinforcement learning is expected to automatically acquire the control rule; however, the retrieval of the control rule requires significant trial-and-error. Imitation learning cannot acquire the control rule if no suitable expert data exist. Methods combining imitation learning and reinforcement learning reduce the number of trial-and-errors; however, they are still not effective against robot failure because these methods cannot utilize expert data effectively. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning method that efficiently recovers control performance from failures by utilizing both the control rules prepared by the designer and multiple discriminators to calculate measures similar to expert data. Experimental results show that the proposed method recovers the control performance with fewer episodes than the conventional method. The main contribution of the proposed method is its efficiency against robot failure through utilizing expart data prepared for failure by the designers for imitation learning.},

This paper extends an established data-driven solution for a class of adaptive optimal linear output regulation problem to achieve self-tuning torque control of servomotor drives, and thus enables online adaptation to unknown motor resistance, inductance, and permanent magnet flux. We make contributions by tackling three practical issues/challenges: 1) tailor the baseline algorithm to reduce computation burden; 2) demonstrate the necessity of perturbing reference in order to learn feedforward gain matrix; 3) generalize the algorithm to the case where F matrix in the output equation is unknown. Simulation demonstrates that the deployment of adaptive dynamic programming lands at optimal torque tracking policies.},

As a result, DE is very sensitive to these two parameters. To address this predicament, many adaptive parameter control methods have been proposed for these two parameters. However, there are no comprehensive comparisons among these adaptive parameter methods. To make up for this defect, this paper mainly investigates the effectiveness of six widely utilized adaptive strategies, namely the ones in JADE, IDE, jDE, SinDE, FDSADE, and RDE. For fairness, this paper selects the binomial crossover and the mutation “DE/current-to-pbest/1” to accompany the six adaptive parameter strategies. Experimental results on the commonly adopted CEC2014 benchmark suite have demonstrated that the adaptive parameter control methods in IDE and JADE help DE achieve the best overall performance. With these investigations, it is envisaged that this paper provides a fundamental guideline for new learners and those looking for an appropriate adaptive parameter technique for their newly created DE algorithms.},

Edge nodes (ENs) as service providers, provide users computing/network services in a pay-as-you-go manner, and they also suffer from the high cost brought by providing computing resources. Thus, the problem of profit maximization is highly important to ENs. However, with the development of 5G network technologies, a large number of mobile devices (MDs) are connected to ENs, making the above-mentioned problem a high-dimensional challenge, which is highly difficult to solve. This work formulates a joint optimization problem of task offloading, task partitioning, and associations of large-scale users to ENs to maximize the profit of ENs. This work focuses on applications that can be split into multiple subtasks, each of which can be completed in MDs, ENs and a cloud data center. Specifically, a mixed integer nonlinear program is formulated to maximize ENs’ profit. Then, a novel hybrid algorithm named Genetic Simulated-annealing-based Particle swarm optimizer with a Stacked Autoencoder (GSPSA) is designed to solve it. Real-life data-based experimental results demonstrate that compared with other peer algorithms, GSPSA increases the profit of ENs while strictly meeting latency needs of users’ tasks. The dimension of the problem that can be solved is increased by more than 50\% with GSPSA.},

We leverage a graph neural network based neural prediction model to predict the probability to be included in the final solution for each edge. Our CG-P algorithm constructs a reduced graph that only contains the edges with higher predicted probability, and this graph reduction process significantly speeds up the solution process. We evaluate the CG-P algorithm on railway crew scheduling problems and it outperforms the baseline column generation algorithm. We provide two solution modes for our CG-P algorithm. In the optimal mode, we can obtain a solution with an optimality guarantee while reducing the time cost to 63.12\%. In the fast mode, we can obtain a sub-optimal solution with a 7.62\% optimality gap in only 2.91\% computation time.},

Self-organizing ideas from nature are very promising and have not been highly explored in manufacturing automation. The contribution of this paper goes towards that direction. We first define a highly flexible shop-floor and the interaction of the elements is proposed considering a multi-agent based negotiation. From this point, we introduce and define analogies and patterns based on the echolocation of bats that can be applied in manufacturing automation. These patterns are based on the way how bats hunt and avoid obstacles based on the emission of sound and echo perception. These ideas are showcased using the matrix production concept which proofs the feasibility of the current approach.

Such systems should be capable of operating under any changes in production. Therefore, in this paper, a novel modelling concept of Petri net-based physical RMS for mass customisation production is proposed. The idea is based on the interpreted Petri net, which permits for additional specification of input and output signals of the system. Moreover, such a net ought to be live and bounded (or even safe), therefore a boundedness and safeness verification algorithm is developed.

  abstract  = {To achieve high fidelity haptic rendering of soft objects in a high mobility virtual environment, we propose a novel haptic display DandelionTouch. The tactile actuators are delivered to the fingertips of the user by a swarm of drones. Users of DandelionTouch are capable of experiencing tactile feedback in a large space that is not limited by the device’s working area. Importantly, they will not experience muscle fatigue during long interactions with virtual objects. Hand tracking and swarm control algorithm allow guiding the swarm with hand motions and avoid collisions inside the formation.Several topologies of impedance connection between swarm units were investigated in this research. The experiment, in which drones performed a point following task on a square trajectory in real-time, revealed that drones connected in a Star topology performed the trajectory with low mean positional error (RMSE decreased by 20.6\% in comparison with other impedance topologies and by 40.9\% in comparison with potential field-based swarm control). The achieved velocities of the drones in all formations with impedance behavior were 28\% higher than for the swarm controlled with the potential field algorithm.Additionally, the perception of several vibrotactile patterns was evaluated in a user study with 7 participants. The study has shown that the proposed combination of temporal delay and frequency modulation allows users to successfully recognize the surface property and motion direction in VR simultaneously (mean recognition rate of 70\%, maximum of 93\%). Dandelion-Touch suggests a new type of haptic feedback in VR systems where no hand-held or wearable interface is required.},

Metaverse users are supposed to live in a digital realm in which such living universes are created either as imaginative or realistic environments. This brings a new creative space for architects in the Architecture-Engineering-Construction (AEC) sector to design new buildings and cities in a semi-realistic digital world as they can be inspired by actual urban settings and augment these real or realistic environments towards a cyber environment. This paper aims to present such a cyber environment, called BIMyVerse, that blends IoT-enabled situational awareness, VR-supported integrated semantic digital twin models incorporating Building Information Model (BIM), Geographical Information System (GIS) and sensory cyberspace and explainable interpretations for better interaction with buildings and urban contexts. The proof of concept studies demonstrate how BIMyVerse can be used for i) situational fire regulation check and monitoring the maintenance status (building-scale); ii) circular economy provisioning through the digital twin of an urban transformation area (urban-scale).},

Vection research can help enhance Virtual Reality applications and improve simulator fidelity as vection appears to be a desired sensation in motion simulators. The experience of vection can be modulated by cognitive factors and potentially personal traits, such as the vividness of imagination. Previous research investigating the relationship between auditory vection and kinesthetic imagery presented conflicting findings. However, the relationship between visually-induced vection and imagination has not been investigated. Herein we investigated the relationship between kinesthetic imagery and unimodal visual and bimodal visual-auditory vection. Twenty-nine participants were visually and audibly immersed in virtual environments with varying degrees of ecological relevance wherein they reported on their vection experience. No differences were found for vection intensity and latency measures between participants with high and low kinesthetic imagery. We conclude that imagery does not appear to play a role in the experience of visually-induced vection.},

For evaluating the training system, after using it for the airport and life insurance employees training, a comparative investigation was conducted to determine whether the system’s applicability for training. As per B business office experiment, when the number of data items was n=44, a correlation coefficient with a strong correlation of 0.662 was obtained.

Since the variation among human facial expressions is huge, facial expression recognition is still one of the challenging topics in computer vision. In the facial expression recognition, the key challenge is to capture the dynamic variation of the physical structure of the face from the videos. However, traditional machine learning based systems may have large errors due to the feature extraction on environmental factors such as postures, angles, light, occlusion or backgrounds, which can easily lead to unrecognized or error identification results. In this work, we propose a deep learning based framework, and add residual in residual dense block and triple attention mechanism to our model. On several benchmark facial expression datasets, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and compare our model with other state-of-the-art modalities.},

  abstract  = {Remote speech reconstruction is widely used in counter-terrorism, medical science and engineering. In order to obtain reconstructed speech with high accuracy, we propose a speech reconstruction method. This method consists of two parts. Firstly, some optical devices are used to collect speckle images. Secondly, the convolutional neural network is used to detect the subtle motion of speckles. The results show that the lowest mean absolute error of the sinusoidal signal reconstructed by the method is 0.0489, and the lowest mean absolute error of the real speech is 0.0271. Compared with the convolutional neural network proposed before, the error of reconstructed speech is small, and the number of parameters is significantly reduced, with 0.73M for our model compared to 11.45M for the previous model. Besides, the time cost of training on some datasets is reduced to less than 1 hour, which is much lower than the previous model. The experimental results prove that our model is a lightweight, high-accuracy model for remote speech reconstruction with short training time.},

  abstract  = {The application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is sometimes limited by a large number of parameters and floating-point operations. Pruning methods have been proved to be effective to solve this problem. These methods improve the efficiency and storage occupancy of CNNs by removing weights connected with certain neurons/channels. The key issue is the selection of suitable neurons/channels to be pruned. Then, fine-tuning is usually applied to restore the performance of a pruned model to that before the pruning. However, existing neurons/channels selection methods do not explicitly consider the impact of the pruning on the model output. Moreover, the performance of a fine-tuned model may suffer from the information loss problem caused by the pruned neurons/channels. In this work, a stochastic sensitivity measure-based neurons/channels selection criterion is proposed to choose and prune insensitive neurons/channels, which effectively reduces the degradation of model performance. Moreover, a compensation operation followed by fine-tuning is proposed to relieve the information loss problem and restore model performance. Experimental results show that our method yields comparable compression and acceleration rates with less accuracy degradation compared with existing pruning methods for CNNs. For instance, the proposed method achieves more 6.8\% FLOPs reduction and 0.25\% accuracy improvement on VGG-16 compared with a recently proposed pruning method.},

In this study, we proposed ensemble learning to achieve synergistic improvements in model accuracy and thereby provide highly stabilized performance on diverse medical datasets. We first investigated the model performance of the latest deep learning architectures, e.g., Inception, VGGNet, MobileNet, Xception, ResNet50, and selected 7 state-of-the-art models to the diverse open CT datasets (SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan, USCD CT, and COVID-X dataset). The model parameters were transferred from the other domain and fine-tuned based on medical image sets. The last convolutional layers were stacked and a fully-connected neural network is employed to find generalized feature space. The peak accuracy of the fine-tuned single CNN models were InceptionV3 - 0.96, VGG16 - 0.94, VGG19 - 0.94, MobileNetV2 - 0.98, Xception - 0.9, ResNet - 0.96, DenseNet201 - 0.97. The proposed ensemble model achieves the peak accuracy of 0.99\%, outperforming each individual model and achieving the highest performance in all three open CT datasets.

SmartHelm is an attention-sensitive smart helmet that integrates none-invasive brain and eye activity detection with hands-free Augmented Reality (AR) components in a speech-enabled outdoor assistance system. The described studies systematically increased in ecological validity from lab to field. The first study consisted of an Augmented Reality preparation examination in the lab. The second study then investigated simulated attention distraction modeling, whereas the third study examined real-world attention distraction modeling while cycling in traffic. During these three studies, multimodal data (EEG, eye-tracking, video, GPS and speech) has been collected synchronously and analyzed in offline and online experiments. Machine Learning models were trained and optimized for attention modeling.Results: Analyses of self-report and objective data during the simulation study show the plausibility of the simulated internal and external distractions. The analysis of behavioral data captured by multimodal biosignals recorded in the field study further shows that real visual attention distractions can be automatically identified using synchronized video and eye-tracking data. Machine Learning methods based on long short-term memory models (LSTMs) indicate that simulated attention distractions can be automatically detected from EEG data, with the best detection performance for mental distractions. Finally, the self-report data suggest that the comfort of the SmartHelm helmet should be further improved for permanent use in road traffic.},

Since the data should be communicated securely between the communicating devices, the network security is one of the dominant research areas for the 6LoWPAN IoT applications. Meanwhile, 6LoWPAN devices are vulnerable to attacks inherited from both the wireless sensor networks and the Internet protocols. Thus intrusion detection systems have become more and more critical and play a noteworthy role in improving the 6LoWPAN IoT networks. However, most intrusion detection systems focus on the attacked areas in the IoT networks instead of precisely on certain IoT nodes. This may lead more resources to further detect the compromised nodes or waste resources when detaching the whole attacked area. In this paper, we therefore proposed a new precisional detection strategy for 6LoWPAN Networks, named as PDS-6LoWPAN. In order to validate the strategy, we evaluate the performance and applicability of our solution with a thorough simulation by taking into account the detection accuracy and the detection response time.},

However, such frauds are hard to detect due to the complexity of the operating environment in supply chain finance such as involvement of multiple parties under different agreements. Traditional instruments of financial institutions are time-consuming yet insufficient in countering fraudulent supply chain financing. In this study, we propose a novel blockchain-driven framework for deterring fraud in supply chain finance. Specifically, we use inventory financing in jewelry supply chain as an illustrative scenario. The blockchain technology enables secure and trusted data sharing among multiple parties due to its characteristics of immutability and traceability. Consequently, information on manufacturing, brand license, and warehouse status are available to financial institutions in real time. Moreover, we develop a novel rule-based fraud check module to automatically detect suspicious fraud cases by auditing documents shared by multiple parties through a blockchain network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we employ agent-based modeling and simulation. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can effectively deter fraudulent supply chain financing as well as improve operational efficiency.},

In order to keep the vehicle in a safe state, the ACC approach can override the human operator’s velocity control commands. The safe state is defined as a state from which the vehicle can be stopped safely, no matter which steering actions are applied by the operator. This is achieved by first sampling various potential future trajectories. In a second stage, assuming the trajectory with the highest risk, a safe and comfortable velocity profile is optimized. This yields a safe velocity control command for the vehicle. In simulations, the characteristics of the approach are compared to a Model Predictive Control-based approach that is capable of overriding both, the commanded steering angle as well as the velocity. Furthermore, in teleoperation experiments with a 1:10-scale vehicle testbed, it is demonstrated that the proposed ACC approach keeps the vehicle safe, even if the control commands from the operator would have resulted in a collision.},

  abstract  = {This article discusses the segmentation of indoor daily living environments, such as rooms in a house, into regions that are habitually used for different purposes by the residents living in the environment. Because these regions usually include purpose-related furnishings, previous studies have focused on the functionalities of these furnishings or their predefined parts to characterize the purposes of the regions, including those furnishings used by the residents. However, the regions used for specific purposes do not necessarily correspond to the furnishings or their predefined parts. Even for a single dining table, its central area typically serves as the region used for placing food, drink, salt shakers etc., whereas the peripheral area typically constitutes a region for dining together. This article attempts to extract the regions used for different purposes as a spatial range from the given environment by segmenting it based on the similarity in the variation of postures observed in each position and the occupancy of its surrounding space. In the experiments using two datasets for indoor daily living environments observed by RGB-D cameras, the obtained regions primarily correspond to our understanding of the regions used for different purposes.},

  abstract  = {Hand actions classification is an imperative field for acquiring smart functionality in modern electronic devices because hand actions classification offers interactive and innovative methods to communicate and interact. Therefore, we develop a novel architecture based on you only looking at coefficients (YOLACT), a real-time instance segmentation approach, and a temporal relation network (TRN) for hand actions understanding. In addition, our framework consists of a face recognition-based security network (FRB-SN) for user identification. We trained the YOLACT and the TRN models using the segmented version of the 20BN jester dataset composed of hand actions images and ground truths while the FRB-SN is trained using the VGGFace2 dataset. For testing, the YOLACT is used to segment the object from the given image sequence and then passed to the TRN-trained model to predict the corresponding action. Our experimental results showed that the accuracy and frame rate of the proposed framework are competitive.},

In this paper, we propose a novel handwriting generation approach that surpasses previous state-of-the-art results by $\sim$ 16\% in the objective study and by $\sim$ 17\% in the subjective study. Our contribution is twofold: (1) developing a new objective function based on a novel reparameterization technique for mixture models (2) developing a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)based metric for evaluating digitized handwriting styles. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show the application of optimization-Based Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), a few shot learning technique, to adapt our model to new author styles with few training examples.

  abstract  = {This paper presents the validation and the comparative study of a shared control concept for a large vehicle manipulator (LVM). The state-of-the-art controlling a LVM is manual control: The operator controls the manipulator to carry out a specific task and keeps the vehicle on the road. Easing the work for the operator, an automatic lane-keeping of the vehicle can be taken into account: An automation of the vehicle which keeps it on its reference, but without taking into consideration of the manipulator’s specific task. However, the operator has his specific task with the manipulator, and therefore, such automation may not be satisfying. Therefore, this paper presents the validation and compares the Limited Information Shared Controller (LISC) proposed previously with the manual control mode. This step is crucial, showing the concept’s applicability and benefits compared to the state-of-the-art solution. Thus, the LISC is compared with a non-cooperative controller (NCC) and the manual mode on a real-time simulator with test subjects. It has a more realistic experimental setup than in other studies because there is no predefined manipulator reference. The study results indicate that the NCC can lead to undesired motions of the overall system because the test subjects cannot carry out their specific task. On the other hand, the proposed the LISC of the vehicle can reduce the working load while supporting the operator in carrying out the manipulator’s specific task.},

The main idea is to maximize the human driver’s control experience while allowing them to navigate safely (the inputs do not lead to collisions). The proposed physically-inspired model-based obstacle avoidance algorithm relies on optimal maps of the expected time for executing a safe stop manoeuvre. These maps are pre-computed using policy iteration in the case of an experienced driver stochastic model. As the burden of complex calculations is handled offline, the online implementation of the algorithm requires little computing resources. Its efficiency is tested experimentally in a study with healthy participants: a statistically significant result confirmed that the proposed algorithm outperforms a baseline rule-based control.

An experimental study is presented in which a state-of-the-art Expert-guided Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (EMICS) method is compared with our proposed Negotiation-Enabled Mixed-Initiative Control Switcher (NEMICS) algorithm. Results suggest that the NEMICS framework is able to successfully avoid conflicts for control, which is a fundamental challenge encountered with previous MI control methods. Comparing NEMICS with the EMICS, we provide evidence of improved navigational safety (i. e. fewer collisions). Additionally, our usability study suggests that human operators perceived their interactions with NEMICS as less intrusive than with EMICS.},

Existing models of opinion dynamics consider only the influence of the heterogeneous bounded confidence of neighbors on agents, ignoring the combined effect of the global reputation of the entire network, neighbors’ similar opinions, and their degree of stubbornness. In this paper, a perspective exchange framework for project-based interorganizational networks is used to identify agents who can proactively raise the level of their opinions. A modified agent-based opinion model of PIONs based Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model is then proposed. Extensive case experiments are conducted on an artificially generated network dataset, and the theory of Shannon-like entropy is applied to verify the stability and convergence of the proposed model. The simulation results show that the increase in the proportion of global reputation leads the group to evolve toward consensus and converge slowly, while the increase in the proportion of neighbor’s opinions makes the group evolve toward polarization and converge quickly.},

Those applications require high network throughput and short latency, rarely available within one data channel. Until recently, nonhomogeneous channels could not have been concurrently engaged owing to the protocol legacy restrictions. In order to answer the current challenges, new protocols, e.g., Multipath TCP (MPTCP), have been designed. MPTCP splits the data stream over a number of channels in the way dictated by a low-level component – the scheduler. However, the default scheduler aims at increasing throughput rather than constraining the transfer delay. Thus, for time-sensitive applications, other solutions are needed. In this work, a new scheduler, explicitly targeting the transmission aspects related to protocol delay, is designed. The scheduler properties are analyzed formally and its performance is tested experimentally.},

This approach is applied to a case study of a virtual healthcare intervention system to measure the team’s productivity. The results indicate several deficiencies in the process with respect to requirements engineering task that cause loss of time and increase rework rates. Results indicate that there are some challenges in the development process that contribute to some deficiencies. The rework rate is high and the number of tasks that are intended to be completed is less than what was planned. These factors can contribute to the lengthening of the software development process.

Our proposed Custom Rolling Matching Encoding (CRME) protocol matches complex acoustic channel states with a vote-queue algorithm. It performs reliable low-rate acoustic communication in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Results show that the framework has surpassed technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) in terms of BER, power consumption for device usage, and communication distance: BER is below 0.5\% at a 272 bps data reception rate. Also, the framework can be deployed on embedded devices, consumes less power than RFID, and performs similarly to BLE, providing an alternative to cost-effective acoustic communication.},

This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach to resolve the FJSP. In the approach, the FJSP is formulated as a Markov decision process where disjunctive graph is used to represent the state, operation set and machine allocation are used as the actions, the reward function is established based on the optimization objective (i.e. makespan). To obtain the embedding representation of the disjunctive graph of the FJSP, the corresponding graph neural network (GNN) is used to extract the state features. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) decision network and scheduling rules cooperate to achieve the selection of actions (i.e. operations and machines). The multi-threaded asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm is employed to optimize the model parameters to shorten the training time. The approach has been tested on the benchmarks. The results prove that this approach is superior to scheduling rules and meta-heuristic algorithms in results and computing time respectively.},

In DAG task scheduling problems, a set of distributed tasks with dependencies are dispatched to appropriate computing instances. The objective is to obtain the feasible schedule with the minimal schedule length, i.e., makespan. In this paper, we propose a task duplication based clustering framework for the problem under study. We employ the task duplication scheme in the framework which allows task clusters contain duplicated tasks in order to reduce the communication cost. A selection matrix is introduced to record the candidate tasks to generate clusters. Multiple feasible task clustering solutions are obtained based on the selection matrix and among which the best one with the minimal makespan is output. Experimental results indicate that the proposal outperforms compared algorithms on both effectiveness and robustness.},

Disassembly is a key step in the recycling process. How to minimize the negative impact of greenhouse gases on the environment has attracted extensive attention. This paper studies the disassembly line balancing problem to minimize the carbon emissions generated in the disassembly process. A Q-learning algorithm in reinforcement learning is applied to solve the disassembly line balancing problem. Through the analysis and comparison with the state-action-reward-state’-action algorithm to address the same real-life cases, it is proved that the Q-learning algorithm has good performance in most cases. In terms of solution speed, the proposed method is faster in both small-scale and large-scale cases.},

The Latent Factor Analysis (LFA) model can well handle the high-dimensional matrices analysis. Recently, Particle Swarm optimization (PSO)-incorporated LFA models have been proposed to tune the hyper-parameters adaptively with high efficiency. However, the incorporation of PSO causes the premature problem. To address this issue, we propose a sequential Adam-adjusting-antennae BAS (A 2 BAS) optimization algorithm, which refines the latent factors obtained by the PSO-incorporated LFA model. The A 2 BAS algorithm consists of two sub-algorithms. First, we design an improved BAS algorithm which adjusts beetles’ antennae and step-size with Adam; Second, we implement the improved BAS algorithm to optimize all the row and column latent factors sequentially. With experimental results on two real high-dimensional matrices, we demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively solve the premature convergence issue.},

Although LCS has limitations working on higher dimensional datasets, we resolve this limitation by using CNN as a feature extractor. The other concept of the non-interpretability of CNN is addressed by using the LCS rule. Furthermore, our experiment with higher dimensional datasets like CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST shows that extended LCS provides comparable performance to the standard neural network model while also providing interpretable results.

Currently, some promising FL algorithms improve the effectiveness of learning under the non independent-and-identically-distributed (Non-IID) data settings. However, they require a large number of communication rounds between the server and clients for an acceptable accuracy. Inspired by the training paradigm of gossip learning, this paper proposes a new FL framework, named FedGosp. It first classifies the clients into different categories based on the model weights trained by the locally stored data. Then FedGosp utilizes the communication not only between clients and the server, but also between different classes of clients themselves. This training process enables instilling knowledge about various data distributions in the passed models. We evaluate the performance of FedGosp in multiple Non-IID settings on CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets, and compare it with the recently popular algorithms such as SCAFFOLD, FedAvg and FedProx. The experimental results show that FedGosp can improve the model accuracy by 6.53\% and save 5.6 × communication costs at best compared to the second-ranked baseline.},

We introduce a new parameter $\kappa$ into the SVM-ARIMA model to adjust the weight of the ARIMA component, which significantly improves the performance.

Through the tests of several multi-modal benchmark functions, it is shown that the algorithm can effectively and accurately find the most optimal solutions to the multi-modal problem. It does not need to set the niche radius in advance, so it can better solve multimodal optimization problems. We test it with nine multi-modal benchmark functions ranging from one-dimension (1-D) to ten-dimension (10-D), and we compare it with a genetic algorithm and evaluate from peak ratio, max peak ratio, and running time. The experimental results show that the CEDC algorithm is better than conventional algorithms in both runtime and peak ratio.},

  abstract  = {Pollen classification plays an essential role in many fields such as medicine and palynology. Notably, manual pollen identification via observing key pollen information (e.g., their contours) is time-consuming and laborious. To date, deep learning methods can extract complex features in an end-to-end manner. However, deep learning based automatic classification methods on pollen grains are still rare, and their performances remain unsatisfactory owing to limitation of interference from irrelevant information (such as impurities and bubbles) and the lack of pollen attention. Based on the above considerations, we propose a contour-guided network called CG-Net, which contains three modules. Image pre-processing module first removes impurities and bubbles in pollen images according to the color information. Then, contour awareness module is designed to generate contour features and these features are served as attention maps for next module. Finally, contour guidance module weights the yielded contour attention maps to both original images and feature maps of different convolution layers, making the CNN focus on discriminative features of pollen grains. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world pollen datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method with the accuracy and F1-score over 84\%.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning is broadly used in many intelligent cybernetic systems. With the burgeoning of the communities of AI, the number of machine learning-based models is rapidly increasing, but picking a suitable and optimal (or relatively good) model from overwhelming options has become a conundrum when deploying a new system. Therefore, we are motivated by an intriguing question: Can we automatically select a proper model for new data? However, unsupervised model selection poses two main challenges: (i) Evaluation and comparison of candidate models on the new data are infeasible due to the lack of labels; and (ii) It is non-trivial to build relationships between model performance and data characteristics when the interaction between these characteristics should be considered. In light of these limitations, this paper proposes a factorization machine-based unsupervised model selection method. Following mainstream model selection protocols, we also leverage model performance on prior known datasets. Differently, we learn higher-order complex relationships between model performance and dataset characteristics. Specifically, our method transfers the historical performance into a second-order function of meta-features and embedding weights by harnessing the power of factorization machine. This function can be subsequently used to select a proper model when given a new dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains more superior model selection performance than five state-of-the-art approaches, and our method executes faster than its competitors by approximate three magnitudes.},

However, there are few works in data augmentation addressing the information propagation of nodes with different importance. In this work, we propose a novel graph data augmentation algorithm for graph classification task, called PassAugment, aiming to pass these importance in graph data augmentation. After distinguishing the importance of all nodes in each graph using the saliency map, we design a data augmentation approach including two strategies: (i) randomly adding edges between the important nodes and the other nodes to globally improve the effective information passing, and (ii) randomly removing edges between the unimportant nodes and their neighbors to locally reduce the ineffective information passing. More importantly, our proposed approach as a standalone module can be combined with many GNNs architectures. Experimental results on graph classification task show that our approach consistently improves the accuracy and achieves or closely matches the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract  = {Imbalanced music genre classification is a crucial task in the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) field for identifying the long-tail, data-poor genre based on the related music audio segments, which is very prevalent in real-world scenarios. Most of the existing models are designed for class-balanced music datasets, resulting in poor performance in accuracy and generalization when identifying the music genres at the tail of the distribution. Inspired by the success of introducing Multi-instance Learning (MIL) in various classification tasks, we propose a novel mechanism named Multi-instance Attention (MATT) 1 to boost the performance for identifying tail classes. Specifically, we first construct the bag-level datasets by generating the album-artist pair bags. Second, we leverage neural networks to encode the music audio segments. Finally, under the guidance of a multi-instance attention mechanism, the neural network-based models could select the most informative genre to match the given music segment. Comprehensive experimental results on a large-scale music genre benchmark dataset with long-tail distribution demonstrate MATT significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines. 1 Github: https://github.com/JohannesLiu/Music-Genre-Classification},

To provide more accurate scientific research knowledge for researchers in a specific academic domain, it is necessary to study the discourse structure of domain scientific articles and to propose an automatic annotation approach to automatically annotate discourse information from articles. Unfortunately, few works have studied the discourse structure of domain scientific articles and the corresponding automatic discourse annotation. To fill this gap, we take scientific articles of the wastewater-based epidemiology domain as a case to study how to automatically and efficiently annotate discourse information. This paper has three contributions. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical discourse model with two layers to cover all potential discourses in various domain scientific articles. Specifically, the first layer defines four core discourse concepts to describe the main process of a scientific research which can be applied in all scientific articles in various domains. The second layer defines fine-granular domain-specific structure, which can accurately describe the entire research contents of a specific domain. Secondly, based on the proposed model, we build a corpus dataset of 100 annotated scientific articles in the wastewater-based epidemiology domain. Thirdly, based on the model and dataset, we propose a simple yet efficient Top-K resampling-based approach to train a more effective classifier for automatic annotation. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed hierarchical discourse model and the Top-K resampling-based classification approach.},

  abstract  = {Product backorder is a common problem in supply chain management systems. It is essential for entrepreneurs to predict the likelihood of backorder accurately to minimize a company’s losses. However, existing methods are hard to achieve satisfactory results since the number of backorders and non-backorders are extremely imbalanced. Besides, the backorder data’s attributes are complex to oversample them effectively. To address these problems, a novel hybrid sampling method is proposed to help predict extremely imbalanced backorder. The Randomized Undersampling (RUS) and a Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (CWGAN) are innovatively introduced into backorder prediction. First, RUS is used to reduce the majority non-backorder samples. Second, CWGAN is served as an oversampling technique to generate high-quality backorder samples. It utilizes unique structures in the generator and the discriminator to effectively model both numerical and categorical variables. Finally, the training dataset is balanced, and the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is adopted to make backordering prediction. In the experiments of Kaggle’s dataset ‘Can you predict product backorder?’, our proposed method is superior to all benchmark methods in terms of standard evaluation metrics. The results show that our proposed product backorder prediction model is effective.},

  abstract  = {Malocclusion has a high prevalence in the population, which seriously affects patients’ oral and mental health. Angle’s classification is a widely accepted diagnostic standard for malocclusion, either requiring professional intervention and complicated procedures, or increasing radiation risks. This paper proposes a new method of Angle’s classification based on occlusal contact information to realize the automatic Angle’s classification. Firstly, a novel bite force measurement device is used to record the occlusal data of subjects with different occlusal categories, Meta-analysis evaluated several occlusion quantitative evaluation indicators. Then, the imbalance of the data set is improved by oversampling and popular machine learning models are used for training and performance evaluation. The result shows that the accuracy of the random forest model combined with occlusal contact information reaches 87.83\%, and the performance of other evaluation indexes is good. It is demonstrated that machine learning models can be applied to Angle’s classification and shows the great potential of occlusal contact information in the aided diagnosis of oral diseases.},

Group role assignment (GRA) is dedicated to optimizing the performance of a group, which is not applicable to the multi-group role assignment (MGRA). Moreover, in dynamic scenes, the agents’ capabilities change over time, further complicating the problem. Based on the emerging and promising role-based collaboration (RBC) theory and its E-CARGO (Environments - Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects) model, we formulate the adaptive MGRA problem, and propose a novel current state-based MGRA (CSB-MGRA) algorithm to keep the entire team productive. The constraints of the tasks are not the same due to their diverse characteristics and needs. Moreover, team members do not necessarily remain the same in the whole process, and staff transfers may occur between groups. A constant assignment scheme is not guaranteed to maximize team performance. Therefore, the constraints of different groups are set to be different, and re-assignments of the whole team are considered in the construction of CSB_MGRA. The experimental results prove the practicality of the solution proposed in this paper.},

Regardless, they have required a lot of processing power due to the massive amount of data that has been generated during the last years. As a consequence, determining the computational cost of these algorithms is one of the most interesting tasks in the quest for optimal clustering solutions in a real-time system. This study presents a research guide for the researchers working in the same field.

  abstract  = {In safety-critical applications, where several mobile robots and autonomous agents are being utilized for a mission, a fault-resilience behavior of the system is necessary. The fault resilience mechanism mostly uses the robot’s redundancy and tasks reassignment to recover malfunctioning and increase operating efficiency. The E-CARGO (Environments - Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects) model designed for the Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) approach has been used successfully on cooperative Multi-Robot Systems (MRSs). Role-based characteristics of E-CARGO will facilitate cooperative decision-making and simplify handling failure. This paper develops an extended E-CARGO model for a fault resilience role engine. Agents use factor graphs to update the process role and manage the potential failure in each time step. We apply hybrid control in this paper. By “hybrid” we mean that evaluating and assigning initial roles are centralized, and role-playing is decentralized based on the local observations. The RBC life cycle and a Bayesian consensus will maintain fault resilience behaviors. Potential failure can be identified in a Bayesian way by updating agents’ reliability and calling the central unit to assign new process roles to guarantee robustness. Simulation experiments show that the proposed role engine can increase performance and tolerate failures in multi-robot path planning scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Quality of emergency services depend on the effectiveness of emergency vehicle fleets (e.g., police, fire trucks, and ambulances). Traditionally, these fleets are composed of emergency crews that must attend highly stochastic incident demand within a short target arrival time. Incidents must be attended immediately, which prevents that an a priori computed work break schedule is executed as planned and many crews may be left without a break during prolonged periods of time. Extended focused work periods decrease efficiency with related decline of attention and performance. Therefore, break schedule should be regularly updated on the fly to allow frequent and sufficiently long time for rest. In this paper, we propose a dynamic algorithm for on the fly work and break balancing for crews in emergency fleets. Based on the historical intervention data, the algorithm (re)arranges vehicles’ crews’ work breaks as the time evolves considering individual crews’ preferences. Moreover, it dynamically reallocates stand-by vehicles for improved coverage of a region of interest. We show the performance of the proposed algorithm on two simple functional examples.},

In this paper, we focus on the driver excitement in the level 2 automated driving (advanced driving support) and propose a method for estimating the excitement using the SD (semantic differential) method. We also show that there is a clear correlation between excitement and arousal levels during driving with a level 2 driver assistance system.

  abstract  = {Sensing human activity via WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has considerable application prospects in future intelligent interaction scenarios such as virtual reality, intelligent games, metaverse, etc. Recently, many Deep Learning-based WiFi sensing schemes have been proposed in the literature, which gained high accuracy for a wide range of simple activities such as standing, squatting, and bending. However, the performance will be suffered when existing approaches are used to recognize drastic activities, such as actions in vigorous sports. This is mainly due to the reason that the spatiotemporal information of these actions is not well utilized. To overcome this drawback, we propose a novel DL-based WiFi sensing method for drastic activity recognition by combining the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. The designed CNN-BiLSTM architecture is in parallel with feature extraction, which can simultaneously extract sufficient spatiotemporal features of action data and establish the mapping relationship between actions and CSI streams, thereby improving the accuracy of activity recognition. The CNN is used to extract information on the spatial dimension, while the BiLSTM extracts information on the time dimension. To verify the performance of the proposed scheme, we build a hardware experiment platform and constrain a dataset with 1400 pieces of records for 7 classes of basketball actions. After training over the dataset, the proposed CNN-BiLSTM scheme achieves 96\% experimental accuracy on the test set, which is better than the benchmark methods.},

In the present work, we take the next step and investigate how driving modes (autopilot, navigation system, and printed map) associated with different levels of engagement can be categorized from drivers’ gaze patterns. Using gaze data recorded in these three driving tasks along with several state-of-the-art machine learning methods, we demonstrate that the driving modes are associated with different gaze patterns.

Compound expression recognition is an important challenge for the assessment of human complex emotion.

The recognition performance of models learned from the basic expressions is poor due to the small number of compound expression datasets with highly accurate labels and insufficient sample diversity. Making full use of domains outside of compound expressions in small sample datasets will help promote diversity. We propose the Multi-Domain Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (MDFGAN), which innovatively fuses the face domain, compound expression domain and basic expression domain to obtain rich expression generation capability and high accuracy recognition. Pairing the face domain and the contour-unrelated compound expression domain in the generator will expand the sample diversity. The contour-related compound expression domain and the basic expression domain will jointly improve the expression recognition accuracy of the discriminator.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments with three different legged robots (Walker2d, Ant-v2, and Humanoid-v2) in OpenAI Gym. The experimental results reveal that Walker2d and Ant-v2 are more vulnerable to attack on the length than on the thickness of the body parts, whereas Humanoid-v2 is vulnerable to attack on both the length and thickness. We further identified that the adversarial body shapes break left-right symmetry or shift the center of gravity of the legged robots. This method of finding adversarial body shapes can be used to proactively diagnose the vulnerability of legged robot walking.},

  abstract  = {We address adversarial attacks on the actuators at the joints of legged robots trained by deep reinforcement learning. The vulnerability to the joint attacks can significantly impact the safety and robustness of legged robots. In this study, we demonstrate that the adversarial perturbations to the torque control signals of the actuators can significantly reduce the rewards and cause walking instability in robots. To find the adversarial torque perturbations, we develop black-box adversarial attacks, where the adversary cannot access the neural networks trained by deep reinforcement learning. The black box attack can be applied to legged robots regardless of the architecture and algorithms of deep reinforcement learning. We employ three search methods for the black-box adversarial attacks: random search, differential evolution, and numerical gradient descent methods. In experiments with the quadruped robot Ant-v2 and the bipedal robot Humanoid-v2, in OpenAI Gym environments, we find that differential evolution can efficiently find the strongest torque perturbations among the three methods. In addition, we realize that the quadruped robot Ant-v2 is vulnerable to the adversarial perturbations, whereas the bipedal robot Humanoid-v2 is robust to the perturbations. Consequently, the joint attacks can be used for proactive diagnosis of robot walking instability.},

  abstract  = {Thermal Comfort Data is critical to generate machine learning models for efficient heating and cooling systems. However, thermal comfort datasets are often highly imbalanced due to subjective user feedback, thus making it challenging to accurately predict both majority and minority classes. This demands the use of data synthesis techniques prior to training classification models to balance the datasets. Commonly used techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Method (ADASYN) often compromise testing accuracy and more sophisticated techniques like Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) are significantly expensive to train. In this paper we propose a novel data augmentation algorithm called Conditional Classifier-Generator (cCGen) to address these two issues. We evaluated the performance of cCGen with real thermal comfort data against SMOTE, ADASYN and cWGAN-GP at different imbalance ratios. Our experiments reveal that our approach can produce better F1 scores than other sampling methods while being more than 10 times faster than cWGAN-GP and not compromising test accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Trajectory prediction of a moving object has imperative significance in both research and practical applications, ranging from target tracking, security surveillance and autonomous vehicle driving. For improving the efficacy of such prediction, a novel approach of data stream learning coupled with Kalman-filter and evolving correlated horizons feature selection (KF-ECH-FS) is proposed. KF has traditionally been used as a control-feedback-loop mechanism that corrects the errors from past trials, to predict the next-step position in trajectory prediction. In our fusion model here, KF and its windowed version are being used as predictor variables in a multivariate time series forecasting process. The predictor variables which serve as additional features aid in improving the trajectory prediction when only the relevant features are being selected in the incremental learning manner by multi-variate data stream analytics. Our proposed ECH-FS solves the problem of model overfitting when many features after expansion by time-series windowing are evaluated and selected along the learning process. A simple and efficient feature selection heuristics, Auto-encoder is used, along with data stream learning by Gate Recurrent Unit. The results, through an experimentation over a sample case of camera surveillance of accident prevention, show that our proposed KF-ECH-FS is superior to either KF or windowing alone in 1-step horizon trajectory prediction.},

But are humans ready for it, or will they be hesitant to adopt it due to the lack of trust? To safeguard future autonomous mobility, robust run-time trust assurance and assessment is necessary. One strategy that is so far under-explored is rooted in involving the intelligence inside the autonomous agents, which could be directed towards detection of trust-breaking behaviour in other agents so that problematic vehicles are reported before they can engage in harmful behaviour.To support the progress in this direction, we propose a peer-to-peer model-based run-time trust assessment method, employing the model in terms of a Digital Twin for an autonomous vehicle (drone in our case) to ensure the trusted execution of intelligent agents. In this research, we examine the role of the Digital Twin in the trust-building scenario, and propose the characteristics of the intended Digital Twin model. To illustrate the approach, we present a case study of an autonomous-drone food delivery system and use formal approaches such as Petri Nets and Finite State Machines (FSM) to evaluate the scenario and demonstrate how trust could be built among autonomous drones or other vehicles.},

Carpooling among commuting private cars can reduce vehicle volume and alleviate traffic congestion. Moreover, commuters matching is the key issue to solve for realizing stable carpooling. This paper designs a commuting trajectory based stable carpooling model (CT-CSC) for commuting private cars, and proposes a particle swarm-based commuter matching approach for stable carpooling (PSCMA). The objective of CT-CSC model is minimizing carpooling cost. In the proposed PSCMA, the particle swarm and fitness calculation rules are redesigned to make it suitable for the CT-CSC model. The real-world RFID electronic identification data in Chongqing is used for experimental verification. Experimental results show the effect of the parameter inertia factor ω for the PSCMA. In addition, compared with genetic algorithm, hill climbing algorithm and simulation annealing algorithm, the performance of the PSCMA is outstanding. Furthermore, 1,003 commuters passing through the Huanghuayuan Bridge in Chongqing are selected to carpool, and we analyzed the reduction of the number of commuters, mileages and gasoline},

  abstract  = {Accurate traffic prediction is critical to the effectiveness of intelligent transportation systems. However, traffic data are highly nonlinear with complicated dynamic spatio-temporal correlations, accurate traffic forecasting, particularly long-term forecasting, remains a difficulty. Existing models generally learn a fixed graph to capture spatial correlations, which makes them difficult to effectively capture changing spatial dynamics over time, resulting in poor prediction outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new spatio-temporal graph convolution network model, named Spatio-Temporal Attention-based Graph Convolution Network (STAGCN), which jointly fuses dynamic evolving spatial correlations and long-term temporal correlations to improve the performance. First, we design a spatio-temporal multi-head self-attention module to capture both spatial heterogeneity and temporal correlations. Second, we propose an adaptive evolving graph convolution module that can learn a new graph at each time step and make STAGCN evolve dynamically. Meanwhile, self-attention is used to construct a dynamic adjacency matrix to further capture spatial correlations. In addition, we optimize the original Transformer by employing relation-aware attention mechanism to make it better suitable for time series prediction, thereby improving the long-term prediction performance of the model. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms other baselines.},

  abstract  = {The autonomous vehicle (AV) has been studied by many researchers recently because of its valuable points in transportation, aviation, military, smart city, and aerospace. The model predictive control (MPC) is employed to track the artificial intelligent regenerated motion signals with higher accuracy than other error-and model-based controllers as it can consider the constraints of the system in extracting the optimal solution. However, the accuracy and applicability of the MPC rely on the MPC horizons, including prediction and control horizons. The higher prediction horizons mean a higher computational load of the system, which reduces the real-time applicability of the system. On the other hand, a higher prediction horizon increases the system’s stability in facing abrupt motion signals. In addition, higher control horizons mean more dexterity in the system facing an unknown situation. On the other hand, a longer control horizon increases the computational load of the system exponentially. This study employs particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to extract the optimal MPC horizons considering the accuracy and computational load. The cost function is defined to increase the accuracy of the longitudinal time-varying velocity tracking, decrease the lateral deviation, decrease the relative yaw angle and decrease the computational load of the system. It should be noted that the lateral deviation and relative yaw angle are extracted using the vehicle four wheels dynamic model in order to evaluate the AVs’ passenger motion comfort. The proposed method is designed and developed under MATLAB/Simulink. The extracted optimal MPC horizon is compared with some other arrangements of the MPC horizons to prove the efficiency of the proposed method compared with the trial-and-error method.},

In spite of a large body of literature dedicated to the identification, rejection and removal of artifactual components in EEG, the study of the impact that different artifacts may have on the EEG signal properties has been mostly qualitative and focused on the source (e.g. muscle activity, electromagnetic interference) rather than the function generating them. This work takes advantage of a unique dataset where EEG of 12 participants elicited during the execution of 9 common human activities (e.g., speaking, blinking, etc.) is co-registered with electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, and baselined to “resting” (artifact-free) intervals to allow an exact, quantified assessment of the impact of artifacts. We examine several metrics capturing different facets of the influence of artifacts on EEG and measure the extent to which a state-of-the-art artifact removal method is able to eliminate them. In addition to an in-depth, quantified profiling of functional EEG artifacts, our work provides valuable information for precisely tuning the hyper-parameters of artifact rejection and removal algorithms and for designing realistic brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.},

However, recent researches have shown that language models can learn gender biases from corpus, and lead to discriminatory decisions and unfair allocation of resources. We proposed a measure of gender bias in BERT resume retrieval system, by performing job searches on a group of resumes with different genders but consistent abilities. We proposed to calculate the average ranking and Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) scores of male and female resumes, and found that men outperformed women even though the two resumes were identical except for gender. This shows BERT has gender stereotypes, and its resume retrieval systems prefer male candidates. Therefore, we also proposed a regularized debiasing method to promote gender equity. Referring to Densifier method, we can get the subspace vector encoding bias semantics through matrix transformation of word vector difference between occupational and gender words. By defining the correlation between BERT word vector and gender bias subspace as the loss term, we can remove the bias semantics in BERT, and also avoid it learning stereotypes even trained on an unfair data set. After regularized debiased, the gender ranking gap of BERT was reduced by an average of 61.8\%, while DCG scores were reduced by 53.9\%.},

For this reason, we propose a slope-adaptive navigation approach based on multilayer cost map in this paper. Instead of taking the point cloud of slope as obstacles, we actively construct a multi-layer cost map that takes slope information into the map in the stage of building environment map. A slope detection algorithm is developed to switch the cost map during the robot navigation. The slope is then considered as a passable road, only with extra cost. In the case that the slope leads the robot to a new floor, we adopt the Aruco code to switch the map information, such that the navigation can still keep working. Both simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

In this study, we investigated a method to assess car sickness objectively and quantitatively by inducing sickness with a driving simulator (DS) and examining the changes in physiological indices with low-burden measurement devices. Ten participants were asked to ride DS and read a book there, and subjective ratings of sickness and drowsiness, electrocardiogram, respiration, and skin conductance were obtained. Experiments were conducted under two conditions: with sinusoidal vibration at a roll angle of 0.2 Hz (A) and without vibration (B). Nine out of ten participants experienced mild subjective sickness, although no statistically significant differences between conditions were obtained. The principal component analysis on physiological indices was conducted on seven participants across conditions; two were excluded due to arrhythmia and one was due to no sickness. In addition, skin conductance was excluded from the analysis because of measurement deficits. As a result, the first component related to respiratory instability was commonly obtained in all, and the principal component loadings were similar for all but one of the participants. This component increased with moderate sickness and drowsiness. The second component was related to mean heart rate and heart rate variability. Not only there were large individual differences in the loading patterns of this component and its principal component scores showed complex changes depending on the degree of sickness and drowsiness. Thus, although the process of sickness is complex and differs among individuals, the combination of changes in these two principal components may be used to assess the process. Further studies with a larger number of participants are needed to develop a method to assess sickness and drowsiness separately and to address individual differences.},

Furthermore, a physiological index cannot be used for evaluation because the individual character includes their results. However, in this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation based on saliva. The evaluation of inside response is an important factor in understanding the skills and abilities of an individual. We measured saliva cortisol, which is an ideal index for evaluating stress, and applied it in a simulator-based experiment.},

  abstract  = {With the blossoming of online social networks (OSN), personality analysis based on OSN texts has gained much research attention in recent years. The previous methods mainly focus on human-designed features extracted through psychological dictionaries or semantic features extracted through language models. However, the shallow statistics features can not fully convey the personality information and the language models can not capture enough psychological background knowledge. Besides, the lack of large labeled datasets has been a serious obstacle impending further research. To tackle these problems, we propose a personality analysis model, namely PerKG, which combines personality knowledge graph and heterogeneous graph representation learning to exploit external knowledge from psycholinguistics and learn the group-level information to predict users’ personalities accurately. Specifically, we construct a personality knowledge graph based on existing psycholinguistics knowledge. And then, for each user, we align the user information with the knowledge graph to obtain the personality heterogeneous graph. Finally, the personality vector of each entity node is learned for prediction by designing a walk strategy on the personality heterogeneous graph. Detailed experimentation shows that our proposed PerKG architecture can effectively improve the performance and alleviate the label sparsity problem of personality analysis.},

  abstract  = {To differentiate from competitors, it has become increasingly important to design products based on the “Kansei value,” which impresses and inspires consumers. However, the perceptual indices of products are generally designed qualitatively, which is not only time-consuming but also costly. Therefore, in recent years, studies have been conducted to discuss the relationship between some perceptions by applying multivariate analysis and machine learning to the adjectives related to perception and affective response. Nonetheless, determining the structure that expresses the relationship of the adjectives is obtained by trial and error, based on the hypothesis of the researchers. Therefore, we aimed to investigate a method for mechanically exploring some semi-optimal structures without a hypothesis of the model structure by applying a genetic algorithm to the construction of adjective relationships using structural equation modeling. In this study, we prepared a four-layered model according to the human perception process for eight categories of material samples and constructed a relationship from a total of 20 words perceived from each sample. Consequently, we could construct a perceptual model that can be interpreted quantitatively and semantically using the proposed method. The advantage of this technique is that it can be used to construct important structures that might be overlooked.},

To ensure service quality and maximize the revenue, cloud service providers in GDCs need to reasonably and efficiently allocate computing resources and schedule tasks of users. Traditional heuristic algorithms face challenges of uncertainty and complexity in GDCs for scheduling tasks. To solve them, this work establishes an improved resource allocation and task scheduling method based on deep reinforcement learning. It considers the dependency among different tasks, and builds a workload model based on the real-life data in Google cluster trace. In addition, a deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling model is proposed to reasonably allocate and schedule resources (CPU and memory) in GDCs. Based on two models, an Improved Deep Q-learning Network (IDQN) is proposed to autonomously learn the changing environment of GDCs, and yield the optimal strategy for resource allocation and task scheduling. Real-life data-based experiments demonstrate that IDQN achieves lower task rejection rates and energy cost than several typical task scheduling methods.},

Due to the difficulty in capturing nonlinear features, traditional forecasting methods usually fail to achieve high performance in predicting resource usage and workload sequences. Much noise implicit in the original sequences of resources and workloads is another reason for their low performance. To address these problems, this work proposes a hybrid prediction model named SABG that integrates an adaptive Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter, Attention mechanism, Bidirectional and Grid versions of Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. SABG adopts an adaptive SG filter in the data pre-processing to eliminate noise and extreme points in the original time series. It uses bidirectional and grid LSTM networks to capture bidirectional features and dimension ones, respectively. Then, it utilizes an attention mechanism to explore importance of different data dimensions. SABG aims to predict resource usage and workloads in highly variable traces in cloud computing systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SABG achieves higher-accuracy prediction than several benchmark prediction approaches with datasets from Google cluster traces.},

This work first adopts a SG filter to eliminate noise in the raw data. It applies TCN to extract short-term features from the sequences.

Given the highly dynamic nature of such a setting, the accuracy and understanding of traditional reconstruction methods as well as the generalization capabilities of deep learning-based methods is required. However, the state-of-the-art methods are typically inadequate. The presented work demonstrates a two-part machine learning-based approach that rely on autoencoder-like models. The first is a Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) that takes a single image as input and reconstructs a 3D voxel grid. The input images are then sorted based on the reconstruction quality of the SAE output. The second is a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) that processes multiple images sampled from the ordered set to generate an enhanced 3D voxel grid. The work highlights a novel approach to 3D model reconstruction and presents insights to the process of 3D reconstruction from single image inputs. The autoencoders are trained on a dataset comprised of multiple objects with images captured from different zenith and azimuth angles, simulating an aerial vehicle viewpoint. We show the efficacy of the proposed approach by reconstructing a 3D voxel grid on a ModelNet40 dataset class.},

RWMaU is focused to find the majority points which lie at the overlapped region of the minority and the majority classes. Such points meddle with the learning and detection of the minority points. RWMaU uses random walks to mark the majority points satisfying the above characteristic in a non-parametric fashion. For each majority point, a proximity score is calculated on the basis of - their visit frequencies and the order of visits of the majority points in the random walks. This score is used to perceive the closeness of the majority class points to the minority class. The majority points lying close to the minority class are subsequently undersampled. Empirical evaluations on 21 datasets using 3 classifiers demonstrate substantial improvement in performance of RWMaU over existing methods for addressing class imbalance and show that it is an efficient and effective way to address class imbalance in binary classification problems.},

We propose an effective regularization method that simultaneously imposes spatial consistency and feature diversity on CNN feature maps from a unified perspective. The former guides different feature map channels to concentrate collaboratively on the discriminative areas while the latter ensures that the feature maps are diverse. The proposed method does not require additional supervision, and leverages the covariance matrix of multi-channel feature maps to regularize the loss at the last convolutional layer where the semantic information is the richest. This allows the influence to be backpropagated to update all convolutional layers. We perform experiments using four network architectures for transfer learning from two source domains to three target domains, and demonstrate that our regularization method improves accuracy in all different settings. The proposed regularization method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars, and Stanford-Dogs datasets with 89.8\%, 94.6\%, and 88.5\% accuracy, respectively.},

As facial emotion is one of the important expressions in our daily life, emotion recognition helps in conversation and understanding more effectively. Although emotion recognition may seem to be an easy task to humans, it is challenging for the machine. Currently, many facial emotion detection technologies are based on the features extracted from the whole face and do further analysis to detect emotions. However, there are some limitations to this method. For example, it may require considerable time in the training and prediction with the high-resolution image input. It is a major issue if we apply the model to a mobile device that gives high-resolution photos. To deal with the problem, reducing the input size while remaining the important information would be a solution. To achieve it, the dimension reduction method may be an option. On the other hand, there is a lot of psychological research on how humans recognize emotion by facial expression. Improvements can be made if we can make good use of the results for emotion recognition tasks. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a psychological-oriented method for reducing the input size on the emotion detection task which is based on the eyes region. It is found that the proposed method gives compatible performance compared to the face based model. With the proposed method, the time used for training and prediction is significantly reduced.},

  abstract  = {In two earlier papers presented at the 2019 and 2020 American Control Conferences, the concept of “Mutual Learning” was introduced by the authors and applied to learning in static and dynamic stochastic environments. In this paper, we extend the concept of mutual learning to optimization. Two agents attempting to optimize the same performance index “learn” from each other to reach the solution more efficiently. Since optimization is a well investigated mathematical area in systems theory, it is particularly well suited to the original objective of the authors to study “Mutual Learning” in a systems theoretic framework.The two agents involved in mutual learning can use any of the methods well-known in the literature to optimize the given function. The initial conditions and the period over which the optimization is carried out, may be different for the two agents before they communicate with each other for the first time. The principal conclusion of the paper is that mutual learning should be viewed as a general research area, and not as a specific procedure used in different system theoretic problems.},

  abstract  = {optimization of per-layer or/and total inference time without accuracy loss in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is significantly crucial in resource-constrained Edge-AI devices and embedded systems. To do this, this work 1) introduces a CNN inference micro-benchmark (mbNet) for performance analysis and optimization and 2) proposes a simple yet effective performance model for adaptive kernel selection to optimize per-layer CNN inference time. Considering the convolutional layer is the core part of CNNs, the two mainstream convolutional strategies of unrolling based convolution (UNROLL) and direct convolution (DIRECT) are adopted/implemented, compared and analyzed in terms of per-layer convolutional time. Using the obtained data from our mbNet, we build an accurate and interpretable tree-based performance model, with which our adaptive kernel selection approach shows significant convolutional performance improvement up to $5.4\times$ speedup (on average, $2.7\times$ and $1.6\times$ speedup, compared to the default UNROLL and DIRECT respectively).},

  abstract  = {Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) is considerably challenging due to the capacity and electricity constraints of electric vehicles (EVs). Most existing studies on EVRP consider no limits on charging times when optimizing the routes of EVs. However, due to the long time of charging, the charging times of EVs are usually limited due to the urgent service demands of customers. To simulate this practical problem, this paper first formulates the EVRP with both capacity and charging time constraints (EVRP-CC). To tackle this new optimization problem, this paper further devises a two-stage solution construction method for ant colony optimization (ACO) to build feasible solutions to EVRP-CC. Subsequently, we embed the proposed method into five popular and classical ACO algorithms, namely ant system (AS), ranking based ant system (Rank-AS), elite ant system (EAS), max-min ant system (MMAS), and ant colony system (ACS), to solve EVRP-CC. Extensive experiments conducted on several instances generated from the widely used EVRP benchmark set demonstrate that the proposed solution construction method is effective to help ACO to solve EVRP-CC. In particular, Rank-AS with the proposed solution construction method achieves the best overall performance in solving EVRP-CC.},

  abstract  = {Virtual Coupling (VC) is a hot topic in railways. A virtually coupled train set operates as a single train and consists of multiple unit trains (UTs). Each UT keeps a desired gap distance with its predecessor by following a spacing policy. Constant time headway (CTH) spacing policy is widely adopted in the existing studies about VC. Arrival time difference (ATD), i.e., the difference between the time instants of two successive UTs arriving at a platform, is large when using CTH. It is not expected because the passengers loading of all UTs should operate at the same time. This paper firstly analyzes the causes of ATD mathematically and proves ATD is inevitable when adopting CTH. Then, the change tendency of ATD with respect to each parameter is analyzed. The above analysis indicates that CTH is not suitable for the arrival process. Thus, a quadratic spacing policy is designed to reduce ATD. Experimental results show that ATD can hardly be reduced by only optimizing the parameters of CTH, but the quadratic spacing policy greatly reduces it.},

  abstract  = {Virtual Coupling (VC) is an emerging topic in the railway industry. It breaks the long-distance limitation and enables trains to operate at closer distances with new safety distance constraints. The new safety distance has high-order nonlinear time-varying because it is closer to the characteristics of virtually coupled trains (VCTs). This makes it difficult for the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system to track the front virtually coupled train (VCT) in real-time and cannot guarantee stop synchronization. VCTs are equivalent to a physically connected train. So synchronous operation is very important. In order to solve the above problems, this paper takes the entire VCTs as optimization object and takes synchronized stopping, punctuality, and precise stopping as optimization indicators. The reinforcement learning Deep Q Network (DQN) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem to seek the reference speed curve of each VCT. ATO performs real-time control on the basis of reference speed curve, which reduces calculation pressure and ensures synchronous operation of VCTs. Moreover, this paper improves DQN algorithm according to operation scenarios of VCTs to make the solution faster. Finally, we conduct a simulation experiment with the scene of Beijing Metro Line 11. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of this method for stopping synchronization and the superiority of the improved DQN algorithm for VCTs running scenarios.},

Queuing theory is used to provide equilibrium guidance for the evacuation. Furthermore, lane-changing and traffic light preemption strategies are used to prioritize the EV.

By introducing a new cost function and combining the Danger Field method in the collision checking process, our method can efficiently find a near time-optimal and smooth trajectory to the goal. We verify the method in simulation using a car-like robot model in an environment containing both static and moving obstacles. By comparing it systematically to other sampling-based path planning algorithms and the Time-Scaling time-optimal trajectory planning method, the results show that our method generally produces collision-free, smoother, near time-optimal trajectories that satisfy constraints with less computation time and fewer samples.},

As a result, the algorithm is able to efficiently train multiple networks representing different map regions and track poses accurately in large-scale environments.

By processing the high-resolution images of the vision-based tactile sensor, we achieved depth reconstruction of the surface and localization of the contact area. To improve gripping flexibility and stability, we applied a self-adaptive grasping strategy with real-time contact detection feedback, which performed 94\% success rate in experiment. Based on the rotational actuator at the fingertip, we proposed two in-hand manipulation primitives: (1) pivot: fingertips co-rotating for object reorientation; (2) twist: fingertips contra-rotating for object spin. The primitives are theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified in two practical tasks: pivoting a paper cup under vertical constraints and twisting a screw with spin angle estimation.

To improve the efficiency of an EDAS, a learning-based approach to model the driver behavior from an urban driving data collected using a dynamic driving simulator is presented. To cluster the driving data of thirty-four participants, unsupervised learning techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used. Furthermore, to predict the driver speed error while tracking an advisory speed, both stochastic and determinstic models, namely Stochastic Volatility (SV) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) respectively, are trained. Six new drivers evaluated the proposed concept, whose driving style is classified using a trained temporal convolution network (TCN). Using the predicted driver speed error, the eco-driving advisory speed is compensated and provided as a feedback to the driver via a human-machine interface (HMI). The results reveal that the deterministic model has been able to achieve higher prediction accuracy as compared to the stochastic model. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the drivers using EDAS with driver error compensation have been able to perform better advisory speed tracking and achieve improved energy savings.},

The hourly increase of users’ interactions and the e-commerce platform’s desire of letting users engage on their sites are pushing researchers to shape the virtual digital web as user specific and revenue-oriented. This paper develops a deep learning-based approach for building a movie recommendation system with three main aspects: (a) using a knowledge graph to embed text and meta information of movies, (b) using multi-modal information of movies like audio, visual frames, text summary, meta data information to generate movie/user representations without directly using rating information; this multi-modal representation can help in coping up with cold-start problem of recommendation system (c) a graph attention network based approach for developing regression system. For meta encoding, we have built knowledge graph from the meta information of the movies directly. For movie-summary embedding, we extracted nouns, verbs, and object to build a knowledge graph with head-relation-tail relationships. A deep neural network, as well as Graph attention networks, are utilized for measuring performance in terms of RMSE score. The proposed system is tested on an extended MovieLens-100K data-set having multi-modal information. Experimental results establish that only rating-based embeddings in the current setup outperform the state-of-the-art techniques but usage of multi-modal information in embedding generation performs better than its single-modal counterparts. 1 .},

  abstract  = {Human walking is a complex activity with a high level of cooperation and interaction between different systems in the body. Accurate detection of the phases of the gait in real-time is crucial to control lower-limb assistive devices like exoskeletons and prostheses. There are several ways to detect the walking gait phase, ranging from cameras and depth sensors to the sensors attached to the device itself or the human body. Electromyography (EMG) is one of the input methods that has captured lots of attention due to its precision and time delay between neuromuscular activity and muscle movement. This study proposes a few Machine Learning (ML) based models on lower-limb EMG data for human walking. The proposed models are based on Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN).

  abstract  = {Patients with knee arthropathy suffer from pain owing to damage at the knee joint cartilage and experience difficulty in walking as the condition worsens. As one of treatments of knee arthropathy, an implantation of cellular cartilage has been performed. After implantation of cellular cartilage, the knee joint should avoid overweight to prevent cell damage form body weight and apply appropriate mechanical stress to articular cartilage to promote cartilage regeneration. Therefore, a weight support system which can adjust the amount of weight in everyday use is required. This study aims to develop an in-clothes body weight support system to protect the knee joint during daily walking to support knee arthropathy treatment and recovery in regenerative medicine, and confirm basic performance of the system through experiments with able-bodied person. The system had frame structure with two-node link from the groin to the foot with the user&#39;s knee joint as the center of rotation. It consisted of load-bearing seat, height adjustment mechanism, thigh cuff, mechanical knee joint, and, ground reaction force sensor shoes, and was designed to be sufficiently thin to fit inside clothes. In the 10-Meter walking test, the system could adjust the amount of supporting weight and support two-thirds, one-half, and one-third of total body weight of an able-bodied participant during walking. In conclusion, we confirmed that the developed system had basic performance of weight support.},

Although the success of deep neural network makes the object recognition feasible in various applications, it is still difficult to perform well on a large number of classes. This paper presents an ensemble learning approach to deal with recognition for the growing number of retail products. In the proposed technique, the object classification networks are first improved with feature extraction and block attention. The ensemble model is then constructed by integrating the multiple network models with the loss selection as model weights. In the experiments, the feasibility of our ensemble recognition method is validated with a number of production items. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art recognition algorithms.},

As the first step of applying the evidence theory in practical applications, the generation of basic probability assignment(BPA) directly affects the subsequent fusion and decision-making. However, it is still a difficult and open issue. This paper proposed a new method to generate BPA with the normal membership function. First, we construct a normal membership function for each class with its mean value and standard deviation of a certain attribute, whose function value represents the probability of a sample belonging to it. According to the rule of the intersection of fuzzy sets, the probability of a sample belonging to the proposition with multiple classes is the minimum function value of the normal membership functions for all relevant classes. Therefore, the BPA for the attribute can be obtained with the rule. Similarly, the BPAs for other attributes can also obtained with the same method. To make decision, the BPAs for all attributes will be combined into a fused BPA with the Dempster combination rule. The final classification result is the proposition with the largest value in it. Finally, we conduct the classification experiments on nine datasets from the UCI dataset and the result shows the superiority and robustness of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we propose an approximate Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) unit using a Random Forest approximation method, which can significantly reduce the computation for inference in the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We assume various scenarios of faults and evaluate the fault effects. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approximate DMR unit achieves high fault detection for three types of fault models.

In this publication, we address this problem by proposing a method for training effective language-specific sentence encoders without manually labeled data. Our approach is to automatically construct a dataset of paraphrase pairs from sentence-aligned bilingual text corpora. We then use the collected data to fine-tune a Transformer language model with an additional recurrent pooling layer. Our sentence encoder can be trained in less than a day on a single graphics card, achieving high performance on a diverse set of sentence-level tasks.

  abstract  = {Temporal action localization (TAL) is a task of identifying a set of actions in a video, which involves localizing the start and end frames and classifying each action instance. Existing methods have addressed this task by using predefined anchor windows or heuristic bottom-up boundary-matching strategies, which are major bottlenecks in inference time. Additionally, the main challenge is the inability to capture long-range actions due to a lack of global contextual information. In this paper, we present a novel anchor-free framework, referred to as HTNet, which predicts a set of $\langle$start time, end time, class$\rangle$ triplets from a video based on a Transformer architecture. After the prediction of coarse boundaries, we refine it through a background feature sampling (BFS) module and hierarchical Transformers, which enables our model to aggregate global contextual information and effectively exploit the inherent semantic relationships in a video. We demonstrate how our method localizes accurate action instances and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two TAL benchmark datasets: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.3.},

In the case of automated or robotic N-Trailers, which can often exchange a subset of trailers during operations (e.g., when used in logistic stations or transhipment ports), kinematic parameters of the vehicle can become unknown or at least uncertain. Moreover, in the multi-axle trailers with fixed wheels the resultant trailer length and hitching offset are inherently uncertain or even time-varying during cornering motion. Therefore, we address the problem of parametric estimation of the N-Trailer kinematics using only (noisy) measurements of the vehicle’s joint (articulation) angles. A scalable sequential estimation procedure is proposed which can be flexibly applied to vehicles equipped with an arbitrary number of trailers interconnected with the off-axle and/or on-axle hitches. Numerical results presented in the paper illustrate large-sample statistical properties of the proposed estimation procedure.},

The core of the strategy is to promote communication link stability through backup nodes. A node backup routing algorithm is designed to search for alternative nodes for each node in a communication link. A node can flexibly select the next-hop node during packet transmission based on actual conditions. When an unexpected mobility change of a specific node causes a communication link failure, we can restore the link by enabling the alternative nodes. The influence of various factors on packet reception rate and communication delay is studied through simulation experiments. By comparing with two existing routing protocols, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified.},

Different from other traditional approaches that adopt only reactive inputs (i.e., surrounding traffic data), GraphPro also accepts proactive inputs (i.e., traffic signal timing). This allows GraphPro to predict link speed more accurately, depending on whether or not there is a contextual change in traffic signal timing. A Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) structure, including a generator (prediction model) and a discriminator, is employed to incorporate unprecedented network traffic states and ensures a high level of generalizability for the prediction model. A hybrid graph block, comprised of a reactive cell and a proactive cell, is implemented into each neural layer of the generator. In order to jointly capture spatio-temporal influences and signal contextual information on traffic links, the two cells adopt several key neural network-based components, including graph convolutional network, recurrent neural architecture, and self-attention mechanism. The double-cell structure ensures GraphPro learns from proactive input only when required. The effectiveness and efficiency of GraphPro are tested on a short-term link speed prediction task using real-world traffic data. Due to the capabilities of learning from real data distribution and generating unseen samples, GraphPro offers a more reliable and robust prediction when compared with state-of-the-art data-driven models.},

This paper investigates the problem of defining delivery plans with the aim to support logistic companies in reducing planning times and freight delivery costs. In delivery planning, given a set of delivery requests, both the routes and load configurations of Transport Units (TUs) are to be established. In the literature, this problem is defined as Three-dimensional Loading Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (3LCVRPTW). However, these problems are generally tackled separately and referred to as the vehicle routing problem and the container loading problem, respectively. Moreover, only a few contributions present solution approaches for real logistic systems, and these methods are mainly based on heuristics. In this work, we define a novel matheuristic algorithm for the integrated solution of the vehicle routing problem and container loading problem. The proposed method is suitable for real logistic applications and combines the advantages of exact solutions with the rapidity of heuristics. The approach aims at minimizing the total travel costs and the clients’ time windows violations in the routes’ definition, while optimizing the configuration of the cargo inside each TU. The developed matheuristic algorithm is tested both on a well-known literature benchmark and on a real dataset provided by the Italian company Elettric80. The obtained results show that the proposed method succeeds in determining in a short computational time both feasible routes and loading plans, minimizing the related costs while fulfilling logistics constraints.},

In this study, we leveraged a novel virtual reality (VR) experimental platform to evaluate SI-DCS neurohaptic feedback during naturalistic object interaction. Two human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for seizure localization were asked to discriminate between visually identical virtual objects based on their distinct SI-DCS neurohaptic profiles. In a binary discrimination task, neurohaptic feedback was either present or absent while grasping a virtual object. In the ternary discrimination task, neurohaptic feedback was either present in one of two distinct neurohaptic sequences or absent. Both subjects performed significantly above chance in binary and ternary discrimination, demonstrating the efficacy of S1-DCS as neurohaptic feedback. Successful ternary discrimination also demonstrated that different sequences of amplitude-modulated SI-DCS at a single pair of electrodes can evoke discriminable neurohaptic percepts. Moreover, amplitude-modulated SI-DCS sequences were shown to elicit sensorimimetic percepts described as “bumpy” and “smooth” in Subject 1, and as a sensation of movement in the paralyzed hand of Subject 2. Our study demonstrates the reliability and discriminability of both simple and complex SI-DCS for neurohaptic feedback during immersive VR object interaction and supports the use of immersive VR for neurohaptic design towards the development of functional brain computer interface.},

We form a point cloud of microphone positions by the measurement and then register them into Gaussian model in the global coordinate system common across all arrays. We apply likelihood maximization approach to estimate the positions and postures of all arrays that minimizes the discrepancy of global microphone positions retrieved from local observations. We conducted numerical experiments to find that the calibration with no error was achieved with no measurement errors in microphone position, whereas mean estimation errors of less than a quarter of the wavelength in position and one degree in posture were observed when assuming a possible magnitude of measurement errors estimated in previous works.},

In this method, suitable locations for scanning the occluded areas with a mirror are detected and connected using multiple paths that are verified as safe to fly.The developed method was evaluated in the simulation environment. The results suggested that the developed method could obtain more points and photograph more occluded areas than the method of repeating random movements and the method to locally search for the optimal direction.},

  abstract  = {Tactile sensation is essential for recognizing mechanical interactions between the human body and its environment; it is generally uniquely experienced by individuals. Haptic sharing technologies enable to share of other person’s (or robot’s) tactile sensations, and it is expected to apply for skill learning, collaborative work, and robot operation. While wearable tactile sensors are useful for tactile measurements, they are affected by differences in physical characteristics between individuals. Therefore, to accurately convey the tactile information felt by others and utilize it for work, it is necessary to remove individual differences due to differences in individual physical characteristics. In this study, based on the frequency based intensity of skin vibration of an individual, the vibration detected by the acceleration sensor affixed to the fingertip was modulated to remove individual differences. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we investigated both physical and perceptual similarities for skin vibrations collected from three persons with three different fine textures. The results showed that vibrations individually modulated with the proposed method was similar in the intensity and power spectrum density than those using the uniform modulation function, and was perceived similar when presenting those with a vibrator.},

This work presents a wearable fingertip capable of providing touch, sliding and vibration feedback while the user interacts with virtual objects. This multimodal feedback is applied to the human fingertip using an array of servo motors, a coin vibration motor and 3D printed components. The wearable fingertip uses a 3D printed cylinder that moves up and down to provide touch feedback, and rotates in left and right directions to deliver sliding feedback. The direction of movement and speed of rotation of the cylinder are controlled by the exploration movements performed by the user hand and finger. Vibration feedback is generated using a coin vibration motor with the frequency controlled by the type of virtual material explored by the user. The Leap Motion module is employed to track the human hand and fingers to control the feedback delivered by the wearable device. This work is validated with experiments for exploration of virtual objects in Unity. The experiments show that this wearable haptic device offers an alternative platform with the potential of enhancing the feeling and experience of immersion in virtual reality environments, exploration of objects and telerobotics.},

Our network exploits the spatial connections between human keypoints and object keypoints to capture their fine-grained structural interactions via graph convolutions. It fuses such geometric features with visual features and spatial configuration features obtained from human-object pairs. Furthermore, to better preserve the object structural information and facilitate human-object interaction detection, we propose a novel skeleton-based object keypoints representation. The performance of SGCN4HOI is evaluated in the public benchmark V-COCO dataset.

Prior studies have exploited motion sensors to detect riding contexts and recognize related behaviors. Nevertheless, they fail to integrate a scheme to account for single-handed riding with elements crucial to danger prevention: awareness of the surroundings, response to danger, and convenient adoption. In this work, we proposed, designed, and implemented DoubleCheck: a smartphone-based real-time framework for cycling hand detection and distraction recognition. The method monitors handlebar holding on different road surfaces and recognizes hazardous distraction activities related to single-handed cycling using motion signals captured by a built-in inertial measurement unit in a handlebar-borne smartphone. It was designed on the premise that single-handed cycling enabled operators to adapt their body movements to different (often distracting) activities. We conducted an evaluation experiment using 22 participants on asphalt and pavement. The results indicate that DoubleCheck achieves an F1-score of 0.96 for hand detection and 0.69 for distraction recognition, demonstrating its efficacy as a candidate rider-safety precautionary measure.},

  abstract  = {Circuit breakers (CBs) play an important role in modern society because they make the power transmission and distribution systems reliable and resilient. Therefore, it is important to maintain their reliability and to monitor their operation. A key to ensure a reliable operation of CBs is to monitor their condition. In this work, we performed an accelerated life testing for mechanical failures of a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) by performing close-open operations continuously until failure. We recorded data for each operation and made the collected run-to-failure dataset publicly available. In our experiments, the VCB operated more than 26000 close-open operations without current load with the time span of five months. The run-to-failure long-term monitoring enables us to monitor the evolution of the VCB condition and the degradation over time. To monitor CB condition, closing time is one of the indicators, which is usually measured when the CB is taken out of operation and is completely disconnected from the network. We propose an algorithm that enables to infer the same information on the closing time from a non-intrusive sensor. By utilizing the short-time energy (STE) of the vibration signal, it is possible to identify the key moments when specific events happen including the time when the latch starts to move, and the closing time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the VCB dataset and is also compared to the binary segmentation (BS) change point detection algorithm. This research highlights the potential for continuous online condition monitoring, which is the basis for applying future predictive maintenance strategies.},

This paper proposes a new architecture of MES implemented in Python that is able to verify, interpret, and execute production plans automatically generated by an AI planner. Moreover, the proposed MES supports running in a distributed way in several instances, where each instance is able to interpret a location-specific part of a production plan. All MES instances are synchronized and the current global or partial (per each instance) production progress can be observed via HTTP/REST API.

Packet-wise no-wait transmission scheduling is devised to enable fine-grained scheduling for deterministic delays of the control system data. An integrated system model for the co-design architecture is constructed by integrating scheduling variables into the control system model, which enables simultaneous optimization of the control and transmission strategies for improving the feasible solution space and control performance. Co-design problem based on the integrated model is formulated as mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. A Tabu-search-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain near-optimal solutions efficiently for the co-design problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves control performance compared with best-effort transmission without co-design.},

This work proposes an improved hybrid prediction model named LBPSC for Chinese named entity recognition for the water environment data, which combines Lattice structure, Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), Positional feature encoding, Sentence self-attention and conditional random field (CRF). LBPSC employs a three-phase end-to-end methodology for Chinese named entity recognition. It first adopts a BiLSTM with lattice structure to extract both character and word features from two directions, thereby avoiding word segmentation errors. It then innovatively combines a sentence self-attention mechanism with positional feature encoding to better handle sentences and add the position information to the trained features after BiLSTM. Then, a CRF layer is adopted to decode features and finally output the predicted tag of the data. Experimental results with real-life dataset demonstrate that LBPSC outperforms other deep learning algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Yet, misclassification is inevitable in any estimation methods. In this work, we propose a framework that allows for refining a semantic segmentation model on the fly during the robot’s operation. We introduce a few-shot segmentation based on weight imprinting for online model refinement without fine-tuning. Training data are collected via observation of a human’s interaction with the plant parts. We propose novel robust weight imprinting to mitigate the effect of noise included in the masks generated by the interaction. The proposed method was evaluated through experiments using real-world data and shown to outperform an ordinary weight imprinting and provide competitive results to fine-tuning with model distillation while requiring less computational cost.},

In addition to variations of facial expressions caused by identity, pose, and occlusion, gender also affects the face of human emotions. Even though males, females, and infants share the same facial expressions, their characteristics are vastly different. To capture the effect of gender on facial expressions, we propose a novel multi-task FER method with joint gender learning. First, in addition to the original emotion labels of face images, we annotate gender labels, including male, female, and infant. Second, we introduce a gender-aware multi-task convolutional neural network for FER, which can learn the emotion and gender features of faces. Compared with single-task expression recognition methods, our proposed framework for introducing gender feature learning can significantly achieve higher performance on FER in the wild. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of our framework on two public wild FER datasets, RAF-DB and FER2013. And the results show that the gender learning auxiliary task is beneficial to the improvement of the performance of FER.},

  abstract  = {Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable topic in smart video analysis. The recognition of fine-grained attributes is challenging work as they are indistinguishable in surveillance images. In this study, we propose an Attention Auxiliary Spatial Fusion (AASF) model to improve the performance of PAR from the following two aspects: (1) We employ an Embedded Attention (EA) module to encode position information into channel information so that it can aggregate features in two different spatial directions with the small-scale visual clues. (2) We propose a Feature Pyramid Adaptive Fusion (FPAF) module to adaptively select useful features for multiple attributes from different levels with contradictory information. Extensive experiments conducted on two large public indoor and outdoor PAR datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results, especially obtaining better performances on fine-grained attributes.},

The significant applications of HAR in ambient assisted living environments include monitoring the daily activities of elderly and cognitively impaired individuals to assist them by observing their health status. In this research, we present a deep learning-based fusion approach for multimodal HAR that fuses the different modalities of data to obtain robust outcomes. Here, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) retrieve the high-level attributes from the image data, and the Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) is utilized to capture significant patterns from the multi-sensory data. Finally, the extracted features from the modalities are fused through self-attention mechanisms that enhance the relevant activity data and inhibit the superfluous and possibly confusing information by measuring their compatibility. Lastly, extensive tests have been performed to measure the efficiency and robustness of the developed fusion approach using the UP-Fall detection dataset. It is evident from the experimental findings that the proposed fusion technique outperforms the existing state-of-the-art and achieves relatively better performance.},

  abstract  = {The early identification of the patients’ hospitalization at triage level within the Emergency Department (ED) presents a potential solution to reduce the risk of overcrowding and improve the quality of care. Thus, predicting patient out-come on arrival assists medical staff in the make of the appropriate patient pathway decision and so reduces the risk of medical error and complication of the patient’s condition. Previous works don’t consider the uncertainty of medical data while the management of this uncertainty is one of the most important and crucial tasks of medical information systems. Thus, we present in this paper an improved version of the classical prediction model by taking into account the uncertainty and by managing properly the missing information. In this context, we propose a new approach based on Dempster-Shafer theory and Dynamic Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithm. Our proposed approach deploys the correspondent neural network as follows: 1) computes for each input parameter the Basic Belief Assignment (BBA) that provides an assessment of the uncertainty pattern using the Dempster’s rule; 2) deduces the correspondent weights based on the computed BBA, and 3) uses an appropriate transfer function to activate the next layer neurons. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by using a real ED database. We prove that our proposed approach manages efficiently the uncertainty of the medical data sources and missing information, so improves the decision making and reduces errors and complexity.},

  abstract  = {Predicting human trajectory is one of the key knowledge required for autonomous driving and social robots in real scenarios. Recent studies based on Transformer networks have shown a great ability to model social behaviors. As far as we know, global trajectory information has an essential influence on prediction at a certain step. However, these methods only rely on the previous trajectory states/attention but ignore the important following states/attention of the trajectory for each pedestrian, which will generally collapse on some irregular movements (e.g. acceleration, deceleration, and motionless). To solve this issue, we propose a Global Temporal Attention optimization model (GTAO), which activates the utilization of the following states/attention of the trajectory, and jointly and iteratively optimizes the preliminary trajectory prediction through a global temporal attention (GTA) module. To effectively address the decline in the generalizability and abnormal processing of the model, we further introduce global temporal guidance (GTG) module to instruct the GTA to learn the features closer to realistic trajectories. Experimental results on commonly used real-world human trajectory prediction datasets (ETH and UCY) indicate that our GTAO can achieve better performance in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Typical machine learning methods extract nonlinear characteristics, but they suffer from overfitting problems due to data noise. Most current deep learning models have problems of gradient disappearance and explosion, and often fail to capture long-term dependence. To solve above-mentioned problems, this work proposes a multi-indicator time series prediction method named SG-Informer for river water quality prediction. SG-Informer integrates the Savitsky-Golay filter, the ProbSparse self-attention mechanism of an encoder, and a generative style decoder, serving as data smoothing and noise elimination, network scale reduction, and prediction speed improvement, respectively. SG-Informer establishes a high-quality water quality time prediction model, which effectively predicts the future water quality time series trend. Based on real-life data sets of water quality, multi-indicator and single-indicator prediction experiments are performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SG-Informer outperforms several state-of-the-art prediction methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning applications related to high-stakes decisions are often surrounded by significant amounts of controversy. This has led to increasing interest in interpretable machine learning models. A well-known class of interpretable models is that of decision trees (DTs), which mirror a common strategy used by humans to arrive at solutions through a series of well-defined decisions. However, much of previous research on DTs for criminal justice predictions has focused primarily on collections (ensembles) of DTs whose results are aggregated together. Such DT ensembles are used to help improve accuracy; however, their increased complexity and deviation from human decision-making processes makes them much less interpretable compared to single-DT approaches. In this paper, we present a new DT model for criminal recidivism prediction that is designed with high interpretability, accuracy, and fairness as core objectives. The interpretability of the model stems from its formulation in terms of a single DT structure, while accuracy is achieved through an intensive optimization process of DT parameters that is carried out using a novel evolutionary algorithm. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the performance of our proposed EADTC (Evolutionary Algorithm Decision Tree for Crime prediction) method on relevant datasets. Our experiments show that the EADTC approach achieves competitive accuracy and fairness with respect to state-of-the-art ensemble DT models, while achieving higher interpretability due to the simpler, single-DT structure.},

  abstract  = {Crime occurrence prediction is an important task for public security and urban governance. In real world, some crimes are quite harmful, thus it’s necessary to predict these crimes in the next few days (weeks). However, these harmful crime events may have relatively lower frequency, and their records are discontinuous and sporadic, making the multistep occurrence prediction difficult. Due to the sparsity and irregularity of the crime sequences, most of the existing crime prediction techniques do not distinguish crime types and have difficulties to predict low-frequency crimes’ occurrences. In addition, they cannot accurately predict the occurrence of crimes over multiple recent time slots due to sporadic crime records. In this paper, we propose Multi-Time-Slot Crime Occurrence Prediction (MCOP) model, which aims to (1) predict crime types separately and (2) predict crime occurrences in the next multiple time slots. Specifically, MCOP uses a GRU-ODE-Bayes model to handle the discontinuous and sporadic crime events sequences. MCOP is enhanced by a data augmentation to address the data sparsity problem, and exploits the near repeat phenomenon to enable continuous crime predictions. We evaluated our model using real-world urban data, and the results showed our model outperforms the baseline techniques.},

We formulate an AGV-UAV communication multi-objective optimization problem (AUCMOP) to simultaneously maximize the total transmission rate, minimize the total repositioning time of AGVs and minimize the total motion energy consumptions of AGVs by optimizing the positions, excitation current weights and moving speeds of AGVs, as well as the sequence for communicating with different UAVs.

Precise and timely detection, identification, and location estimation of line-to-ground, line-to-line, line-to-line-to-ground, and line-to-line-to-line faults can considerably enhance the speed of a recovery process of transmission lines and hence reduce the costs associated with the downtime of a power system. Consequently, having a robust, affordable, and accurate fault diagnosis system is crucial to perform these tasks within an acceptable time window after a fault occurs in the presence of system uncertainties. Mistakenly detected or undetected faults can be expensive in the conventional techniques and this fact has motivated us to present a robust detection, identification, and location estimation system by using a machine learning method called generalized regression neural networks. The robustness of this technique is tested with respect to the variations of fault resistance, phase difference between two connected buses, fault inception angle, local bus voltage fluctuations, source inductance fluctuations, and measurement noise. Besides, the effect of noise on the GRNN method is revealed in this paper. Its comparison with the existing state-of-the-art methods shows its outstanding performance in the accurate fault classification and location estimation for transmission lines.},

  abstract  = {Vehicle detection is a challenging task in computer vision. Since the differences among different vehicle shapes are small and not easy to recognize, the common object detection models usually do not work well for vehicle recognition. To select positive samples, the existing anchor-based detection methods usually use high-quality anchor boxes which are very close to the shapes of the vehicles. Such methods often make the prediction strongly dependent on high-quality anchor boxes. At present, the ATSS (Adaptive Training Sample Selection) method has also been used to select high-quality anchor boxes. The main purpose of this method is to automatically set the shapes of the anchor boxes according to the training datasets. However, for vehicle detection, the shapes of the vehicles are usually similar while the scales of the vehicles are quite different, which may influence the performance of the ATSS based vehicle detection. To solve the above problems, we propose a vehicle detection model PSLTNet (Positives Selection with Low Threshold Network). To reduce the prediction instability due to relying on high-quality anchor boxes, PSLTNet applies the positive samples selection with low threshold to enhance the prediction ability for different quality anchor boxes. To improve the identification ability of different vehicle types, PSLTNet adopts a pyramid structure and cascades dilated convolutions at each level. In addition, in order to make the bounding box regression loss be independent of scales, PSLTNet uses GIOU (Generalized Intersection Over Union) to supervise the position regression task of candidate bounding boxes. Finally, to reduce the loss of a large number of simple negatives, PSLTNet uses Focal Loss to supervise the classification task of the background candidate bounding boxes. The Experimental results upon the BIT-Vehicle dataset show that the proposed method can obtain better performance than that of the existing methods.},

Motivated by this fact, the authors have clarified the best combination of binary classifiers that makes ECOC, assuming a situation in which each binary classifier can estimate the true posterior probability. They also have proposed a total framework for analytical evaluation when a binary classifier outputs an estimated posterior probability that approximates the true posterior probability. These studies established a framework for evaluating the theoretical performance of ECOC.Based on these findings, this study discusses the theoretical performance of ECOC from the upper bound perspective. The results showed that increasing the Hamming distance between code words can blackuce the error rate. We then evaluate various combinations of binary classifiers based on analytical evaluation.},

The optimization problem considers both the vehicle’s actuation limits and the lateral and longitudinal forces acting on the car modeled through the Pacejka’s magic formula and a simple drivetrain model. Furthermore, the approach allows to safely race on a track populated by static obstacles generating collision-free trajectories and tracking them while enhancing the lap timing performance.

  abstract  = {This paper exploits the use of Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology to improve the localization of robots in both indoor and outdoor environments. In order to efficiently integrate the UWB technology in existing multi-sensor architectures, such as Kalman-based, we propose two approaches to estimate the UWB position covariance values. The first approach uses statistical methods to estimate static covariance values based on data acquired a priori. The second approach adopts a neural network (NN) to capture the relationship between the positional error of the UWB data and the signal quality information, such as the Estimate Of Precision (EOP) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The GPS-RTK is used as ground truth and RGB-D odometry is adopted for both bench-marking and integration purposes. Position sources are fused by means of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Real world experiments are conducted with a tracked mobile robot driving outdoors in a closed-loop trajectory. Results show that the NN is able to efficiently model the sensor covariances and adapt the trustworthiness of the EKF estimation, overcoming data loss by relying on the other available estimation source.},

  abstract  = {A Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA) is an algorithm that transforms the movement of a simulated vehicle into movement that can be reproduced with a Motion Simulator (MS) while respecting its physical constraints. Crucially, MCAs aim to provide a realistic driving experience to simulator users. Adaptive MCAs are a type of MCA that is flexible, computationally light and designed to adjust behaviour based on the current MS state. However, adaptive MCAs require extensive manual tuning which is difficult, time consuming and a sub-optimal process. This paper presents an optimisation-based method using Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) for automatically tuning the free parameters of the Adaptive Gradient Descent-based MCA (AGDA) while accounting for MS physical constraints and motion fidelity. The cost function of the tuning routine considers the RMSE, correlation coefficient (CC) and error oscillation of the motion sensation signals of the MS driver with respect to those of the simulated vehicle driver. The displacement, velocity and acceleration of the MS are also considered. The proposed method was implemented using MATLAB and Simulink and the effectiveness of the approach was tested with a Rigs of Rods simulation of a ground vehicle. Compared to the existing manually tuned AGDA, the optimally tuned AGDA obtained with the proposed method performs 32.6\% and 23.7\% better in terms of RMSE and CC of the motion sensation signals, respectively. The observed performance improvement and moderate computational load of the AGDA renew its relevance in the context of modern MCAs.},

A type of continuous optimization problem that has switching structured constraints is called mathematical programs with switching constraints (MPSC). Relaxation methods are well known gradient descent-based approaches for solving MPSC. However, with the use of these conventional algorithms, we reveal that the sequence of solutions easily converges to an infeasible stationary point due to a special class of switching constraint whose feasible set is geometrically separated into mutually exclusive sets in variable space. We define this kind of switching constraint as the disjunctive allowable set constraint (DAS-constraint). To force the sequence of solutions to escape from such infeasible stationary points, we construct a new algorithm that introduces random sampling if convergence to an infeasible point is detected. Furthermore, to reduce the computation cost due to random sampling, we randomize only specific variables that are relevant to DAS-constraints. Numerical experiments show that feasible solutions can be found by using our proposed algorithm, even for large-scale optimization problems where no solutions are found within a practical time limit when using a conventional algorithm.},

This paper restricts attention to a specific type of goal, namely reaching a desired state within a certain time bound. For such goals, a robot system’s competency and resilience can be defined as the probability of reaching the desired state as a function of the time bound under a nominal unperturbed condition and under known perturbation conditions, respectively. Two metrics taken from prior work for measuring competency and resilience, power and efficiency, are modified so that they do not require subjective parameters. This paper formalizes the adapted metrics for discrete time Markov chains. The adapted metrics are applied to a best-of-N case study that is solved by a graph-based approach and modeled as a discrete time Markov chain. The case study demonstrates that the modified metrics allow power-efficiency trade-offs to be more easily visualized than the cluttered visualizations produced by the original metrics.},

The fingers are actuated through a compact, series-elastic differential mechanism that reduces the total number of required actuators to only two.

  abstract  = {Assistive navigation for blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals is of significance to extend their mobility and safety in traveling, enhancing their employment opportunities and fostering personal fulfillment. Conventional research is mainly based on robotic navigation approaches through localization, mapping, and path planning frameworks. They require heavy manual annotation of semantic information in maps and its alignment with sensor mapping. Inspired by the fact that we human beings naturally rely on language instruction inquiry and visual scene understanding to navigate in an unfamiliar environment, this paper proposes a novel vision-language model-based approach for BVI navigation. It does not need heavy-labeled indoor maps and provides a Safe and Efficient E-Wayfinding (SeeWay) assistive solution for BVI individuals. The system consists of a scene-graph map construction module, a navigation path generation module for global path inference by vision-language navigation (VLN), and a navigation with obstacle avoidance module for real-time local navigation. The SeeWay system was deployed on portable iPhone devices with cloud computing assistance for the VLN model inference. The field tests show the effectiveness of the VLN global path finding and local path re-planning. Experiments and quantitative results reveal that heuristic-style instruction outperforms direction/detailed-style instructions for VLN success rate (SR), and the SR decreases as the navigation length increases.},

As such, it can be an accessible means of providing inputs for people with paralysis to manipulate their environment. This paper explores the potential for using the jaw, specifically the mandible, as an alternative input to human-machine interface systems. Two tests were developed to test the mandible’s ability to respond to visual stimuli. First, a visual response time test to measure the precision and accuracy of user input through a mandible-actuated button. Second, a choice response test to observe coordination between the mandible and a finger.Study results show that the mean response time of mandible inputs is 8.3\% slower than the corresponding mean response time of performing the same task with a thumb. The delay in response after making a decision is statistically insignificant between the mandible-and finger-actuated inputs with the mandible being 2.67\% slower.Based on these results, the increase in response time while using the mandibular input is minimal for new users. Coordination is feasible in tasks involving both the mandible and thumb. Extensive training with a made-to-fit device has the potential to enable a visual response time equivalent to the fingers in more complex tasks. The mandible is a viable option for accessible HMI for discreet inputs. Further testing into continuous input is needed to explore the mandible’s potential as an input for body augments.},

  abstract  = {Driving simulators are utilized for many applications including basic driver training, human factor studies, human-machine interaction, and vehicle prototyping in automobile industries. The main purpose of using driving simulator is to provide realistic driving experience. Since simulator platforms have physical limitations, Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs) are used to generate driving sensation for the simulator user while considering the simulator&#39;s physical and dynamical constraints. When using a model predictive control (MPC)-based MCA, the principle of MPC is leveraged to predict an optimized future behavior of the simulator where a series of control actions is developed across a defined future horizon using the explicitly specified process model. Corresponding to the pre-positioning or time-varying reference MPC, it is crucial to predict the future vehicle motion signals for the simulator accurately. The existing methods for predicting vehicle motion signals do not excel in predicting time-series of a long sequence due to the missing feedback loop or limited memory size. To address this issue, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is developed to predict motion signals using Python. The performance of LSTM is compared with those from different traditional methods using several measurements criteria, which include the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). The results indicate that LSTM outperforms RNN by producing more accurate motion allowing the MCA to deliver realistic motion sensations, the LSTM model can be employed in a wide range of applications including autonomous vehicles trajectory prediction, and other prediction problems.},

We add a dense conditional random fields to the ConvLSTM, which further extracts global spatial information and can predict SIC more accurately. The experimental results show that compared with ConvLSTM, our model has a great improvement in the overall prediction accuracy and has more accurate predictions in the SIC boundary region, especially in the melting and freezing seasons when the SIC changes drastically. Our model also shows better prediction performance when making iterative predictions.

To tackle this problem, instead of traditional heuristics-based algorithms, more adaptive detection systems such as natural language processing (NLP)powered approaches are essential to understanding phishing text representations. Nevertheless, concerns surrounding the collection of phishing data that might cover confidential information hinder the effectiveness of model learning. We propose a decentralized phishing email detection framework called Federated Phish Bowl (FedPB) which facilitates collaborative phishing detection with privacy. In particular, we devise a knowledge-sharing mechanism with federated learning (FL). Using long short-term memory (LSTM) for phishing detection, the framework adapts by sharing a global word embedding matrix across the clients, with each client running its local model with Non-IID data. We collected the most recent phishing samples to study the effectiveness of the proposed method using different client numbers and data distributions. The results show that FedPB can attain a competitive performance with a centralized phishing detector, with generality to various cases of FL retaining a prediction accuracy of 83\%.},

  abstract  = {Throughout the years, many attempts have been made at creating music procedurally. However, very few of those attempts were concerned with the actual “meaning” of the music that was generated. The goal of this research is to implement a pipelined model of neural networks capable of generating homophonic music without input. The generated music should be “meaningful”, that is to say, it should sound like it has a purpose. This is similar to how a human composer would write music. This idea of “meaning” makes a composition tell a story or express feelings. This is the reason humans write music, as well as create other forms of arts. As the goal of artificial creativity is to approach human creativity as close as possible, Artificial Intelligence should try to imitate humans as close as possible. Therefore, it is important for a music generating AI to understand “meaning” in music. In order to introduce meaning in AI composition, the process is approached step-by-step. Dedicated neural models trained on melodies that express purpose through the use of motifs are first used to generate a melody. That melody serves as input to another neural model, trained on chord progressions that contextualize the melodies they accompany, to generate harmony. Besides the model being symbolic, there are no musical constraints or guidelines for generation. By using this pipelined but unconstrained approach, it is possible to procedurally generate music that sounds as if composed by a human being.},

  abstract  = {Accurately identifying network intrusion cannot only help individuals and enterprises better deal with network security problems, but also maintain the Internet environment. Currently, classification methods with autoencoders for feature learning have been proved to be suitable for the network intrusion detection. This work proposes a new hybrid classification method named SABD for network intrusion detection. SABD integrates Stacked sparse contractive autoencoders, Attention-based Bidirectional long-term and short-term memory (LSTM), and Decision fusion. SABD integrates the feature extraction of stacked sparse contractive autoencoders with the classification ability of attention-based bidirectional LSTM. Specifically, stacked sparse contractive autoencoders are used for extracting features, which are sent to the attention-based bidirectional LSTM for the classification. Finally, the decision fusion algorithm is adopted to integrate classification results of multiple classifiers and yield the final results. Experimental results based on real-life UNSW-NB15 data demonstrate that the proposed SABD outperforms its state-of-the-art peers in terms of classification accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Continual learning requires the ability to reliably transfer previously learned knowledge to new tasks without disrupting established competencies. Methods such as Progressive Neural Network [1] accomplish high-quality transfer learning while nullifying the insidious problem of catastrophic forgetting. However, most module-based continual learning systems require task labels during operation – a constraint that limits their application in many real-world conditions where task indicators are opaque. This paper proposes a task detector neural algorithm to acquire task information while maintaining immunity to forgetting. Our proposed task detector allows progressive neural networks (and many similar systems) to operate without task labels during test time. Our task detector is built from familiarity autoencoders which recognize the nature of the required task from input data. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach through experiments in video game playing and automated image repair. Our results show near-perfect task recognition in all domains (&gt;.99 F1), rewards above published single-task scores in MinAtar, and realistic image repairs on damaged human face pictures. The performance of our integrated method is nearly identical to the progressive systems equipped with ground-truth task labels 1},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a ranking weight based roulette wheel selection (RWRWS) method for a promising particle swarm optimizer, called comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (CLPSO), to further improve its optimization performance. Specifically, the proposed RWRWS adopts a non-linear weight function to enhance the selection probabilities of promising personal best positions during the exemplar construction. In this way, it is expected that the construction efficiency of generating a promising leading exemplar for each particle could be improved and thus the optimization performance of CLPSO is expectedly elevated. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of RWRWS, we carry out extensive experiments on a widely acknowledged benchmark problem set by comparing it with other three selection methods, namely the fitness-based roulette wheel selection (FRWS), the ranking based roulette wheel selection (RRWS), and the tournament selection (TS). Experimental results demonstrate that RWRWS helps CLPSO attain the best overall performance among the four selection methods.},
