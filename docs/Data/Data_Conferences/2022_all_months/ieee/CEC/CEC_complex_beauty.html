  abstract  = {NeuroEvolution automates the generation of Artificial Neural Networks through the application of techniques from Evolutionary Computation. The main goal of these approaches is to build models that maximize predictive performance, some-times with an additional objective of minimizing computational complexity. Although the evolved models achieve competitive results performance-wise, their robustness to adversarial examples, which becomes a concern in security-critical scenarios, has received limited attention. In this paper, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of models found by two prominent Neu-roEvolution approaches on the CIFAR-10 image classification task: DENSER and NSGA-Net. Since the models are publicly available, we consider white-box untargeted attacks, where the perturbations are bounded by either the $L_{2}$ or the $L_{\infty}$ -norm. Similarly to manually-designed networks, our results show that when the evolved models are attacked with iterative methods, their accuracy usually drops to, or close to, zero under both distance metrics. The DENSER model is an exception to this trend, showing some resistance under the $L_{2}$ threat model, where its accuracy only drops from 93.70\% to 18.10\% even with iterative attacks. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of pre-processing applied to the data before the first layer of the network. Our observations suggest that some of these techniques can exacerbate the perturbations added to the original inputs, potentially harming robustness. Thus, this choice should not be neglected when automatically designing networks for applications where adversarial attacks are prone to occur.},

In this problem, the objective is to create a consensus ranking given a set of input rankings. This paper considers a variant of this problem, in which the set of input rankings may contain ties and may be incomplete. An Adaptive Biased Random-key Genetic Algorithm (A-BRKGA) is proposed to solve this problem, and the results are compared to an integer linear programming model previously introduced in the literature. Since the fitness evaluation of the A-BRKGA is its most time-consuming component, a partial fitness evaluation was derived and used in the local search component created for this problem. The partial evaluation reduces the time complexity from quadratic to linear. In the experiments, the efficiency of the A-BRKGA with the local search was evaluated against the A-BRKGA without the local search component and the integer linear programming introduced in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed technique achieved superior results in terms of quality when compared to the A-BRKGA without the local search component, achieved similar results in terms of quality and better results in terms of computational time when compared to the integer linear programming model.},

This removes the need for creating a simulator before commencing controller evolution and results in a simulator that is not only tailored specifically to the robot being used, but also to the task that the robot is expected to perform. This paper demonstrates that Bootstrapped Neuro-Simulation can also be used for damage recovery since the Neural Network Simulator adapts to physical changes to the robot and enables the evolution of controllers that utilize the undamaged components of the robot. Limbs of a hexapod robot are disabled to simulate damage in the experiments described in this paper. Various adaptations to the Bootstrapped Neuro-Simulation algorithm are investigated in simulation. A real-world robot is used to demonstrate the successful recovery from damage and to illustrate situations where the adaptations were found to be beneficial.},

An emerging branch of evolutionary computation proposed in recent year is the evolutionary multitasking, which is to manipulate evolutionary algorithms for tackling multitask optimization problems. Recent studies of evolutionary multitasking have drawn much attention on designing effective knowledge transfer mechanisms. This study proposes a novel evolutionary multi-tasking method named summit-assisted evolutionary multitasking (SaEMT) by integrating summit-based knowledge transfer into the general multi-population evolutionary multitasking method. There are two main features in the proposed method, including the summit-based recombination, and the dynamic control of transfer rate. Empirical results show that the proposed method can outperform classical and advanced evolutionary multitasking methods in terms of solution quality and convergence speed. Experimental results also discover that the SaEMT is able to complete in acceptable running time.},

The proposed method, CR-FM-NES, extends a recently proposed state-of-the-art NES, Fast Moving Natural Evolution Strategy (FM-NES), in order to be applicable in high-dimensional problems. CR-FM-NES builds on an idea using a restricted representation of a covariance matrix instead of using a full covariance matrix, while inheriting an efficiency of FM-NES. The restricted representation of the covariance matrix enables CR-FM-NES to update parameters of a multivariate normal distribution in linear time and space complexity, which can be applied to high-dimensional problems. Our experimental results reveal that CR-FM-NES does not lose the efficiency of FM-NES, and on the contrary, CR-FM-NES has achieved significant speedup compared to FM-NES on some benchmark problems. Furthermore, our numerical experiments using 200, 600, and 1000-dimensional benchmark problems demonstrate that CR-FM-NES is effective over scalable baseline methods, VD-CMA and Sep-CMA.},

The problem has five constraints: power consumption, temperature, humidity, $\mathbf{CO}_{2}$ concentration, and average illuminance. To solve the problem, we utilize IBEA framework. For efficient solution generation, we employ the steady-state model for IBEA. We propose the total constraint win-loss rank for multiple constraints to treat multiple constraints equally.

  abstract  = {A swarm of robots can collectively select an option among the available alternatives offered by the environment through a process known as collective decision-making. This process is characterised by the fact that once a decision is made by the group, it can not be attributed to any of its group members. In the large majority of the swarm robotics literature, only a few types of mechanisms have been used to allow the robots of a swarm to make collective decisions. Namely, the mechanisms referred to as the Voter and the Majority model or variations of these two models. Recently, an alternative solution has been proposed which is based on the use of dynamical neural networks as individual decision-making mechanisms. This alternative solution proved effective in a perceptual discrimination task. In this paper, we carry out extensive comparative tests that quantitatively evaluate, on a perceptual discrimination task, the Voter model and the dynamic neural network model on a variety of operating conditions and for swarms that differ in their size. The results of our study clearly indicate that the performances of a swarm employing dynamical neural networks as the decision-making mechanism are more robust, more adaptable to a dynamic environment, and more scalable to a larger swarm size than the performances of a swarm employing the Voter model as the decision-making mechanism. We account for these performance differences with an analysis of the two models.},

Our hybrid approach, CEM-SAC, exhibits both the stability of CEM and the efficiency of SAC in training policy neural networks of reinforcement learning agents for solving control problems. Experimental result comparisons with the three baselines CEM, SAC, and CEM-TD3, a recently-introduced ERL method that combines CEM and the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, on a wide range of control tasks in the MuJoCo benchmarks confirm the enhanced performance of our proposed CEM-SAC.

  abstract  = {Efficiently managing large deposits and warehouses is not an easy task. The amount of variables and processes involved from the moment a consumer purchases a single product until its receipt is quite considerable. There are two major problems involving warehouses processes: the order picking problem (OPP) and the order batching problem (OBP). The OPP aims to minimize the distance traveled by a picker while collecting a set of products (orders). The OBP seeks to assign orders to batches with a capacity limit in order to minimize the sum of distances traveled during the retrieving of products from all batches. When these two problems are approached together, they become the Joint Order Batching and Picking Routing Problem (JOBPRP). This work proposes a novel formulation for JOBPRP and develops a grouping genetic algorithm with controlled gene transmission. To assess our proposals, we executed computational experiments over literature datasets. The mathematical model was used within a mixed-integer programming solver (Gurobi) and tested on the smaller instances to evaluate the quality of the solutions of our metaheuristic approach. Our computational results evidence high stability for all tested instances and much lower objective value than the previously reported in the literature, while maintaining a reasonable computational time.},

  abstract  = {The performance of feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) is directly dependant on the training algorithm. Conventional training algorithms such as gradient-based approaches are so popular for FFNN training, but they are susceptible to get stuck in local optimum. To overcome this, population-based metaheuristic algorithms such as differential evolution (DE) are a reliable alternative. In this paper, we propose a novel training algorithm, Reg-IDE, based on an improved DE algorithm. Weight regularisation in conventional algorithms is an approach to reduce the likelihood of over-fitting and enhance generalisation. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current DE-based trainers do not employ regularisation. This paper, first, proposes a regularisation-based objective function to improve the generalisation of the algorithm by adding a new term to the objective function. Then, a region-based strategy determines some regions in search space using a clustering algorithm and updates the population based on the information available in each region. In addition, quasi opposition-based learning enhances the exploration of the algorithm. The best candidate solution found by improved DE is then used as the initial network weights for the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, as a local refinement. Experimental results on different benchmarks and in comparison with 26 conventional and population-based approaches apparently demonstrate the excellent performance of Reg-IDE.},

The proposed methodology combines a multi-dimensional time series forecast and a novel approach to large-scale optimization. Gradient-boosting method is applied to forecast both generation and consumption time-series of the Monash university campus for the month of November 2020. For the consumption forecasts we employ log transformation to model trend and stabilize variance. Additional seasonality and trend features are added to the model inputs when applicable. The forecasts obtained are used as the base load for the schedule optimisation of university activities and battery usage. The goal of the optimisation is to minimize the electricity cost consisting of the price of electricity and the peak electricity tariff both altered by the load from class activities and battery use as well as the penalty of not scheduling some optional activities. The schedule of the class activities is obtained through evolutionary optimisation using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and the genetic algorithm. This schedule is then improved through local search by testing possible times for each activity one-by-one. The battery schedule is formulated as a mixed-integer programming problem and solved by the Gurobi solver. This method obtains the second lowest cost when evaluated against 6 other methods presented at an IEEE competition that all used mixed-integer programming and the Gurobi solver to schedule both the activities and the battery use.

  abstract  = {One possible approach to deflect the trajectory of an asteroid on a collision course with the Earth, and prevent a potentially devastating impact, is the use of a kinetic impactor. The upcoming NASA DART and ESA Hera space missions will be the first to study and demonstrate this technique, by driving a spacecraft into the moon of a binary asteroid system with the aim of altering its momentum, and knocking it off course. In this work, we seek to predict critical parameters associated with such an impact, namely the momentum transfer efficiency and axial ratio of the target body, based on light curve data observed from ground before and after the impact in order to give insights into the real effect of the deflection effort. We present here our approach to this problem, which we address from a purely data-driven perspective based on simulated data provided as a part of the Andrea Milani Planetary Defence Challenge, organised by the EU H2020 Stardust-R research network in conjunction with ESA. Formulating the problem as a time series regression task, we develop an end-to-end deep learning pipeline in which we apply the latest advances in deep learning for time series, such as the use of the Transformer architecture as well as ensembling and self-supervised learning techniques. Exploiting these techniques for the challenge, we achieved second place out of the student teams, and fifth place overall without relying on any a priori knowledge of the physics of the asteroid system.},

  abstract  = {Metaheuristics are known to be effective for solving a broad category of optimization problems. However, most heuristics require different parameter settings appropriately for a problem class or even for a specific problem. Researchers address this commonly by performing a parameter tuning study (also known as hyper-parameter optimization) or developing a parameter control mechanism that changes parameters dynamically. Whereas parameter tuning is computationally expensive and limits the parameter configuration to stay constant throughout the run, parameter control is also a challenging task because all dynamics induced by various operators must be learned to make an appropriate adaptation of parameters on the fly. This paper investigates parameter tuning and control for a well-known optimization method - differential evolution (DE). In contrast to most existing DE practices, an additional individualistic evolutionary operator called polynomial mutation is incorporated into the offspring creation. Results on test problems with up to 50 variables indicate that mutation can be helpful for multi-modal problems to escape from local optima. On the one hand, the effectiveness of parameter tuning for a specific problem becomes apparent; on the other hand, its generalization capabilities seem to be limited. Moreover, a generic coevolutionary approach for parameter control outperforms a random choice of parameters. Recognizing the importance of choosing a suitable parameter configuration to solve any optimization problem, we have incorporated a standard implementation of both tuning and control approaches into a single framework, providing a direction for the evolutionary computation and optimization researchers to use and further investigate the effects of parameters on DE and other metaheuristics-based algorithms.},

Six memetic strategies are presented and tested over five population-based algorithms endowed with niching techniques. Experimental results clearly show that local search enhances the performance of the framework for multimodal optimisation in terms of both peak ratio and success rate. The most promising results are obtained by the variants that employ an archive that pre-selects the solutions undergoing local search thus avoiding computational waste.

  abstract  = {Landscape-aware algorithm selection approaches have so far mostly been relying on landscape feature extraction as a preprocessing step, independent of the execution of optimization algorithms in the portfolio. This introduces a significant overhead in computational cost for many practical applications, as features are extracted and computed via sampling and evaluating the problem instance at hand, similarly to what the optimization algorithm would perform anyway within its search trajectory. As suggested in [Jankovic et al., EvoAPP 2021], trajectory-based algorithm selection circumvents the problem of costly feature extraction by computing landscape features from points that a solver sampled and evaluated during the optimization process. Features computed in this manner are used to train algorithm performance regression models, upon which a per-run algorithm selector is then built. In this work, we apply the trajectory-based approach onto a portfolio of five algorithms. We study the quality and accuracy of performance regression and algorithm selection models in the scenario of predicting different algorithm performances after a fixed budget of function evaluations. We rely on landscape features of the problem instance computed using one portion of the aforementioned budget of the same function evaluations. Moreover, we consider the possibility of switching between the solvers once, which requires them to be warm-started, i.e. when we switch, the second solver continues the optimization process already being initialized appropriately by making use of the information collected by the first solver. In this new context, we show promising performance of the trajectory-based per-run algorithm selection with warm-starting.},

  abstract  = {The interest in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for civilian applications has seen a drastic increase in the past few years. Indeed, UAVs feature unique properties such as three-dimensional mobility and payload flexibility which provide unprecedented advantages when conducting missions like infrastructure inspection or search and rescue. However their current usage is mainly limited to a single operated or autonomous device which brings several limitations like its range of action and resilience. Using several UAVs as a swarm is one promising approach to address those limitations. However, manually designing globally efficient swarming approaches that solely rely on distributed behaviours is a complex task. The goal of this work is thus to automate the design of UAV swarming behaviours to tackle an area coverage problem. The first contribution of this work consists in modelling this problem as a multi-objective optimisation problem. The second contribution is a hyper-heuristic based on multi-objective reinforcement learning for generating distributed heuristics for that problem. Experimental results demonstrate the good stability of the generated heuristic on instances with different sizes and its capacity to well balance the multiple objectives of the optimisation problem.},

Results on multi-objective landscape problems showed that most Pareto optimal solutions were reachable from the single-objective local optimal solutions. This tendency was emphasized by increasing the number of objectives and the objective correlation.

  abstract  = {When performing feature selection on most data sets, there is a general situation that some different feature subsets have the same number of selected features and classification error rate. This indicates that feature selection in some data sets is a multimodal multiobjective optimization (MMO) problem. Most of the current studies on feature selection ignore the MMO problems. Therefore, this paper proposes a feature selection method based on a multimodal multiobjective genetic algorithm (MMOGA) to solve the problem. This algorithm is mainly improved in three aspects. First, a special initialization strategy based on symmetric uncertainty is designed to improve the fitness of the initial population. Second, this paper adds a niche strategy to the genetic algorithm to search for multimodal solutions. Unlike traditional niche methods that has a central individual, this algorithm also considers the distances between individuals in the niche. Third, to effectively utilize excellent individuals for evolution, this algorithm uses a method based on the Pareto set of the niche to generate offspring. Finally, by comparing with other algorithms, the effectiveness of the MMOGA in feature selection is verified. This algorithm can successfully find equivalent feature subsets on different datasets.},

Although a large number of hypervolume approximation methods have been proposed at present, most of them still have shortcomings in the trade-off between approximation accuracy and running time. To solve this problem, we propose an hypervolume approximation method based on angular points. The main idea is to find all the angular points of hypervolume region, and calculate the mean distance between the reference point and each angular point as the hypervolume approximation value. In the experimental part, six different spatial surfaces are used to test the accuracy of the algorithm, and four different dimensions are set for each type of surface. At the same time, two commonly used Hypervolume approximation methods were added for comparison. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in most cases.},

Those methods have been implemented as game-specific libraries, and they can only offer the same kind of analysis for all maps and all users. In this paper, we propose a way to consider terrain analysis as a combinatorial optimization problem. Our method allows different kinds of analysis by changing constraints or the objective function in the problem model.

This study is an attempt to improve our understanding of the automated design of hybrid metaheuristics by utilizing fitness landscape analysis to reveal the topological characteristics that can be exploited to design better automated approaches. We consider the sequential hybridization, including algorithm configuration and parameter tuning, of single-point and multi-point metaheuristics and three optimization problems which are the earth-observing satellite scheduling problem, the aircraft landing problem and the two-dimensional bin packing problem. Interestingly, the design space exhibits similar trends regardless of the underlining optimization problem. The design space is found to be rugged, multimodal, moderately searchable, has multiple funnels, and almost no plateau. Based on these findings, deeper insights are provided to guide the development of future automated approaches instead of blindly trying different options.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DF JSS) is a complex and challenging combinatorial optimisation problem. In DF JSS, job operations have to be processed on a set of machines, and thus machine assignment and operation sequencing decisions need to be made simultaneously in dynamic situations. Genetic programming (GP), as a hyper-heuristic approach, has been widely used to learn scheduling heuristics for DF JSS automati-cally. However, the traditional GP parent selection method based on fitness value only may not be sufficiently effective, since not all the subtrees of a GP individual are meaningful and can contribute to the goodness of the individual. This paper proposes a new GP algorithm with a novel fitness function by incorporating the subtree importance into the parent selection method. Specifically, the subtree importance is measured by the correlation coefficient between the behaviour of subtrees and the GP individual. The proposed algorithm is expected to improve the effectiveness of GP by capturing more useful subtrees for producing offspring to the next generation. This paper uses nine DF JSS scenarios to examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves slightly better performance in some of the scenarios while no worse in all other scenarios. Further analyses, including the effect of the designed fitness function and sizes of the learned scheduling heuristics, are also conducted.},

  abstract  = {The main purpose of portfolio optimization is to reduce the risk, and/or maximize the return of a group of investments. Most of the works that have been done on port-folio optimization are based on the Modern Portfolio Theory introduced by Markowitz in 1959. Some of them have employed price predictions to compute optimal asset weights. It has been demonstrated that using price predictions, instead of historical data, might improve portfolio performance under a risk-adjusted perspective. However, contributions in the field mainly focused on stocks, while little attention has been given on multi-asset portfolios including real estate. In this paper, we fill this gap by running a genetic algorithm on 456 portfolios to demonstrate the added value of including price predictions in our asset allocation problem. To investigate this, we compare the theoretical case of having a perfect foresight, where the predicted price $p_{t}$ is exactly the same as the expected price pt; under this case, the portfolio optimization task takes place in the test set (since we have assumed a perfect price prediction). We compare the results under perfect foresight with results derived from portfolio optimization that only took place in the training set, and the weights were then directly applied to the test set. Our goal is to demonstrate the theoretical advantages of using price predictions on mixed-asset portfolios that include real estate. Our results show that there can be significant improvements (up to 45\%) in sharpe ratio, rate of return, and risk, when using price predictions instead of a historical prices based portfolio.},

Test case prioritization and reduction minimize cost and effort needed for retesting by scheduling critical test cases before the less critical ones and removing redundant test cases. The criticality and redundancy of the test cases depend on several testing criteria. This paper empirically analyzed the effect of different testing criteria like code and fault coverage on the techniques&#39; performance. This paper proposed a discrete Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) for enhancing efficiency of test case prioritization. The algorithm is improved by replacing the random distribution with Gaussian probability to escape from the local optima. The evolution stagnation issue is further resolved by hybridizing it with genetic algorithm (QPSO-GA). In addition to prioritizing the test cases, the algorithm also reduces the test suite size through the test suite reduction approach. The experiments are conducted on different versions of three pro-grams from the open-source software infrastructure repository. The performance is compared with the average percentage of statement coverage, fault detection, and their combinations with the cost. Consequently, suite reduction, fault detection capability losses, and coverage loss percentage are also drawn for test suite reduction. The proposed algorithms outperformed the random search, ant colony optimization, differential evolution, GA, PSO, and adaptive PSO for all the evaluation metrics.},

Meanwhile, intermediate holding is often needed to a) release availability of scarce resources such as runways and gates for more cost-effective routing and scheduling, b) provide additional solutions in the speed profile database that can be used during routing and scheduling, and c) keep airport ground movements functional during disruptive events that may paralyse part of the taxiway network. This paper presents an extended multiobjective memetic algorithm upon the multigraph model to search for desirable solutions with intermediate holding. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined with problem instances of different airport layouts. The results demonstrate prominent savings in both time and fuel costs compared with solutions without intermediate holding.},

  abstract  = {Algorithmic trading has become an increasingly thriving research area and a lot of focus has been given on indicators from technical and sentiment analysis. In this paper, we examine the advantages of combining features from both analyses. To do this, we use two different genetic programming algorithms (GP). The first algorithm allows trees to contain technical and/or sentiment analysis indicators without any con-straints. The second algorithm introduces technical and sentiment analysis types through a strongly typed GP, whereby one branch of a given tree contains only technical analysis indicators and another branch of the same tree contains only sentiment analysis features. This allows for better exploration and exploitation of the search space of the indicators. We perform experiments on 10 international stocks and compare the above two GPs&#39; performances. Our goal is to demonstrate that the combination of the indicators leads to improved financial performance. Our results show that the strongly typed GP is able to rank first in terms of Sharpe ratio and statistically outperform all other algorithms in terms of rate of return.},

  abstract  = {Bi-level programming (BLP) is a hierarchical decision-making problem in which part of the constraints is determined by solving other optimization problems. Classic op-timization techniques cannot be applied directly, while standard metaheuristics often demand high computational costs. The transfer optimization paradigm uses the experience acquired when solving one optimization problem to speed up a distinct but related task. In particular, the multitasking technique ad-dresses two or more optimization tasks simultaneously to explore similarities and improve convergence. BLPs can benefit from multitasking as many (potentially similar) lower-level problems must be solved. Recently, several studies used surrogate methods to save expensive upper-level function evaluations in BLPs. This work proposes an algorithm based on Differential Evolution supported by transfer optimization and surrogate models to solve BLPs more efficiently. Experiments show a reduction of up to 86\% regarding the number of function evaluations of the upper-level problem while achieving similar or superior accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art solvers.},

In detail, VQCs involve parameterized quan-tum circuits to be trained by means of a classical optimizer that makes queries to the quantum device. VQCs play a key role in several applications including quantum classifiers where the Hilbert space is used as feature space. Currently, the most used classical optimizer to learn V QCs is the gradient descent method. However, the so-called barren plateaus issue causes gradients of cost functions to become exceedingly small as the dimension of the classification problem is increased. As consequence, gradient descent method could be not efficient in real-world classification problems. This paper proposes to apply Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to train VQCs used as quantum classifiers. As shown in the experiments, the application of GAs results in accurate solutions obtained with a reduced number of queries to quantum devices.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling is an important combinatorial optimisation problem that covers valuable practical applications such as order picking in warehouses and service allocation in cloud computing. Machine assignment and operation sequencing are two key decisions to be considered simultaneously in dynamic flexible job shop scheduling. Genetic programming has been successfully and widely used to learn scheduling heuristics, including a routing rule for machine assignment and a sequencing rule for operation sequencing simultaneously. There are mainly two types of learning strategies to evolve scheduling heuristics, i.e., learning one rule by fixing the other rule, and learning the routing rule and the sequencing rule simultaneously. However, there is no guidance on which learning strategy to use in specific cases. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive study of learning strategies on scheduling heuristics of genetic programming in dynamic flexible job shop scheduling by comparing five learning strategies, including two strategies that are extended from the existing studies. The results show that learning two rules simultaneously, either using cooperative coevolution or multi-tree representation, is more effective than only learning one type of rule. Cooperative coevolution is recommended if an algorithm aims to handle a problem by dividing it into small sub-problems, and focuses on the characteristics of routing rule and sequencing rule. Genetic programming with multi-tree representation that treats the routing rule and the sequencing rule as an individual, is preferred to reduce the complexities of algorithms.},

To effectively handle LMOPs, we propose a large-scale MOEA via self-guided problem transformation. In the proposed optimizer, the original large-scale search space is transferred to a lower-dimensional weighted space by the guidance of solutions themselves, aiming to effectively search in the weighted space for speeding up the convergence of the population. Specifically, the variables of the target LMOP are adaptively and randomly divided into multiple equal groups, and then solutions are self-guided to construct the small-scale weighted space correspondingly to these variable groups. In this way, each solution is projected as a self-guided vector with multiple weight variables, and then new weight vectors can be generated by searching in the weighted space. Next, new offspring is produced by inversely mapping the newly generated weight vectors to the original search space of this LMOP. Finally, the proposed optimizer is tested on two different LMOP test suites by comparing them with five competitive large-scale MOEAs. Experimental results show some advantages of the proposed algorithm in solving the considered benchmarks.},

Since the currently available methods do not allow for that, in this paper, we propose a holistic approach for solving a Multi-Objective Path Planning (MOPP) problem for UAVs in a three-dimensional, large-scale urban environment. For the tackled optimization problem, we propose an energy model and a noise model for a UAV, following a smooth 3D path. We utilize a path representation based on 3D Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). As optimizers, we use a conventional version of an Evolution Strategy (ES), two standard Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) - NSGA2 and MO-CMA-ES, and a gradient-based L-BFGS-B approach. To guide the optimization, we propose hybrid versions of the mentioned algorithms by applying an advanced initialization scheme that is based on the exact bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm. We compare the different algorithms with and without hybrid initialization in a statistical analysis, which considers the number of function evaluations and quality features of the obtained Pareto fronts indicating convergence and diversity of the solutions. We evaluate the methods on a realistic 3D urban path planning scenario in New York City, based on real-world data exported from OpenStreetMap. The examination&#39;s results indicate that hybrid initialization is the main factor for the efficient identification of near-optimal solutions.},

  abstract  = {Although an entire frontier of Pareto-optimal solutions exists for multi-objective optimization problems, in practice, decision makers are often only interested in a small subset of these solutions, called the region of interest. Specialized optimizers, such as reference-point based evolutionary algorithms, exist that can focus the search to only find solutions inside this region of interest. These algorithms typically only modify the selection mechanism of regular multi-objective optimizers to preferentially select solutions that conform to the reference point. However, a more effective search may be performed by additionally modifying the variation mechanism of the optimizers, namely the crossover and the mutation operators, to preferentially generate solutions conforming to the reference point. In this paper, we propose a modular mutation operator that uses a recent knowledge discovery technique to first find decision rules unique to the preferred solutions in each generation. These rules are then used to build an empirical distribution in the decision space that can be sampled to generate new mutated solutions which are more likely to be closer to the preferred solutions. The operator is modular in the sense that it can be used with any existing reference-point based evolutionary algorithm by simply replacing the mutation operator. We incorporate the proposed knowledge-driven mutation operator into three such algorithms, and through benchmark test problems up to 10 objectives, demonstrate that their performance improves significantly in the majority of cases according to two different performance indicators.},

In a nutshell, the weights of a parametrized quantum circuit are varied until the empirical sampling distribution of the circuit is sufficiently close to a desired outcome. Numerical first-order methods are applied frequently to fit the parameters of the circuit, but most of the time, the circuit itself, that is, the actual composition of gates, is fixed. Methods for optimizing the circuit design jointly with the weights have been proposed, but empirical results are rather scarce. Here, we consider a simple evolutionary strategy that addresses the trade-off between finding appropriate circuit ar-chitectures and parameter tuning. We evaluate our method both via simulation and on actual quantum hardware. Our benchmark problems include the transverse field Ising Hamiltonian and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin model. Despite the shortcomings of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, we find only a minor slowdown on actual quantum machines compared to simulations. Moreover, we investigate which mutation operations most significantly contribute to the optimization. The results provide intuition on how randomized search heuristics behave on actual quantum hardware and layout a path for further refinement of evolutionary quantum gate circuits.},

For instance, time-series for daily stock data would be profiled at 252 points in one year. However, this episodic style neglects the important events, or price changes that occur between two intervals. Thus, we use Directional Changes (DC) as an event-based series, which is an alternative way to record price movements. In DC, unlike time-series methods, time intervals are constituted by price changes. The unique feature that decides the price change to be considered as a significant is called a threshold θ. The objective of our paper is to create DC-based trading strategies, and then optimize them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). To construct such strategies, we use DC-based indicators and scaling laws that have been empirically identified under DC summaries. We first propose four novel DC-based trading strategies and then combine them with existing DC-based strategies and finally optimize them via the GA. We conduct trading experiments over 44 stocks. Results show that the GA-optimized strategies are able to generate new and profitable trading strategies, significantly outperforming the individual DC-based strategies, as well as a buy and sell benchmark.},

Massively parallelization in a distributed memory environment effectively speeds up evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms for practical application problems.

Here, we propose a method to improve the problem that the T-neighbor is divided and the solution distribution becomes sparse by adaptively controlling the penalty value in the PBI function according to the distance from the reference vector using a distribution function such as Laplace distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by comparison with execution using a single CPU.},

  abstract  = {Intelligent Transportation aims to usher in a new and improved version of motorised traffic, one that is stream-lined, safe and at the heart of the net-zero agenda. Designing and building the urban infrastructure necessary to turn that vision into a reality relies on complex decision making, which often hinges on estimating the dynamics of future traffic through areas of the road network that are yet to be built. Traffic models capable of yielding such estimations, robustly and reliably, are valuable technological tools that urban planners can utilise to inform their decisions. To that end, we propose a novel algorithm that employs Genetic Programming and Transfer Learning to produce traffic models which accurately predict vehicle flow through a given junction based on readings collected from sur-rounding areas. We enhance the algorithm with a randomisation mechanism and run a comprehensive experimental study on a segment of the city of Darmstadt&#39;s road network, in order to investigate the effects of the exploration-exploitation interplay on the generated models&#39; prediction accuracy.},

  abstract  = {In solving multi-modal, multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), the objective is not only to find a good representation of the Pareto-optimal front (PF) in the objective space but also to find all equivalent Pareto-optimal subsets (PSS) in the variable space. Such problems are practically relevant when a decision maker (DM) is interested in identifying alternative designs with similar performance. There has been significant research interest in recent years to develop efficient algorithms to deal with MMOPs. However, the existing algorithms still require prohibitive number of function evaluations (often in several thousands) to deal with problems involving as low as two objectives and two variables. The algorithms are typically embedded with sophisticated, customized mechanisms that require additional parameters to manage the diversity and convergence in the variable and the objective spaces. In this paper, we introduce a steady-state evolutionary algorithm for solving MMOPs, with a simple design and no additional user-defined parameters that need tuning compared to a standard EA. We report its performance on 21 MMOPs from various test suites that are widely used for benchmarking using a low computational budget of 1000 function evaluations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms (MO_Ring_PSO_SCD, DN-NSGAII, TriMOEA-TA&amp;R, CPDEA, MMOEA/DC and MMEA-WI). The proposed algorithm exhibits significantly better performance than the above algorithms based on the established metrics including IGDX, PSP and IGD. We hope this study would encourage design of simple, efficient and generalized algorithms to improve their uptake for practical applications.},

  abstract  = {Metaheuristics (MHs) are proven powerful algorithms for solving non-linear optimisation problems over discrete, continuous, or mixed domains. Applications have ranged from basic sciences to applied technologies. Nowadays, the literature contains plenty of MHs based on exceptional ideas, but often, they are just recombining elements from other techniques. An alternative approach is to follow a standard model that customises population-based MHs, utilising simple heuristics extracted from well-known MHs. Different approaches have explored the combination of such simple heuristics, generating excellent results compared to the generic MHs. Nevertheless, they present limitations due to the nature of the metaheuristic used to study the heuristic space. This work investigates a field of action for implementing a model that takes advantage of previously modified MHs by learning how to boost the performance of the tailoring process. Following this reasoning, we propose a hyper-heuristic model based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained with processed sequences of heuristics to identify patterns that one can use to generate better MHs. We prove the feasibility of this model by comparing the results against generic MHs and other approaches that tailor unfolded MHs. Our results evidenced that the proposed model outperformed an average of 84\% of all scenarios; in particular, 89\% of basic and 77\% of unfolded approaches. Plus, we highlight the configurable capability of the proposed model, as it shows to be exceptionally versatile in regards to the computational budget, generating good results even with limited resources.},

The PFCLP is a relevant problem for Geographic Information Systems, where the objective is to position labels on a map avoiding overlaps to improve legibility. The first techniques proposed to solve this problem considered only the presence/absence of over-lapping, while more recent ones introduced the idea of estimating the intensity of such overlap. This work extends previous works by considering the overlap intensity through the Jaccard index. Traditional mathematical models for PFCLP were compared to the proposed strategy showing that the Jaccard index provided the best results in terms of legibility. A Clustering Search (CS) algorithm was also proposed to compare the performance of our strategy on a set of large-sized instances. The experimental results show good solutions for instances with up to 13206 points.},

  abstract  = {In forensic sciences, blood is a shred of essential evidence for reconstructing crime scenes. Blood identification and classification may help to confirm a suspect, although several chemical processes are used to recreate the crime scene. However, these approaches can have an impact on DNA analysis. A potential application of bloodstain identification and classification using Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can be used as substance clas-sification in forensic science for crime scene analysis. Therefore, this work proposes the use of a fast and compact Hybrid CNN to process HSI data for bloodstain identification and classification. For experimental and validation purposes, we perform exper-iments on a publicly available Hyperspectral-based Bloodstain dataset. This dataset has different types of substances i.e., blood and blood-like compounds, for instance, ketchup, artificial blood, beetroot juice, poster paint, tomato concentrate, acrylic paint, uncertain blood. We compare the results with state-of-the-art 3D CNN model and examine the results in detail and present a discussion of each tested architecture with limited availability of the training samples (e.g., only 5\% (792 samples) of the data samples are used to train the model, and validated on 5\% (792 samples) data samples and finally blindly tested on 90\% (14260 samples) of the data samples).

  abstract  = {Multi-objective decision-making and dynamic short-est paths are two areas of research widely studied and of great importance for computer science, engineering, and economics. Both areas have seen a remarkable evolution in their algorithms in the last decades and have contributed to several applications in real life. The applications range from cost reduction in the expansion of telecommunications and electrical networks to the accessibility of people and autonomous vehicles. However, despite their importance, the investigation of methods at the intersection of these two areas has not been explored in the literature. Problems at this intersection are characterized by graphs whose topology can change over time (i.e., edges can be inserted or deleted online) and whose edges&#39; costs are defined by more than a single criterion or objective. In this paper, we introduce the multi- objective dynamic shortest path problem (MODSP) and present the first algorithm to solve it. In particular, we formally define the MODSP problem and explain its relation to multi-objective decision-making and dynamic shortest paths. Concerning the algorithm, we present the first single-source MODSP (SMDSP) approach as a first effort towards solving MODSP problems while avoiding the recomputation of the paths from scratch when the graph is updated. Finally, we perform an experimental evaluation of the SMDSP and a comparison with the state-of-art algorithm for multi-objective shortest path problems. The results of our experimental evaluation prove that in an environment subjected to constant updates, the SMDSP algorithm is more efficient.},

In this paper, we consider the multi-objective travelling salesperson problem (MTSP), both static and dynamic, with conflicting objectives. NSGA-II and MOEA/D, two popular evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms suffer from loss of diversity and poor convergence when applied separately on MTSP. However, both these techniques have their individual strengths. NSGA-II maintains di-versity through non-dominated sorting and crowding distance selection. MOEA/D is good at exploring extreme points on the Pareto front with faster convergence. In this paper, we adopt the bicriterion framework that exploits the strengths of Pareto-Criterion (PC) and Non-Pareto Criterion (NPC) evolutionary populations. In this research, NSGA-II (PC) and MOEA/D (NPC) coevolve to compensate the diversity of each other. We further improve the convergence using local search and a hybrid of order crossover and inver-over operators. To our knowledge, this is the first work that combines NSGA-II and MOEA/D in a bicriterion framework for solving MTSP, both static and dynamic. We perform various experiments on different MTSP bench-mark datasets with and without traffic factors to study static and dynamic MTSP. Our proposed algorithm is compared against standard algorithms such as NSGA-II &amp; III, MOEA/D, and a baseline divide and conquer coevolution technique using performance metrics such as inverted generational distance, hypervolume, and the spacing metric to concurrently quantify the convergence and diversity of our proposed algorithm. We also compare our results to datasets used in the literature and show that our proposed algorithm performs empirically better than compared algorithms.},

At present these hybrid networks are designed manually and various organisation attempts are noticed.

Most of the existing methods are specially designed to handle one or a few certain types of topologies and thus have limited applicability. To address this issue, this study proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) to generate crease patterns for orthogonal-structure origami models. Two crease pattern representations, i.e., string and matrix, are designed for the GA to deal with crease pattern search. The experimental results on three test instances indicate that the GA is capable of finding the target crease patterns. In particular, the string representation leads to faster convergence than the matrix representation. These outcomes show the potential of GA for origami design.},

The most fine grained approach to changing their internal structure, direct manipulation of the bitstream, has largely been abandoned. The undocumented bitstream formats of modern FPGAs made it complicated and error-prone. This situation has fundamentally changed with the advent of open-source FPGA toolchains. Previous attempts to exploit this opportunity were promising, but only manged to solve very basic tasks. We present in this paper an evolved tone discriminator circuit. It was evolved by replicating the most famous experiment in this field, but with modern hardware. For that we map the originally used Xilinx XC6200 FPGA to a modern Lattice iCE40 FPGA. We show how to set up the experiment and optimize the evolution environment. Our approach allows over 130 times more reconfigurations per second than previous approaches. Additionally, we discuss reasons for the abandonment of direct bitstream manipulation for EHW in context of the new possibilities created by open-source FPGA toolchains. We show which challenges have been solved and which steps need to be taken next.},

  abstract  = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) are sorts of optimization problems that have many global optima. To discover as many peaks as possible and increase the accuracy of the solutions, MMOP requires algorithms with great exploration and exploitation abilities. However, exploration and exploitation are in an adversarial relationship, since exploration aims to locate more optima via searching the global space rather than small regions, whereas exploitation targets to enhance the accuracy of solutions via searching in small areas. The key to efficiently solving MMOPs lies in striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. To achieve the goal, this paper proposes an adversarial differential evolution (ADE), containing an adversarial reproduction strategy and an adversarial selection strategy. Firstly, adversarial reproduction strategy generates offspring for exploration and offspring for exploitation and lets these two types of offspring compete for survival. Secondly, adversarial selection strategy employs a diversity-optimization-based selection and a crowding-based selection to select the offspring with both good diversity and good fitness. Diversity-optimization-based selection transforms the problem of selecting diverse individuals into an optimizing problem and solves it via an extra genetic algorithm to get the offspring with optimal diversity. Extensive experiments are conducted on CEC2013 MMOP benchmark to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ADE. Experimental results show that ADE has advantages over the state-of-the-art MMOP algorithms.},

In this paper, we study Genetic Programming (GP) for symbolic regressions to explore the potentials of multi-objective GP in recovering analytical expressions for two and, in the future, N particles. We propose a new GP approach containing building blocks to scale up the problem and provide a new benchmark with 22 cases for this application. To identify the strengths and limitations of GP, we generate fully resolved training data from simulations. We compare the results of our algorithm to the superimposition method and a multi-layer perceptron as two baseline methods. The results show that GP can find comparable and sometimes better solutions with smaller failure rates than the two baseline methods. In addition, the produced solutions by GP are explainable and certain function patterns inline with physical laws can be identified across the benchmark problems.},

In this paper, we hybridize a meta-genetic algorithm with reinforcement learning to automatically design genetic algorithms for the two-dimensional bin packing problem. The task of the meta-genetic algorithm is to search the configuration space of genetic algorithms and the task of reinforcement learning is to decide whether to evaluate a candidate configuration or not. Therefore, avoiding wasting the computational budget on poor configurations. The proposed hybrid and the meta-genetic algorithm without reinforcement learning produce solvers for the two-dimensional bin packing problem that are competitive with the state-of-the-art algorithms. However, the proposed hybrid consumes about 25\% of the computational effort required by the meta-genetic algorithm without reinforcement learning.},

  abstract  = {Finding transcription factor binding sites plays an important role inside bioinformatics. Its correct identification in the promoter regions of co-expressed genes is a crucial step for understanding gene expression mechanisms and creating new drugs and vaccines. The problem of finding motifs consists in seeking conserved patterns in biological datasets of sequences, through using unsupervised learning algorithms. This problem is considered one of the open problems of computational biology, which in its simplest formulation has been proven to be np-hard. Moreover, heuristics and meta-heuristics algorithms have been shown to be very promising in solving combinatorial problems with very large search spaces. In this paper we propose a new algorithm called Biomapp (Biological Motif Application) based on canonical Expectation Maximization that uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence to re-estimate the parameters of statistical model. Furthermore, the algorithm is embedded in an Iterated Local Search, as the local search step and then, we use a hierarchical perturbation operator in order to escape from local optima. The results obtained by this new approach were compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm MEME (Multiple EM Motif Elicitation) showing that Biomapp outperformed this classical technique in several datasets.},

A DLN is a complex system composed of a high number of different classes of drones and ground infrastructures. The corresponding DLN model is composed of a number of interconnected digital twins of each one of these infrastructures and vehicles, forming a single digital twin of the whole logistic network. The paper proposes a multi-agent bio-inspired optimisation approach based on the analogy with the Physarum Policefalum slime mould that incrementally generates and optimise the DLN. A graph theory methodology is also employed to evaluate the network resilience where random failures, and their cascade effect, are simulated. The different conflicting objectives are aggregated into a single global performance index by using Pascoletti-Serafini scalarisation.},

  abstract  = {Multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems have multiple equivalent Pareto sets, each of which is mapped to the entire Pareto front. A number of multi-modal multi-objective algorithms have been proposed to find all equivalent Pareto sets. Their performance is evaluated by computational experiments on multi-modal multi-objective test problems. A common feature of those test problems is that a single point on the Pareto front in the objective space corresponds to multiple clearly separated Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space. In this paper, we propose a new type of multi-modal multi-objective test problems where a single point on the Pareto front corresponds to an infinite number of Pareto optimal solutions (i.e., a subset of the decision space). This means that the mapping from the Pareto set in the decision space to the Pareto front in the objective space is a set-to-point mapping. For example, all points on a line in the decision space are mapped to the same single point on the Pareto front. As a result, the dimensionality of the Pareto set is larger than that of the Pareto front. We examine the search behavior of multi-modal multi-objective algorithms using the proposed test problems. Some interesting observations are reported.},

  abstract  = {Area coverage is essential for robots used in cleaning, painting, and exploration applications. Reconfigurable robots have been introduced to solve the area coverage limitation of fixed-shape robots. The existing global coverage algorithms of reconfigurable robots are limited to consideration of a limited set of predefined shapes for the reconfiguration and do not consider the exact geometrical shape of obstacles. Therefore, degraded coverage performance could be observed from the existing methods. On the other hand, the coverage methods that consider reconfiguring beyond a limited set of predefined shapes are limited to local coverage. Furthermore, these methods only consider a single reconfiguration for the coverage. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel coverage method for a reconfigurable robot consisting of both global and local path planners. The global path planner uses boustrophedon motion combined with the A * algorithm. The optimum grid positioning that maximizes the global coverage is determined through a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The local coverage planner performs continuous reconfig-uration of the robot to adequately cover obstacle zones while navigating through narrow spaces without collisions. A GA is used to determine the reconfiguration parameters of the robot at each instance of the local coverage. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method is effective in performing both global and local coverage path planning for improving the area coverage performance.},

Currently, in industry sector, decarbonization and carbon neutrality are approached by technical innovations such as Industry 4.0. In particular, optimal production scheduling researches which are important in production environments have been conducted actively. However, there is a gap between the previous optimal production scheduling researches and production schedule generating methods of practical production environments. The proposed method can fill the gap and it can be applied to the practical production environments. Results of the proposed method are compared with those of the conventional MBSO [7] and GMBSO based methods. It is verified that the proposed MP-GMBSO based method can find higher quality production schedules. In addition, it is verified that there is a significant difference among the conventional MBSO and GMBSO based methods, and the proposed MP-GMBSO based method with 0.05 significant level by the Friedman test as a priori test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni-Holm correction as a post hoc test. In addition, the objective function of the target production scheduling has needles and it is found that the problem is one of the challenging problems to be optimized. The proposed MP-GMBSO based method can solve the problem better than the conventional MBSO and GMBSO based methods even with the challenging characteristic of the problem.},

These algorithms are trained on the same code that they intend to test, requiring instrumentation and lengthy search times to test each software component. This paper outlines a novel genetic programming framework, where the evolved solutions are not input values, but micro-programs that can repeatedly generate input values to efficiently explore a software component&#39;s input parameter domain.

  abstract  = {Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming (G3P) is widely recognised as one of the most successful approaches for program synthesis, i.e., the task of automatically discovering an executable piece of code given user intent. G3P has been shown capable of successfully evolving programs in arbitrary languages that solve several program synthesis problems based only on a set of input/output examples. Despite its success, the restriction on the evolutionary system to only leverage input/output error rate during its assessment of the programs it derives limits its scalabil-ity to larger and more complex program synthesis problems. With the growing number and size of open software repositories and generative artificial intelligence approaches, there is a sizeable and growing number of approaches for retrieving/generating source code (potentially several partial snippets) based on textual problem descriptions. Therefore, it is now, more than ever, time to introduce G3P to other means of user intent (particularly textual problem descriptions). In this paper, we would like to assess the potential for G3P to evolve programs based on their similarity to particular target codes of interest (obtained using some code retrieval/generative approach). Through our experimental evaluation on a well-known program synthesis benchmark, we have shown that G3P successfully manages to evolve some of the desired programs with all four considered similarity measures. However, in its default configuration, G3P is not as successful with similarity measures as it is with the classical input/output error rate when solving program synthesis problems. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-objective G3P approach that combines the similarity to the target program and the traditional input/output error rate. Our experiments show that compared to the error-based G3P, the multi-objective G3P approach could improve the success rate of specific problems and has great potential to improve on the traditional G3P system.},

It has been successfully used in a number of applications, for example for the task of automatic algorithm selection. However, recent work has shown that Exploratory Landscape Analysis contains some specific weaknesses that its users should be aware of. As the technique is sample based, it has been shown to be sensitive to the choice of sampling strategy. Additionally, many landscape features are not invariant to transformations of the underlying samples which should have no effect on algorithm performance, specifically shifting and scaling. The analysis of the effect of shifting and scaling has so far only been demonstrated on a single problem set and dimensionality. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the invariance of Exploratory Landscape Analysis features to these two transformations, by considering different sampling strate-gies, sampling sizes, problem dimensionalities, and benchmark problem sets to determine their individual and combined effect. We show that these factors have very limited influence on the features&#39; invariance when they are considered either individually or combined.},

Concretely, j3-XCS is composed of classifiers that condition part in each dimension is represented by the beta distribution that can change a flexible distribution shape according to its parameters. Through the intensive experiments of the different types of continuous space problems, the following implications have been revealed: (1) j3-X CS can show higher classification performance and function approximation performance with fewer classifiers than other XCSs with the conventional representations such as XCS with the hyperrectangular representation (i.e., XCSR) and XCS with the hyperellipsoidal representations (i.e., hyperellipsoid-based XCS); (2) fJ-XCS can quickly and stably evolve the classifiers that can appropriately match the line and curved shapes in comparison with XCSR and the ellipsoidal-based XCS; and (3) while the performance of the conventional XCSs is highly sensitive to the hyperparameter that defines the generality of the covering classifier, the performance of fJ-XCS is the most robust to its values.},

In this context, agents can obtain advantages by undervaluing their preferences. Thus, we will see how to discourage such lies even in the presence of public goods and non-additive utilities. Likewise, we will use genetic algorithms to show, through experimental results, the robustness of our proposal against lies.},

First, we apply a grammar-based genetic algorithm for evolving Python functions that minimise or maximise the probability of a function to be in a certain class, and we also produce programs that yield an output near to the classification threshold, namely for which the network does not express a clear classification preference. We then use such sets of evolved programs as initial popu-lations for an evolution strategy approach in which we apply, by following different policies, constrained small mutations to the individuals, so to both explore the decision boundary of the network and to identify the features that most contribute to a particular prediction. We furtherly point out how our approach can be effectively used for several tasks in the scope of the interpretable machine learning, such as for producing adversarial examples able to deceive a network, for identifying the most salient features, and further for characterising the abstract concepts learned by a neural model.},

  abstract  = {Differential evolution has a long track record of successfully solving optimization problems in continuous domain due it its powerful Euclidean distance-based learning concept. Although this affects its suitability for solving several problems with permutation variables, several studies show that it can be applicable for effectively solving permutation-based problems. In this paper, an improved design of differential evolution is introduced to solve a military fleet modernization problem with discrete parameters. In this problem, several modernization oper-ations are required to transition a military force from an outdated fleet to a more modern one with the objective of maximizing the force&#39;s deployment at the minimum cost over a pre-determined planning period. The proposed differential evolution incorporates a new solution representation, a proposed repairing heuristic method, a modified mutation operator and mapping method for efficiently tackling the discrete characteristics of the targeted problem and is coupled with a simulation model to evaluate the fitness of the generated solutions. To judge its performance, the proposed algorithm has been implemented to solve a case study that addresses recent fleet modernization strategies of the Australian Army to recapitalize its forces over the next decade and in a continual process. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can provide more efficient fleet modernization schedules which are 29.32\% and 51.43\% better than those obtained by other two comparative algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a hybrid BRKGA (MP-HBRKGA), that combines BRKGA with a Local Branching technique, to solve the multiproduct two-stage capacitated facility location problem (MP-TSCFLP). In this problem, a set of different products has to be transported from a set of factories, passing through a set of depots (first stage) and then transported to a set of customers (second stage). The goal in the MP-TSCFLP is to minimize the opening and transportation costs, where each kind of product has its own transportation cost per unit transported. Recent hybrid methods have been successfully applied to facility location problems, therefore, in this paper we propose adaptations of such hybrid methods and implement the MP-HBRKGA for handling the multiproduct characteristic. To the best of our knowledge, such hybrid BRKGA presented the best results for the single-product problem and have not yet been applied to solve the problem with multiple products. Computational experiments compare the obtained results to those in the literature, using four sets, with different characteristics, of large-sized instances, proposed in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) is an important real-world problem. However, the problem is challenging because of many conflicting objectives and the complexity of production flows. Genetic programming-based hyper-heuristic (GP-HH) is a useful approach for automatically evolving effective dispatching rules for many-objective JSS. However, the evolved Pareto-front is highly irregular, seriously affecting the effectiveness of GP-HH. Although the reference points method is one of the most prominent and efficient methods for diversity maintenance in many-objective problems, it usually uses a uniform distribution of reference points which is only appropriate for a regular Pareto-front. In fact, some reference points may never be linked to any Pareto-optimal solutions, rendering them useless. These useless reference points can significantly impact the performance of any reference-point-based many-objective optimization algorithms such as NSGA-III. This paper proposes a new reference point adaption process that explicitly constructs the distribution model using Gaussian process to effectively reduce the number of useless reference points to a low level, enabling a close match between reference points and the distribution of Pareto-optimal solutions. We incorporate this mechanism into NSGA-III to build a new algorithm called MARP-NSGA-III which is compared experimentally to several popular many-objective algorithms. Experiment results on a large collection of many-objective benchmark JSS instances clearly show that MARP-NSGA-III can significantly improve the performance by using our Gaussian Process-based reference point adaptation mechanism.},

  abstract  = {Assigning ambulances to emergencies in real-time, ensuring both that patients receive adequate care and that the fleet remains capable of responding to any potential new emergency, is a critical component of any ambulance service. Thus far, most techniques to manage this problem are as convoluted as the problem itself. As such, many real-world medical services resort to using the naive closest-idle rule, whereby the nearest available vehicles are dispatched to serve each new call. This paper explores the feasibility of using a genetic programming hyper heuristic (GPHH) in order to generate intelligible rules of thumb to select which vehicles should attend any given emergency. Such rules, either manually or automatically designed, are evaluated within a novel solution construction procedure which constructs solutions to the ambulance dispatching problem given the parameters of the simulation environment. Experimental results suggest that GPHH is a promising technique to use when approaching the ambulance dispatching problem. Further, a GPHH-evolved rule&#39;s interpretability allows for detailed semantic analysis into which features of the environment are valuable to the decision making process, allowing for human dispatching agents to make more informed decisions in practice.},

  abstract  = {In multimodal optimization problems the main goal is to find as many global optima as possible by using a single search process. This type of optimization tasks emerges in many real-world scenarios in assorted fields including medicine, physics, and aerospace, among many others. However, addressing several multimodal optimization problems simultaneously has received little attention from the multitask optimization community to date. Even though solving different multimodal problems at the same time can largely benefit from the existing synergies among the modes of different tasks, this setup has been less studied than other optimization tasks. This work finds its inspiration in the incipient concepts of Evolutionary Multitasking and Multifactorial Optimization to propose a multifactorial Cellular Genetic Algorithm for solving multimodal optimization problems. Our designed algorithm expedites the search for the global optima of different problems at a time by including several algorithmic steps aimed at adapting the search itself as per the synergies found over the exploration of the problems&#39; landscape. An extensive experimentation has been designed using 14 different functions from the CEC‘2013 competition on multimodal optimization benchmark. Besides evaluating the performance of the devised algorithm to retain the global optima of every function in the benchmark, we also conduct an analysis of the transfer of knowledge among such functions. Finally, we compare its performance to that of a winning proposal in this CEC‘2013 competition so as to reflect on the suitability of the multitasking paradigm to solve multimodal optimization tasks.},

The problem considers a contract market in which a distribution system operator (DSO) requests flexibility from aggregators with DR capabilities. We include a network validation approach in the evaluation of solutions, i.e., the DSO determines losses and voltage limit violations depending on the location of aggregators in the network. The validation of the network increases the complexity of the objective function since new network constraints are included in the formulation. Therefore, we advocate the use of metaheuristic optimization and a simulation procedure to overcome this issue. We compare different evolutionary algorithms, including the well-known differential evolution and other two more recent algorithms, the vortex search and the hybrid-adaptive differential evolution with decay function. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in solving the proposed complex model under a realistic case study.},

  abstract  = {Topology optimization optimizes material layout in a design space for a given objective, such as crash energy absorption, and a set of boundary conditions. In industrial applications, multi-objective topology optimization requires expensive simulations to evaluate the objectives and generate multiple Pareto-optimal solutions. So, it is more economical to identify preferred regions on the Pareto front and generate only the desired solutions. Clustering methods, a widely used subclass of machine learning methods, provide an unsupervised approach to summarize the dataset, which eases the identification of the preferred set of designs. However, generating solutions similar to the preferred designs based on different metrics is a challenging task. In this paper, we present an interactive method to generate designs similar to a preferred set using one of the state-of-the-art weighted-sum approaches called scaled energy weighting - hybrid cellular automata (SEW-HCA). To avoid unnecessary computations, metamodels are used to predict the desired weight vectors needed by SEW-HCA. We evaluate an application of our method for cooperative topology optimization using a cantilever multi-load-case problem and a crashworthiness optimization problem. Using the proposed method, we could successfully generate designs that are similar to preferred solutions based on geometry and performance. We believe that this is a crucial component that will improve the usefulness of multi-objective topology optimization in real-world applications.},

The problem grows in importance when we consider Genetic Programming, where fitness evaluation is often rather slow. Therefore, finding the minimum amount of data that enables us to discover the solution to a given problem could bring significant benefits. Using the notion of entropy in a dataset, we seek to understand the information gain obtainable from each additional data point. We then look for the smallest percentage of data that corresponds to enough information to yield satisfactory results. We present, as a first step, an example derived from the state of art.

  abstract  = {Low budget black-box optimization is a relevant topic in many practical applications with expensive objective functions or tight real-time constraints. Recently, there has been a growing interest in addressing combinatorial permutation problems in a low budget and black-box scenario. In this context, most of the previously proposed algorithms learn a probabilistic model which guides the search by trying to somehow indicate the most effective areas of the permutation search space. However, the large size and the inherent discontinuity of the permutation space may lessen the effectiveness of this approach when a low, or very low, budget of evaluations is considered. Moving from this consideration, in this work we present a simpler elitist trajectory-based algorithm for low budget black-box optimization of permu-tation problems. The proposed algorithm, namely FAT-RLS, is based on three core ideas: a randomized local search scheme, an adaptive perturbation strength and the use of a tabu structure. A series of experiments held on commonly adopted benchmark problems clearly shows that FAT-RLS obtains better or compara-ble effectiveness with respect to the previous proposals. Moreover, its negligible computational overhead is of particular interest in mission critical situations where tight real-time constraints have to be matched.},

The telecommunication industry is facing tight budgets and severe competition. Therefore, reducing the cost of designing a fibre network via automation and optimisation has become critical. In order to automate and optimise network designs, British Telecom (BT) have developed a network design software, BT NetDesign, which includes a number of heuristics to search the design space of networks using a simulated annealing (SA) search strategy. Although NetDesign&#39;s current SA-based method is able to provide exploration and exploitation via different move heuristics, it cannot consistently reach the near-global optimum as the search space grows exponentially with the size of the network. To deal with larger networks, this study implements sequence-based hyper-heuristics utilising a hidden Markov model (HMM) with different acceptance strategies. The proposed methods have been rigorously analysed and compared using real-world network instances of different sizes. Results showed that HMM with a longer learning period and threshold acceptance strategy has promising ability to reach high quality solutions for large real-world problem instances.},

We compare down-sampled lexicase selection with standard lexicase selection on three common problems from the general program synthesis benchmark suite. First, we find that both lexicase variants are robust against reducing the amount of training data. We find that standard lexicase has a tendency to overfit the training data on some problems. With down-sampled lexicase, in contrast, overfitting on training data is reduced and evolved programs generalize better on held-out test cases. Consequently, we suggest to use grammar-guided genetic programming with down-sampled lexicase selection in the program synthesis domain.},

In tackling this complicated problem, we focuses on Inter-Domain Path Computation problem under the Domain Uniqueness constraint (IDPC-DU), which is employed to improve h-PCE. The objective of IDPC-DU is to find the shortest path between two given nodes that traverses every domain at most once. Since the IDPC-DU belongs to NP-Hard class, this paper introduces a two-level approach, combining the advantages of two metaheuristic algorithms, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Specifically, the upper-level GA plays the role of navigating the path for ants at the lower level ACO. Furthermore, an anti-stuck strategy that helps ants avoid being stuck is also equipped. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experiments and comparisons with other algorithms are conducted. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms all other comnared ones in most cases.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we study the k-labeled spanning forest problem (kLSF). The input for this problem is an undirected graph with labeled edges and a positive integer k. The goal is to find a spanning forest of the graph with at most $k$ different labels associated with the edges, minimizing the number of components. kLSF finds practical applications in different scenarios related to networks design and telecommunications. Solving it may help to reduce the negative impact of electromagnetic fields exposure on the population health or to increase profits of internet management companies, among others. The interest in kLSF is not only practical but also theoretical since the problem generalizes the best-known NP-hard minimum labeling spanning tree problem (MLST). To approach kLSF, we propose a fix-and-optimize matheuristic that was tested over several instances, achieving high-quality solutions in reasonable computational time. When compared to the best-known algorithms in the literature, our matheuristic outperformed the other proposals in most cases, finding better solutions in less computational time for the most challenging instances.},

  abstract  = {The M3GP algorithm, originally designed to per-form multiclass classification with genetic programming, is also a powerful feature construction method. Here we explore its ability to evolve hyper-features that are tailored not only to the problem to be solved, but also to the learning algorithm that is used to solve it. We pair M3GP with six different machine learning algorithms and study its performance in eight classification problems from different scientific domains, with substantial variety in the number of classes, features and samples. The results show that automatic feature construction with M3GP, when compared to using the standalone classifiers without feature construction, achieves statistically significant improvements in the majority of the test cases, sometimes by a very large margin, while degrading the weighted f-measure in only one out of 48 cases. We observe the differences in the number and size of the hyper-features evolved for each case, hypothesising that the simpler the classifier, the larger the amount of problem complexity is being captured in the hyper-features. Our results also reveal that the M3GP algorithm can be improved, both in execution time and in model quality, by replacing its default classifier with support vector machines or random forest classifiers.},

Despite the significance of machine selection for the FLP, the integration of arrangement and selection problems is neglected in the literature. This paper presents a methodology for solving an extended facility layout problem where not only the arrangement of machines is con-sidered, but also how many machines should be allocated and of which type. We assume the context of a modern brownfield planning project, where an initial layout already exists, which is to be re-purposed for manufacture of products with high variability. We apply our methodology in a case study where three objectives are to be minimized simultaneously. The results demonstrate that a standard NSGA-II introduces bias for this problem type that leads to an inadequate search space exploration. We test adapted mutation and crossover operators to overcome this challenge. While modified crossover had little impact, the new mutation operator was key to outperform the standard approach in all computed metrics. With this operator, we obtain diverse Pareto sets which strictly dominate up to 80\% of the solutions found by the standard approach on average.},

To alleviate the above issue, a zoning search and transfer learning- based multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (called ZSTL-MMOEA) is proposed in the present study. In the ZSTL-MMOEA, the decision space is divided into many subspaces and the transfer learning is used to realize knowledge sharing between two the most similar subspaces. The ZSTL-MMOEA is compared with five recently proposed multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOE- As) on 22 test functions. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its competitors in most functions.},

  abstract  = {This paper focuses on the matching mechanism of Learning Classifier System (LCS) in a continuous space and proposes a novel matching mechanism based on Gaussian distribution. This mechanism can match the “area” instead of the “point (one value)” in the continuous space unlike the conventional LCS such as XCSR (XCS with Continuous-Valued Inputs). Such an area matching contributes to generating the rules (called classifiers) with less-overlapped with other rules. Concretely, the proposed area matching mechanism employed in XCSR using VAE can generate appropriate classifiers for latent variables with high-dimensional inputs by VAE and create a human-interpretable observation space of human-interpretable classifiers. Since the latent variable in VAE is followed by Gaus-sian distribution, the following three matching mechanisms are compared: (i) the (single) point matching that selects the classifier which condition covers the mean of Gaussian distribution M; (ii) the multiple points matching that selects the classifier which condition covers the data sampled from Gaussian distribution (M, u); and (iii) the area matching that selects the classifier which condition roughly covers a certain area of Gaussian distribution (M, o). Through the intensive experiments on the high dimension maze problem, the following implications have been revealed: (1) the point matching in XCSR with VAE generates the ambiguous classifiers which conditions are overlapped with the other classifiers with the different action; (2) the sampling multiple points matching in XCSR with VAE has a potential of generating the less-overlapped classifiers by improving the data set through sampling. (3) the proposed area matching can generate the less-overlapped classifiers with the same learning steps, which corresponds to the time of the point matching.},

  abstract  = {Bilevel optimization refers to a challenging class of problems where a lower level (LL) optimization task acts as a constraint for an upper level (UL) optimization task. When a bilevel problem is solved using a nested evolutionary algorithm (EA), a large number of function evaluations are consumed since an LL optimization needs to be conducted to evaluate every candidate UL solution. Knowledge transfer of optimal LL solutions between neighboring UL solutions is a plausible approach to improve the search efficiency. Even though some of the past studies have utilized this strategy intuitively, the specific impact of the transferred solution(s) has not been clearly differentiated since it forms only a small component of a much more elaborate search framework. In this study, we intend to examine closely the effectiveness of direct solution transfer. To do so, the transferred solution (LL optimum of the nearest UL solution) is considered as the mainstay of the LL search, acting as the starting point for a direct local LL search. We first observe the performance of this approach on existing benchmarks. Based on the understanding gained from the experiments, we design modified problems where such a direct transfer is likely to face significant challenges. We then propose an improved approach that uses solution transfer more selectively by considering correlations between neighboring landscapes for a more effective transfer. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the challenges faced by the direct transfer on the modified problems, as well as the competitive performance of the correlation-based approach. We hope that the insights gained from the study will be beneficial for future development of efficient transfer-based approaches for bilevel optimization.},

We also enhance MAP-Elites by extending it with multiple solutions per cell (the original MAP-Elites saves only a single solution per cell). Different ways of selecting cell members for reproduction are also considered. We test the new MAP-Elites strategies on the evolutionary art application of image generation. Using procedural textures, genetic programming is used with upwards of 15 light-weight image features to guide fitness. The goal is to evolve images that share image features with a given target image. Our experiments show that the new MAP-Elites algorithms produce a large number of diverse solutions, which can be competitive in quality to those from standard GP runs.},

Our portfolio design includes cardinality, box, and budget constraints; an upper bound for the portfolio turnover maintains a control on the transaction costs during rebalancing phases. The algorithm uses a compressed coding scheme to encode the dependent variables into continuous ones to handle portfolio cardinalities. A repair operator deals with box and budget constraints, and an adaptive penalty function approach is used for the turnover constraint. The profitability of the developed investment strategy is tested using data from the MSCI World Index. The out-of-sample results show that our approach can consistently outperform the benchmark index and the cardinality constrained mean-variance model.},

The learning mechanism in traditional PSO is simple and easy to implement, but it suffers some potential problems, such as being easily trapped in local optimum and insufficient balance. Thus, a novel random learning PSO with improved quasi-Newton exploitation mechanism (RQ-PSO) is proposed. Firstly, to improve the global search ability, a random learning mechanism is proposed through the analysis of PSO based on many kinds of learning mechanisms. Then, the random learning mechanism is effectively integrated into PSO to obtain strong global search ability and avoid falling into local optima. Finally, to keep a better balance between exploration and exploitation, an improved quasi-Newton method with strong exploitation ability is incorporated into RL-PSO. The experimental results on the complex functions from CEC-2013 and CEC-2017 test sets show that RQ-PSO outperforms the state-of-the-art PSO variants.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates a novel method combining Scalable Evolution Strategies (S-ES) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). S-ES, named for its excellent scalability, was popularised with demonstrated performance comparable to state-of-the-art policy gradient methods. However, S-ES has not been tested in conjunction with HRL methods, which empower temporal abstraction thus allowing agents to tackle more challenging problems. We introduce a novel method merging S-ES and HRL, which creates a highly scalable and efficient (compute time) algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed method benefits from S-ES&#39;s scalability and indifference to delayed rewards. This results in our main contribution: significantly higher learning speed and competitive performance compared to gradient-based HRL methods, across a range of tasks.},

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimization has been extensively noticed for its fast convergence speed with few parameters. However, it would be plagued by the premature convergence only affected by the global particles. In this study, Composite Proactive Particles in Swarm Optimization (Co-PPSO) is proposed. In Co-PPSO, the composite strategy framework is embedded into Proactive Particles in Swarm Optimization (PPSO), that is, three learning strategies are proposed to evaluate their differences and select the most suitable one for each particle. In addition, an elite group is constructed to make the particles jump out of the situation that they are only affected by the global best one in the particle swarm, and further improve the convergence accuracy. CEC2022 competition of single objective bound-constrained numerical optimization is employed to test the effect of 10- $D$ and 20- $D$ optimization, and four well-known PSO variants were used for comparison. The experimental results show that the Co-PPSO has certain competitiveness to improve premature convergence.},

  abstract  = {Partial differential equations provide accurate models for many physical processes, although their derivation can be challenging, requiring a fundamental understanding of the modeled system. This challenge can be circumvented with the data-driven algorithms that obtain the governing equation only using observational data. One of the tools commonly used in search of the differential equation is the evolutionary optimization algorithm. In this paper, we seek to improve the existing evolutionary approach to data-driven partial differential equation discovery by introducing a more reliable method of evaluating the quality of proposed structures, based on the inclusion of the automated algorithm of partial differential equations solving. In terms of evolutionary algorithms, we want to check whether the more computationally challenging fitness function represented by the equation solver gives the sufficient resulting solution quality increase with respect to the more simple one. The approach includes a computationally expensive equation solver compared with the baseline method, which utilized equation discrepancy to define the fitness function for a candidate structure in terms of algorithm convergence and required computational resources on the synthetic data obtained from the solution of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.},

  abstract  = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms can be categorized into three basic groups: domination-based, decomposition-based, and indicator-based algorithms. Hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which combine algorithms from these groups, are gaining increased popularity in recent years. This is because hybrid algorithms can compensate for the drawbacks of the basic algorithms by adding different operators and structures that complement each other. This paper introduces a hybrid-multi objective evolutionary algorithm (R2-HMEWO) that applies hybridization in the form of structure and operators. R2-HMEWO is based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and equilibrium optimizer (EO). Elite individuals of WOA and EO are selected from a repository based on the R2-indicator and shifted density estimation-based method. In order to improve solutions&#39; diversity, a reference points method is devised to select next-generation individuals. The proposed multi-objective algorithm is evaluated on 19 benchmark test problems (ZDT, DTLZ, and CEC009) and compared with six state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms (NSGA-III, NSGA-II, MOEA/D, MOMBI-II, MOEA/IGD-NS, and dMOPSO). Based on the inverted generational distance (IGD) metric (mean of 25 independent runs), R2-HMEWO outperformed other algorithms on 14 out of 19 test problems and revealed a highly competitive performance on the other test problems. Also, R2-HMEWO performed statistically significant better than MOEA/D and dMOPSO in 15/19 and 14/19 test problems, respectively ( $p &amp;lt; 0.05$ ), and reached significant performance in 4 test problems (from ZDT and CEC09) compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with an advanced adjustment of stabilization sequences for complex chaotic systems by means of meta-evolutionary approaches in the form of a preliminary study. In this study, a two-dimensional discrete-time dynamic system denoted as Duffing map, also called Holmes map, was used. In general, the Duffing oscillator model represents a real system in the field of nonlinear dynamics. For example, an excited model of a string choosing between two magnets. There are many articles on the stabilization of various chaotic maps, but attempts to stabilize the Duffing map, moreover, for higher orbits, are rather the exception. In the case of period four, this is a novelty. This paper presents several approaches to obtaining stabilizing perturbation sequences. The problem of stabilizing the Duffing map turns out to be difficult and is a good challenge for metaheuristic algorithms, and also as benchmark function. The first approach is the optimal parameterization of the ETDAS model using multi-restart Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm na Genetic Algorithm (GA). The second approach is to use the symbolic regression procedure. A perturbation model is obtained using Genetic Programming (GP). The third approach is two-level optimization, where the best GP model is subsequently optimized using NM and GA algorithms. A novelty of the approach is also the effective use of the objective function, precisely in relation to the process of optimization of higher periodic paths.},

  abstract  = {The structure design of robotic arms is of great importance on completing industrial tasks successfully. This is a typical multi-task optimization problem when considering different constraints as different tasks. However, mainstream methods for multi-task optimization such as evolutionary multitasking and Multi-task MAP-Elites algorithms tend to encounter problems such as high computational cost and slow convergence when solving large-scale robotic arm tasks. To this end, this paper proposes a new framework based on the MAP-Elites algorithms for solving large-scale robot arm design tasks, called Multi-task MAP-Elites with Knowledge Transfer (MMKT). Specifically, this paper designs the group-based knowledge transfer process for large-scale task optimization in which all tasks are classified into different groups according to their similarity to generate multiple knowledge transfer areas; and knowledge transfer strategies are designed to enhance the quality of solutions with low fitness value. We test the effectiveness of the MMKT framework in planar robotic arm experiments (2000, 5000, and 10,000 tasks; 10, 15-dimensional search space). The experimental results prove that the MMKT outperforms the MME, CMA-ES, and classical ES algorithms.},

In an expensive multi-objective optimization problem, it is required to obtain a solution set that approximates the Pareto front with an extremely small number of function evaluations. We often know some good solutions in advance when dealing with optimization problems. In this case, instead of generating solutions from scratch, generating solutions from known good solutions can be a shortcut for optimization. The proposed method estimates the Pareto front and Pareto set using the response surface methodology with existing non-dominated solutions as the supervised data. The proposed method selects a subset of objective vectors on the estimated Pareto front and obtains the subset as the solution set. Experimental results using DTLZ and WFG test suites show that the proposed method works well even with only ten non-dominated solutions and 150 function evaluations.},

  abstract  = {We propose a factored evolutionary framework for multi-objective optimization that can incorporate any multi-objective population based algorithm. Our framework, which is based on Factored Evolutionary Algorithms, uses overlapping subpopulations to increase exploration of the objective space; however, it also allows for the creation of distinct subpopulations as in co-operative co-evolutionary algorithms (CCEA). We apply the framework with the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), resulting in Factored NSGA-II. We compare NSGA-II, CC-NSGA-II, and F-NSGA-II on two different versions of the multi-objective knapsack problem. The first is the classic binary multi-knapsack implementation introduced by Zitzler and Thiele, where the number of objectives equals the number of knapsacks. The second uses a single knapsack where, aside from maximizing profit and minimizing weight, an additional objective tries to minimize the difference in weight of the items in the knapsack, creating a balanced knapsack. We further extend this version to minimize volume and balance the volume. The proposed 3-to-5 objective balanced single knapsack problem poses a difficult problem for multi-objective algorithms. Our results indicate that the non-dominated solutions found by F-NSGA-II tend to cover more of the Pareto front and have a larger hypervolume.},

We use the Blocking Job Shop Scheduling Problem (BJSSP) as a study case. Our approach aims to learn an efficient branching and selection process by training a model using small and medium BJSSP benchmarks. For each benchmark, two phases are used. First, we train the model using a small set of solutions provided by a metaheuristic to detect similar features among good solutions. Therefore, generating branching and selection roles. After that, we apply these roles to solve these instances optimally. The obtained results show the effectiveness of our proposed learning-based selection by achieving performance results near the best B&amp;B implementation for BJSSP known to us.},

  abstract  = {Heuristic optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) depend on their parameters to achieve good performance on a given class of problems. Some modifications of heuristic algorithms aim to adapt those parameters during the optimization process. We present a framework to design such adaptation strategies using continuous fuzzy feedback control. Our framework, which is not tied to a particular algorithm, provides us with a simple interface where probes are sampled in the optimization process and parameters are fed back. The process of turning probes into parameters uses fuzzy logic rule sets, where the design of rules aims to maximize performance on a training benchmark. This meta-optimization is achieved by a Bayesian Optimizer (BO) with a Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) prior. The robustness of the control is also assessed on a validation benchmark.},

Because clinical applications of automated medical analysis are required to be reliable, robust and accurate, it is necessary to devise effective DNNs based models for medical applications. In this paper, we propose an ensemble framework of DNNs for the problem of medical image segmentation with a note that combining multiple models can obtain better results compared to each constituent one. We introduce an effective combining strategy for individual segmentation models based on swarm intelligence, which is a family of optimization algorithms inspired by biological processes. The problem of expensive computational time of the optimizer during the objective function evaluation is relieved by using a surrogate-based method. We train a surrogate on the objective function information of some populations and then use it to predict the objective values of each candidate in the subsequent populations. Experiments run on a number of public datasets indicate that our framework achieves competitive results within reasonable computation time.},

We use the actual data of items to be ordered, existing warehouses, and order records from customers. The target area is all over Japan. The task is to find the optimal distribution of one thousand items to eight warehouses. The problem has two objectives: minimizing the total shipping cost and minimizing the average number of stocked warehouses. The problem also has constraints, including the warehouse capacities and the maximum possible number of shipping from each warehouse. Since the commonly used uniform crossover tends to be destructive in this problem, we propose four crossovers for the problem: the item, the warehouse, the item uniform, the warehouse uniform crossovers. Experimental results show that the proposed item crossover is suited to solve this problem, and the obtained item stock allocations can significantly reduce shipping and stocking costs compared with a human-made allocation.},

An evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve these networks subject to two fitness measures: epidemic duration and epidemic spread through a population. With each infection there is a small probability of a new variant being generated. Being infected with one variant provides partial immunity to future variants. This allows us to evaluate the impact of each variant, a significant innovation in comparison to other work. The amount by which each variant was allowed to change had a significant impact upon epidemic spread.

The tolerance-based composite framework is proposed to select the appropriate topology for an individual at the same time. Specifically, local tolerance and global tolerance are predetermined, corresponding to the tolerance for individuals and the population, respectively. The topology involved in the evolution of the individual is replaced when the individual does not progress after successive iterations. The population that does not improve in effect after successive iterations are considered to have exceeded the global tolerance and the three population topologies are reconstructed. The CEC2022 competition on single objective bound-constrained numerical optimization and four state-of-the-art DE variants are employed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

B*-tree is a simple yet efficient representation that encodes the layout of modules in a compact and non-slicing structure. Several B*-tree variants and corresponding operators have been proposed to deal with non-slicing floorplanning. However, these operators are considered and applied individually. A collective manipulation of them remains missing. This study proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) that enables multiple crossover and mutation operators for solving the non-slicing floorplanning problem. In particular, the GA selects one crossover operator and one mutation operator from the pool of operators whenever reproducing an offspring. The probability for an operator to be selected is based on its empirical performance. This study conducts experiments on two well-known benchmarks to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the GA can achieve superior solution quality and efficiency on the non-slicing VLSI floorplanning.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic capacitated arc routing problem (DCARP) aims at re-scheduling the service plans of agents, such as vehicles in a city scenario, when dynamic events deteriorate the quality of the current schedule. Various algorithms have been proposed to solve DCARP instances in different dynamic scenarios. However, most existing work evaluated their algorithms&#39; performance based on artificially constructed dynamic environments instead of using more realistic traffic simulations which are built on actual traffic data. In this paper, we constructed a novel DCARP benchmarking framework based on the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) transportation simulation software, which allows to include real-world traffic environments for generating a set of DCARP instances from dynamic events, such as road congestion or task changes. The flexibility of the framework allows to develop DCARP optimization algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness more comprehensively. We use the benchmarking framework to generate 12 different dynamic instances using real-world traffic data of Dublin City. We then demonstrate the value of our framework by using these instances to compare our previously proposed hybrid local search algorithm (HyLS) with a state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. The generated benchmark scenarios indicate that HyLS is a very effective optimizer on DCARP scenarios with real traffic data for reducing the total service cost. They also demonstrate the importance of our DCARP benchmarking framework for the development and benchmarking of optimization algorithms in more realistic scenarios.},

  abstract  = {In real-world optimization scenarios, the problem instance that we are asked to solve may change during the optimization process, e.g., when new information becomes available or when the environmental conditions change. In such situations, one could hope to achieve reasonable performance by continuing the search from the best solution found for the original problem. Likewise, one may hope that when solving several problem instances that are similar to each other, it can be beneficial to “warm-start” the optimization process of the second instance by the best solution found for the first. However, it was shown in [Doerr et al., GECCO 2019] that even when initialized with structurally good solutions, evolutionary algorithms can have a tendency to replace these good solutions by structurally worse ones, resulting in optimization times that have no advantage over the same algorithms started from scratch. Doerr et al. also proposed a diversity mechanism to overcome this problem. Their approach balances greedy search around a best-so-far solution for the current problem with search in the neighborhood around the best-found solution for the previous instance. In this work, we first show that the re-optimization approach suggested by Doerr et al. reaches a limit when the problem instances are prone to more frequent changes. More precisely, we show that they get stuck on the dynamic LeadingOnes problem in which the target string changes periodically. We then propose a modification of their algorithm which interpolates between greedy search around the previous-best and the current-best solution. We empirically evaluate our smoothed re-optimization algorithm on LeadingOnes instances with various frequencies of change and with different perturbation factors and show that it outperforms both a fully restarted ( $1+1$ ) Evolutionary Algorithm and the re-optimization approach by Doerr et al.},

  abstract  = {Many games are reliant on creating new and engaging content constantly to maintain the interest of their player-base. One such example are puzzle games, in such it is common to have a recurrent need to create new puzzles. Creating new puzzles requires guaranteeing that they are solvable and interesting to players, both of which require significant time from the designers. Automatic validation of puzzles provides designers with a significant time saving and potential boost in quality. Automation allows puzzle designers to estimate different properties, increase the variety of constraints, and even personalize puzzles to specific players. Puzzles often have a large design space, which renders exhaustive search approaches infeasible, if they require significant time. Specifically, those puzzles can be formulated as quadratic combinatorial optimization problems. This paper presents an evolutionary algorithm, empowered by expert-knowledge informed heuristics, for solving logical puzzles in video games efficiently, leading to a more efficient design process. We discuss multiple variations of hybrid genetic approaches for constraint satisfaction problems that allow us to find a diverse set of near-optimal solutions for puzzles. We demonstrate our approach on a fantasy Party Building Puzzle game, and discuss how it can be applied more broadly to other puzzles to guide designers in their creative process.},

Dynamic Workflow Scheduling (DWS) aims to allocate dynamically arriving workflow tasks to cloud resources with optimal makespan, cost, load-balancing, etc. To timely allocate arriving tasks, heuristics have been used to solve the DWS problem in cloud environment. However, most of them are manually designed, considering a single objective, and use simple features to allocate resources to workflow tasks. In practice, multiple objectives should be considered to provide trade-off heuristics for users to choose from. In this paper, we propose a genetic programming hyper-heuristic (GPHH) approach to automatically generate multiple heuristics for multi-objective DWS.

  abstract  = {This work aimed to develop a personalized multi-objective recommender system for food diets, which seeks to suggest to the user a diverse list of four meals a day (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner). The efficient solutions are capable of simultaneously meeting a list of nutritional specifications and also minimizing both the concentration in a specific meal or food item and the total cost of acquisition and preparation. Efficient solutions are sought from the joint use of the NSGA-II and Gurobi optimization packages, after formulating the diet problem as a bilevel optimization: a combinatorial and multi-objective problem at the upper level – which food items from each category (the available food categories and the categories allocated to each of the four meals are defined in advance) should make up the diet – and a mathematical programming problem at the lower level – what is the optimal amount of the selected food items to compose the diet, given nutritional constraints. As Gurobi does not operate directly with a multi-objective optimization perspective, its lower-level objective function involves maximizing the total energy of the daily diet. Experimental results, considering fictitious food costs, show that NSGA-II and Gurobi operate in synergy, providing a diverse list of menus for the four daily meals, thus making a valuable approximation of the Pareto frontier. The distinctive aspect of this multi-objective bilevel solution to the diet problem, then, resides in the supply of diverse and, at the same time, efficient candidate solutions, in the sense of achieving the Pareto frontier and being scattered along its extension.},

How to model the interaction process between individuals by analyzing the relationship of their intentions, emotions, and actions at the cognitive level is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive framework of individual interaction. The core of the framework is that individuals achieve interaction through external action driven by their inner intention. Based on this idea, the interactions between individuals can be constructed by establishing relationships between the intention, emotion and action. Furthermore, we conduct analysis on the interaction between individuals and give a reasonable explanation for the predicting results. To verify the effectiveness of the framework, we reconstruct a dataset and propose three tasks as well as the corresponding baseline models, including action abduction, emotion prediction and action generation. The novel framework shows an interesting perspective on mimicking the mental state of human beings in cognitive science.},

Artificial neural networks are a powerful tool for approximation, and the physics-based functional can be the natural loss for a machine learning method. In this paper, we focus on the loss that may take non-linear fluid properties and mass forces into account. We modified the energy-based variational principle and determined the constraints on its unknown functions that implement boundary conditions. We explored artificial neural networks as an option for loss minimization and the approximation of the unknown functions. We compared the obtained results with the known solutions. The proposed method allows modeling non-Newtonian fluids flow including blood, synthetic oils, paints, plastic, bulk materials, and even rheomagnetic fluids.

  abstract  = {Many real-world optimization problems involve time-consuming fitness evaluation. To reduce the computational cost of expensive evaluations, researchers have been developing surrogate models to approximate the objective function values of unevaluated candidate solutions. However, most of the research has been developed for continuous optimization problems, while only a few of them address surrogate modeling for expensive multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs). COPs have inherently different challenges than continuous optimization. For example, (i) many COPs have categorical and nominal decision variables; (ii) they often require the combination of both global and local search mechanisms; and (iii) some of them have constraints that make them NP-hard problems, which makes them even more difficult to solve with a reasonable number of fitness evaluations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm that combines the decomposition-based algorithm MOEA/D, Tabu Local Search, and Random Forest as a surrogate model to approximate the objective function of unevaluated individuals on multi-objective COPs. Experiments were conducted on constrained and unconstrained well-known multi-objective combinatorial optimization benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms without violating the restrictions in the number of objective function evaluations, which indicates that it may be suitable for real-world expensive multi-objective COPs.},

The optimisation tasks consider the average proteins&#39; hydrophobicity, their solubility and the probability of being generated by a defined functional Hidden Markov Model profile.

  abstract  = {Intrusion detection systems (IDS) generate a large number of false alerts which makes it difficult to inspect true positives. Hence, alert prioritization plays a crucial role in deciding which alerts to investigate from an enormous number of alerts that are generated by IDS. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) off-policy method has shown to achieve better results for alert prioritization as compared to other state-of-the-art methods. However, DDPG is prone to the problem of overfitting. Additionally, it also has a poor exploration capability and hence it is not suitable for problems with a stochastic environment. To address these limitations, we present a soft actor-critic based DRL algorithm for alert prioritization (SAC-AP), an off-policy method, based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework that aims to maximize the expected reward while also maximizing the entropy. Further, the interaction between an adversary and a defender is modeled as a zero-sum game and a double oracle framework is utilized to obtain the approximate mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE). SAC-AP finds robust alert investigation policies and computes pure strategy best response against opponent&#39;s mixed strategy. We present the overall design of SAC-AP and evaluate its performance as compared to other state-of-the art alert prioritization methods. We consider defender&#39;s loss, i.e., the defender&#39;s inability to investigate the alerts that are triggered due to attacks, as the performance metric. Our results show that SAC-AP achieves up to 30\% decrease in defender&#39;s loss as compared to the DDPG based alert prioritization method and hence provides better protection against intrusions. Moreover, the benefits are even higher when SAC-AP is compared to other traditional alert prioritization methods including Uniform, GAIN, RIO and Suricata.},

Unfortunately, the manual definition of misclassification costs is still a very complicated task, especially with the lack of domain knowledge. To deal with the issue of costs&#39; uncertainty, some researchers proposed the use of intervals instead of scalar values. This way, each cost would be delimited by two bounds. Nevertheless, the definition of these bounds remains as a very complicated and challenging task. Recently, some researches proposed the use of genetic programming to simultaneously build classification trees and search for optimal costs&#39; bounds. As for any classification tree there is a whole search space of costs&#39; bounds, we propose in this paper a bi-level evolutionary approach for interval-based cost-sensitive classification tree induction where the trees are constructed at the upper level while misclassification costs intervals bounds are optimized at the lower level. This ensures not only a precise evaluation of each tree but also an effective approximation of optimal costs intervals bounds. The performance and merits of our proposal are shown through a detailed comparative experimental study on commonly used imbalanced benchmark data sets with respect to several existing works.},

In this paper, the literature is enriched by introducing a new mating operator that harnesses the stochastic nature of quantum computation to evolve individuals in a classical genetic workflow. This new approach, named Quantum Mating Operator, acts as a multi-parent operator that identifies alleles&#39; frequency patterns from a collection of individuals selected by means of conventional selection operators, and encodes them through a quantum state. This state is successively mutated and measured to generate a new classical chromosome.

  abstract  = {It is no secret that optimisation is a popular topic in any practical engineering application. Similarly, Metaheuristics (MHs) are a fairly standard approach for solving optimisation problems due to their success, flexibility, and simplicity. However, it is seldom easy to find a solver from the overpopulation of metaheuristics that adequately deals with a given problem. For that reason, the solver selection is even considered an additional problem in many optimisation scenarios. This work investigates the Metaheuristic Composition Optimisation Problem, which involves designing heuristic-based procedures that solve continuous optimisation problems. Therefore, we propose two novel and still simple methodologies based on transfer learning to facilitate the automatic generation of population-based and metaphor-less MHs by using search operators from the literature. To represent these solvers, we adopt our previously proposed unfolded MH model. The first strategy deals with the problem dynamically, building the sequence while solving the low-level problem. In contrast, the second one does it statically by generating the whole candidate sequence before implementing it. Results provide us with information to prove the feasibility of these approaches via experiments using 32 problems with four different characteristic groups and four dimensionalities and varying the number of agents (30, 50, and 100) employed by the search operators. We also remark that one can compare these two methodologies on performance, but we emphasise their potential usage depending on the general application environment.},

Recent research has focused on the study of Boolean functions that satisfy properties on restricted sets of inputs due to their importance in the development of the FLIP stream cipher. In this paper, we consider one such property, perfect balancedness, and investigate the use of Genetic Programming (GP) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to construct Boolean functions that satisfy this property along with a good nonlinearity profile. We formulate the related optimization problem and define two encodings for the candidate solutions, namely the truth table and the weightwise balanced representations. Somewhat surprisingly, the results show that GA with the weightwise balanced representation outperforms GP with the classical truth table phenotype in finding highly nonlinear Weightwise Perfectly Balanced (WPB) functions. This is in stark contrast to previous findings on the evolution of balanced Boolean functions, where GP always performs best.},

  abstract  = {Algorithms relating the amount of population&#39;s diversity to the elapsed period of execution have yielded important improvements. Particularly, schemes with a gradual shift from exploration to exploitation have excelled in several areas of Evolutionary Algorithms. A fairly recent method that applies this design principle is the Genetic Programming variant with Dynamic Management of Diversity (GP-DMD). GP-DMD applies a diversity-based replacement strategy that takes into account a user-defined function or policy that sets the amount of diversity desired in the population. Despite the improvements attained by GP-DMD, it is unable to precisely follow the user-defined policy in some cases. This calls into question its ability to perform a gradual shift from exploration to exploitation and hinders its extension to develop more complex dynamic and adaptive algorithms. This paper proposes the Genetic Programming variant with Controlled Dynamic Management of Diversity (GP-CDMD) which incorporates a novel replacement strategy that aims to improve its tracking capabilities. This is done through a probabilistic selection that takes into account the desired amount of diversity to restrict the diversity of the population. Results in the Symbolic Regression benchmark problem show a significant improvement in the tracking error, which results in features of the dynamics of the population that are more similar to the expected ones. This achievement facilitates the design of more complex diversity-based dynamic and adaptive optimizers and allows for better analyses on the implications of diversity in the GP area.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, center-based sampling has demonstrated impressive results to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of meta-heuristic algorithms. The strategy of the center-based sampling can be utilized at either or both the operation and/or population level. Despite the overall efficiency of the center-based sampling in population-based algorithms, utilization at operation level requires customizing the strategy for a specific algorithm which degrades the scheme&#39;s generalization. In this paper, we have proposed a population-level center-based sampling method which is operation independent and correspondingly can be embedded in any population-based optimization algorithm. In this study, we applied the proposed scheme for Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to enhance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the algorithm. We cluster candidate solutions and inject the centroid-based samples into the population to increase the overall quality of the population and thus decrease the risk of premature convergence and stagnation. By a high chance, the center-based samples are effectively generated in the promising regions of the search space. The proposed method has been benchmarked by employing CEC-2017 benchmark test suite on dimensions 30, 50, and 100. The results clearly indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme, and a detailed results analysis is provided.},

  abstract  = {Large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LSMOPs) refer to optimization problems with multiple con-flicting optimization objectives and hundreds or even thousands of decision variables. A key point in solving LSMOPs is how to balance exploration and exploitation so that the algorithm can search in a huge decision space efficiently. Large-scale multi-objective evolutionary algorithms consider the balance between exploration and exploitation from the individual&#39;s perspective. However, these algorithms ignore the significance of tackling this issue from the perspective of decision variables, which makes the algorithm lack the ability to search from different dimensions and limits the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithm based on the attention mechanism, called (LMOAM). The attention mechanism will assign a unique weight to each decision variable, and LMOAM will use this weight to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation from the decision variable level. Nine different sets of LSMOP benchmarks are conducted to verify the algorithm proposed in this paper, and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our design.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling is a challenging combinatorial optimisation problem, that aims to optimise machine resources for producing jobs to meet some goals. There are two important kinds of decisions that the scheduling process needs to make under dynamic environments, i.e., the routing decision for machine assignment and the sequencing decision for operation ordering. Genetic programming hyper-heuristic has been successfully applied for solving the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem with the advantage of automat-ically evolving good scheduling heuristics. Parent selection is an important process for genetic programming, intending to select good individuals as parents to generate offspring for the next generation. Traditional genetic programming methods select parents for crossover based on only fitness (e.g., tournament selection). In this paper, a new parent selection (i.e., cluster selection) method is proposed to select parents not only with good fitness but also with different behaviours. The proposed cluster selection is combined with genetic programming hyper-heuristic to study whether considering different behaviours in parent selection will improve the effectiveness of the evolved scheduling heuristics. The experimental results show that increasing the number of unique behaviours in the population cannot help evolve effective scheduling heuristics. Further analysis shows that considering behaviour to select parents does increase the number of unique behaviours in the population. However, it gives individuals with poor fitness more probability to be selected to generate offspring. This might be the reason why the proposed method cannot outperform the baseline method.},

Besides the changes in the productive schemes and the evolution of the healthcare resources to new models, the accessibility of pedestrians belonging to this age range is grasping an increasing interest in urban planning processes. This work presents pre-liminary results of a framework that combines graph modeling and meta-heuristic optimization to inform decision makers in urban planning when deciding how to regenerate urban spaces taking into account pedestrian accessibility for the older people in urban areas with difficult orography. The goal of the framework is to decide where to deploy urban elements (mechanical ramps, escalators and lifts), so that an indirect measure of accessibility is improved while also accounting for the economical investment of the installation. We exploit the versatility of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to tackle the underlying optimization problem. Experimental results of a case study located in the city of Santander (Spain) show that the proposed framework can support urban planners when making decisions regarding the accessibility of the public space.},

Therefore, this article presents a surrogate assisted EDA with multi-acquisition functions. Firstly, a variable-width histogram is used as the global distribution model that focuses on promising areas. Next, the evaluated-free local search method improves the quality of new generation solutions. Fi-nally, model management with multiple acquisitions maintains global and local exploration preferences. Several commonly used benchmark functions with 20 and 50 dimensions are adopted to evaluate the proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art surrogate assisted evaluation algorithms (SAEAs) and Bayesian optimization method. In addition, a rover trajectories optimizing problem is used to verify the ability to solve complex problems.

These problems pose a challenge for researchers to design efficient algorithms that are capable of finding optimal solutions with the least budget. Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) proved its powerfulness as a metaheuristic algorithm through the large research body that used it to optimize different industrial and engineering tasks. Nevertheless, as with any meta-heuristic algorithm and according to the “No Free Lunch” theorem, SFS may suffer from immature convergence and local minima trap. Thus, to address these issues, a popular Differential Evolution variant called Success-History based Adaptive Differential Evolution (SHADE) is used to enhance SFS performance in a unique three-phase hybrid framework. Moreover, a local search is also incorporated into the proposed framework to refine the quality of the generated solution and accelerate the hybrid algorithm convergence speed. The proposed hybrid algorithm, namely eMpSDE, is tested against a diverse set of varying complexity optimization problems, consisting of well-known standard unconstrained unimodal and multimodal test functions and some constrained engineering design problems. Then, a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm is carried out with the recent state of art algorithms to validate its competitivity.},

In this paper, we aim to evaluate the usefulness of ELA features and identify features which are the most informative in automated algorithm performance prediction. The goal is to find a subset of features which are sufficient to train a reliable ML model for algorithm performance prediction, with reduced computational costs for calculating the ELA features. We focus on the performance prediction of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strat-egy (CMA-ES) algorithm on the COCO benchmark problems. The results showed that the number of ELA features that lead to a reliable algorithm performance prediction depends on the modular CMA-ES configuration under consideration.

  abstract  = {The Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) is a multi-agent artificial immune system designed for anomaly detection. The algorithm is composed of artificial dendritic cell agents that process timestamped stream data. The lifespan of a cell agent is determined by its migration threshold, which influences the algorithm&#39;s dynamics significantly. The migration threshold is fixed during cell initialisation which limits the performance on various problems. This work proposes a dynamic migration threshold adjustment mechanism by mapping the population to a 2D grid and using Von Neumann Neighbourhoods to adapt this parameter at run time. This forms a novel algorithm variant termed ‘twoDCA’, implemented using the Repast Simphony agent based java API. This new algorithm is applied on synthetic stream data using a sin function generator with two different ways of migration threshold parameter generation. The experimental results show that the introduction of the Von Neumann Neigh-bourhoods has led to a statistically significant impact on certain behaviours of the algorithm. In particular, the great dynamics of twoDCA is realised by carrying forward the updated migration thresholds between cell reincarnations. The twoDCA is readily applicable to 2D data streams, which will diversify the range of applications substantially to which the algorithm can be applied and yields opportunities to add learning components to the core functionality of the algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous Optical Navigation is essential for the proximity operations of space missions to asteroids that usually have irregular gravity fields. One core component of this navigation strategy is the Image Processing (IP) algorithm that extracts optical observables from images captured by the spacecraft&#39;s on-board camera. Among these observables, the centroid of the asteroid is important to determine the position between the spacecraft and the body, which is the focus of this research. However, the performance of standard IP algorithms is affected and constrained by the features of the images, such as the shape of the asteroid, the illumination conditions and the presence of additional bodies, therefore, the quality of the extracted optical observables is influenced. To address the latter two challenges, this paper develops a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based IP algorithm and applies it to the Early Characterization Phase (ECP) of the European Space Agency&#39;s HERA mission with the target body of binary asteroid Didymos. This algorithm is capable of estimating the centroid of the primary body successfully with high accuracy and without being affected by the presence of the secondary body or the illumination in the input images. In addition, it can also estimate the centroid of the secondary body when the two bodies are in the same image, which increases the robustness of the overall navigation strategy.},

The goal of this paper is to give a public image dataset which named $N$ tBC consisting of Nantong blue calico patterns and provide a baseline result for the recognition of Nantong blue calico patterns. In this paper, we perform several baseline experiments on the NtBC dataset, including handcrafted and deep feature based classification methods. we compare some handcrafted methods and four kinds of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including ResNet-50, AlexNet, GoogLeNet-V1 and VGGNet-16. Experimental results show that ResNet-50 yields an accuracy of 93.8\% in the recognition performance, which shows that it is efficient to classify blue calico patterns through deep learning methods. As a consequence, this result provides the current best baseline result for Nantong blue calico image recognition.

Prototypes are also tested on several different and a-priori unknown operating conditions, so we cannot apply a purely supervised model to detect potential anomalies of sensors and, moreover, we have to take into account a covariate shift because measurements drift continuously day by day. We continuously train a RNN (daily) to build a virtual sensor from other sensors and we compare the predicted signal vs the real signal to raise (in case) an anomaly. Furthermore, KL is used to estimate the overlap between the input distributions available at training time and the ones seen at test time, and thus the confidence level of the prediction. Finally we implement an end-to-end system to automatically train and evaluate the models. The paper presents the system and reports the application to a test campaign of about five hundred sensors.},

For instance, it is possible to generate viable recovery gait strategies reaching 2.5 cm, (10 cm.) deviation on average with respect to a commanded direction with 40 – 60 (20) evaluations/trials.

  abstract  = {To train a classifier on a specific domain, often called the target domain, we need labeled data. However, there might be non availability of the labeled data in this domain. In this scenario, we look for a related domain called the source domain, where availability of labeled data is abundant in number. The lack of availability of labeled data in the target domain poses a serious problem and several domain adaptation (DA) approaches have been put forward to cope up with this problem. Existing DA methods seek a subspace common between both the domains (source and target domains) where the distribution difference is minimal and perform manual parameter sensitivity tests to find apposite value of each parameter for their respective objective function. However, for distorted original data, obtaining a common subspace is a challenging task and condensing manual parameter sensitivity testing is also costly and a time-intensive process. To overcome these challenges, some DA methods consider particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. However, none of the existing DA methods simultaneously tackle these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we put forward a method called Feature and Parameter Selection approach for visual Domain Adaptation (FPSDA) to address these challenges. In FPSDA, a suitable subset of features across both the domains and an apposite value of each parameter are simultaneously chosen using a PSO approach. Moreover, to guide the PSO, the objective functions of Joint Geometrical and Statistical Alignment (JGSA) [1] method along with preserving original similarity of data is considered as an objective function for our proposed approach. Full Scale experiments on benchmark datasets for cross-domain adaptation verify that FPSDA performs better than many state-of-the-art classic machine learning and domain adaptation approaches.},

  abstract  = {The blended-wing-body underwater glider (BWBUG) is a new type of underwater vehicle that has been applied in natural resource exploration with great success. Compared with conventional torpedo shapes, BWBUG&#39;s shape has a higher lift-to-drag ratio (LDR), so its shape design has become a research focus of ocean engineering in recent years. It is noteworthy that the traditional design process assumes no prior knowledge and starts from scratch. However, since problems rarely exist in isolation, solving the shape problem of a traditional glider may provide useful information, but the disparity in design space impedes information transmission. This paper presents a heterogeneous transfer optimization method for glider shape, which consists of four parts: simulation, image processing, manifold learning, and the evolution algorithm. The simulation&#39;s goal is to create pressure and velocity clouds. Manifold learning will use the information from cloud maps to create a low-dimensional feature space. The information mapped in low-dimensional space will be used to assist evolutionary algorithms in searching for optimal solutions. The proposed method was tested for the shape optimization problem of a BWBUG, and the results show that knowledge learned from different but related problem domains is potentially beneficial to the new design.},

  abstract  = {Plagiarism detection is a challenging task, aiming to identify similar items in two documents. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatic plagiarism detection that combines BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers) word embedding, attention mechanism-based long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm for weight initialisation. BERT is used to pretrain deep bidirectional representations in all layers, while the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with only one extra output layer without significant changes in architecture. Deep learning algorithms often use the random weighting method for initialisation, followed by gradient-based optimisation algorithms such as back-propagation for training, making them susceptible to getting trapped in local optima. To address this, population- based metaheuristic algorithms such as DE can be used. We propose an improved DE algorithm with a clustering-based mutation operator, where first a winning cluster of candidate solutions is identified and a new updating strategy is then applied to include new candidate solutions in the current population. The proposed DE algorithm is used in LSTM, attention mechanism, and feed- forward neural networks to yield the initial seeds for subsequent gradient-based optimisation. We compare our proposed model with conventional and population-based approaches on three datasets (SNLI, MSRP and SemEval2014) and demonstrate it to give superior plagiarism detection performance.},

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) fits this type of problem well because it allows reaching results in short optimization times. Furthermore, applying this metaheuristic to the problem is easy compared to other available optimization tools. In this work, we provide a sensitivity analysis of the impact of different parameters of PSO in solving an energy community market problem.

  abstract  = {Machine learning techniques are widely used for discovering meaningful patterns and classifying real-world data. These datasets may be large and complex, so feature selection is the primary strategy for reducing the dimension of the data, with the general goal of reducing the amount of redundant and disruptive features in a dataset for fast and efficient data analysis without sacrificing significant predictive model performance. Due to exponentially high search space, feature selection is a complex optimization problem. It is practically impossible to evaluate all of the feature subsets manually. Nature-inspired optimization is widely used for this due to its inherent capability, and it solves feature selection tasks as a single objective optimization problem. However, the main issue is their frequent premature convergence, which results in an inadequate contribution to data mining. Even the majority of existing optimizers are not adaptive in nature. As a result, in this paper, we proposed QL-SSA, which combines Reinforcement Learning and the Squirrel Search Algorithm, making it more adaptive and robust for feature selection by maintaining a good balance between exploration and exploitation steps. It is tested on 20 real-world benchmark datasets using two classifiers, and the results show that it outperforms the baseline optimizer in most cases.},

For this purpose, the analysis of techniques that decrease the side lobe levels of the antenna radiation patterns are of great interest. Traditional methods tend to only be applied to arrays of equally spaced antennas. One possible way to overcome this obstacle is to apply bioinspired algorithms. The present work compares the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) bioinspired algorithms and its opposition-based learning (OBL) variation to Kaiser, Dolph-Chebyshev and uniform windows, classically used for the improvement of transmitted power. The analysis reached SLL values of −54.92 dB and −44.16 dB for an array of 10 and 16 elements respectively. According to the statistical analysis, OBL provides the best results. OPSO and ODE were the most robust algorithms and OPSO performs better for a 16 elements array, while ODE performs better for a 10 elements array.},

Previous work has shown the effectiveness of an ant colony optimization hyper-heuristic for solving scheduling and packing problems. One of the challenges with generation construction hyper-heuristics is the high processing times associated with creating new construction heuristics. While there has been research into using transfer learning to reduce the computational cost of genetic programming generation constructive hyper-heuristics, this has not been investigated for ant colony optimization generation construction hyper-heuristics. In fact to the knowledge of the authors transfer learning has not previously been investigated for ant colony optimization. In this study the knowledge transferred is the pheromone map. The maps are transferred from the source domain to the target domain, with the target domain being more complicated problem instances and the source domain simpler problem instances, which do not take as long to solve. The approach was evaluated on the movie scene scheduling problem, the one dimensional bin packing problem and the quadratic assignment problem. The study has shown that the use of transfer learning has reduced the computational cost drastically while maintaining the same performance for the more complex problems for the movie scene scheduling problem and the quadratic assignment problem. However, for the one dimensional bin packing problem while there is a reduction in computational cost, the quality of the solutions is worse. Future research will investigate the reason for this and evaluate transferring different types of knowledge at various points in the life cycle of ant colony optimization generation construction hyper-heuristics.},

  abstract  = {The emergence of variants of concern (VOC) has produced challenges in bringing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic under control, and has created obstacles in the ultimate transition to endemicity; indeed, the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, caused a wave of unprecedented levels of infection throughout the globe. Although the available COVID-19 vaccines offer significant protection from infection, hospitalization, and death, challenges in vaccine availability globally have limited the efficacy of mass inoculation in controlling viral spread. The present study utilizes an evolutionary strategies (ES)-inspired model to examine the effect of vaccination upon the emergence of viral variants. The kinetics of the evolution of an idealized RNA virus are modelled in the details of the mutation of an ES population, and the emergence of variants is formulated as an optimization problem. A binary fitness function is optimized such that it achieves a maximum upon the condition that a single viral genome exhibits the requisite number of mutations such that it may be considered a variant of concern. Results demonstrate that vaccination is extremely effective in delaying the emergence of viral variants, and that vaccination rates are highly correlated with delayed variant emergence ( $\mathrm{R}= 0.8399$ ) and requisite viral genetic diversity for consideration as a variant of concern ( $\mathrm{R}=0.8583$ ). Time to emergence of a variant of concern for 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, and 80\% vaccination rates of the population are $17.46\pm 1.61$ generations, $20.51\pm 2.12$ generations, $33.67\pm 5.18$ generations, and $226.12\pm 114.41$ generations, respectively. It is shown that the delay in emergence of a variant of concern with higher vaccination rates may be attributable to a decrease in the number of infections, thus requiring a higher degree of genetic diversity in the viral genome.},

We found that the recently proposed $(1+(\lambda, \lambda))$ genetic algorithm solves certain instances of this problem, including those that are hard to heuristic solvers, much faster than simpler mutation-only evolutionary algorithms. Our theoretical analysis shows that there exists an intricate interplay between the problem structure and the way crossovers are used. It results in a drift towards the points where finding the next improvement is much easier. While this condition is formally proven only on one class of instances and for a subset of search points, experiments show that it is responsible for performance improvements in a much larger range of cases.},

A total of twenty-nine benchmark functions and six performance measures were implemented to help with this task. The experiments were run against five different environment types to determine whether the MGPSO can solve problems with various spatial and temporal severities. The best control parameter update strategy was then compared with other state-of-the-art dynamic multi-objective optimisation algorithms (DMOAs).

  abstract  = {Evolutionary algorithms are a well-known optimisation technique, especially for non-convex, multi-modal optimisation problems. Their capability of adjusting to different search spaces and tasks by choosing the suitable encoding and operators has led to their widespread use in various application domains. However, application domains sometimes come with difficulties like fitness functions that can not be evaluated or not more than a few times. In these situations, surrogate functions or approximative fitness functions allow the evolutionary algorithm to work despite this complication. Still, using approximative fitness functions comes with a price: The fitness value is no longer correct for every individual, and the algorithm can not know which value to trust. However, statistical methods yield knowledge about the preciseness of the approximation. We propose using this knowledge to adapt the fitness value to ease the effects of the approximative nature. We choose to use the information given in the density of the training data, which has computational merits over the use of other techniques like cross-validation or prediction intervals. We evaluate our method on four well-known benchmark functions and achieve good optimisation success and computation time results.},

  abstract  = {Classification systems are often deployed in resource-constrained settings where labels must be assigned to inputs on a budget of time, memory, etc. Budgeted, sequential classifiers (BSCs) address these scenarios by processing inputs through a sequence of partial feature acquisition and evaluation steps with early-exit options. This allows for an efficient evaluation of inputs that prevents unneeded feature acquisition. To approximate an intractable combinatorial problem, current approaches to budgeted classification rely on well-behaved loss functions that account for two primary objectives (processing cost and error). These approaches offer improved efficiency over traditional classifiers but are limited by analytic constraints in formulation and do not manage additional performance objectives. Notably, such methods do not explicitly account for an important aspect of real-time detection systems—the fraction of “accepted” predictions satisfying a confidence criterion imposed by a risk-averse monitor. We propose a problem-specific genetic algorithm to build budgeted, sequential classifiers with confidence-based reject options. Three objectives—accuracy, processing time/cost, and coverage—are considered. The algorithm emphasizes Pareto efficiency while accounting for a notion of aggregate performance via a unique scalarization. Experiments show our method can quickly find globally Pareto optimal solutions in very large search spaces and is competitive with existing approaches while offering advantages for selective, budgeted deployment scenarios.},

However, a special type of network-oriented MOPs, termed network multiobjective optimization problems (NMOPs), remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we put forth a general formulation for NMOPs, and propose the network decomposition-combination multiobjective optimization method (NDCMOM) for solving them. NDCMOM adopts a network decomposition mechanism, which breaks the NMOP down to a series of MOPs with smaller scales. The solutions to the NMOP can be obtained by combining the solutions to these smaller-scale MOPs. This decomposition-combination mechanism significantly improves the optimization efficiency. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed NDCMOM outperforms the state-of-the-art MOEAs on large-scale NMOPs.},

Distal control architectures, which combine pre-coded basic behaviors into a (probabilistic) finite state machine offer a promising solution to this problem. In this paper, we enhance a Mixed-Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (MDPSO) algorithm with an Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) scheme to automatically synthesize distal control architectures. We benchmark MDPSO-OCBA&#39;s performance against the original MDPSO as well as the Iterated F-Race (IRACE) and the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithms on both a benchmark function with different noise levels and design problems of distal control architectures. More specifically, we evaluate the algorithms using high-fidelity simulations in three increasingly challenging scenarios involving parallel and sequential tasks. Additionally, the best performing controller generated in simulation by each optimization algorithm is compared with a manually designed solution and validated with physical experiments. The analysis on the benchmark function with different noise levels demonstrates MDPSO-OCBA&#39;s high robustness to noise. The comparison on the robotic control design problems shows that, without any meta-parameter tuning, MDPSO-OCBA is able to generate the best performing control architectures overall, closely followed by IRACE. They significantly outperform MADS for the more complex and noisier scenarios, resulting in competitive controllers in comparison to the manually designed one.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies the application of Machine Learning techniques in Planetary Defense. To quickly respond to an asteroid impact scenario, an Intelligent Decision Support System is proposed to automatically decide if a deflection mission is necessary, and then select the most effective deflection strategy. This system consists of two sub-systems: the first one is named as Asteroid Impact Scenarios Identifier, and the second one is named as Asteroid Deflection Strategies Selector. The input to the Asteroid Impact Scenarios Identifier is the warning time, the orbital parameters and the diameter of the asteroid and the corresponding uncertainties. According to the Probability of Collision and the corresponding confidence, the output is the decision of action: the deflection is needed, no deflection is needed, or more measurements need to be obtained before making any decision. If the deflection is needed, the Asteroid Deflection Strategies Selector is activated to output the most efficient deflection strategy that offers the highest probability of success. The training dataset is produced by generating thousands of virtual impact scenarios, sampled from the real distribution of Near-Earth Objects. A robust optimization is performed, under mixed aleatory/epistemic uncertainties, with five different deflection strategies (Nuclear Explosion Device, Kinetic Impactor, Laser Ablation, Gravity Tractor and Ion Beam Shepherd). The robust performance indices are considered as the deflection effectiveness, which is quantified by the change of impact probability pre and post deflection. We demonstrate the capabilities of Random Forest, Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks at classifying impact scenarios and deflection strategies. Simulation results suggest that the proposed system can quickly provide decisions to respond to an asteroid impact scenario. Once trained, the Intelligent Decision Support System, does not require re-running expensive simulations and is, therefore, suitable for the rapid prescreening deflection options.},

  abstract  = {Probabilistic methods serve as the underlying frame-work of various machine learning techniques. When using these models, a central problem is that of computing the partition function, whose computation is intractable for many models of interest. Here, we present the first quantum-inspired method that is especially designed for computing fast approximations to the partition function. Our approach uses a novel hardware solver for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems that relies on evolutionary computation. The specialized design allows us to assess millions of candidate solutions per second, leading to high quality maximum a-posterior (MAP) estimates, even for hard instances. We investigate the expected run-time of our solver and devise new ultra-sparse parity constraints to combine our device with the WISH approximation scheme. A SIMD-like packing strategy further allows us to solve multiple MAP instances at once, resulting in high efficiency and an additional speed-up. Numerical experiments show that our quantum-inspired approach produces accurate and robust results. While pure software implementations of the WISH algorithm typically run on large compute clusters with hundreds of CPUs, our results are achieved on two FPGA boards which both consume below 10 Watts. Moreover, our results extend seamlessly to adiabatic quantum computers.},

In this work, we propose a generic ATFM framework based on multiobjective optimization for reducing lateral collision risk of the traffic ina given procedural airspace. T he proposed framework aims to optimize the flight level assignment f or a given set of flight plans such that t he lateral collision risk can be reduced. To achieve this goal, we formulate an optimization problem containing two partially conflicting o bjective functions.

In particular, it can be used to induce interpretable decision trees, with the advantage of allowing the practitioner to easily control the language by means of the grammar.

In particular, it only uses simple equality conditions and requires to encode feature names and values with numbers.

To simulate multi-agent migration patterns three path-finding mechanisms based on the classic A* algorithm was utilized: A*; A*, Ambush and Dendriform. Each makes different assumptions about group leadership in terms of their path generation. A* assumes a single leader for the migratory group: A*mbush allows the group to move in waves; and Dendriform allows the group to decompose and recompose into groups of arbitrary size with local leaders. Each mechanism required parameter weightings so that the simulated agents would interact realistically with their environment. Cultural Algorithms were employed to adjust the parameter weight categories in order to optimize the group movement under each of these leadership strategies. The three approaches were applied to the simulation of a real-world multi-agent system, the migration of large herd of caribou. The simulated migration was part of the Deepdive Virtual Reality system. In those simulations A* with a single planning agent emphasized nutrition at the expense of the other parameters. A*mbush learned to reduce nutrition slightly and while increasing its emphasis on risk and exploration. On the other hand, Dendriform emphasized overall effort since its planning more dynamic and required more concentration on local effort to be optimized.},

  abstract  = {Transfer evolutionary optimization (TrEO) has emerged as a computational paradigm to leverage related problem-solving information from various source tasks to boost convergence rates in a target task. State-of-the-art Tr EO algorithms have utilized a source-target similarity capture method with probabilistic priors that grants the ability to reduce negative transfers. A recent work makes use of an additional solution representation learning module to induce high ordinal correlation between source and target objective functions through source-to-target search space mappings, with the aim of promoting positive transfers between them. However, current implementations of this approach are found to be data-intensive - calling for all generated source data to be cached - leading to high storage costs in practice. As an alternative, this paper investigates the feasibility of a data-lean variant of the aforesaid approach, labeled as (1, G)-TrEO, in which only the first and final (Gth) generations of source data are used for solution representation learning and transfer. We conduct experimental analyses of (1, G)-TrEO using multi-objective benchmark functions as well as a practical example in vehicle crashworthiness design. Our results show that a simple data-lean transfer optimizer is able to achieve competitive performance. While this paper presents a first investigation of (1, G)-TrEO, we hope that the findings would inspire future forms of data-lean TrEO algorithms.},

  abstract  = {With the recent upsurge in the use of deep learning and other computationally expensive machine learning models, hyperparameter optimization has become a quite important and widely researched area of study. Genetic algorithms, a subclass of evolutionary algorithms, have proven to be an effective approach and have been widely used in recent years. However, efficiently exploring the domain of possible solutions remains a challenging, and often computationally-expensive task. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient hyperparameter optimization strategy based on a genetic algorithms variant: Biased Random-key Genetic Algorithms (BRKGA). One of the main challenges of BRKGA is its limited capacity to explore the domain surrounding a particular individual. Although good genes will be preserved by its bias property, these genes are copied as they are, and even if a better solution exists in the close neighborhood of a particular gene it might never be explored. We tackle this problem by adding an exploitation component at the end of every evolutionary step, further exploring the hyperparameter domain. Several computational experiments on eight different publicly available datasets were performed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to prove it is a significant improvement over its predecessor. The results show that our proposed method outperforms, in terms of the $F_{1}$ score of the resulting Artificial Neural Network, not only BRKGA but also other commonly used methods in most of the test cases.},

  abstract  = {In complex optimization problems, learning where to search is a difficult but critical decision for all search algorithms. Evolutionary computation methods also encounter a dilemma about where to explore or exploit. In this paper, a Monte-Carlo tree is constructed to guide evolutionary algorithms to search multiple promising regions simultaneously. In the Monte-Carlo tree model, a root node that contains all historical solutions represents the whole solution space. In each node of the tree, with k-means clustering method to partition solutions into different groups, group labels of the solutions are used to train support vector regression, which can learn a boundary to partition a region into different sub-regions. According to state values of nodes, reproduction operators of evolutionary algorithms are strengthened by selecting solutions in the most promising regions. From experimental results on multimodal problems, the proposed algorithm shows a competitive performance, which also indicates a great potential for applications to other kinds of optimization problems.},

These explanations are consistent with the way that an everyday person will explain an event, and have been shown to satisfy the ‘right to explanation’ of the European data regulations. Despite this, current work to generate counterfactual explanations either makes assumptions about the model being explained or utlises algorithms that perform suboptimally on continuous data. This work presents two novel algorithms to generate counterfactual explanations using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE). These are shown to provide effective post-hoc explanations that make no assumptions about the underlying model or data structure. In particular, PSO is shown to generate counterfactual explanations that utilise significantly fewer features to generate sparser explanations when compared to previous related work.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, one of the most relevant challenges of a data center is to keep its information secure. To avoid data leaks and other security problems, data centers have to manage vulnerabilities, including determining the higher-risk vulnerabilities to prioritize. However, the current literature is scarce in the proposal of intelligent methods for the complex problem of vulnerabilities prioritization. Depending on the adopted metrics, the priority could shift, compromising simple sorting-based approaches and impairing the utilization of conflicting risk assessment metrics. Unlike the related work, this study proposes a multi-objective method that uses user-chosen vulnerabilities assessment metrics to output a complete list of these vulnerabilities ranked by their risk and overall impact in the context of an organization. The method includes a multi-objective large-scale optimization problem representation, a novel population initialization scheme, an expressive fitness function, a post-optimization process, and a custom way to select the best solution among the non-dominated ones. The dataset used in the experiments contains anonymized real-world information about database vulnerabilities obtained from a private organization. The experiments&#39; results indicated that the proposed method can reduce the number of vulnerabilities needed to reach an organization&#39;s predefined security targets compared to the baselines simulating a security team&#39;s analysis. Multi-objective optimization achieved on average a 48,17\% reduction in the vulnerabilities needed to reach the organization&#39;s target values compared to the baselines.},

  abstract  = {Trusting an algorithmic decision is much easier if it is understood how it was achieved. Therefore, data mining algorithms with explainable abilities are preferred over complex models for critical applications. Rule-based algorithms are among the easiest data classification models to understand. However, as most interpretable models, rule-based algorithms do not provide the highest accuracy. The Attribute-based Decision Graph (AbDG) is a model to represent a labeled data set as a weighted graph over the attributes. When associated with a proper algorithm, AbDGs can be used for supervised data mining tasks. An important aspect of AbDGs is that the graph encompasses the original attribute values and their relationships, which makes it easily interpretable by extracting rules. The AbDG drawback is defining a suitable graph structure for a given data set. In previous works, the authors proposed GA-AbDG, a genetic algorithm to search for an AbDG by evolving its edge set, keeping the vertex set fixed. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm and genetic operators to evolve both, vertex and edge sets, enhancing the search space of possible AbDG structures. Moreover, we associate a rule-based classifier with the AbDG to achieve explainable results. Experimental results show the proposed method outperforms GA-AbDG and five other classical interpretable classification algorithms.},

The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.},

However, effects of perturbations in design variables i.e. robust optimization in terms of mutltifidlity optimization have yet to be investigated in detail. Typically robust optimization requires high number of function evaluations because of neighbourhood solution estimations. This study proposes a novel technique of multifidelity evolutionary optimization that incorporates robustness measures of optimum solutions involving iterative solvers of pre-converged simulations to reduce computational overhead. A probabilistic dominance based sorting mechanism is used to rank promising solutions of a generation where primary merit for sorting is worst case performance (WCP) of neighbourhood solutions of a solution of interest. Since estimation of WCP of neighbourhood solutions is computationally prohibitive, Kriging surrogate model is used for prediction. An artificial 1D multipeak multifidelity robust problem is formulated and the performance of proposed algorithm is illustrated with it. Afterwards, two additional mathematical functions and a practical engineering simulation problem of flapping wing kinematics have been solved. The results indicate the proposed algorithm is efficient to identify robust solutions in pre-converged simulations of iterative solvers.},

The first one establishes a link between the learning-based histogram model and the $\varepsilon$ -constrained method. Here, the constraint violation level of the $\varepsilon$ -constrained method is used to explore the smaller discontinuous parts and form a better statistical model. The second operation is the hybridization of the EDA with a mutation operator to generate offspring from both the global distribution information and the parent information. A benchmark is used to test the performance of the improved proposal. The results indicated that the proposed approach shows a better performance against other tested EAs.

  abstract  = {Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling has attracted widespread interest from scholars and industries due to its practical value. Genetic programming hyper-heuristic has achieved great success in automatically evolving effective scheduling heuristics to make real-time decisions (i.e., operation ordering and machine assignment) for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling. The design of the training set and fitness evaluation play key roles in improving the generalisation of the evolved scheduling heuristics. The commonly used strategies for improving the generalisation of learned scheduling heuristics include using multiple instances for evaluation at each generation or using a single instance but changing the instance at each new generation of the training process of genetic programming. However, using multiple instances is time-consuming, while changing a single instance at each new generation, potentially promising individuals that happen to underperform in one particular generation might be lost. To address this issue, this paper develops a genetic programming method with a multi-case fitness evaluation strategy, which is named GPMF to evolve the scheduling heuristics with better generalisation ability for the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem. The proposed multi-case fitness evaluation strategy divides one instance into multiple cases and uses the average value of the multi-case objectives as the fitness. Experimental results show that the proposed GPMF algorithm is significantly better than the baseline method in all the tested scenarios.},

Using the concept of consensus sequences, and comparing genotype change to phenotype change, we show how an SGA explores candidate solutions along a neutral network - Hamming-proximal bitstrings of similar fit-ness. Alongside mapping the normal functioning of an SGA, we monitor the formation of error thresholds “from above” by starting with a high mutation probability and slowly lowering it, during hundreds of thousands of generations. The formation of a stable consensus sequence is marked by a measurable upheaval in the dynamics of the population, leading to an efficient exploration of the search space in a short time. After the global optimum is found, we can still measure the degree of exploration the SGA performs on that neutral network, and observe punctuated equilibria. We use 11 numerical benchmark functions, along with the Royal Road Function, and a similar bit block Trap Function; the phenomena observed are largely similar on all of them, pointing to a generic behaviour of Genetic Algorithms, rather than problem particularities. Using a consensus sequence (a per-locus-mode chromosome) obscures quasispecies dynamics. This is why we use a per-locus-mean chromosome to measure information change between successive generations, and plot the number and maximal size of Quasispecies and Neutral Networks.},

Limiting by the maximum waiting time threshold, this study aims to determine the number and locations of established facilities. The first objective function minimizes the facility establishment costs, while the second objective function is to minimize the aggregate traveling, waiting, and demand lost costs.

  abstract  = {The careful selection of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce loading, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediments, can substantially improve the water quality of water-sheds. This paper introduces the first implementation of a hybrid and customized evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) algorithm to improve the Chesapeake Bay Watershed&#39;s (CBW) water quality. To make the algorithm scalable, we inject a few solutions obtained using an integer programming algorithm (IPOPT) in the initial population of EMO. Also, a repair operator is applied to satisfy every equality constraint. Combining these approaches can find a set of non-dominated trade-off solutions from 1,012 variables (Tucker county in West Virginia) to a staggering 153,818 variable problem (the whole state of West Virginia). Furthermore, a pre-liminary analysis of obtained trade-off solutions finds interesting properties of BMP allocations, providing an optimistic picture of applying the proposed customized optimization algorithm in addressing other bigger states leading to the whole Chesapeake Bay watershed.},

  abstract  = {Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a compu-tationally expensive blackbox optimization problem to maximize the performance of a machine learning model by tuning the model hyperparameters. Conventionally, global search has been widely adopted rather than local search to address HPO. In this study, we investigate whether this conventional choice is reasonable by empirically comparing popular global and local search methods as applied to HPO problems. The numerical results demonstrate that local search methods consistently achieve results that are comparable to or better than those of the global search methods, i.e., local search is a more reasonable choice for HPO. We also report the findings of detailed analyses of the experimental data conducted to understand how each method functions and the objective landscapes of HPO.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) solves multiple optimization tasks meanwhile in the framework of evolutionary algorithm, aiming at improving the solving performance on each task via knowledge transfer among tasks. As one of the representative EMTO algorithms, multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) has attracted great attention and has been used to solve many optimization problems. However, most of MFEAs tend to suffer from premature convergence. To deal with this issue, this article designs a novel MFEA by integrating differential evolution, and a hybrid of global and local search strategies, named MFDE-GLS for short. Particularly, the global search strategy is based on an opposition-based learning and a Gaussian perturbation to improve the search ability and maintain population diversity. A local search strategy is introduced by combining 1-dimension search and n-dimension search to accelerate the convergence. Moreover, a new environmental selection mechanism is developed to keep the elite individuals while maintaining the population diversity based on the affinity propagation clustering method. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on both single-objective and multi-objective multi-task benchmark problems to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

However, the cubic computation complexity is involved in building GPs. This paper proposes hyperparameters adaptive sharing based on transfer learning for scalable GPs to address the limitation. In this method, the hyperparameters across source tasks are adaptively shared to the target task by the linear predictor. This method can reduce the computation cost of building GPs without losing capability based on experimental analyses. The method&#39;s effectiveness is demonstrated on a set of benchmark problems.},

  abstract  = {We have recently proposed a novel framework of in vivo computation by transforming the early tumor detection into an optimization problem. In the framework, the tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) provides aided knowledge for the swarm-intelligence-assisted tumor targeting process. Our previous investigations are based on the hypothesis that the BGF landscape is time-invariant, which results in a static function optimization problem. However, the properties of internal environment, such as the flow state of body fluid, will bring about time-dependent variation of BGF. Thus, we focus on dynamic in vivo computation by considering different variation patterns of BGF in this paper. A computational intelligence strategy named “swarm-based learning strategy” is proposed for overcoming the turbulence of the fitness estimation caused by the BGF variation. The in silico experiments and statistical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. In addition, the above process is conducted in a three-dimensional search space, which is more realistic compared to the two-dimensional search space in our previous work.},

The number of different symbols that must be recognized in a score, such as the key, time signatures, tempo, dynamics, notes, alterations, duration, etc, as well as the different meanings some symbols may embody depending on the position in the score, such as a quarter that may mean notes C, D, E, …, makes OMR much harder challenge than Optical Character Recognition (OCR), particularly when dealing with handwritten scores for Computational Intelligence (CI) methods. This paper addresses this hard problem using deep learning based approaches, specif-ically Mask R-CNN, in a specific context: music students that write their scores in a ruled paper notebook when learning 4-part harmony. Preliminary results show that high accuracy levels are obtained, both during training+validation and also during tests, and this allows us to foresee new tools for students that could be combined with available CI methods for 4-part harmony learning.},

  abstract  = {The continuous use of satellite networks in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has accumulated a large amount of space debris. Given the actual state of the orbit, these debris are a threat to the active systems and to the feasibility of future operations in LEO. Now, Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions must be conducted to mitigate the debris through forced deorbitation. The best documented approaches for the ADR mission planning made use of metaheuristics, modeling the ADR as a complex variant of the TSP. However, these approaches usually fail to deal some of the ADR problem dynamics, such as large instances, mission constraints or the debris motion. In this paper we propose heuristic of continuous improvement on a genetic-based solution. Our work advances the state of the art by dealing with large real world instances, modeling all the constraints and considering the problem time dependence (motion). Experiments were conducted to evidence the improvements over the literature. With the ability of generating time-dependent results for scenarios with thousands of debris in a feasible time, our approach yielded missions 96.33\% more effective at the cleaning job than the present ones on the literature.},
