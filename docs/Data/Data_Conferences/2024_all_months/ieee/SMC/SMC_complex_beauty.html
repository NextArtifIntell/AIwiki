  abstract  = {Emotional stability, awareness, and attention may likely be enhanced by meditation and related techniques. Since meditation practitioners may need focus and engagement, virtual reality (VR) may be helpful. Even though there has been some research on the usefulness of VR for meditation, very few studies have looked at the effectiveness of VR on audible mantra repetition (AuMR). Our research addresses this limitation by investigating the efficacy of AuMR, which is assigned to promote better cognitive health and overall brain well-being in VR. Fortyone individuals were randomly divided into two groups, test and control. The test group was engaged in a ten-minute VR-based AuMR session, while the control group did nothing in the same virtual reality setting for ten minutes. Both groups completed self-reported questionnaires before and after the intervention and electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements. We evaluated EEG band power ratios such as alpha-to-beta (AB) ratio and frontal-alpha-to-temporal-theta (FATT) ratio to find the effects of VR-aided meditation. The findings of the ANOVA test demonstrated a substantial decrease in the self-reported stress, anxiety, and depression parameters. Furthermore, comparing the test group to the control group revealed a significant increase in the FATT ratio and a significant decrease in the AB ratio. We also observed significant changes in the HRV values of the test group. The study offers sufficient evidence to suggest the feasibility of AuMR in VR for cognitive wellness.},

  abstract  = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that is usually diagnosed between the ages of one and three. It is characterized by developmental issues and repetitive behaviours. One of the important social skills, i.e., Joint Attention (JA), involves developing a shared focus of attention with another person. Children with ASD often lack JA skills, which can impede their ability to develop social communication skills later in life. This makes early intervention critical. Previous research has explored various techniques for teaching JA skill training, but few have utilized immersive Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) based devices for JA skill training. Additionally, there is limited work in literature exploring the physiological effect of JA training via using immersive AR and VR devices. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a novel JA training platform that utilizes immersive AR and VR devices for JA skill training. This platform enables participants to interact with it using their eye gaze. To validate the acceptance of the developed platforms, we conducted experiments on ASD (5) and Neurotypical (NT) (10) participants. To quantify the participant&#39;s task performance while interacting with these platforms, we have used behavioural (time duration to register a response) and physiological parameters (Beats per minute (BPM)). The ASD group took a longer time for response registration than the NT on both AR and VR platforms (mean duration in sec, for ASD (AR/VR): 34.5/12.5; for NT (AR/VR): 8.8/4.22). Also, the physiological parameter BPM showed a similar trend, which was higher in ASD in comparison to NT for both platforms (BPM, for ASD (AR/VR): 100.49/90.27; for NT (AR/VR): 87.39/86.60). The increase in cardiac activity, as quantified by BPM values for ASD, gives us an impression of the sensory sensitivities in the autistic group that lead to physiological arousal and thereby interfere with their focusing capability, resulting in delayed response. This study emphasizes the importance of monitoring physiological responses of participants during JA training. It also highlights the difficulties faced by ASD participants during these trainings in immersive AR and VR environments.},

  abstract  = {The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across diverse domains in modern life has made them significant sources for collecting and analyzing multi-modal data. However, concerns about ownership and data privacy associated with IoT devices make data sharing among multiple devices impractical. Recently, multimodal federated learning has emerged as an innovative solution where each device client can collectively train a satisfactory local model without exchanging local data. Nevertheless, most existing multimodal federated learning approaches prioritize training a powerful global server model while neglecting the performance of local client models. In this context, this paper introduces FedAF, a multimodal Federated learning approach via feature Fusion with adversarial representation learning, aimed at enhancing local representations and thereby improving local client models. Specifically, using the trained global model, FedAF integrates the global representation of each local client&#39;s data into its local feature obtained from the corresponding client model. Furthermore, domain adversarial learning is employed to align global and local representations by minimizing the discrepancy between local and global encoders, compelling the global encoder to adapt to local tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two unimodal classifications and one multimodal retrieval dataset demonstrate that FedAF achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other federated learning methods and significantly improves local client models while maintaining the satisfactory performance of the global server model.},

  abstract  = {In daily driving, reverse parking into a garage often leads to collision accidents. However, current studies mostly focus on analyzing drivers&#39; eye movements while using a certain specific parking style, lacking comparative research on different parking behaviors. In this study, 200 experiments were conducted with 20 participants of varying driving experience to collect their eye movement data during different types of reverse parking into the garage. Based on the collected eye-tracking data, we try to analyze how driving experience impacts reverse parking behaviors. The findings shown that reveal significant differences in gaze behavior and fixation positions between novice and experienced drivers. Novice drivers exhibit more erratic gaze patterns, focusing more on the right door mirror and frequently shifting their gaze between areas of interest. To be specific, in situation A (entering the garage from the right side), novice drivers feel insecure due to their inability to visually assess road conditions directly, prompting them to rely more on the right door mirror. On the other hand, in situation B (entering the garage from the left side), reliance on interior mirrors is reduced for both novice and experienced drivers. Insights from these findings could enhancing overall driving safety and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Explaining agent&#39;s decision can offer valuable insights for designers and end-users. One proposed method for explaining an agent&#39;s decision-making involves representing a causal relation between state components and action as a causal model and providing explanations for the decisions made using causal model. However, traditional causal model often faces structural limitation, restricting the range of representable control problems. Additionally, providing accurate explanation becomes challenging in control problems with various types of rewards because agent&#39;s intention of an action is unknown. In this study, we introduce a causal model capable of representing a broader range of control problems and a method to provide accurate explanations in control problems with various types of reward structures. Through redefining the relationships between nodes in the causal model, we have enabled a broader representation of control problems. Also, by incorporating agent&#39;s intention into the explanation, we have achieved to provide a more precise explanation. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using OpenAI&#39;s LunarLander environment. Using a proposed causal model, we defined the causal model of LunarLander, which could not be represented by conventional causal models. Furthermore, by incorporating the intentions of an agent into the explanation, novel interpretations previously inaccessible have become feasible.},

  abstract  = {In traditional reinforcement learning, there can be a degradation in the control performance of the policy when the environmental parameters differ between the training and application phase. The policy that minimizes this degradation is referred to as a robust policy. A framework called Noisy action Robust Markov Decision Process (NR-MDP) was proposed for training robust policies, and the Action Robust Deep Determin-istic Policy Gradient (AR-DDPG) algorithm was introduced as a method for solving NR-MDP. The optimal policy in NR-MDP includes policies following various probability distributions, whereas AR-DDPG is restricted to deterministic policies. We propose a new robust reinforcement learning method called Action Robust Q-Learning (AR-QL) that enables the training of optimal policies in NR-MDP by leveraging various sampling techniques to extend the representational capacity of policies, targeting an improvement in policy robustness. To validate this, we confirmed that AR-QL can acquire the optimal policy for a simple NR-MDP problem, for which AR-DDPG fails to obtain the optimal policy. Furthermore, we confirmed that the robust performance of policy trained by AR-QL in the OpenAI&#39;s InvertedPendulum environment surpasses that of policy trained by AR-DDPG.},

  abstract  = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is extensively utilized in the domain of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) which is aiming to predict the absent entities or relationships within Knowledge Graph (KG). The majority of traditional GCN-based models employ the method of passing messages layer by layer to capture the characteristics of distant neighbors. However, this approach fails to effectively integrate the semantic feature information of multi-hop neighbors due to the significant complexity of relations when attempting to learn continuous vectors for entities. To overcome this limitation, this study introduces Multi-Hop Message Passing Graph Convolutional Network (MMPGCN), a novel framework for GCNs that effectively integrates feature information from indirect neighbors in a novel manner. Furthermore, the graph attention mechanism is utilized in the proposed model to differentiate the weights of various indirect neighbors. A robust and expressive balancing gate mechanism is designed to integrate the information from both direct and indirect neighbors to produce the ultimate representation. The approach is assessed using FB15k237 and WN18RR datasets, and it demonstrates superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods for KGC task.},

In this study, we treat each element of the codeword as a random variable and evaluate the average performance of ECOC. As a result, for $M$ class classification if the number of binary classifiers is $O(\log M)$, then the average error probability of various codes approaches that of MAP estimation.

Model stealing attacks jeopardize model privacy and model owners&#39; commercial benefits. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid protection approach-Maximize the confidence differences between benign samples and adversarial samples (MCD), to protect models from theft. Firstly, the LogitNorm approach is used to overcome the overconfidence problem in adversary query classification. Then, samples are divided into four groups according to ES and RS. Different groups are poisoned by different degrees. In addition to enhancing defensive performance and accounting for model integrity, the MCD uses a trigger to confirm the cloned model&#39;s owner. Experimental results show that the MCD defends against a variety of original models and attack techniques well. Against KnockoffNets and DFME attacks, the MCD yields an average defense performance of 54.58 % on five datasets, which is a great improvement over other defenses. Compared to other poisoning techniques, the Strong Poisoning (SP) module reduces the adversary&#39;s accuracy by 48.23 % on average. Additionally, the MCD overcomes the issue of OOD overconfidence while safeguarding the model accuracy in OOD detection and reduces the misclassification rate of ID samples for multiple OOD datasets.},

However, existing 2D medical image object detection methods primarily focus on spatial features within a single CT slice, which overlook spatial relationships between consecutive slices. We propose an Appendix Object Correction Network (AOCN) to refine predictions of universal object detectors. Although AOCN is a 2D network, it effectively leverages spatial relationships across consecutive CT slices. AOCN requires only a few training epochs to improve the accuracy of bounding boxes significantly, which offers advantages such as high scalability, low cost, and reduced training time. It consists of a global case feature learning module for extracting global feature map from the CT case and an object feature relation module for modeling the relationships between objects across slices. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of AOCN in correcting the output bounding boxes of several mainstream object detection networks, with a 6% to 14% improvement in Recall while requiring only a few training epochs.},

However, dynamic disturbances, such as inventory discrepancies arising from errors in receiving, shipping, and handling of goods, often disrupt its operations, leading to degraded service and increased operational costs, thereby affecting overall system performance. Traditional optimization solutions may necessitate adaptations or overhauls in response to such disturbances. This paper introduces a proactive multi-pathway response algorithm tailored to mitigating dynamic disturbances in RMFS, particularly concerning inventory discrepancies. We extend an open-source simulation framework to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and conduct a comparative analysis of dynamic systems.

To solve this problem, Breadth-First Search (BFS) method uses two trees to represent a search space, and performs bi-level BFS on these trees to find the optimal network architecture. However, the BFS method did not discover the best network in NAS-Bench-201, and its search efficiency is still not high enough. In this work, we propose a one-shot method called Depth-first Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) to efficiently explore the best architecture. Given a search space with $N$-candidate operations, we represent it as a single $N$-ary tree and employ depth-first search on this tree to explore high-performance network architectures while significantly reducing the resource consumption during the exploration. While the BFS method explores multiple networks simultaneously in each exploration, DNAS efficiently explores along only one direction at a time, eliminating the need to synchronize the search processes of multiple networks. The proposed DNAS, performed on a single RTX 2080Ti GPU, finds the optimal architectures for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet16-120 in 0.3 hour on NAS-Bench-201, and in 1.0 hour on CIFAR-100. While finding the best network, the search time of the DNAS method has been reduced by around 2 to 8 GPU hours as compared to other well-performed methods, especially reducing the search time by 91.67 % when compared to the BFS method. The best searched network was further transferred to medical image classification tasks and achieved high classification accuracy across multiple datasets. In addition, the results of ablation experiments substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/Bob5090/DNAS.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms have gained considerable success in addressing expensive constrained optimization problems. While significant focus has been directed toward optimization challenges with inequality constraints, the domain of expensive equality-constrained optimization also necessitates attention, as equality constraints are frequently encountered in traditional constrained optimization problems. Recognizing this gap, this study introduces an innovative approach that integrates a multilayer perceptron regression-based surrogate with a gradient descent-based repair method and differential evolution to address these challenges effectively. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We develop a multilayer perceptron-based surrogate model that concurrently approximates the objective function and equality constraints, 2) We employ a gradient descent-based repair method to adeptly manage the challenging equality constraints, and 3) We propose a hybrid local search scheme that enhances the solution refinement process. The combined use of the multilayer perceptron-based surrogate and gradient descent-based local search works in concert with differential evolution to guide the population toward the feasible region. This approach enables the evolutionary search, supported by the surrogate model, to extensively explore potential feasible regions. Our experimental results underscore the potential and efficacy of the proposed surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm in solving such complex optimization problems.},

This paper utilizes the symbol interval propagation method to derive the value intervals of nodes. And similar nodes are selected based on these intervals for fusion, with the objective of reducing errors and diminishing the size of the neural network model. Additionally, the intervals of nodes serve as a benchmark for quantifying errors in the fusion process.

  abstract  = {In the event of disasters, emergencies, or special circumstances, the military needs to deploy vehicle resources to meet the needs of emergency response and rescue work. This problem involves the reasonable allocation and utilization of limited vehicle resources to complete emergency tasks quickly and efficiently while reducing casualties and property losses. However, there are still some difficulties regarding the military vehicle deployment problem, including uneven resource deployment, low deployment efficiency, and insufficient logistics protection. Herein, a mixed-integer linear programming model is constructed to optimize the deployment problem of military vehicles to minimize the total transportation time and cost. Considering the complexity and uncertainty in military operations, this paper introduces a variety of constraints, particularly in terms of vehicle number, geographical limitation, and strategic vehicle. With the designed model, instances of problems of different scales are solved, and comparisons are drawn with the existing deployment methods. The results show that the proposed model can effectively reduce the time and cost required for vehicle deployment, while significantly improving the flexibility and adaptability of the deployment scheme. This study can not only provide a new optimization tool for army vehicle deployment but also be utilized for other similar types of emergency logistics deployment.},

  abstract  = {In the field of reinforcement learning, reward functions are essential for training agents aiming to execute desired actions. However, designing reward functions manually is difficult, time-consuming, and can lead to inaccuracies. This research introduces a novel framework called the Scale In-variant Reward Framework (SIRF) for creating dense rewards using a neural network (NN) classifier. SIRF employs neural networks to mix complex state functions and generate dense bounded reward signals. SIRF&#39;s effectiveness is evaluated using the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm in an OpenAI Gym environment, a popular open-source toolkit for reinforcement learning research. The results demonstrate that SIRF achieves comparable performance to existing reward functions from the OpenAI Gym environment in terms of key metrics such as average reward, network loss, velocity, and energy consumption for continuous environment agents. This suggests that SIRF can effectively guide the agent&#39;s learning process while maintaining consistency in the reward scale, simplifying the overall reinforcement learning setup.},

Existing methods have achieved promising accuracy and efficiency through dedicated model designs. However, we suggest these methods overly exploit dataset biases instead of semantics. This will lead to exaggerated performances on biased datasets and implicit a significant deficiency in generalizability, which is an important metric yet not considered in existing studies. In this paper, we observe the degradation caused by a spurious dependency and design a model to mitigate this harm. Specifically, we generate an Out-Of-Distributed (OOD) test set from a widely used TV Retrieval dataset, revealing the existing models&#39; erroneous dependency on the temporal locations of target moments. Therefore, we utilize a theoretical Structural Causal Model (SCM) to dig into the roots of this dependency by constructing causal paths for the models. Furthermore, we propose a concrete Clip Location Deconfounding Model (CLDM) to disentangle the confounded video features into the content part and the location confounder part, then produce results with causal intervention. Experiments show that CLDM significantly alleviates the impact brought by dataset biases thus providing advanced generalizability among existing works.},

Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) based methods without class activation map (CAM) have shown greater capability in generating reliable pseudo labels than previous methods using CAM. However, the current ViT-based methods utilize max pooling to select the patch with the highest prediction score to map the patch-level classification to the image-level one, which may affect the quality of pseudo labels due to the inaccurate classification of the patches. In this paper, we introduce a novel ViT-based WSSS method named top-K pooling with patch contrastive learning (TKP-PCL), which employs a top-K pooling layer to alleviate the limitations of previous max pooling selection. A patch contrastive error (PCE) is also proposed to enhance the patch embeddings to further improve the final results.

Data-driven approaches for system identification of AUV sub-systems is an open research area. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for system identification of the depth subsystem of AUVs using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy). The AUV depth subsystem is excited with two different input profiles and the resulting states are used for system identification. Both SINDy and PINN show high accuracy in the estimated coefficient values with noisy measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) quantify the closeness between the actual states and those obtained from the system using the estimated coefficient values. In addition, the percentage error in the identified coefficient values is reported. The results highlight that PINNs obtain the most remarkable performance with multi-step inputs, whereas SINDy excels with sine inputs. For multi-step input, PINN yields MSE and RMSE values of the order 10−2 for states, whereas SINDy achieves values around of the order 10−3 for sinusoidal input.},

This absence may be attributed to the global under-discussion of the MC topic, which has often been perceived as taboo within the sports community. This article delineates a User-Centered Design (UCD) guided research and innovation process for an mHealth App, namely the “Coral App.” This personalized decision support tool is tailored for female athletes and coaches to augment their comprehension of the MC and its impact on training and performance. The fully operational Coral App was meticulously designed and field-tested through collaboration with a multidisciplinary team comprising expert coaches, athletes, sport and health researchers, and designers. The design process of the Coral App comprised of three stages: (i) User studies involving focus group and semi-structured interviews with coaches and female athletes, (ii) Iterative design of the Coral App with experts, and (iii) Longitudinal field testing of the fully functional Coral App with 26 recreational athletes and one coach over the course of a year. The System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Experience Scale (UEQ) were employed to gauge user feedback on usability and experience. The study results concluded that the perceived ease of use and usefulness are indicators of higher user acceptance intention of the Coral App among female athletes. This is particularly significant for establishing tracking, communication, and education regarding the MC and comprehending its impact on performance. This article contributes to the much-needed literature on female-focused innovation of decision support-related mHealth services within the sports domain. Furthermore, it illustrates the value of UCD in furnishing a framework for collaboration with relevant stakeholders to develop research-driven innovative solutions, especially concerning the MC, a topic often shrouded in stigma and deemed taboo internationally.},

  abstract  = {The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem is to find a set of collision-free paths for multiple agents within a shared environment while minimizing the total time spent. In MAPF, finding an optimal solution is NP-hard. And in some cases, finding suboptimal solutions is also NP-hard, with severe limitations imposed by the scale of the problem. Anytime multi-agent path planning (MAPF) is a promising method for path optimization in large-scale multi-agent systems. Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is the foundation of the state-of-the-art anytime MAPF and can even perform well for large-scale issues. It discovers a fast solution at first, and then iteratively plans paths for subsets of agents produced via de-structive heuristic techniques to gradually enhance the quality of the solution until it approaches optimality. In this paper, we propose a subset selection algorithm based on maximum latency and density, which improves upon the subset selection rule of the existing state-of-the-art solver, MAPF-LNS. We conducted tens of thousands of experiments on multiple maps of the MAPF benchmark set with larger numbers of agents. Our experimental results indicate that our solver, MAPF-DD-LNS, significantly outperforms MAPF-LNS in both the quality of the final solution and the speed of resolution.},

Simple multilayer perceptrons achieved 97% and higher accuracies.

  abstract  = {Accurate segmentation of kidney ultrasound (KUS) images is of great significance for the diagnosis of kidney diseases. However, KUS images have challenges such as low contrast, large size variations, and acoustic shadow interference. In addition, obtaining labeled data is a major challenge in the field of medical image segmentation. This paper proposes a dual-branch hybrid CNN Transformer combined with a dual teacher semi-supervised segmentation network (DHCT-DT) based on the MT model. The reliability of guidance can be improved between two teachers by constructing consistency regularization constraints. The U-Net architecture is employed between the main teacher and student model. The auxiliary teacher model adopts a dual-branch hybrid CNN Transformer architecture. The multi-scale channel fusion attention mechanism (MSCF) is introduced to capture the feature correlation information of KUS images at different scales and channels. Two different training methods can combine their advantages to fully extract local and global information from images. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on two datasets: a KUS dataset and a breast ultrasound (BUS) dataset. Both datasets demonstrated the most competitive segmentation performance. For example, in a semi-supervised experiment using only 10% labeled data in the BUS dataset, the Dice coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, HD, and ASSD reached 82.28%, 76,36%, 13.36mm, and 3.71mm.},

Recent Transformer-based models mainly focus on promoting global interaction between features. However, local interaction and temporal asynchronism modeling are not deeply considered. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a dual-branch complementary multimodal interaction mechanism (DCMI), which consists of a global difference feature activation module (GDFA) and a local information dynamic aggregation module (LIDA). GDFA measures the difference between the target element and the global features, thus activating important information. LIDA designs a multimodal heterogeneous graph and constructs asynchronous interaction between heterogeneous features to dynamically aggregate local information. DCMI adaptively fuses the complementary dual branches to improve the model&#39;s cognitive and decision-making abilities of global and local information. Comprehensive comparisons with existing methods on public datasets verify the superiority of the proposed model. Extensive ablation experiments and qualitative analysis show the effectiveness and rationality of DCMI, which can promote the interaction between multimodal features.},

Currently, numerous computational techniques have been developed to predict plant miRNA-lncRNA interactions. However, the majority of existing approaches focus solely on miRNA and lncRNA feature extraction, ignoring the fusion learning of miRNA-lncRNA interactions, which may result in insufficient feature representation. In this paper, we present a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism-based prediction model for plant miRNA-lncRNA interactions (BCAMLI). We embed RNAs using a pre-trained model (Doc2vec), which can fully combine the context information of k-mer words with the remote dependent information of the RNA sequence, allowing us to capture sequence features with more semantic information. We develop a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism for enhancing interactive feature learning between miRNAs and lncRNAs, allowing us to better understand underlying biological mechanisms and improve MLI predictions. Finally, we evaluate BCAMLI on the benchmark dataset, and our proposed model outperforms the representative baseline.},

In order to facilitate the optimization of image composition and improve the authenticity and efficacy of the composite images, this paper delves into the composite image harmonization technique to adjust the appearance of the foreground to be harmonious with the background. Current methods usually overlook the interrelation between the foreground and background content, typically transferring the style directly from the whole background to the foreground. In addition, conventional normalization methods were prone to a degradation in image quality of the foreground region after harmonization. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Adaptive Normalization method, which modulates the mean and standard deviation of foreground region specifically and pointedly, to harmonize the appearance while simultaneously preserving the texture structures of original foreground by considering the local information from the deviation maps. Moreover, we incorporate a Multi-scale Region Correlation-driven strategy to explore the correlation between the foreground and the background content, enabling the foreground object to fit the background semantics more seamlessly. Both ablation and comparison experiments on the iHarmony4 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method as well as the superiority of our model over other state-of-the-art image harmonization methods.},

Consequently, a comprehensive mechanism is developed, in which, for more judicious trade-off decision-making based on the maximum EV arbitrage revenue and the minimum grid load fluctuation, a typical MOO algorithm, i.e., multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), is adopted on the evaluation over entire schedule period; for decreasing excessive computational and communication costs, a finite discrete set associated with charging or discharging behaviors is proposed, and for organizing such EV behaviors, a price-driven auction algorithm is developed to respond to time-of-use (TOU) tariffs in each time slice.

Despite its critical importance, the domain remains relatively underexplored within the academic sphere, particularly in accommodating the crack segmentation on resource-constrained devices. This challenge arises due to the inherent demand for deeper and broader network structures to achieve optimal performance, resulting in heavier computational and storage overhead. Thus, deploying crack segmentation models on practical platforms poses a formidable challenge.

To investigate this issue, we developed a virtual reality (VR) robotic system for upper limb rehabilitation using a line-tracing task that measures physiological and behavioral signals. Challenge level can be modulated by introducing force noise disturbance. We con-ducted a preliminary study on 12 participants, measuring user engagement and physiological/behavioral signals at different noise (challenge) levels. Our findings align with the predictions of flow channel theory. Engagement peaks at an intermediate challenge level.

Nevertheless, existing methods overlook the discriminative semantic information lost due to sample scarcity and the hidden category information in the query set, failing to address the issue of unreliable prototypes generated from limited annotated samples. In this paper, we propose a feature enhancement network for few-shot classification. To improve the accuracy and robustness of few-shot classification models, we first enhance the support set through learning a weight matrix and then align the enhanced support set prototypes with textual semantics. To avoid being influenced by introduced prior noise, we fuse between semantically aligned prototypes and mean prototypes and ultimately utilize query prototypes for dynamic updating to obtain more accurate class prototypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets.

The model introduces Channel-Spatial Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution (CS-ODConv) to learn complementary attention across diverse dimensions within the kernel space, enabling the model to focus more on crucial features of the input. Additionally, an Alpha-CIoU loss function is employed to flexibly regulate the bounding box regression precision by adjusting the α value. To enhance the model&#39;s generalization capability and detection performance, the model incorporates a Multi-Head Context Aggregation (MHCA) network module.

This approach has several key advantages: First, the model can learn multiple probability distributions that capture different potential future outcomes for multiple vehicles. Secondly, by combining the trajectory information of multiple vehicles, the model can reason in the way of the standard denoising model and multiple residual denoising models, so as to improve the model performance and prediction speed. Finally, a general constraint function was introduced to ensure the control trajectory of multiple vehicles and avoid collisions.

To address the above problems, we integrate the intra-modal and inter-modal relations and propose a Semantic Relation-based Cross Attention Network(SRCAN). In our proposed method, we first mine the possible intra-modal associations between regions in an image and between words in a text to obtain features with semantic relationships, and then capture the fine-grained associations between segments through the cross-attention mechanism. Finally, we balance the intra-modal and inter-modal relationships to improve the performance of the model.

  abstract  = {The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is essential in today&#39;s industrial manufacturing, as it can greatly enhance efficiency in production via real-time data processing. In FJSP, it is important to consider various constraints due to the complexity of real-world production environments. Traditional Meta-heuristic methods encounter challenges in accommodating intricate problem constraints and suffer from high computational complexity, while rule-based methods perform poorly. Single-agent deep reinforcement learning frameworks are not equipped to handle complex real-world production issues. On the other hand, although existing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning frameworks designed for FJSP can solve FJSP with various constraints through minor adjustments, they often lack coordination among agents, leading to inefficient performance and unstable training. In this paper, we design a modular and coordinated multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that can solve FJSP problems with various constraints by adding agents tailored to specific constraints. We introduce a novel multi-agent coordinated proximal policy optimization algorithm (MACPPO), which promotes cooperation among agents by achieving dynamic credit allocation. We conducted experiments on multiple-sized instances under various constraints including equipment calendars and transportation, to verify the superiority of our framework. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed novel method in addressing both the original FJSP problem and the FJSP problem with transportation and equipment calendar constraints. This efficiency is achieved compared to other well-known scheduling approaches, demonstrating the flexibility and efficiency of the architecture we proposed under diverse constraints.},

  abstract  = {Driven by the growing societal emphasis on sustainable consumption, per-use rental channels are being integrated by platforms alongside their traditional standalone resale channels. Motivated by this business practice, this study aims to answer the question: should a platform operating a retail channel introduce a per-use rental channel? To this end, two analytical models are developed. One where the platform only resells the manufacturer&#39;s products (the S model) and another where the platform incorporates a per-use rental channel alongside the resale channel (the SR model). We study the channel structure selection of the platform between the S and the SR models. Some important findings are obtained. Firstly, the platform may not always benefit from adding a per-use rental channel and will benefit only if the utility that consumers gain from each usage is high. Secondly, the retail price of the platform will increase in the wholesale price of the manufacturer, but the rental price will not be affected. Lastly, the parameters such as the psychological cost, utility per usage, and maximum usage frequency of customers exert different influence on manufacturer and platform pricing, and the profits of both entities.},

  abstract  = {Recently, zero-shot fault diagnosis has gradually attracted the attention of researchers because that some type of data cannot be obtained in advance in practical production scenarios. However, the existing zero-shot methods hardly utilize multi-channel data information and learn the potential correlation between signal patches and attributes for unseen fault classes, resulting in unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a patch-attribute alignment method based on channel-time attention for zero-shot fault diagnosis. First, a feature extraction module with channel attention is introduced to obtain the multi-channel information of signal patch. Then the feature map and the corresponding attribute vector are processed interactively by an embedding-reconstruction structure. Finally, a patch-attribute alignment module with time attention CNN is utilized to predict the attribute vector and consequently obtain the corresponding fault diagnosis label. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms baseline zero-shot fault diagnosis methods, and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module.},

  abstract  = {Traditional optical instruments for VR glasses are costly, bulky, and complex, while current automated solutions lack sufficient measurement range and accuracy. To optimize VR glasses&#39; optical characteristics, we introduce LumChrom-Net, an innovative dual-path neural network framework for automated production solutions. LumChromNet comprises two key components: First, for luminance calibration, it utilizes a stacked neural network combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to capture luminance features under low illumination and to process nonlinear characteristics across different light levels. By integrating the multiscale hybrid features of GPR with the perceptual capabilities of MLP and fusing through Random Forest, it achieves high precision calibration and a wide range under limited data samples. Second, for chromaticity calibration, it employs the Adaptive Multidimensional Color Space Transformation Network (AMCS-TransNet), expanding the dimensions of the color space and incorporating a linear transformation layer with a dynamic learning matrix to enhance the stability of color space conversion. This ensures accurate conversion from RGB to CIE XYZ space, adaptable to white points across different dimensions. LumChromNet extends the luminance grayscale range to 0–255, with a fitting error below $1.87\%$), and enhances color space $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ to 0.998 with an average error within $1.5\%$). It expands the luminance measurement range to 0–250 cd/m2and maintains optical property errors under $\pm 5\%$, providing a cost-effective, flexible, and automated strategy for VR glasses and other devices.},

Meanwhile, the actual manufacturing process is inevitably affected by disturbances, necessitating the consideration of dynamic environments. To this end, this study investigates a new production-logistics collaborative scheduling problem in dynamic flexible job shops (PLCSP-DFJS). The high-frequency disturbance of new job arrivals is incorporated into the PLCSP-DFJS, and two objectives, namely makespan and total logistics cost, are optimized. A multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (MODRL) method is presented to solve PLCSP-DFJS. In MODRL, a weight-decomposition and neighborhood-inheritance training mechanism is devised to obtain the near-optimal Pareto front, and a dual-level channel-driven framework capable of achieving decentralized decision-making of production and logistics is designed. The performance of MODRL is verified through experiments conducted in an aviation component production shop.},

They are transformed into high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) tensors which include abundant temporal pattern information. Latent factorization of tensors (LFT) is an extremely efficient and typical approach for extracting such patterns from an HDI tensor. However, current LFT models require the QoS data to be maintained in a central place (e.g., a central server), which is impossible for increasingly privacy-sensitive users. To address this problem, this article creatively designs a federated learning based on latent factorization of tensors (FL-LFT). It builds a data-density-oriented federated learning model to enable isolated users to collaboratively train a global LFT model while protecting users&#39; privacy. Extensive experiments on a QoS dataset collected from the real world verify that FL-LFT shows a remarkable increase in prediction accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) approaches.},

To solve the problem that blockchain systems cannot access off-chain data, oracle is introduced. However, existing research mainly focuses on the consistency and integrity of data, but ignores the problem that oracle nodes may be externally attacked or provide false data for selfish motives, resulting in the unresolved problem of data accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new Decentralized Testing architecture (DecTest) that aims to improve data accuracy. A blockchain oracle random secret testing mechanism is first proposed to enhance the monitoring and verification of nodes by introducing a dynamic anonymized question-verification committee. Based on this, a comprehensive evaluation incentive mechanism is designed to incentivize honest work performance by evaluating nodes based on their reputation scores. The simulation results show that we successfully reduced the discrete entropy value of the acquired data and the real value of the data by 61.4 %.},

Although adding noise mitigates backdoors injected in the model, it simultaneously negatively impacts the main performance. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel defense mechanism, Guided Noise (GN), that eliminates backdoors without compromising the model&#39;s main performance. GN achieves this by utilizing conductance to evaluate the importance of neurons and subsequently adding guided noise to suspected backdoor neurons selected by voting, which only disturbs the backdoor task. Extensive experimental evaluations of GN show its significant superiority over traditional noising-based defenses, making it a valuable replacement for existing noising to enhance the robustness of existing defenses against backdoor attacks in FL.},

  abstract  = {In real-world applications, multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) usually have multiple constraints. To solve constrained MOPs (CMOPs), various constraint handling techniques (CHTs) were proposed in the field of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO). A simple CHT with high applicability is to use the total constraint violation as an additional objective. The total constraint violation-based CHT transforms a constrained $(m-1)$-objective MOP to an unconstrained m-objective MOP. This CHT was also used to create a real-world unconstrained multi-objective test suite called RE from real-world constrained problems. Recently, the RE test suite has been frequently used for evaluating EMO algorithms. Only when the additional objective value is zero (i.e., only when the total constraint violation is zero), solutions are feasible in the original constrained MOP. This means that feasible solutions of the original constrained MOP are located on the boundary of the Pareto front of the formulated unconstrained MOP. As a result, the final population of an EMO algorithm on the formulated unconstrained MOP includes many infeasible solutions of the original constrained MOP. This means that good solution sets for the unconstrained MOP are not always good solution sets for the original constrained MOP. In this paper, we propose an improved total constraint violation-based CHT. The core idea is to use not only positive constraint violations but also negative constraint violations. We apply the proposed CHT to real-world constrained MOPs. Experimental results show that the proposed modification improves the quality of feasible solutions obtained by the total constraint violation-based CHT.},

  abstract  = {Recently, many studies have used evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to optimize complex problems across various fields, including mechanical structure design, robotics, and cloud computing. EAs simulate the process of evolution to improve solutions to a given problem iteratively. However, EAs encounter significant challenges when dealing with high-dimensional expensive problems (HEPs). The large solution space and high computing cost of fitness evaluations (FEs) make optimization with limited FEs particularly difficult. To tackle this problem, an Adaptive Multi-stage Evolution Algorithm named AMEA is proposed. In AMEA, an adaptively enhanced teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm is adopted to explore the search space and find potential areas quickly. Then, in the next stage, the Gaussian process surrogate model and a genetic learning particle swarm optimization algorithm are adopted for further exploitation. Besides, this work proposes an adaptive stage switching criterion and an individual screening mechanism to enhance the optimization ability. AMEA demonstrates strong optimization performance when applied to HEPs. We compare AMEA with several state-of-the-art HEP optimization algorithms through seven benchmark functions, and the results show that it performs competitively with other algorithms. Finally, we also validate AMEA&#39;s effectiveness with a real-world computation offloading problem.},

  abstract  = {Community detection sheds light on various graph mining tasks such as social recommendation, which is becoming a long-standing issue in the realm of complex network analysis. A non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is frequently used to tackle this task. However, it builds based on the principle of linear representation and has difficulty in capturing non-linear features from irregularly non-Euclidean data. To address this issue, this study boosts an NMF-based community detector by combining with a graph convolution module, and a novel Graph Convolution and Graph-Laplacian bi-regularized, Symmetric non-negative matrix factorization (GCGS) model is proposed relying on two main ideas: a) taking a graph convolution network (GCN) as a non-linear constraint module on the feature matrix to ensure its non-linearity; and b) adopting graph regularization to preserve the local geometric features of the network topology. A non-negative and multiplicative update (NMU) algorithm is then derived to solve the unified objective function. Extensive experimental results on six real networks indicate that GCGS achieves higher precision in community detection than its peers.},

  abstract  = {The prediction of the generalization error in deep neural networks is a fundamental task with important implications, both in theoretical and practical terms. Recently, inspired by the intuitive conjecture that deep neural networks possess some low-dimensional embedding, which is the main responsible for the learning progress, fractal dimension has been presented as a promising measure to describe the intrinsic dimension of this embedding and, as an immediate consequence, also providing more reliable prediction of generalization. Nevertheless, the investigated approaches rely on the indirect modeling of the training dynamics and involves an analysis of the entire trajectory of the parameter space, which is prohibitively expensive in computational terms. Based on this, here we propose a straightforward and efficient numerical method to calculate the fractal dimension of the parameter distribution and use it as a predictor of the generalization error. The method takes inspiration from the variogram method to estimate the fractal dimension of a function profile and relies on the empirical power-law scaling between a small perturbation added to the trained parameters and the corresponding displacement in the loss function. The proposed measure is compared with other classical and state-of-the-art generalization measures in the literature using different hyperparameter configurations and the results suggest its promising potential, achieving competitive performance in all the analyzed datasets. Our study also proposes an adapted loss function that accounts for the fractal dimension and a theoretical generalization bound.},

Some existing methods concatenate local features with global features to complete the classification task. However, simple feature concatenation cannot fully exploit the advantages of the above two features. This study proposes a novel multiattention feature extraction network (MAFEN) for the scene classification of HRSIs. First, a dual-branch network is proposed to extract local and global features from the scene images. Subsequently, an interattention fusion module is utilized to merge the local and global features. In addition, the multilevel feature fusion module helps avoid the loss of shallow and middle-layer features. Finally, an aggregated loss is employed to enhance the feature fusion of the dual-stream feature extractor by considering the contributions of different features. Experimental evaluations are conducted on three widely used public datasets for scene classification. Results confirm the potential of MAFEN for remote sensing scene classification tasks when compared with currently advanced methods in the field.},

Therefore, this work develops Machine Learning models to predict strip breakage, by investigating the relationship between features and the breakage event, using attribute selection techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, comparing classification methods based on trees, such as Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Extra Trees (ET). This work uses the following methodology: first, the models were evaluated for the complete set of data with default initial parameters, then a new evaluation of the models was carried out with the optimized parameters still with high data dimensions, and finally, an evaluation was carried out of the models with the best-selected attributes. The model that performed best was the DT with 21 attributes, with a recall or TPR (True Positive Rate) of 0.863 and an AUC (Compute Area Under of ROC Curve) of 0.926. The models also indicated that there is no unique cause that characterizes the breaks in the aluminium cold mill, but several others, such as the effect of the rolling mill, coil history domain, oil mill and lamination cylinders.},

While stress has been recognized as a detrimental factor on sleep quality, the relationship between pre-sleep stress level, resting EEG and subsequent sleep structure remains to be explored. This study presents a novel approach that evaluates pre-sleep stress levels using a 2-channel EEG to predict slow-wave sleep (SWS) deficiency. We recorded forehead EEG immediately before sleep onset, then utilized power spectra and entropy analysis to extract stress-related neurological features, including beta/delta correlation, alpha asymmetry, fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn), and spectral entropy (SpEn). We found that individuals with SWS deficiency exhibited signs of stress, such as a robust beta/delta correlation, higher alpha asymmetry, and increased FuzzEn. Conversely, individuals with ample SWS displayed weak beta/delta correlation and reduced FuzzEn in EEG recordings. Finally, we tested the robustness of the selected neuro markers with two supervised learning models and found that the selected markers predict SWS deficiency with an accuracy above 70%. Our study demonstrated that stress-related neurological markers derived from pre-sleep EEG can effectively predict SWS deficiency. The proposed method can be integrated with a portable EEG device and sleep-improving interventions to develop a personalized sleep-improvement solution.},

In this study, we propose an interactive health care robot that measures vital signals of residents. In this interactive vital measurement, the health care robot gently approaches a resident and operates its arm to reach the resident&#39;s hand. The robot then interactively requests the resident to grab the haptic vital handle. The novelty of our method is in the design of human-robot interaction. On the surface of the haptic vital handle, the vital sensors and pressure sensors are arrayed in order to detect physical gripping. The vital signals of the blood oxygen saturation and heart rate are recorded only when the robot is detecting pressure patterns and confident of the hand gripping. This mechanism allows the open contact measuring without clipping resident&#39;s fingers. We performed experiments to measure vital and pressure signals from healthy adults and evaluated the reliability of the measurement in the different configurations of the body postures denoted as the stance, on-chair, on-wheelchair, and on-bed.},

The result has shown that extracting the phonation features and using AeXGB could achieve an accuracy of 92% for classifying HC vs. MP vs. SP, which outperforms the traditional machine learning approach for three class classifications of Parkinson&#39;s severity level from spontaneous speech.},

  abstract  = {Accurate blood vessel extraction in medical images is a key step in the diagnose of vascular-related diseases and can also provide important guiding information for surgery. However, blood vessels are characterized by elongated and tortuous, irregular shapes, making the task of vessel segmentation challenging. Multi-scale contextual features can help to better understand the structure and morphology of an image, and attention mechanisms plays a quite essential role in the abstraction of contextual features. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale dual-branching blood vessel image segmentation method based on the grid attention mechanism. In the encoder, a dual combination of CNN and grid attention is used for multi-scale contextual information extraction, and then channel attention is utilized to fusion the feature representations extracted in a weighted manner, which can be better adapted to complicated vascular structures. In the decoder, each feature map of the encoder layer is up-sampled by sub-pixel convolution, and subsequently, the high-resolution feature maps obtained are concatenated to generate the final segmentation mask by further convolution operations. This design can fully utilize the multi-scale feature information extracted by the encoder while preserving the spatial structure and details of the image. We conducted experiments on two public retinal fundus image datasets and the results demonstrate that our approach outperforms CNN-based, attention-based and state-of-the-art CNN-Attention combined models.},

  abstract  = {Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are malware that allow attackers to remotely control infected systems and steal sensitive user data via the internet. Although current detection methods based on network traffic rules are widely adopted due to their efficiency and accuracy, writing these rules heavily relies on expert knowledge and is costly. This is incredibly challenging when extracting rules for obfuscated Trojans. To achieve effective and efficient RAT detection, this paper proposes a Parallel Sliding Window Sequence Alignment (Parallel-SWSA) algorithm. This method uses a sliding window to segment the data, then uses the Jaccard Similarity coefficient to calculate the similarity between sequences within the window, selects the most similar sequence pairs for alignment one by one, and extracts the common feature sequences. By introducing parallel processing techniques, the extraction efficiency of the feature sequences is significantly improved. Additionally, we developed an automatic conversion tool for Snort rules to address the issue of labor-intensive rule writing. This tool can automatically transform extracted feature sequences into Snort-compatible rules, suitable for intrusion detection systems that support Snort rules. The Parallel-SWSA algorithm was validated on five datasets and achieved high detection rates. The results indicate that the method can effectively extract malicious feature sequences generated during RAT communication and possess strong noise resistance capability.},

  abstract  = {Graph Knowledge Distillation (GKD) in artificial intelligence typically employs a teacher-student model, which faces challenges such as rigidity, time-consumption, and teacher training. To improve, this paper develops a Graph self-Distillation Network (GraDiNet), a framework that operates without the need for a teacher model or graph neural network (GNN) during training and inferencing phases. GraDiNet uniquely utilizes multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to harness both the structural knowledge of graphs and the semantic information of nodes, thus facilitating hierarchical self-distillation between a target node and its neighbors. Additionally, the GraDiNet approach incorporates a novel similarity-based difference enhancement technique and a penalty factor within the training loss to further delineate the distinction between positive and negative samples. This allows GraDiNet not only to bypass the necessity for a GNN teacher in learning graph structure knowledge but also to predict node classification efficiently. Extensive evaluations show that standard MLPs can significantly boost their performance through this implicit hierarchical self-distillation and the similarity difference enhancement. GraDiNet thus achieves an average improvement of 15% over conventional MLPs and outperforms leading state-of-the-art GKD methods across three real-world datasets.},

The robust Kalman Filter with credibility mechanism is utilized to filter out the attacked state data. The controller is designed by incorporating the prescribed performance control (PPC) and backstepping approaches, based on a combined brushed tire model. To achieve the control objective with concerned issues, three contribution are presented: 1) To eliminate the effect of noise and FDI attack, the robust Kalman Filter considers the credibility of measurement in three methods, and obtains a more accurate estimation; 2) A modified prescribed performance function (PPF) is developed in the PPC design to stabilize the control outputs, and constrain them within the PPF boundaries, where the need for accurate initial conditions is eliminated; 3) A modified backstepping control approach is presented to reduce the computational effort. Finally, high-fidelity simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where the superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated by comparing with a traditional sliding mode control (SMC) law.},

To tackle these limitations and mitigate classification biases, this research proposes a Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)-based weighted evolving ensemble model as well as a Siamese network for plant species classification. Specifically, we first diversify the base classifier pool by employing three networks, i.e. ResNet50, Xception, and VGG19, fine-tuned using the specimen samples. Besides the adoption of a mean average ensemble model, a weighted ensemble scheme with PSO-based optimal weighting factor generation is also utilised to integrate the outputs of the three base networks for tackling classification variances. In addition, to further tackle species classification with extremely imbalanced data, a Siamese network with ResNet50 as the backbone is utilised. Evaluated using a challenging FGVC6 data set with Melastomataceae images, the PSO-based weighted ensemble model is able to assign more influence to the best performing base networks for ensemble prediction and outperforms the traditional mean average ensemble method. Moreover, the Siamese network also obtains competitive performance for solving imbalanced specimen classification by performing comparing similarity scores between image embeddings.},

The proposed approach results in the generalization of stacking operations for multiple objects, in contrast to handcrafted action model-based task and motion planning (TAMP). Action model adaptation for new object stacking is done by drawing inferences using intuitions and learning a reward from visual clues based on the heuristically defined reward function. With this reward, the action model adaptation problem is formulated as an n-armed bandit problem. Additionally, an efficient action selection strategy is proposed for the n-armed bandit problem, which leads to fast convergence. The agent repetitively interacts with the environment in real-time to adapt the action model for the new object. After adaptation, the agent is capable of stacking objects with varying poses. The proposed approach is tested in simulation using the URS manipulator with a two-finger gripper. The proposed adaptive action model-based TAMP outperforms the traditional handcrafted action model-based TAMP by a significant margin in terms of success rate.},

Nonetheless, blockchain games diminish the monopolistic edge previously held by traditional game providers, forcing them to compete with players by token distribution. Therefore, this paper explores the duopoly competition within the blockchain game market, emphasizing the role of interoperable NFTs together with NFT wear and tear.

  abstract  = {In group decision making, reaching consensus of decision groups is important to obtain reliable decision-making result. Moreover, expert reliability can significantly affect the result reliability, and unreliable experts provide incorrect information and affect the rationality and effectiveness of decision result. A few studies have considered expert reliability and defined it as the similarity of each expert&#39;s opinions before and after adjustment in the iterative consensus process. They have not considered how to eliminate overly unreliable experts before consensus process to improve the reliability of result, or how to define and measure expert reliability in non-iterative optimization consensus process. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes a group consensus optimization ranking approach with expert reliability and social network relationships to avoid the negative impact of unreliable experts on decision-making. The similarity between original and consistent preference is used to measure expert reliability, the weights of experts are obtained by social network relationships. When the reliability of some experts doesn&#39;t meet the requirement, they should be excluded before consensus process. For the remaining experts, an improved consensus optimization model and a median ranking model are established to promote consensus and obtain final ranking result based on a new ordinal consensus measurement. Finally, a numerical example about pollution control plan selection and a comparison analysis are given to illustrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed approach.},

This challenges the usage of satellites when visible time window is calculated and decided separately for each Pol, causing frequent switching among a lot of Pol captures. While traditional methods are more suitable for observing fewer Pols, denser points require a different approach to fully utilize satellite resources and avoid inefficient tasking. Meanwhile, because Pols are geographically clustered and dispersed in different regions, more satellites need to be analyzed in order to generate a collaborative planning result. This paper proposed a dense-point aggregation method that uses clustering to generate a hybrid task representation based on the geographic distribution of Pols. A collaborative plan modeling and solving algorithm is proposed to provide a compatible optimization with this hybrid representation.

The partitions provided by the proposed algorithm were evaluated based on cluster purity, normalized mutual information and adjusted Rand index, and was compared with the outcome of previous clustering models.

The paper presents a framework as a significant advancement in sleep technology, offering a new method to diagnose and understand microsleeps, characteristics, and patterns of brain activity and sleep disorders.},

  abstract  = {Forecasting models that rely on machine learning often lack a transparent trading logic, which can erode trust when they are applied to real-world trading scenarios. To tackle this problem, a model grounded in an investment concept known as ‘second-level thinking’ is proposed. This approach enhances both the interpretability of the model and the prediction accuracy. The model&#39;s first-level thinking process makes a broad prediction based on features related to the macroeconomic environment. These features are used to group samples into clusters, each representing a different state of the macroeconomic environment. For each cluster, an associative memory is constructed to improve interpretability and simplify the prediction process, mirroring the function of human memory. A theorem is developed to explore the relationship between the capacity of the associative memory and the threshold used in the clustering step. This helps establish an appropriate threshold for reliably memorizing patterns within each cluster. The second-level thinking process then refines these predictions by fitting the residuals from the first-level process using technical features, further enhancing prediction performance. Experiments conducted on two datasets of Chinese government bonds demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms others in terms of prediction accuracy and trading performance.},

  abstract  = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to track the evolving knowledge states of students based on their historical performance, playing a vital role in online intelligent education systems. While deep learning-based knowledge tracing achieves impressive predictive performance, existing methods suffer from two main shortcomings. Firstly, storing massive amounts of historical information introduces irrelevant noise during the training process. Additionally, individual differences may prevent the model from accurately capturing students comprehensive states. Secondly, deep learning models lack interpretability, failing to provide precise descriptions of students knowledge states. This paper proposes an improved knowledge tracing method through learning processes and concept similarity map (LCKT). We incorporate diverse features, including exercise, exercise difficulty, concept, response time, response, and interval time, to measure the diversity of exercise interactions. Additionally, we utilize a forgetting gate to simulate the decline of students knowledge over time during the learning process. Furthermore, we introduce a concept similarity map as a constraint for model training, which clearly delineates students mastery across different knowledge points. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LCKT outperforms state-of-the-art KT methods and exhibits interpretability to some extent.},

This research investigates the use of reinforcement learning algorithms to optimise the parameters of the GA during its runtime. Specifically, we propose a variant of the GA method which embeds the Q-learning algorithm to select an optimal mutation rate at each iteration. Evaluating with a set of benchmark functions, the proposed GA model with Q-learning shows promising performance with lower mean scores than those of the original GA for most test functions. In particular, the Q-learning algorithm shows a promising emergent behaviour, i.e. selecting a high mutation rate when the population variance is low to increase swarm and search diversity. Evaluated using diverse unimodal and multimodal numerical optimisation problems, the proposed model outperforms several baseline GAs with a statistical significance.},

Water quality prediction is based on historical data to predict future water quality. However, it is difficult to learn a representation map from a time series that captures the trends and fluctuations to effectively remove noise from time series data and capture complex nonlinear relationships. To solve these problems, this work proposes a time series prediction model, called PSGT for short, which integrates Patch Savitsky-Golay filtering and Transformer. First, this work adopts a Patching method to embed sub-time series data and obtains the trends and semantic information of the time series. Second, it uses the Savitsky-Golay filtering to effectively remove the noise data in the patch and improve the prediction accuracy. Third, it uses a Transformer mechanism to address the nonlinear problem of water quality time series and improve long-term prediction capability. Two real-world datasets are utilized to evaluate the proposed PSGT, and experiments prove that PSGT performs better than other benchmark models by at least 6%.},

  abstract  = {Synthetic lethality (SL) refers to the phenomenon that simultaneous mutation of two genes is lethal to cells, while mutation of either gene alone is not lethal. Exploiting this genetic interaction holds immense clinical potential for selectively killing cancer cells without harming normal cells. Given the vast genomic combinatorial space, relying solely on wet lab experiments for screening synthetic lethal gene pairs is impractical, leading to the emergence of various computational methods. Existing computational methods often rely on single-feature extraction methods or single data sources for prediction, resulting in poor predictive accuracy when faced with unseen genes. In this work, we propose a novel deep ensemble model for synthetic lethality prediction based on a stacking strategy (DSESL). Firstly, leveraging the publicly available SynLethKG knowledge graph, we learn gene embed dings at three different focus-levels: single-entity single-relation, single-entity multi-relation, and multi-entity multi-relation, constructing three sub-models for prediction from the knowledge graph. Additionally, we incorporate signaling pathway data and utilize graph neural network-based methods to construct a pathway sub-model. Finally, we adopt a stacking strategy-based ensemble approach to effectively integrate the prediction results from different sub-models. Based experimental results, our proposed DSESL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art SL prediction methods in all three prediction scenarios.

Furthermore, by using DeepLabCut, the 3D coordinates of the mouse&#39;s keypoints were obtained.

We innovatively designed Focaler-CPIoU loss to increase the weight of a few classes of samples to achieve the optimisation of pest imbalance data detection. We introduced lightweight convolutional MBConv to improve the recognition accuracy while reducing the number of model parameters. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, we established an insect dataset containing six types of insects, in which the most numerous thrips is 431.5 times more than the least numerous chrysopaperla. The experimental results show that compared with YOLOv8, the mAP50 reaches 61.7% with a 73.1% reduction in the number of model parameters, an improvement of 5.4%, and an improvement of 769 in FPS. A feasible approach to optimise the detection of unbalanced number of insects is provided in this paper along with the ability to be deployed on lightweight hardware devices.},

  abstract  = {Photovoltaic(PV) power generation forecasting is an important method to solve the inherent volatility and inter-mittency of solar energy. However, traditional research methods often assume that the data is complete or well pre-processed, which does not match the reality of data collection scenarios where data is missing. To this end, We propose M-VGTG, a novel framework that integrates Variational Mode Decompo-sition (VMD), Global-Local Temporal Attention Unit(GLTA-Unit), and Multi-Scale Temporal Graph Convolution to tackle the complex issue of missing values in PV power forecasting. First, to address the problem of modal aliasing, a missing data processing strategy based on VMD is designed. Secondly, a carefully designed GLTA-Unit provides a global-local attention mechanism to capture long-term dependencies and local fluctu-ations, improving the forecasting performance. To address the problem of different positive and negative correlation relation-ships between sequences at different time scales, a multi-scale method is adopted. The GLTA-Unit and Partial Convolution are introduced into the backbone model Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to handle temporal features and missing mode updates. Capturing spatial structure is also important. In order to adaptively handle missing modes, this paper uses Adaptive Graph Convolution Network (AGCN) to process spatial features and introduces the latest BiasedGCN module to handle the perception of missing values in the information propagation process. Experiments on real PV power generation datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate the potential of this architecture in addressing the unique challenges of PV power gencratlon forecasting.},

  abstract  = {Distributed systems&#39; applications employ distributed hashing for minimal dispersal, load balancing, and efficient lookups. One such scheme is Ring Consistent Hashing (RCH), which was initially proposed to tackle the issue of web hotspots. Later, it gained popularity in numerous practical ap-plications due to its structured node placement and $O(\log(N))$ asymptotic complexity. Despite its popularity, RCH&#39;s uniformity is usually worse than other hashing schemes, such as the Highest Random Weight (HRW) and Anchor Hash (AH). For this reason, virtual nodes are introduced in RCH, which increases the memory footprint of the original scheme and restricts its scalability. In this paper, we propose a modification to the existing mapping rule between nodes and keys in the RCH scheme. We develop theoretical arguments and conduct several simulations on the conventional RCH algorithm using modified rule. The results show that the modified rule utilizes only half the number of virtual nodes compared to the original R CH for the same performance, resulting in significantly improved uniformity. Moreover, the memory footprint of the modified RCH is nearly halved compared to the original RCH, owing to the reduced number of virtual nodes. Additionally, the simulation results demonstrate that the modified scheme surpasses HRW and AH in lookup rate and memory usage, making it a superior choice for large-scale distributed systems.},

  abstract  = {Motor imagery BCI systems have demonstrated success in single-subject laboratory settings, where a classifier is trained using data from a single BCI user. Typically, multiple training sessions are needed to enhance the user&#39;s performance. To address this, the BCI community has developed Subject Transfer techniques, which reduce training time by leveraging data from other subjects, primarily as pretraining samples. This study introduces a novel subject transfer method that employs Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) followed by Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) for feature extraction. Once the spatial features are extracted, binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is applied for feature selection. In this approach, 40% of the target subject&#39;s data is used to derive a BPSO filter, which is then applied to the data from all subjects before training and testing. The binary vector produced by BPSO acts as a filter, optimizing model performance by focusing on the most class-representative features. Classification is performed using linear support vector machines (SVMs) trained via Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), enabling the hyperplane to be pre-trained and allowing for the effective use of data collected outside of the user session in an interpretable way. The proposed method was evaluated using three benchmark BCI Competition datasets: III-IVa, IV-I, and IV-IIa. It outperformed the single-trial MI-EEG classification state-of-the-art by 3.4% on the BCI Competition III dataset IVa and by 8.4% on the BCI Competition IV dataset IIa.

Additionally, we design summary prompts to provide sufficient global semantics for better text segmentation.

Bug Traceability (BT) is critical for enhancing software quality, reducing maintenance costs, and boosting team efficiency. To explore the trends and advancements of BT, we conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). We initially retrieve 4674 citations from 7 databases spanning 2014 to 2023, and 24 primary studies meet the rigorous selection criteria. Our study identifies 6 types of bug trace links, 8 traceability strategies, and 47 bug traceability recovery (BTR) techniques. Among them, 47 BTR techniques can be further classified into 6 categories. At the same time, we perform statistics on 113 datasets and 16 evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of BTR techniques proposed in the primary studies. In evaluating the overall quality of the primary studies, 8 dimensions are utilized to support technology transfer, categorizing the overall quality into 4 levels: poor, middle, good, and excellent, with 79% of primary studies evaluated at a good level. This study not only furnishes a clear definition of BT for scholarly reference, but also highlights that information retrieval (IR), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are the mainstream techniques used for BTR.},

  abstract  = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) exerts its specific functions at distinct subcellular locations, making the localization of mRNA within cells critically important for studying gene expression and cell migration, and also possessing significant medical value. Current mRNA subcellular localization prediction tasks rely on time-consuming and labor-intensive wet lab experiments. Traditional machine learning approaches suffer from weak feature representation capabilities, leading to poor predictive performance. To address this, we proposed LM-mRNALoc, a mRNA subcellular localization prediction model based on large language models and attention mechanisms. This represents the first application of large language models in this field, harnessing their strong representational capabilities to overcome the limitations of previous machine learning approaches. Experiments have shown that compared with state-of-the-art predictors, LM-mRNALoc achieves an F1-score that exceeds the best existing predictors by 12.5 % on independent validation sets. The datasets and codes for LM-mRNALoc are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LM_mRNALoc-28F0.},

During the auction process, advertisers strive to maximize the total value of their winning impressions within the limited budget constraint. However, due to the complexity and volatility of the bidding environment, it is difficult to obtain an optimal bidding strategy. To solve this challenge, the advertising campaign cycle is divided into different time slots to better control and manage advertising delivery. Subsequently, the dual-delay deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm is employed to learn the optimal bidding factor for each time slot. This approach allows for the dynamic adjustment of bidding strategies at different time slots, adapting to market fluctuations and target audience behavioral patterns. The analysis shows that direct rewards from the bidding environment were misleading. So the new reward function based on the generalized second pricing (GSP) mechanism, designed to learn optimal policy effectively. Finally, experiments on RTB dataset show that the algorithm could achieve more rewards in different bidding environments.},

Despite the acknowledged importance of channel configurations, achieving an optimal distribution that balances computational efficiency and model accuracy remains challenging. In this paper, we initially transform the CNN training problem into an analogous knapsack optimization problem, incorporating the loss sensitivity criteria. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of value density, employing greedy algorithms, to accurately quantify the improvement in accuracy achievable by increasing the unit FLOPs on every layer. This fosters a proficient exploration and optimization of channel configurations within convolutional layers. Additionally, the efficacy of the proposed methodology has been substantiated through both theoretical derivations and experimental validations by the research team, outperforming popular pruning methods under equal-scale FLOPs conditions. We hope that the integration of value density into channel search algorithms will contribute to the development of more powerful CNNs.},

  abstract  = {Pareto set learning (PSL) is an emerging approach for acquiring the complete Pareto set of a multi-objective optimization problem. Existing methods primarily rely on the mapping of preference vectors in the objective space to Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space. However, the sampling of preference vectors theoretically requires prior knowledge of the Pareto front shape to ensure high performance of the PSL methods. Designing a sampling strategy of preference vectors is difficult since the Pareto front shape cannot be known in advance. To make Pareto set learning work effectively in any Pareto front shape, we propose a Pareto front shape-agnostic Pareto _Set Learning (GPSL) that does not require the prior information about the Pareto front. The fundamental concept behind GPSL is to treat the learning of the Pareto set as a distribution transformation problem. Specifically, GPSL can transform an arbitrary distribution into the Pareto set distribution. We demonstrate that training a neural network by maximizing hypervolume enables the process of distribution transformation. Our proposed method can handle any shape of the Pareto front and learn the Pareto set without requiring prior knowledge. Experimental results show the high performance of our proposed method on diverse test problems compared with recent Pareto set learning algorithms.},

Existing methods generally leverage auxiliary information like spatial-temporal context, POI categories, and social relationships to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. However, most of them overlook the fact that the check-in records collected from users are often incomplete, leading to effective information missing and inadequately modeling. To this end, we propose a novel method Adaptive Graph-Based Trajectory Data Augmentation (AG-TDA) for next POI recommendation, which perceives potential relations among POIs and auxiliary information based on adaptive graph structure learning. Specifically, we design an adaptive graph-based trajectory data augmentation module from global view, which automatically explores implicit uncertain relations among POIs, categories, and regions via similarity learning with fine-grained node embeddings to get more expressive representations. In local view, we extend the self-attention mechanism by the learned fine-grained representations and personalized spatial-temporal information for capturing user dynamic intentions. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AG-TDA.},

Recently, complex network systems have faced an increasing number of malicious attacks and random failures, emphasizing the vital importance of assessing their performance. The CNN-based predictor serves as a powerful tool for evaluating the robustness of complex networks. However, the excellent performance of CNN-based predictors requires complete network data, which is often not available in real-world networks. In this paper, we investigate the recovery of losing information in networks. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) Explore the impact of information loss in complex networks on CNN-based robustness prediction models. 2) Propose three recovery algorithms for addressing information loss, effectively improving the issue of losing network information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in the presence of information loss in complex networks, CNN-based predictors exhibit higher prediction errors. However, through the application of recovery algorithms to recover losing information, a significant reduction in prediction errors is achieved.},

The divergent training goals of servers and clients lead to performance degradation: servers aim for a global model with improved generalization across all data, whereas clients seek to develop private models tailored to their specific local data distributions. This paper introduces a novel federated learning framework named FedAMKD. FedAMKD divides federated learning into two independent entities, a local model tailored to each client&#39;s data and a global model for data aggregation and knowledge sharing. A unique aspect of FedAMKD is its adaptive mutual knowledge distillation at the local level, customized for the skewed degree of the client&#39;s data quantity. This method achieves the goal of enhancing both local and global model performance, reducing the adverse effects of data quantity-skewed heterogeneity in federated learning.

To address the information silo problem caused by semantic heterogeneity, a method named Querying of Ontology Mapping-based OPC UA (QOMOU) is proposed. It extracts the information models of OPC UA servers into resource description framework triples, utilizes web ontology language for semantic enrichment and inference, and employs a semantic similarity model for event ontology mapping to improve query efficiency. The method&#39;s effectiveness is validated through functional queries using the SPARQL protocol in Apache Jena. The query efficiency is 5% higher on average compared to both structured query and extensible markup languages. Moreover, by employing a keyword-matching algorithm, the query accuracy of the existing heterogeneous data integration scheme is improved by 4% on average. This enhancement can boost the operational efficiency of Internet of Things systems based on the OPC UA architecture.},

With the success of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), there have been many derivative works of the same paradigm that further better different aspects, in both ease of training and performance. Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) provides the next step in the development of preference alignment by combining the training pipeline into a single monolithic reference optimization process. In addition, ORPO also eliminates the need for a reference model to further improve on training efficiency without negatively affecting performance. However, ORPO, and many of its predecessor, requires datasets with pre-defined reference pairs of example which could severely limit the amount of compatible training data and lower LM&#39;s capability compares to what could be potentially achieved. Inspired by this limitation, we devise a new approach, Monolithic Unpaired Preference Optimization (MUPO), that is capable of making use of the abundantly available data without paired reference and combining the training process into a single monolithic stage for further efficiency and accessibility. Through our experimentation, we found that MUPO&#39;s test performances on Stable LM and Phi-2 stayed competitive with previous methods like SFT, SFT+DPO, and ORPO.},

  abstract  = {In few-shot knowledge graph completion (FKGC), inferring new relationships from limited data is a key challenge. Current FKGC frameworks often struggle to detect subtle differences among entity types and handle noise in sparse environments, impacting their performance. Aligning relational representations with entity and relationship data, while managing prediction uncertainties, is another significant hurdle. We propose the NAEP model, which integrates a hierarchical relational gating graph attention network to discern complex relational dynamics and differentiate entity types. It employs neighborhood multihead attention for path encoding to reduce noise and incorporates an Evidential Conditional Neural Processes encoder to handle predictive uncertainties. Preliminary results show that NAEP performs robustly across various datasets, from large ones like NELL and WIKI to smaller ones like FB15K-237, demonstrating its versatility and superior performance.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, Non-Fungible Token (NFT) has gradually become the key application of blockchain technology. Static NFT is the most common type of NFT. Once static NFT is minted on the blockchain, its additional metadata is immutable. However, some NFTs that mark real assets, games, sports, and other types must dynamically update the metadata. Therefore, a dynamic NFT with changeable features is needed. The emergence of dynamic NFT has greatly expanded the application innovation scene, and promoted the rapid development of community ecology, but also brought new problems and challenges to anti-fraud and supervision. This paper aims to realize the classification and detection of dynamic NFT. First, define and classify dynamic NFTs from both dynamic and static perspectives. Second, a complete dataset of dynamic NFT smart contract codes on Ethereum was constructed for the first time, and analyzed from multiple perspectives. Third, a smart contract feature model of dynamic NFT is proposed, and machine learning methods are used for recognition and classification. After experimental verification, the method proposed in this article can be effectively used to detect and identify dynamic NFTs, helping NFT holders avoid risks.},

The study explored the impact of VRZM on stress via EEG patterns and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale - 21 (DASS - 21). The results indicated significantly reduced depression, anxiety, and stress levels in the VRZM group but not in the VR group. Moreover, VRZM induced a pronounced increase in the frontal alpha-to-temporal theta ratio, indicating enhanced relaxation, contrasting with no significant change in the VR group. The results suggested the effectiveness of VRZM meditation in promoting calmness and its potential efficacy in mental health interventions. We highlight the implications of VRZM for alleviating mental health problems like stress.},

However, the challenges associated with acquiring depth information pose significant hurdles to this task, especially given the lack of RGB-D datasets tailored specifically for COD. Consequently, employing depth estimation techniques to generate pseudo-depth information emerges as a viable solution in the realm of depth-enhanced COD tasks. In this study, we propose an architecture, DAS-COD (Depth-Aware Swin Transformer COD), that integrates Swin Transformer model with depth estimation techniques for the purpose of camouflaged object detection. In particular, we use a dual-stream Swin Transformer backbone to extract feature maps from different modalities. These maps are then enhanced with a multi-modal feature enhancement module. Additionally, to address the inherent discrepancies between pseudo-depth maps and actual depth information, we incorporate an edge-aware module to significantly improve the accuracy of boundary delineation in the predicted outcomes. We tested our proposed method on three different COD datasets. Our results show that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance across these camouflaged object detection datasets.},

Aiming at the problem of small objects information loss in multiscale feature fusion and the impact of background information, this paper proposes a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism (MFFM) with the convolutional block attention modules (CBAM). The proposed approach efficiently utilizes the low three-layer feature information (P1-P3) output from the backbone network and the improved feature fusion technique to enhance the characterization ability of the single-layer feature information through the attention mechanism. This mechanism enables the single-layer features to carry the three-layer feature information, thereby improving the fusion ability among the feature layers. The experimental results demonstrate that MFFM enhances the overall accuracy mAP on the VisDrone2019-DET validation set by 1.4% and the accuracy APs on small objects by 1.5% in comparison to the baseline model YOLOX-X. This approach effectively improves the performance of small object detection.},

  abstract  = {In AR/VR and other application scenarios, the quality of human free-view video reconstruction significantly impacts user experience. Current reconstruction methods often rely on images captured by multi-view cameras and struggle to handle deformations caused by human movement. To address this issue, we propose HFVR (Human Free-Viewpoint Reconstruction), which aims to reconstruct the free view of moving humans from monocular videos. The core concept of HFVR is to utilize the motion deformation field to connect the observation space and the canonical space to perform a 3D representation of humans in the canonical space for rendering from any perspective. We first introduce the motion deformation field to transform the human body in the observation space into a standard space, then model the human body in that standard space. Second, we design a 3D global perception module to use global structural information to address deformation accuracy issues. Finally, we construct a rendering-guided module based on a reference frame that effectively overcomes limitations due to a lack of multi-view information by combining 2D observation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can render realistic free-viewpoint motion humans using monocular videos. Our method improves the LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) metric by 9.89% compared to that of HumanNeRF, as well as by 45.28% compared to that of Neural Body.},

Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) allows for precise targeting of the peripheral nervous system, enabling the elicitation of diverse sensations in the human body, including tactile, cold, heat, and pain. Current research efforts predominantly focus on ultrasound stimulation of the upper limbs, specifically the fingers. However, there is a paucity of investigation pertaining to the stimulation of the peripheral nervous system in the lower limb of the human body. Furthermore, the utilization of a singularly focused transducer for stimulation introduces anisotropy, thereby rendering it challenging to enhance the axial resolution. This study aims to explore an innovative approach using dual transducers that synergistically focus ultrasound to achieve highly precise stimulation and reduce the disparity between axial and lateral resolution. The primary objective is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing this approach for deep muscle stimulation in the human calf muscles, thus delving into the realm of lower limb neuromodulation.},

To inform these interactions, it is helpful for a vehicle system to have a good understanding of a driver&#39;s situational awareness. In this work we explore a relatively under-exploited, passively measurable signal which might provide insight into a driver&#39;s awareness: the constriction and dilation of their pupils over time, or pupillometry. We ask whether pupillometry might be practically useful to detect if and when a driver becomes aware of a road hazard. Using a dataset of driver responses to both hazardous and routine scenarios during simulated semi-automated driving, we compare models trained on pupillometric data to a model trained on facial responses, and demonstrate how their performances differ in terms of accuracy and latency. While a driver&#39;s facial expressions are, as expected, a useful cue to determine awareness (0.82 AUC on held-out test stimuli), we find that pupillometric data alone can provide an even more meaningful signal (0.93 AUC). In addition, we find that the pupillometric model performance degrades more gracefully than the face model when tested on unseen subjects, while fusing models yields further accuracy and latency improvements given sufficient training data. We characterize the shape of the performance vs. latency curve for all models and make our code available for reproducibility.},

This task is challenging, owing to the constant movement of cameras and unstable reference points for camera calibration, which stem from the complexities of the guide dog training process and the surrounding environment. In addition, trainers and dogs walk side by side, making it difficult for 2D videos to capture complete interactions without obstacles. We present a comprehensive system that starts with 2D video footage from multicamera setups, proceeds to extrinsic camera calibration from the moving trainer&#39;s joints, and reconstructs the 3D poses of guide dogs and trainers. This process includes human 2D/3D pose estimation, camera calibration, and dog 2D/3D pose estimation. A novel aspect of the proposed approach involves modifying the existing calibration method for multiple cameras. This modification is designed to achieve extrinsic camera calibration and accommodating complex camera settings in real-world situations, including both fixed and moving multicamera setups without calibration objects. We can create a 3D representation of the training sessions by detecting the trainer&#39;s 2D and 3D skeletons and using calibrated cameras to triangulate the dog&#39;s 3D pose. This allows for a detailed analysis and adjustment of guide dog training methods based on the 3D pose data of trainers and guide dogs, thereby improving the overall training process.},

To overcome such limitation, we propose an error-tolerant code segmentation (ECS) approach, as well as supporting algorithms, to improve semantic conflict prevention.

Meanwhile, considering the impact of task diversity on the quality of service (QoS) of the system, we design an integrated scheme that combines improved clustering techniques and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for dynamic resource scheduling. Firstly, a random forest-based clustering algorithm (RFCA) is used to cluster UEs according to the service requirements (SR) of tasks, as a way to reduce the complexity of task processing and user association. Then a DRL-based computational offloading and bandwidth allocation algorithm (DCOBA) is used to improve the QoS by jointly optimising UAV-user associations, offloading ratios, and bandwidth allocation to reduce the system latency and energy consumption. Finally, experimental simulation data shows that our scheme can better optimise the Qos compared to traditional schemes.},

  abstract  = {With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile edge computing (MEC) effectively reduces task delay of multiple applications. The limitations of computing and storage capabilities, as well as the complex dynamic network environments, make efficient edge service computing stressful. To address this challenge, digital twin (DT) technology is a promising solution that bridges the virtual and physical worlds by creating digital representations of physical objects. DT technology can model the behaviors of physical entities through virtual mirroring and assist physical networks in making optimal network strategies. In this paper, we combine DT technology with MEC networks to develop a utility-based task offloading and resource allocation scheme, aiming to maximize the quality of experience (QoE) of user equipments (UEs) and the utility of base stations (BSs). Specifically, we construct a hierarchical Stackelberg game model, study the interaction between BSs and UEs, and prove that the UE layer is an exact potential game with Nash equilibrium (NE). To achieve Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we propose a game-based hierarchical interaction algorithm (GHIA) and analyze it. The experimental results show that GHIA has good convergence, and the utility performance of participants is better comparing to other algorithms.},

This challenge primarily involves two key tasks: pedestrian detection and re-identification. While significant progress has been achieved in pedestrian detection tasks in recent years, enhancing the effectiveness of re-identification tasks remains a persistent challenge. This difficulty arises from the large total number of pedestrian samples in multi-object tracking datasets and the scarcity of individual instance samples. Motivated by recent rapid advancements in meta-learning techniques, we introduce MAML MOT, a meta-learning-based training approach for multi-object tracking. This approach leverages the rapid learning capability of meta-learning to tackle the issue of sample scarcity in pedestrian re-identification tasks, aiming to improve the model&#39;s generalization performance and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy on mainstream datasets in the MOT Challenge.

  abstract  = {Image deraining aims to improve the visibility of images damaged by rainy conditions, targeting the removal of degradation elements such as rain streaks, raindrops, and rain accumulation. While numerous single image deraining methods have shown promising results in image enhancement within the spatial domain, real-world rain degradation often causes uneven damage across an image&#39;s entire frequency spectrum, posing challenges for these methods in enhancing different frequency components. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet) specifically for single image deraining that adaptively enhances images across various frequencies. We employ convolutions of different scales to adaptively decompose image frequency bands, introduce a feature enhancement module to boost the features of different frequency components and present a novel interaction module for interchanging and merging information from various frequency branches. Simultaneously, we propose a feature aggregation module that efficiently and adaptively fuses features from different frequency bands, facilitating enhancements across the entire frequency spectrum. This approach empowers the deraining network to eliminate diverse and complex rainy patterns and to reconstruct image details accurately. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually appealing enhancement results but also surpasses existing methods in performance.

Traditional methods predominantly rely on feature extraction from datasets and the utilization of complex deep learning models for classification, necessitating larger datasets and more intricate computational models. The challenge lies in balancing leveraging unlabeled traffic to enhance classification datasets and controlling model complexity. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces ETKD, an encrypted traffic classification framework based on knowledge distillation. ETKD is designed to address the trade-off between classification accuracy and model complexity. The framework capitalizes on image recognition techniques to extract encrypted traffic features from extensive unlabeled traffic data. Subsequently, these features are fine-tuned using a teacher-student model, achieving a harmonious equilibrium between reducing model complexity and maintaining high classification accuracy. The experimental results presented in this paper provide compelling evidence of the framework&#39;s effectiveness. Compared to state-of-the-art models, the minimal model employed in our approach achieves notably higher accuracy and F1-score, underscoring the practicality and efficiency of the proposed ETKD method.},

  abstract  = {Remote sensing image change detection (RSCD) is an active research area in remote sensing. Existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer methods operate on images in Euclidean space, limiting flexible perception and interaction among different positions. Recent advancements in various fields have focused on transferring feature processing to non-Euclidean space, allowing for more flexible feature learning. Mapping different locations of high-resolution remote sensing images into non-Euclidean space enables more flexible perception of individual pixels. Motivated by this, we have developed a method solely based on GNN, termed Pure GNN-based Method with the Mutual Information Sensing (PGNet), specifically for detecting changes in remote sensing. In the PGNet framework, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are employed to derive graph-level characteristics. By aggregating information from neighboring nodes in the graph, we capture richer and more detailed features. Subsequently, by fusing the shallow and deep distributions of local and global features of bi-temporal remote sensing images, we achieve an effective combination of fine-grained and macro-level information. Finally, in order to make explicit semantic perception of bi-temporal images, we propose a Mutual Information Sensing module, which encourages bi-temporal feature pairs to enhance their understanding of each other&#39;s semantic information. To confirm the efficacy of PGNet, we carried out a series of tests with advanced techniques across multiple datasets. The outcomes show that our model surpasses existing CNN and Transformer-based methods in precision.},

In this paper, we present a mesh denoising approach that utilizes graph convolution representations to enhance the understanding of the mesh characteristics. It integrates precisely designed graphs to explore the inherent compositional structure of the mesh. When analyzing meshes under the influence of various noises, we extract information about the original features of the mesh by capturing spatial geometric features through graph convolution calculations. Our method is based on Guided Normal Filtering (GNF) to design a Graphical Representation Module (GRM) and a GCN-Based Normal Prediction Module (NPM). It can adaptively obtain the optimal guided normal vectors for noisy meshes. We have compared and analyzed the various methods to produce state-of-the-art results.},

Both Ohbot and reading groups answered multiple-choice questions based on a poem. Emotional arousal was measured using a thermal camera. Results showed that the Ohbot group experienced an average facial temperature decrease of 0.78°C, indicating reduced stress or increased relaxation, while the reading group had a temperature increase of 1.13°C, suggesting higher cognitive or emotional effort. Despite these physiological differences, quiz performance was similar between the Ohbot and reading groups.

The elderly face greater health risks, and their behaviors often indicate signs of crises and illnesses. The rapid development of IoT technology offers new solutions for detecting abnormal signs, thereby promoting healthy aging, independent living, and social participation for the elderly. However, the diversity of IoT devices has led to the phenomenon of personal data silos. When the elderly leave their usual IoT environment, the issue of continuity in healthcare services becomes more pronounced. To address this issue, this study proposes a decentralized Ubi-Care framework. The framework aims to achieve complete separation of data and applications. It is based on the ActivityPub protocol and integrates various data from wearable devices, smart home sensors, and social networks, storing this data in a ubiquitous personal online data store (UPOD) and assigning different roles based on data type. UPOD applications support bidirectional following, allowing users to access data associated with relevant roles, addressing issues related to data categorization, sharing, privacy, and security. Additionally, this study proposes a method for utilizing complete UPOD data to perform anomaly detection based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). By effectively integrating IoT data into UPOD and enhancing data interoperability. The data-sharing model proposed in this study also facilitates elderly individuals and their family members in sharing relevant data as needed, while ensuring privacy protection.

Space situational awareness (SSA) is essential for avoiding collisions and limiting the generation of extra debris. Accurate and efficient detection of space objects plays a critical role in achieving this goal. Our research focuses on the development of detection algorithms that are both precise and quick, taking into account the real-time and safety of spacecraft operations in orbit. For the first time, we take a fully Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) to run the query-based end-to-end object detection for SSA. We further compare its performance with the newest YOLOv9 algorithm. This is an innovative attempt at SSA. First of all, it does not require predefined a priori anchor boxes or complex post-processing strategies such as Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), and can directly achieve end-to-end target detection. Secondly, the fully ConvNets are selected as the basic framework, which not only retains the advantages of self-attention mechanism, but also greatly improves the computing efficiency. These methods show outstanding performance on the challenging SPARK data set. The fully ConvNets approach achieves end-to-end detection by utilizing the query attention mechanism, excluding the need for complicated post-processing in traditional object detection methods and with higher efficiency. YOLOv9 involves an enhanced feature pyramid fusion and a more powerful detection head, potentially resulting in higher precision.

  abstract  = {Infrared small target detection (ISTD) holds significant importance in domains such as maritime search and rescue, and autonomous driving. To enhance the detection capabilities of infrared small targets against complex backgrounds, a novel detection algorithm based on an improved Detection Transformer (DTER) is proposed. This algorithm leverages the DTER detection framework and the EDSR network, utilizing super-resolution reconstructed images as inputs. It incorporates the Enhanced Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) module and an improved backbone structure. Moreover, it employs a micro-target detection encoder head with a new feature layer S2 to elevate the quality of minute feature extraction. The proposed method achieved a mAP@50 of 96% and mAP@(50:95) of 54.6% on a public dataset. Compared to current state-of-the-art methods for infrared small target detection, it demonstrates superior capabilities in reducing false positives and misses while maintaining commendable real-time performance.},

Additionally, we introduce a pigeon-inspired navigation strategy that effectively replaces the traditional obstacle repulsion term by preventing the swarm from becoming trapped in local min-ima and reducing oscillatory behaviors. To validate the efficacy of our algorithm, we have developed an autonomously designed PlusBot swarm platform, which consists of agile vibration-driven miniature robots.

This setup meets the requirements for conducting heterogeneous swarm movement experiments in indoor environments.

  abstract  = {With the proliferation of mobile intelligent terminals, opportunistic networks have attracted widespread attention as a complementary technology to multi-network convergence. Different from traditional wireless networks, message delivery in opportunistic networks does not rely on a fixed infrastructure, but rather storing messages in a cache and utilizing the movement and encounters of nodes to relay messages. However, in practical application scenarios, nodes have limited storage space and energy and will easily exhibit selfishness. An increase in the number of selfish nodes will drastically degrade the performance of the network. To solve the problem of significant network performance degradation when the number of selfish nodes is high, this paper proposes an Incentive mechanism of Selfish nodes based on Energy optimization and Game Theory (ISEGT). The mechanism abstracts the process of forwarding messages by nodes into a bargaining game process, and selectively forwards messages based on nodes&#39; remaining energy and other circumstances. The experimental results show that the ISEGT mechanism can motivate selfish nodes to actively participate in message forwarding, which improves the success rate of message delivery and the survival rate of nodes, and optimizes the overall performance of the network.},

RocksDB has been introduced with numerous configuration options for customization and performance optimization. Unfor-tunately, determining an optimal configuration for each given workload remains challenging due to the overwhelming number of options. This complexity is compounded by different types of workloads, thereby requiring efficient configuration tuning. Recent studies have approached automatic tuning techniques to solve this problem by applying reinforcement learning approaches or transferring prior knowledge to predictive models in order to tune unobserved target workloads. However, the former method is time-consuming, and the latter results in unstable optimal performance according to the accuracy of the predictive models. The models trained with prior knowledge, estimate RocksDB performance of given configurations on the target workload, where those workload mismatches degrade tuning performance. To address these challenges, we propose MetaTune, which introduces a meta learner, which is a meta-learning technique, to train a workload -specific predictive model. MetaTune effectively transfers prior knowledge and effi-ciently fine-tunes the model for new workloads. We conducted a comparative analysis of MetaTune with the state-of-the-art baselines across a heterogeneous set of workloads.

  abstract  = {The Gaussian homotopy method is a classical optimization approach for solving nonconvex problems. It applies Gaussian smoothing to a given problem, using varying smoothing factors to generate a series of proxy problems that are easier to solve, subsequently addressing them gradually from simpler to more complex ones. Traditional Gaussian homotopy methods typically utilize a predefined sequence or parameter to update a single smoothing factor serially. However, this sequential updating process is inefficient and unsuitable for parallel homotopy pipelines. Moreover, the utilization of predefined sequences or parameters leads to a lack of adaptability. To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose an adaptive parallel Gaussian homotopy optimization method. Initially, we introduce an adaptive model called Scaling. This model is formulated as a scaler that concurrently adjusts multiple smoothing factors, with each factor aligning to a homotopy level. It can be integrated easily into serial and parallel homotopy pipelines. Furthermore, we establish a collaborative training regimen to jointly train the Scaling model and a parallel homotopy model, named continuation path learning (CPL) [1] model. Throughout the training process, the Scaling model furnishes CPL with multiple scaled smoothing factors and updates CPL implicitly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian homotopy approach performs competitively.},

Yet, the algorithm displays oscillatory patterns during the minimization process, which may result in slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we proposed a conjugate gradient style momentum to accelerate the QPAM for image restoration. The iterative scheme of the proposed method consists of a proximal linearization that is re-formulated for the conjugate momentum acceleration.

The recent improvement of audio models based on transformers have brought about methods that can handle multiple audio tasks concurrently. However, recent related methods still require retraining multi-task targets with an amount of data, and achieve the general effect after training for multi-task scenarios than the simple combination of standalone methods processed separately.

In the decoding stage, the IAMA is used as a bridge between the encoder and the decoder to solve the adverse effects of illumination changes on the segmentation of weak boundary lesions. In order to further enhance the boundary features lost due to illumination change in the low-contrast lesion area, we introduce the CPM to improve the perception of the integrity of the lesion area.

However, existing graph clustering methods usually focus on technical-level improvements and ignore data-level information augmentation. In fact, data augmentation on graph data can effectively improve the receptive field and feature richness of model, and its effectiveness has been verified in many deep learning fields. Based on this motivation, we proposed a simple structure enhanced method for graph clustering, called SEGC.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a new object detection model called RFSD-YOLO, which is based on the YOLOv8 model and is specifically designed for detecting prohibited items in X-ray images. The model adopts the RFCAConv structure instead of the conventional convolutional operation. This allows for independent parameterisation among the convolutional kernels, enhancing the model&#39;s ability to capture and express potential prohibited item features. The neck section of the model includes the GSConv and VoVgscspdesigns, which aim to balance complexity and parameter size while maintaining detection performance and reducing computational burden. Additionally, we have introduced a dynamic head structure, DyHead, which replaces the traditional detection head design and improves detection accuracy without adding computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that our enhanced model surpasses the current state-of-the-art object detection models in detecting prohibited items. Additionally, we introduce a simplified version of the RFSD-YOLOnano model to cater to resource-constrained environments. This streamlined model improves AP, AR, and mAP by 4.4%, 14.6%, and 3.4%, respectively, compared to YOLOv8n. This series of innovations not only validates the superiority of our model, but also provides new solutions in the field of automated detection of prohibited items for X-ray security screening.},

  abstract  = {Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS), leveraging the temporal information from users&#39; behaviors, have noticeably improved user experience against traditional systems. However, these behaviors often follow long-tail distribution, making the systems biased towards popular items (i.e., popularity bias). Moreover, popularity bias would amplify the neglect of long-tail recommendations, thereby sharpening the long-tail problem. Previous researches usually address these challenges independently, focusing on reducing the over-recommendation of popular items or enhancing the representation quality of tail items. Indeed, it is possible to incorporate their merits to achieve the best of both worlds. Thus, we propose a novel and unified framework, named Collaborative Solution to Long tailed problem and Popularity bias (CSLP), to tackle both the long-tail problem and popularity bias simultaneously. To achieve this, we first introduce a representation enhancement module featuring dual generators to enhance user and item representations, particularly for those in the tail. On the other hand, a debiasing module incorporating an Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) with a clipping strategy is introduced to further alleviate the popularity bias. Specifically, this clipping strategy demonstrates a clear decrease in the original IPS method&#39;s variance, effectively improving the recommendation for stability and accuracy. Experiments on three widely-used datasets show CSLP&#39;s effectiveness in solving both issues. CSLP surpasses all baselines (traditional, popularity bias, and long-tail problem) in overall performance, significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy for both tail users and items, and achieving a more balanced ratio of recommendations between popular and tail items.

These models are uniquely adapted to handle the distinct nuances of anime-style imagery, a domain where conventional GANs often stumble due to complex stylistic variations and a heightened risk of mode collapse. Novel elements of our approach include, (1) modification of existing generator and discriminator architectures of both AC-GAN and WAC-GAN, (2) Q-learning based optimal hyperparameter selection, and (3) Illustration2Vec (I2V)-based automated attribute label extraction. Specifically, the Q-learning method is employed for hyperparameter search which effectively explores the search space of key network configurations by fulfilling the principles of Bellman optimality. Besides that, a deep learning-based 12V&#39;s method is utilised to generate attribute class labels and latent vectors to inform the generation process. Furthermore, we augment AC-GAN and WAC-GAN with additional layers to enhance their feature learning and generative capabilities. The insertion of these additional layers is calibrated based on the optimised network learning settings as well as the class labels derived from 12V, to fine-tune model scalability and diversity. Our experimental studies indicate that the conjunction of these techniques has led to a significant improvement in generating high-fidelity anime faces, adeptly handling the diverse and complex attributes inherent in anime-style imagery. The proposed strategies also showcase the potential of our customised AC-GAN and WAC-GAN models to master the nuanced art of anime face generation.},

In contrast to prior research on trip recommendation, our research deals with such a problem: If a user is scheduled to attend an academic conference at 2:30 PM, how might he/she make a visit to the city&#39;s attractions while still managing to attend the conference? To address this problem, a trip recommendation method based on mixed graph representation learning is proposed. Firstly, a mixed graph is used to describe the spatial temporal, and transition knowledge in users&#39; check-in data. Then, we employ the graph convolutional network to integrate knowledge matrices extracted from the mixed graph. Finally, a trip inference module, which incorporates a dual decoder, POI popularity knowledge, and positional encoding, is designed to generate a trip for a given query. Experiments are conducted on five real-world trip datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several widely-used baselines when recommending a trip with an FP.},

  abstract  = {Since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in speech synthesis, remarkable achievements have been attained. In a thorough exploration of vocoders, it has been discovered that audio waveforms can be generated at speeds exceeding real-time while maintaining high fidelity, achieved through the utilization of GAN-based models. Typically, the inputs to the vocoder consist of band-limited spectral information, which inevitably sacrifices high-frequency details. To address this, we adopt the full-band Mel spectrogram information as input, aiming to provide the vocoder with the most comprehensive information possible. However, previous studies have revealed that the use of full-band spectral information as input can result in the issue of over-smoothing, compromising the naturalness of the synthesized speech. To tackle this challenge, we propose VNet, a GAN-based neural vocoder network that incorporates full-band spectral information and introduces a Multi-Tier Discriminator (MTD) comprising multiple sub-discriminators to generate high-resolution signals. Additionally, we introduce an asymptotically constrained method that modifies the adversarial loss of the generator and discriminator, enhancing the stability of the training process. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that the VNet model is capable of generating high-fidelity speech and significantly improving the performance of the vocoder.},

Current practices rely heavily on conventional modeling techniques that show success in improving accuracy. However, they overlook the non-linear nature, dynamics characteristics, and non-Euclidean dependencies between complex process variables. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework known as a Knowledge discovery graph Attention Network for effective Soft sensing (KANS). Unlike the existing deep learning soft sensor models, KANS can discover the intrinsic correlations and irregular relationships between the multivariate industrial processes without a predefined topology. First, an unsupervised graph structure learning method is introduced, incorporating the cosine similarity between different sensor embedding to capture the correlations between sensors. Next, we present a graph attention-based representation learning that can compute the multivariate data parallelly to enhance the model in learning complex sensor nodes and edges. To fully explore KANS, knowledge discovery analysis has also been conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that KANS significantly outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art methods in soft sensing performance. Furthermore, the analysis shows that KANS can find sensors closely related to different process variables without domain knowledge, significantly improving soft sensing accuracy.},

This paper presents an adaptive periodic and spatial self-attention method based on LSTM (APS-LSTM) to address these challenges. The APS-LSTM learns temporal features from a multi-periodicity perspective and captures diverse spatial dependencies from different period divisions. The APS-LSTM consists of three main stages, (i) Multi-Period Division, that utilizes Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to divide various periodic patterns; (ii) Spatio-Temporal Information Extraction, that performs periodic and spatial self-attention focusing on intra- and inter-periodic temporal patterns and spatial dependencies; (iii) Adaptive Aggregation, that relies on amplitude strength to aggregate the computational results from each periodic division. The abundant experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of APS-LSTM. The code is available: https://github.com/oopcmd/APS-LSTM.},

  abstract  = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an extremely severe condition. At present, the conventional polysomnography (PSG) test is utilized to treat OSA using several physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardio-gram (ECG), and the oxygen level in their blood. During the PSG test, the patient is required to wear many sensors while sleeping. This method is unquestionably complex, expensive, and can cause discomfort to the patients. In addition, it is more appropriate to use single-lead ECG signals for wearable mobile devices due to their compatibility with noninvasive requirements and hardware limitations. In this research, a deep learning model (DLM) using smoothed wavelet spectrograms (SWS) of ECG signals is proposed for the automatic classi-fication of OSA. The SWSs are smoothened using Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter. Then, these SWSs are provided as input to the designed DLM called WAvelet SPectrogram-based Convo-lutional Neural Network (WASPCN-Net) and pre-trained Res-Net50 model. The WASPCN-Net model obtained an accuracy of 87.25%, sensitivity of 78.97%, and specificity of 92.35% with SWS using a 10-fold cross-validation approach, which is superior to many state-of-the-art techniques. Further, we also obtained the performance on the pre-trained ResNet-50 model and received an accuracy of 86.92%, sensitivity of 81.74%, and specificity of 90.12%. The proposed WASPCN-Net is more accurate, simple, fast, and robust than the Res-Net50 model because it requires relatively few tunable learning parameters.},

In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of DNN models on such complex classification tasks. In response, we propose a two-stage hierarchical classification framework, which is composed of a coarse-grained classifier and a series of fine-grained classifiers. A data correction sampling module is designed between the two stages, in order to mitigate the influence of misclassification caused by the coarse-grained classifier; and a discriminative filter learning module is employed in the fine-grained classification, in order to gain better distinguish abilities among fine-grained categories. Experiments on the well-known dataset CIFAR-100 and a newly-constructed hierarchical dataset mini-ImageNet76 demonstrate that employing a hierarchical framework can effectively improve the model robustness on such complex classification tasks.},

Moreover, service discovery and composition techniques can be distributed across various edge services. Owing to the multi-level indexing mechanism, determining the hash range for distinct services is crucial. Additionally, heterogeneity between service compositions results in differing indexing structures. In this study, we present a novel thread-based indexing method explicitly devised for service discovery in web service environments. Our approach commences with employing indexing to distinguish partitioning intervals of web service repositories. Subsequently, we assign a corresponding index hash value to each web service. Each index is then threaded and registered within a thread-based index pool. By allocating threads to a central service discovery server, the pertinent search thread undertakes the service retrieval task initiated by the service consumer, enabling asynchronous processing and result delivery to the client. To corroborate our method, we performed comprehensive experiments in real-world web service discovery scenarios. The outcomes underscore the effectiveness of our approach, emphasizing its potential to augment service discovery in web service environments.},

As the current traditional monitoring methods are time-consuming and laborious, while the deep learning method has the advantages of low cost, high efficiency and high accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a combination of UAV remote sensing and deep learning methods to monitor grassland mouse hole. First, because there is no publicly available grassland mouse hole dataset, this study used a UAV to capture images to create a grassland mouse hole dataset. Second, an improved YOLOv7 model, YOLOAPM, is proposed with the goal of improving the accuracy of small target recognition. Through ablation and comparison experiments, the validity of the improved model as well as the method of this paper are verified to be improved compared to other models.

However, existing change detection methods based on CNNs or Transformers face two main challenges. Firstly, CNNs often lack the ability to effectively model long-range dependencies, resulting in diminished recognition performance for targets sharing the same semantics but having different features. Secondly, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies adeptly but struggle to capture local details and multi-scale features effectively. In response to these challenges, we propose a CNN and Transformer Aggregation Network (CTA-Net) for change detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we devise two encoders based on Transformers and CNNs, respectively, facilitating the generation of complementary global and local features during the encoding phase. In the decoding phase, we design a pyramid-structured complementary decoder to aggregate multi-level complementary features from the CNN and Transformer branches. Furthermore, we propose a novel skip connection strategy to exploit the relationship between decoded features and multi-level complementary features, thereby enhancing the model&#39;s multi-scale invariance. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed CTA-Net model.},

With the development of deep learning technology, some individual recognition methods for giant pandas have emerged. However, these methods often neglect cross-angle facial recognition, a common occurrence in natural settings, and predominantly focus on identification rather than verification, rendering them unsuitable for wild populations of unknown individuals. Cross-angle facial verification poses novel challenges, notably feature misalignment and geometric deformation induced by varying angles, particularly in the verification process reliant on comparing feature discrepancies. To address this issue, we developed the CrossPandaFace model. This model employs a Pixel Drift Unit (PDU) to adjust feature pixels and utilizes template features generated by the Template Generation Module (TGM) as a reference to align giant pandas from different angles onto a unified template. Furthermore, Multi-scale Feature Supplement (MSFS) compensates for the potential risk of losing local features of aligned features. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance, thus affirming the efficacy of our model for cross-angle giant panda verification.},

Distributed time-varying optimization involves a collective effort by multiple agents to collaboratively minimize the aggregate of local objective functions that change over time. This process is subject to time-dependent equality constraints and relies solely on information available at the local level and from neighboring agents. First, a finite-time multi-parameter smooth distributed algorithm with input TDs is proposed to solve the optimization problem of MASs with arbitrary switching topologies. Secondly, combined with the Lyapunov stability theory, the states of each agent can achieve consensus and asymptotically track the optimal solution trajectory within a finite-time is proved. At last, an illustrative simulation example of target tracking with MASs is given to verify the effectiveness and applicability of the theoretical results.},

However, these DP-FL approaches are vulnerable to single-point failures at the server node and suffer significant performance declines in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) scenarios. To mitigate the research gap, we propose the Decentralized Federated Collaborative Learning (DFedCL.) DFedCL framework is designed as a fully decentralized system where clients can directly share updated models without a server node. Within this framework, each client maintains a private model locally and uses a sharing model for information exchange. These two models are collaboratively trained and updated in each learning iteration based on the noise-added gradients generated. To improve the model generalization ability and enhance model learning performance in non-IID scenarios, we further propose the SAM-based update correction, applied by the sharing model exchange. We evaluate our proposed DFedCL through MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in different non-IID degrees, the experimental results show the DFedCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

A pivotal challenge within FL is the defense against Byzantine attacks, which can alter the model aggregation process and ultimately lead to the failure of Federated Learning convergence. Existing Byzantine defense mechanisms often result in diminished model accuracy in scenarios characterized by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel defense approach named Fed-BRMC. This method combines a self-developed federated Dual-Model Contrastive Detection technique with Similarity Detection methods, leveraging historical update information from users to deeply mine the characteristics of model parameters, effectively distinguishing between Byzantine and honest users. Extensive experimentation has shown that Fed-BRMC significantly improves user identification accuracy in non-IID data scenarios compared to existing methods and notably enhances the global model accuracy of Byzantine-robust Federated Learning.},

  abstract  = {Bitcoin is under the threat of fork since it operates with a distributed ledger. Predicting the fork probability in advance is beneficial for taking early action to avoid malicious attacks. In this study, we compose a colored Petri net model of Bitcoin. Our model consists of a given number of nodes, and each node has five subpages representing the node structure: proof of work, broadcast blocks, verify blocks, and the process of adding blocks to blockchain, respectively. Simulation results of fork probability can be easily obtained and analyzed by observing the data in the measuring components of subpages. The results show that our model correctly simulates the fork probability: on recent Bitcoin data, compared with the results of the wide-known SimBlock simulator, a difference of some 4.3% has been obtained. Thus, taking into account vivid graphical representation, our model has certain advantages for the developing techniques of attack avoidance.},

Minimizing the makespan of a close-down process is economically significant in increasing the throughput of a wafer fab. However, the optimization of a close-down process is challenging due to wafer residency time constraints. Existing linear programming models must be constructed when specific processing time and robot activity time parameters are given. To address the issue, we propose a scheduling method based on deep reinforcement learning. For this reinforcement learning algorithm, the specific states, actions, and reward functions are designed for the close-down process to follow the Markov property, and a deep Q-network is adopted to find an optimal scheduling policy. Experimental results demonstrate that, in contrast to traditional scheduling methods, the proposed method achieves an optimal policy and also excels in generalization, enabling adaptive real-time production scheduling.},

The proposed method enables each propeller module to independently generate control efforts based solely on its local state information and that of its 1-hop neighbors, without requiring global system knowledge. The PE-PINN is trained to approximate the optimal centralized control policy by incorporating the nominal system dynamics and accounting for modeling uncertainties. Key innovations include estimating the Lipschitz constant to ensure persistent excitation during training, and a decentralised control formulation that minimizes the difference between the learned and optimal control efforts. Experimental results on a modular aerial testbed demonstrate the PE-PINN&#39;s ability to achieve high-accuracy fixed-point hover and trajectory tracking performance, outperforming a prior decentralised control approach by 8.57% and 24.17% respectively.

In this paper, we propose a cooperative fault-tolerant braking control with prescribed performance for urban rail trains. A coupled multi-agent braking model is first developed, where each vehicle is treated as an independent and controllable agent subject to various uncertainties, input saturation and different levels of actuator faults. Further, incorporating a prescribed tracking performance function, a distributive adaptive terminal sliding mode controller is developed to ensure safe and reliable train braking control. The control input saturation nonlinearity is addressed by employing a smooth hyperbolic tangent function for approximation. Adaptation laws are introduced to mitigate the effects of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The efficacy of the proposed control scheme is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations.},

We conduct comprehensive experiments on a diverse dataset collected from real-world scenarios, covering various challenging conditions. The results show that our improved YOLOv5 network achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the merits of the proposed SEC3 attention and BiFPN fusion modules in boosting performance.

  abstract  = {This study proposes a direct torque control (DTC) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) equipped with a neural network and a fuzzy hysteresis controller to achieve seamless control of a three-phase induction motor. In the proposed DTC system, feedback currents and voltages measured at the stator are fed into the hysteresis controller and a switching table. Subsequently, six-arm voltages are generated based on the voltage vector selector table to drive the RM5G inverter. However, severe switching noise is present in the power transistors of the inverter. These problems lead to numerous large ripples, instability, and delayed torque and flux responses at the stator. To address the aforementioned challenges, this study proposes a fuzzy controller to enhance flux signals. This controller incorporates a fuzzifier, a fuzzy rule base, and a defuzzifier. Additionally, a backpropagation neural network control is employed to improve torque signals. The multilayer neural network is utilized not only to calculate torque rapidly but also to enhance calculation accuracy. The proposed control method effectively reduces flux and torque errors, facilitating smooth control of the three-phase induction motor. After functional verification on an FPGA board, the proposed design is implemented on an ASIC fabricated using the TSMC $0.18-\mu \mathrm{m}$ CMOS process. The results indicate a chip area of approximately $0.959\times 0.9584\text{mm}^{2}$ and a power consumption of 2.2524 mW at a supply voltage of 1.8 V and an operating frequency of 10 MHz.},

  abstract  = {Brain-machine interface (BMI) technology has witnessed notable advancements, facilitating individuals with motor disabilities to effectively operate prosthetic limbs. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed within BMIs to train decoders that can interpret neural activity and translate it into movement intentions using reward information. Internal rewards, reflected in neural response to sensory feedback in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), can be used for autonomous updates in RL-BMIs. Studies have shown that designed audio feedback improves subjects&#39; learning abilities, while neural activity in the mPFC induced by audio feedback indicates future rewards information. These findings highlight the possibility to utilized neural modulation in mPFC upon audio-induced can serves intermediate guidance on decoder update feedback. However, the reliance on single neuron spike signals from mPFC has limitations and will be unavailable, especially in long-term BMI implants. Local field potentials (LFPs) provide neural ensemble information and have been proposed as an alternative long-term data source to overcome these limitations. This paper proposes to extract LFPs neuromodulations and relate them to audio-induced reward expectation information from mPFC neural activity by implementing a data-driven marked point process (MPP) methodology. We correlate synchronized spike activity to the transient events in the LFP broad high frequency (bhf) band (200-400Hz) in the mPFC of rats performing the two-lever press discrimination task. Compared with extracting LFP features from the binned spectrogram power, our approach improves 24.63% on average in the peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) across subjects over our data segments. This study indicates that LFPs in the mPFC contains the information that can provide sensory-induced reward expectation information in long-term use and advances the development of autonomous guidance for BMI decoders.},

The volume conduction (VC) effect can be approximated as a linear mixing of the electrical fields of the brain regions, leading to spurious connectivity results. The proposed modularized brain connectivity network consists of three methods: Surface Laplacian (SL), partial correlation, and phase lag index (PLI) to eliminate VC effects from the brain connectivity network. SL is initially applied to the raw Electroencephalography (EEG) signal, and Event-related potential peak-wise modules for each EEG event are identified. Next, the optimum EEG channels are selected using the partial correlation method, and the source channel of each module is identified. Finally, the resultant brain connectivity network is constructed by adding the edges (i.e., PLI value) between the source channels of two modules. The experiment is performed on an EEG-based driving dataset. The performance of the proposed brain network for each driving event is evaluated based on graph measures such as mean local efficiency (MLE) and global efficiency (GE). After eliminating the VC effects, the modularized brain connectivity network significantly improves information processing rates (in terms of graph measures) across the brain region. We achieved maximum average GE (AGE) and average MLE (AMLE) values of 0.742 and 0.825 with the proposed brain network.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an anonymous node selection scheme that anonymously selects nodes with high reputations to participate in tasks to ensure the security and service quality of nodes. Then, this paper also details the interest requirements and behavioral motives of all parties in the payment settlement and asset valuation scenarios. Under the hypothesis of rational man, an incentive mechanism based on the Stackelberg game is proposed. It can achieve equilibrium under the pursuit of the revenue of task publishers and executors, thereby ensuring the revenue of all types of users and improving the enthusiasm for participation. Finally, we verify the security of the proposed scheme through security analysis.

Our approach yielded a 70 % classification accuracy in determining the winner of shogi games from previously unseen board states when tested on a validation set. The results highlight the effectiveness of using genetic algorithms to evolve a shogi evaluation function and provide a further understanding of enhancing shogi AI using game outcomes as primary training data. Our method&#39;s computational efficiency also stands as an advantage over other techniques commonly employed in this domain. This work offers a fresh perspective in the realm of computer shogi with implications for future research and development.},

Our aim is to develop a conservative solution that minimizes the maximum deviation from the optimal routing time in the worst-case scenario. To achieve this, we integrate neural models into heuristic approaches, capitalizing on recent advancements in neural techniques. Specifically, we incorporate a pre-trained neural model into the tabu search framework, using it to refine the evaluation function. This novel integration streamlines the solution improvement process. Our experimental results underscore the effectiveness of this approach, showing that it handles various scales of the robust traveling salesman problem more efficiently and in less time compared to traditional heuristic methods.},

Then, a safety proximal policy optimization method is proposed that incorporates a safety network to decouple the economic and safety factors in the traditional reward composition. Finally, experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Optimization of robotaxi dispatch with ride-sharing can enrich the travel choices of residents and improve the network capacity of transportation systems. This work proposes a multi-objective optimization model for robotaxi dispatch. Unlike previous approaches, this is the first attempt to adjust simultaneously unreasonable boarding time (BT) and pick-up/drop-off (UO) points for passengers during the dispatch. It encourages passengers to walk to the recommended UO points or to be picked up slightly earlier or later, which aims to maximize the profit per kilometer of robotaxis and to minimize the total travel expense of passengers. Consequently, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with mass center (NSGA-MC) is proposed to address the model. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its peers from multiple metrics, which highlight the advantage in advancing intelligent public transportation systems.},

SenBeMC combine API call information vectors with behavioral information to enhance the deep semantic information of input features, enriching the hierarchical structure of feature representation. SenBeMC stands out by employing soft thresholding and attention mechanisms to sift through the noise — extraneous information that can mask the malware&#39;s true nature, and a BiLSTM model that excels in understanding the sequence and timing of actions, crucial for spotting sophisticated threats.

  abstract  = {Image captured under low-light conditions presents unpleasant artifacts, which debilitate feature extraction performance in upstream visual tasks. Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve brightness and contrast, further reducing noise that corrupts the visual quality. Recently, many image restoration methods based on Swin Transformer have been proposed, and impressive performance has been achieved. However, on one hand, trivially employing Swin Transformer for LLIE would expose several artifacts, including over-exposure, brightness imbalance, noise corruption, etc. On the other hand, it is impractical to capture image pairs of low-light images and corresponding ground truth, i.e., well-exposed images in the same visual scene, for model training. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch network based on Swin Transformer, guided by a signal-to-noise ratio prior map which provides the spatial-varying information for LLIE. Moreover, we leverage unsupervised learning to construct the optimization objective based on the Retinex model, to guide the training of the proposed network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is competitive with the baseline models.},

  abstract  = {Object detection in UAV imagery has become a hot topic in recent years. However, deploying real-time detection models on UAV platforms is highly challenging due to limited computational power and memory. Moreover, the large size of UAV-captured images, the small size of objects, and their dense distribution all impact detection efficiency. Many researchers have made a series of improvements to address these issues, but they have not maintained a good balance among model size, inference speed, and accuracy. To address above difficulties, this paper proposes an efficient and lightweight model that maintains moderate detection accuracy while achieving model lightweighting and reduced inference time. Concretely, considering the higher resolution of drone-captured images, we have designed a backbone with more lightweight downsampling modules, enhancing deployment efficiency on devices with limited resources. Additionally, this work incorporates a self-attention mechanism in the feature extraction component of the model, which significantly improves the ability to process critical areas in the image, crucial for detecting small-scale and densely distributed targets. Moreover, this work designs an IoU tailored for drone aerial images, which calculates losses by focusing on the shape and scale of bounding boxes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of bounding box regression. Additionally, it uses a ratio of scale factors to control the generation of auxiliary bounding boxes, which aids in loss calculation and accelerates convergence. Experimental results on the VisDrone 2019 dataset show that compared to existing detection methods used for drones, our model is more lightweight and efficient, while also achieving medium accuracy. Also, compared to our baseline method, YOLO-ELD reduces the number of model parameters by about 40%, increases the inference speed of the model by 10%, and also improves the precision of model by 3%.},

  abstract  = {In the application of drone-based target detection, both the lightweighting of the model and its accuracy are crucial. Therefore, this paper aims to achieve model lightweighting and accuracy improvement through structural improvements to the YOLO model. To meet this objective, this work optimizes the structure of the existing model to address the challenge of operational limitations in small drones, which have restricted computational capacities. By integrating lightweight modules as the backbone of the model, it enhances the feasibility of deployment on devices with limited processing power. Furthermore, the introduction of a self-attention mechanism, which is placed in the Neck of the model improves the ability to prioritize critical regions within the image. This enhancement is crucial for accurately detecting overlapping or blurred objects encountered by the moving drone. Additionally, the modification of the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, which now considers the aspect ratio and shape of the bounding boxes further refines the target detection capabilities, ensuring more precise and reliable object localization. Since drones do not remain at a constant height or position, the angles and distances of the vehicles which they capture are bound to change. This adjustment, which modifies how the IoU quantifies overlap, allows the IoU to more accurately quantify the degree of overlap of vehicle detection bounding boxes at different angles and distances, thereby providing more reliable target detection performance. Experimental results indicate that compared to existing YOLO models, our method achieves 30% reduction in model size and 1% improvement in accuracy.},

Currently, there are various adversarial attack methods developed, but the adversarial samples generated using most methods are still disadvantaged by the poor target ransferability of cross-model in black-box scenarios. To address this issue, a new method called Adaptive Variation Method (AVM) is proposed in this paper to improve the transferability of targeted adversarial examples in black-box scenarios. AVM relies on Adjustment of diversified inputs(ADI) method to achieve data enhancement on the input image and Maximum absolute difference (MD) method to calculate the loss for adversarial perturbation. Specifically, the Resized-Diverse-Inputs (RDI) method is improved in this paper to propose a new diversified input method, namely the Adjustment of diversified inputs (ADI) method. By means of repeated scaling and random filling performed on the input image, the image becomes relatively rough, with its input diversity and random flexibility improved. In addition, the Maximum absolute difference (MD) method is proposed in this paper to enhance the advantage of adversarial samples by minimizing the maximum absolute difference between the adversarially perturbed global image and local image. According to the experimental results, this method improves the success rate in the presence of transfer-based targeted attacks.},

  abstract  = {Traditional group decision-making problems focus on obtaining a complete ranking of all alternatives from best to worst. However, in many real-life scenarios, there are instances where it is necessary to assign only two rank levels to alternatives, creating a ranking where one subset of alternatives is prioritized above another subset. These scenarios are referred to as 2-rank group decision-making problems. Linguistic preference relations serve as an effective tool for expressing decision-makers preferences, as they allow comparisons between two alternatives at a time using linguistic terms. Nonetheless, in 2-rank group decision-making problems with linguistic preference relations, it is common for the same linguistic term to hold different meanings for different decision-makers, a phenomenon known as personalized individual semantics (PISs). Addressing how to model PISs in 2-rank group decision-making problems presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we develop a consensus-reaching model for 2-rank linguistic group decision-making problems, incorporating PISs and consistency control for decision-makers. Specifically, we first employ consistency-driven models to evaluate and improve the consistency of each decision-makers linguistic preference relations. Based on this foundation, we determine the 2-rank preference vectors for both individuals and the group. Subsequently, we propose a 2-rank consensus measurement method and design a 2-rank consensus-reaching process to help decision-makers enhance their consensus level. This involves the development of a PIS-based consensus level maximization model and a PIS-based minimum adjustment model. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm to implement the consensus-reaching framework. Ultimately, numerical experiments and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Since 2016, the demand for remote work has grown by nearly 400%, with 3.5 million remote job vacancies posted, and it is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. Therefore, one of the challenges in advancing remote work is fostering innovation, particularly serendipity, in a remote workforce. This fortunate discovery can pave the way for technological advancements, new business strategies, or even scientific revolutions. However, creating moments of serendipity in a remote work environment is a significant challenge. Thus, finding the right approach to stimulate serendipity in a remote work environment is an ever-evolving challenge. Therefore, this work aims to understand the possibilities of serendipity that collaboration tools used in remote work can support. The methodology used for this work was a Rapid Review. First, we explore the factors related to serendipity in physical offices, for which we identified twenty-three elements. Next, we compiled 38 strategies for remote work that were found to promote serendipity, which we organized in a framework for better observation. Our findings can serve as a starting point for designing new tools and identifying existing software and tools that already play a supportive role.},

  abstract  = {Value decomposition plays a pivotal role in ensuring effective credit assignment within Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), particularly in cooperative multi-agent tasks where agents are limited to accessing team rewards only. However, existing methods treat the mixing network as a black box, implicitly assuming that neural networks can autonomously extract important information and achieve rational credit assignment during policy learning. This approach not only lacks interpretability but may also prove inefficient in complex scenarios. To enhance the interpretability and rationality of value decomposition, we propose an innovative approach called “Causal Value Decomposition”(CMIX). CMIX employs causal inference-based models, introducing a set of metrics beyond environmental rewards to enhance robustness and model interpretability. Specifically, CMIX establishes intricate relational structures among agents in complex environments and leverages causal relationships between agents and their surroundings to address the credit assignment challenge in MARL. By employing do-calculus, CMIX accurately measures the impact of each agent&#39;s actions on environmental states, precisely determining their contribution to the collective reward. This approach not only enhances the interpretability of existing black-box models but also improves the accuracy of credit assignment in multi-agent systems. Moreover, CMIX exhibits high scalability and complements existing value decomposition techniques. Its effectiveness and scalability have been rigorously tested across various settings, including MPE, LBF, and SMAC environments.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have witnessed remarkable advance-ments in entity alignment, which endeavors to identify entities that represent the same real-world objects across different knowledge graphs (KGs). Nonetheless, prevailing approaches predominantly operate within closed-domain scenarios, rendering them inadequate for handling unmatchable entities. To address this challenge, we propose a retrieval augmented large language model framework (RALLM) to leverage the reasoning capacities of large language models (LLMs) to achieve open-set entity alignment, which not only enables the identification of equivalent entities for matchable entities but also addresses the identification of unmatchable ones. Specifically, we propose a novel retrieval augmentation method that leverages both textual and structural information of entities to retrieve potential equivalent candidates. Subsequently, we employ an iterative process to prompt the LLM to discern the equivalence between the retrieved candidate entity and the entity requiring alignment. To mitigate issues related to many-to-one alignment prediction and enhance alignment efficacy, we devise a memory mechanism to store highly confident aligned entity pairs and provide reminders to the LLM when a candidate entity has been matched. Our experimental findings underscore the superior performance of RALLM, highlighting the potential of LLMs in facilitating open-set entity alignment tasks.},

However, an excessive number of redundant features can negatively impact the learning speed and classification performance of machine learning models. Selecting important features from high-dimensional data is a challenge. To address this challenge, We propose a cooperative evolutionary algorithm based on feature clustering to partition the feature subspace for feature selection. Firstly, a clustering method based on feature similarity is employed to partition the subspaces at a lower computational cost. Then, an initialization strategy based on feature-label correlation is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the population. Finally, to reduce the dimensionality of the feature subset while ensuring the classification efficiency of the algorithm, a mutation operator based on the optimal individual is introduced to obtain higher quality solutions. The algorithm is applied to 14 classic datasets and compared with 7 advanced algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the algorithm&#39;s ability to obtain good feature subsets.},

To address these challenges, we present the HCMLP, a highly condensed all-MLP architecture designed for optimal lightweight efficiency, enabling extended long-term predictions without compromising performance. This pioneering method simultaneously captures the spatial correlations between pose joints and the temporal dynamics of each joint by employing distinct but parallel spatial and temporal MLPs. Then, Dynamic Aggregation component dynamically assimilates the spatial and temporal correlations. Finally, channel MLP synergizes and refines these spatio-temporal features for enhanced prediction accuracy. Our experiments on the Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW datasets reveal that HCMLP surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods in short-term, long-term, and particularly extended long-term predictions, while maintaining the least parameters.

  abstract  = {As human-machine interaction continues to evolve, the capacity for environmental perception is becoming increasingly crucial. Integrating the two most common types of sensory data, images, and point clouds, can enhance detection accuracy. Currently, there is no existing model capable of detecting an object&#39;s position in both point clouds and images while also determining their corresponding relationship. This information is invaluable for human-machine interactions, offering new possibilities for their enhancement. In light of this, this paper introduces an end-to-end Consistency Object Detection (COD) algorithm framework that requires only a single forward inference to simultaneously obtain an object&#39;s position in both point clouds and images and establish their correlation. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the object correlation between point clouds and images, this paper proposes a new evaluation metric, Consistency Precision (CP). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an extensive set of experiments has been conducted on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X datasets. The study also explored how the proposed consistency detection method performs on images when the calibration parameters between images and point clouds are disturbed, compared to existing post-processing methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits ex-cellent detection performance and robustness, achieving end-to-end consistency detection.

We find that adding specific camera descriptions not only prevents these issues but also enhances visual quality. Consequently, we propose a simple and safe prompt engineering method (SSP) to improve visual generation quality by providing optimal camera descriptions. Specifically, we create a dataset from multi-datasets as original prompts. To select the optimal camera, we design an optimal camera matching approach and implement a classifier for original prompts capable of automatically matching. Appending camera descriptions to original prompts generates optimized prompts for further visual generation. Experiments demonstrate that SSP improves semantic consistency by an average of 16 % compared to others and safety metrics by 35.8%.},

Then, ablation studies are conducted to assess the suitable BL model architectures within the context of federated learning. Furthermore, we perform a comparative analysis between these approaches and existing federated learning schemes to evaluate their advantages and limitations.

Traditional strategies, including variable speed limit (VSL) and ramp metering, are commonly used for freeway traffic congestion management. Recently, vehicle platooning has become a promising way to alleviate traffic bottlenecks. This work proposes a novel framework that combines VSL and vehicle platooning for freeway bottleneck, referred to as VSL-VP, in mixed traffic of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). First, the upstream road of a bottleneck is divided into two segments, called the former and the latter. VSL limits vehicle speed at the former segment, thereby reducing inflow traffic to the latter one. Then, deep reinforcement learning is employed for CAV platooning at the latter segment, where low traffic flow density and large car-following distance create conditions for smooth lane change and platoon formulation of CAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that VSL-VP significantly enhances the bottleneck throughput and reduces traffic congestion at elevated levels of CAV penetration rates.},

A graph reasoning decoder block with attention-based feature fusion was proposed to capture the semantic associations between regions incorporating edge information. Moreover, the elastic interaction-based loss function, a groundbreaking loss function, was introduced to ensure that the segmentation of the fine branches should be achieved smoothly and consistently. Upon evaluation against a public urban street tree dataset, the precision, recall, IoU, and accuracy of tree branch segmentation are 94.39%, 93.16%, 88.27%, and 98.78%, respectively, achieving the best result among all the tested models.

  abstract  = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) for diabetes in China is the foundation for processing Chinese diabetic medical data. However, the structure of Chinese diabetes medical data is complex, with issues such as confusion between entity types and ambiguous entity boundaries, which pose difficulties and challenges for named entity recognition in Chinese diabetes data. Current mainstream named entity recognition models typically use single-feature representations of text, which do not fully use the features of the text, resulting in poor entity recognition performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a Chinese diabetes named entity recognition method that uses multi-feature fusion and a multi-head attention mechanism. It uses the RoBERTa-wwm pre-trained model to obtain character vectors from Chinese diabetes medical texts and enhances their semantic features by incorporating Chinese radical-level structural feature vectors. The obtained vectors are processed through a BiGRU module to extract global context features and a CNN module to capture multi-scale local features. After fusing these features, the most relevant feature information for entities is obtained by integrating the multi-head attention mechanism. Finally, the conditional random field is used for entity recognition to complete extraction of the entities. Experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits superior performance and achieves better results on the Chinese diabetes annotation dataset.},

  abstract  = {Traditional visual question answering (VQA) often falls short as merely relying on image information is insufficient to answer given questions. Therefore, Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) has emerged. Typically, KB-VQA involves first retrieving knowledge from external knowledge bases, then using the retrieved knowledge in conjunction with the understanding of visual content for joint reasoning to predict answers. However, current models often suffer from weak visual perception capabilities when processing image information. Additionally, due to the incompleteness of external knowledge bases, retrieved knowledge may contain noise or even irrelevant information. Moreover, the re-embedding of knowledge text features during the model&#39;s reasoning process may deviate from the original meanings in the knowledge base. To address these challenges, we propose a method for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) using GPT-3.5, leveraging image captions and in-context prompts. We utilize an advanced captioning model to convert images into accurate textual representations, enhancing the large language model&#39;s understanding of visual information. Moreover, we eliminate the need for additional knowledge bases by directly employing GPT-3.5 as a knowledge base for knowledge retrieval and generate logically consistent text during inference to predict answers. Furthermore, we enhance GPT-3.5&#39;s question-answering capability for VQA through in-context prompt learning. Experiments on the public OK-VQA dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our model.},

  abstract  = {Manufacturing specifications contain a large number of terms, which makes general domain text error detection methods ineffective in manufacturing. Existing text error detection methods have a limited utilization of term dictionary, and the challenge lies in the inability to determine whether a word not in the term dictionary is an out-of-vocabulary word or a miswritten word. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Miswritten Term Pre-check feature Matrix (MTP-Matrix), which leverages n-gram similarity matching method to pre-check potential miswritten terms. Besides, we capture the information about error positions and types of miswritten terms through adding Attention-enhanced Network with Local Feature (ANLF), which enhances the representation of miswritten terms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MTP-Matrix and ANLF can improve the F1 values of all baselines. The highest F1 value reaches 76.84%, and the F1 value of term error detection increases by 6.09%.},

  abstract  = {Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that progresses in a slow and irreversible manner. Although many computer-aided methods have been used to diagnose AD, the issue of underutilization of detailed information and features persists. In this study, we propose a new AD diagnostic network (FPRes-Net) that can fully learn the rich information of 3D MRI slices by extracting multi-scale features and feature fusion. Firstly, in order to fully extract multi-scale information, a network structure combining ResNet-50 with feature pyramids was designed. Next, a feature fusion method was designed to reduce noise and increase the importance of important features. Finally, a visually interpretable method called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was introduced to visualize important feature regions in AD diagnosis. Experimental analysis was conducted on the publicly accessible ADNI-1 dataset, and our proposed FPRes-Net model performed better than other advanced research methods, with an accuracy rate of 99.5%. Our proposed model can be effectively used for clinical diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract  = {In the current context of proliferation of news information, personalised news recommendation is important to help users quickly access content of interest. Existing approaches tend to ignore the diversity of users&#39; reading behaviours and the variability of news topics within a session. They tend to assume that all the news read or clicked within a session are attributed to one main interest, while in reality, each news session may cover a variety of news with different interests corresponding to different topics. The paper introduces a news session recommendation approach that utilizes both long-and short-term representations of user interests, incorporating multi-view learning techniques, and the method treats the clicking behaviours of anonymous users as a session: initially, a multi-scale convolutional neural network is employed to capture the features of user-clicked news articles from mul-tiple viewpoints; Subsequently, a GRU multi-channel interest decoupler is crafted to identify potential interests within each clicked news item, enabling the modeling of diverse interests to capture the user&#39;s long-term preferences. Concurrently, recent user-clicked news items are considered as short-term interests. These long and short-term interests are then amalgamated to create the ultimate user interest representation; Finally, the user&#39;s preference value for the candidate news is calculated by click-summing and the final recommendation result is generated. By comparing with the benchmark method on the real data set, the findings demonstrate strong performance on objective evaluation metrics such as Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), affirming the efficacy of the proposed method for news recommendation.},

  abstract  = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control technique that employs a dynamic model of the controlled process and an optimization algorithm to determine the control strategy. Nevertheless, the cost and effort required to create and maintain dynamical models are often high, and solving the resulting optimal control problem can be computationally complex. In recent years, data-driven modeling has become an attractive alternative to approximate the behavior of dynamical systems, with the aim of alleviating these issues. However, using such models for model-based control can be challenging due to their typically nonlinear and nonconvex nature. To address these issues, we propose a recursive multi-step learning-based dynamical modeling framework to capture the temporal behavior of dynamic systems. We take advantage of Input Convex Lipschitz Neural Networks, which are explicitly designed to be convex and continuous with respect to their in-puts. We further show that these mathematical proprieties hold in a multi-step dynamical modeling framework. The proposed approach is evaluated in a real-life MPC experiment conducted in a smart building in the Samso Marina, Denmark. We show that the proposed approach keeps the internal temperature within comfort constraints while minimizing heating/cooling energy consumption.},

Input shaping technology enables stable performance for high-speed motion in industrial motion systems. However, existing input shapers commonly suffer from the ineffective control performance caused by the ignorance of observation error errors. To address this critical issue, this paper proposes an Extended Kalman Filter-incorporated Residual Neural Network-based input Shaping (ERS) model for vibration control. Its main ideas are two-fold: a) adopting an extended Kalman filter to address a vertical flexible beam&#39;s model errors; and b) adopting a residual neural network to cascade with the extended Kalman filter for eliminating the remaining observation errors. Detailed experiments on a real dataset collected from a vertical flexible beam demonstrate that the proposed ERS model has achieved significant vibration control performance over several state-of-the-art models.},

Electric wheelchairs enhance social activities by expanding the mobility range of older people. However, the proportion of accidents involving electric mobility devices is high among people aged 70 years and above. This is because of decreased sensory and cognitive speeds and motor function. To improve these factors, we focused on surface electromyograms (sEMG) that are output before the start of movement. Using this signal, we used machine learning to estimate the distance and direction of movement of a hand before concluding the control operation of the wheelchair. Multiple features, including frequency and magnitude sum, were determined from the measured sEMG, and two types of machine learning, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were used to identify the distance and direction of movement. Three types of movement distances and four types of movement directions were identified. The feature importance was calculated, and those contributing to the distance and direction discrimination were determined and compared for each machine learning method. The discrimination rate using an RF was higher than that using SVM. The results are discussed, focusing on the importance of features for each participant.},

Additionally, it incorporates an adaptive model pool to manage the time-varying concept drift commonly observed in dynamic data streams. This flexible and dynamic management mechanism allows the model to adapt to changes in the data stream, maintaining robust anomaly detection performance across various conditions. Empirical validation of our model through ten comparative experiments on high-dimensional datasets affected by concept drift shows that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

In particular, information spectrum methods, which is one of efficient techniques in information theory, have been applied to the hypothesis testing problem, and have succeeded in giving the general formula of the optimum hypothesis testing exponent. Recently, two typical extensions of the binary hypothesis testing setting have received much attention. One is the case where we do not know the probabilistic distributions. The other is the hypothesis testing problem in the presence of noise. However, information spectrum methods have not yet been applied to the hypothesis testing in these two directions. Hence, in this paper we develop information spectrum methods to treat the hypothesis testing in these settings. In particular, we first consider the hypothesis testing with noise and show the optimum exponent of the type II error probability under the condition that the type I error probability is smaller than or equal to some constant. Then, we extend this result to the case where probability distributions of data are unknown.},

In this paper, the adversarial learning is introduced into quantum control and the loss function under the worst-case noise is used as a way to quantify the impact of time-varying noises on control performance. We utilize the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) technique to search the worst-case noise and meanwhile offer a strategy to improve the robustness of the control law. Simulation experiments on a two-qubit system and a four-qubit system show that the found noises indeed can act as worst-case noises. Furthermore, the optimized control laws demonstrate good robustness to time-varying noises in state preparation tasks.},

  abstract  = {As a method of evaluating user preferences for items such as products and designs, the pairwise comparison method, where the user chooses which of two items is preferable, is often employed. Since the preference for items varies among users, clustering methods such as k-means can be applied to capture these tendencies. However, as the number of items increases, the number of comparisons also increases. Therefore, missing values occur when users do not answer due to fatigue, or when experimenters reduce the number of comparisons in advance. The net-win vector, which counts the number of wins for each item against others, has robustness for clustering with missing values. In this paper, we propose a multiple imputation method for clustering pairwise comparison data. Our approach combines the net-win vector with missing-value imputation using the Bradley-Terry model and consensus clustering to integrate multiple clustering results. Furthermore, we attempt to improve performance by iteration between missing value imputation and clustering.

This paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network to improve invisible attack detection in smart grids. First, graph theory and grid knowledge are utilized for modeling in order to learn graph structure and spatial features. Secondly, hidden features are extracted based on the graph attention mechanism to predict the future behavior of nodes. Thirdly, graph deviation score is calculated from the end-to-end learned node deviations, which is the judgement for identifying attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that our method identify attacks more accurately than baseline methods.},

The economic analysis reveals an attractive net present cost of $3.26 million over the MG&#39;s 25-year lifetime, with a competitive levelized cost of energy of $0.196 per kWh. The environmental impact assessment quantifies a significant reduction of 394.429 tonnes of $CO_{2}{-}$ equivalent greenhouse gas emissions annually through the integration of 200 kW of solar photovoltaic and 258 kW of wind turbines. The resilience assessment demonstrates a high energy reliability with zero unmet loads facilitated by backup systems and decision-making tools.

  abstract  = {Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neurological disease that is difficult to diagnose and requires long-term management. The progression of this disease is reflected to some extent in changes in speech, such as hoarseness and articulation disorders. However, it is difficult for general neurologists to grasp the diagnostic patterns of such rare diseases, especially in underdeveloped regions. As an emerging field, speech-based intelligent diagnostic assistance provides a safe, non-invasive, and convenient solution for healthcare education management. To this end, we firstly constructed a novel Chinese speech dataset of myasthenia gravis patients (MGCS). Then we proposed a network named Myasthenia Gravis Speech Net (MGS-Net) for the classification of myasthenia gravis pathological speech, which is mainly composed of two blocks: the Local Feature Enhancement (LFE) block and the Feedforward Dense (FFD) block. The LFE block extracts temporal local features using a sliding window approach, while the FFD block captures the global representation of the data. Compared to existing methods, our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 98.75% and a recall rate of 99.17%. We validated the effectiveness of existing acoustic feature sets in pathological speech classification of MG, which will provide an important tool for health education management of neurological diseases.},

However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific traffic networks at particular time periods. Consequently, deep learning models trained on one network may struggle to generalize effectively to unseen networks. To address this, we proposed a novel spatial-temporal trajectory prediction framework that performs cross-domain adaption on the attention representation of a Transformer-based model. A graph convolutional network is also integrated to construct dynamic graph feature embeddings that accurately model the complex spatial-temporal interactions between the multi-agent vehicles across multiple traffic domains. The proposed framework is validated on two case studies involving the cross-city and cross-period settings. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves superior trajectory prediction and domain adaptation performances over the state-of-the-art models.},

A large number of vehicles get access to the shared channel resources to broadcast their states information, which may lead to channel congestion. The existing channel congestion solutions mainly focus on the media access control layer state to optimize channel resource utilization, without considering the impact of the physical layer on successful packet reception performance. In this article, we propose a packet reception model to represent the successful reception rate of state packets under the influence of interference signals and noise, and design an application-specific utility function. This utility considers the states of the physical layer and the media access control layer to balance reducing the physical layer interference and meeting application requirements. We then propose a distributed joint power and rate control algorithm that uses on-demand mode to allocate channel resources to meet the safety application requirements of each vehicle. The simulation results show that our work can effectively prevent channel congestion and improve the safety performance of vehicles in different driving scenarios.},

In the proposed framework, the population of each task is divided into better-performing and worse-performing sub-populations. A random exchange strategy is designed for the former, while an inter-task knowledge transfer strategy is proposed for the latter with the aim for improving the population diversity.

In particular, these applications have specific requirements in terms of delay. Meeting specific delay requirements without high throughput loss is difficult, especially in dynamic networks. In addition, it is important that the proposed congestion control algorithms can be easily deployed. In this paper, we propose a congestion control algorithm, namely TD-BBR, to meet the delay requirements of different applications. TD-BBR is built on BBR and can adapt to various network environments without high throughput loss. we employ an online algorithm based on the recursive least squares method to predict future bandwidth. We design a simple and effective algorithm to adjust the congestion window (CWND) to meet the specific delay requirements according to the value of bandwidth prediction and the distance between the current delay and the target delay. We implement a real congestion control system through extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology and have deployed it in the Linux kernel without recompiling the kernel. Extensive experiments show that TD-BBR can effectively meet different delay requirements in most cases, decrease the 95th percentile delay, and avoid high throughput loss compared to other congestion control algorithms,},

For safe planning, AV/ego must understand the weightage of various spatiotemporal interactions in a scene. Contemporary works use colos-sal transformer architectures to encode interactions mainly for trajectory prediction, resulting in increased computational complexity. To address this issue without compromising spatiotemporal understanding and performance, we propose the simple Deep Attention Driven Reinforcement Learning (DAD-RL) framework, which dynamically assigns and incorporates the significance of surrounding vehicles into the ego&#39;s RL-driven decision-making process. We introduce an AV-centric spatiotemporal attention encoding (STAE) mechanism for learning the dynamic interactions with different surrounding vehicles. To understand map and route context, we employ a context encoder to extract features from context maps. The spatiotemporal representations combined with contextual encoding provide a comprehensive state representation. The resulting model is trained using the Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm. We evaluate the proposed framework on the SMARTS urban benchmarking scenarios without traffic signals to demonstrate that DAD-RL outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an ablation study underscores the importance of the context-encoder and spatiotemporal attention encoder in achieving superior performance.},

To stay within sight, the robot needs to follow the leader from a different position. This paper presents a front-following system for an autonomous mobile robot using a Kinect sensor. Research effort is concentrated on control of the robot, which walks in front of the human leader. For a general human-following system, especially for front-following, both localization of the robot and the prediction of the human&#39;s motion and state position are necessary. However, the framework proposed in this study uses a machine-learning-based prediction system to direct the robot ahead of the human without the need for robot localization. The proposed human motion prediction neural network predicts the 3D coordinates of a human walking behind the robot and, when combined with a proportional-integral-differential controller to control robot movement, enables accurate following for turning angles up to $100^{\circ}$. Since robot localization is not required, only one Kinect sensor is needed. The front-following system is validated via both simulation and real-time experiments, demonstrating overall success in front-following for wide and narrow spaces.},

By capturing function descriptions of assembly functions and introducing prompt learning, effective inference of function names is achieved. In experiments, PTGFI outperforms the state-of-the-art model by 2.96 % in precision. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced components within the PTGFI framework. We further validate the utility and reliability of function names generated by the PTGFI framework through case studies.},

  abstract  = {Ship operation time is a crucial factor in developing berth plans. While most existing research focuses on container terminals, few scholars have examined bulk cargo terminals due to the unique nature of their cargo and complex operational processes. This work proposes a berth characteristic classification-based prediction method (BCCPM) to predict the operation time of ships in bulk cargo terminals. Firstly, recognizing both the similarities and differences among berths in bulk cargo terminals, this paper introduces a berth clustering method based on K-means to group berths with similar operational traits. Then, to conquer the limitations of individual machine learning models in prediction, a stacking ensemble learning approach is proposed for predicting ship operation time in various types of berths. Experiments are conducted on the real operation data from Qingdao dry bulk cargo terminal, China. The results show that outperforms single machine learning models in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization. Moreover, BCCPM effectively captures operational nuances of different berths, resulting in a 2-hour reduction in MAE and a 6% decrease in MAPE compared to the overall prediction method.},

  abstract  = {Federated learning is an emerging machine learning framework, which is commonly used in the structure of distributed machine learning due to its characteristic of “data immutable model motion”. In practical scenarios, the data samples and hardware conditions between clients are highly heterogeneous. The traditional simple aggregation can cause the global model to unintentionally favor certain clients. There is a significant performance gap between vulnerable groups and groups with richer training resources in the global model. This paper proposes Dynamic Momentum-based Federated Learning (DMFL) to address this issue. It dynamically adjusts the client aggregation weight based on historical performance and current round losses in each round. Experimental results show that DMFL can improve the effectiveness of the overall model while reducing the variance of the client accuracy distribution. Compared to existing baselines, the proposed algorithm performs superior fairness in results.},

  abstract  = {Recently, there has been extensive research on multi-objective feature selection (FS). In general, minimizing the number of selected features and maximizing classification performance are two primary objectives of most multi-objective FS tasks. However, due to complex interactions among features, a subset with poor classification performance does not necessarily imply uselessness; for instance, some features, when combined with others, can significantly enhance classification performance. Therefore, not only the classification performance of feature subsets but also their diversity in the search space should be considered. Motivated by this, this paper proposes an evolutionary multitasking based optimization framework, named multi-objective feature selection with enhanced diversity and opposition-based learning. Firstly, it utilizes two different forms of single-objective FS tasks to provide feature subsets with better classification performance and greater diversity for the multi-objective FS task at hand, thereby promoting evolutionary search in multi-objective FS tasks. Then, to explore more feature combinations, a novel crossover operator utilizing opposition-based learning is proposed to search for more promising feature subsets. Additionally, a duplicate solution handling approach is proposed to maintain population diversity. Experimental results on ten classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms five state-of-the-art FS methods in most cases.},

However, it encounters difficulties to expand in tasks with sparse external rewards. Among them, the issues of exploration inefficiency and non-stationarity are serious. In this paper, we propose a novel HRL approach in which we design two measures for subgoals: balance and potentiality. By generating a new subgoal and strategically extending it toward more promising regions, we enhance exploration efficiency by striking a balance in the process. Lastly, leveraging the two measures, we employ an active exploration policy to prevent the introduction of low-level intrinsic rewards, which naturally avoids non-stationary problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art HRL baselines in MuJoCo tasks with sparse rewards.},

However, data heterogeneity across various clients results in catastrophic forget-ting, where the model rapidly forgets previous knowledge while acquiring new knowledge. To address this challenge, personalized federated learning has emerged to customize a personalized model for each client. However, the inherent limitation of this mechanism is its excessive focus on personalization, potentially hindering the generalization of those models. In this paper, we present a novel personalized federated learning method that uses global and historical models as teachers and the local model as the student to facilitate comprehensive knowledge distillation. The historical model represents the local model from the last round of client training, containing historical personalized knowledge, while the global model represents the aggregated model from the last round of server aggregation, containing global generalized knowledge. By applying knowledge distillation, we effectively transfer global generalized knowledge and historical personalized knowledge to the local model, thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing the general performance of personalized models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages of our method.},

While systematics and taxonomies have been extensively studied in biology, there is no general taxonomy that can identify and classify man-made systems in general. Machines are increasingly becoming complex, diverse, and most importantly autonomous, and as they pervasively co-exist with humans and animals in nature, the absence of a unified classification system presents significant challenges in safety, communication, and effective development of future machines. The key contributions of this research are three-fold. First on analysis: it examines in depth the current industry standards and academic literature and identifies major issues in building a taxonomy. Second on synthesis: it establishes a general principle to classify broad classes of machines and builds a coding scheme for consistent naming, identification, and classification. Third on applications: it provides exemplifying use cases to demonstrate the utility of the proposed system. The result is a general taxonomic classification system that categorizes machines not just by their physical attributes, but from the principled perspectives of autonomy, ecology, and anthropogenic factors. This interdisciplinary approach offers a robust, inclusive taxonomic framework that encompasses a broad spectrum of machines, including software and learning systems.},

Lying rate (%) was calculated using 3-axis acceleration and grouped into subjects with long and short sleep time. HRV indices were calculated from 1-day ECG data. As a result, RRI increased (P&lt;0.001) and the low frequency power of ULF, VLF, and LF significantly decreased or decreased trend in the long sleep time group than the short sleep time group. A decrease in LF/HF was also observed. It is suggested that long hours of sleep-in older adults who are less daily activity may decrease HRV.},

Specifically, we establish the Chinese few-shot relation extraction datasets DUIE Few and SanWen Few. Notably, we introduce a framework based on large language models for dataset augmentation, which effectively alleviates the problem of feature extraction due to insufficient data and improves task performance. Finally, we present baselines for prototype networks, Siamese networks, and the CFSRE model based on relational category information. Experimental results show that the CFSRE model improves accuracy, recall, and F1 score under few-shot conditions, particularly as the sample size decreases.

  abstract  = {In the social media, users frequently express personal emotions, a subset of which may indicate potential suicidal tendencies. The implicit and varied forms of expression in internet language complicate accurate and rapid identification of suicidal intent on social media, thus creating challenges for timely intervention efforts. The development of deep learning models for suicide risk detection is a promising solution, but there is a notable lack of relevant datasets, especially in the Chinese context. To address this gap, this study presents a Chinese social media dataset designed for fine-grained suicide risk classification, focusing on indicators such as expressions of suicide intent, methods of suicide, and urgency of timing. Seven pre-trained models were evaluated in two tasks: high and low suicide risk, and fine-grained suicide risk classification on a level of 0 to 10. In our experiments, deep learning models show good performance in distinguishing between high and low suicide risk, with the best model achieving an F1 score of 88.39%. However, the results for fine-grained suicide risk classification were still unsatisfactory, with the best weighted F1 score of 50.89%. To address the issues of data imbalance and limited dataset size, we investigated both traditional and advanced, large language model based data augmentation techniques, demonstrating that data augmentation can enhance this model performance by up to 4.65% points in F1-score. Notably, the Chinese MentalBERT model, which was pre-trained on psychological domain data, shows superior performance in both tasks. This study provides valuable insights for automatic identification of suicidal individuals, facilitating timely psychological intervention on social media platforms.

  abstract  = {Physiological sensors are commonly applied for user state monitoring and consequent machine behavior adaptation in applications such as rehabilitation and intelligent cars. While more accurate user state monitoring is known to lead to better user experience, increased accuracy often requires more sensors or more complex sensors. The increased setup time and discomfort involved in the use of such sensors may itself worsen user experience. To examine this effect, we conducted a study where 72 participants interacted with a computer-based multitasking scenario whose difficulty was periodically adapted - ostensibly based on data from either a remote eye tracker or a lab-grade “wet” electroencephalography sensor. Deception was used to ensure consistent difficulty adaptation accuracies, and user experience was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, NASA Task Load Index, and an ad-hoc scale. We found few user experience differences between the eye tracker and electroencephalography sensor - while one interaction effect was noted, it was small, and there were no other differences. This result is at first surprising and seems to indicate that comfort and setup time are not major factors for laboratory-based user experience evaluations of such technologies. However, the result is likely due to a suboptimal study protocol where each participant interacted with only one sensor. In future work, we will use an alternate protocol to further explore the effects of user comfort and setup time on user experience.},

  abstract  = {In the domain of blind soccer, proficient sound localization, utilizing auditory cues, is essential for player performance. This study explores the capacity of individuals to accurately localize static and dynamic auditory cues in an environment that allows free neck movement and investigates the strategies of head movement that contribute to optimal sound localization. Through enhancements to our virtual reality system, we conducted comprehensive verification tests to assess these abilities. Our analysis reveals that sighted players with experience in blind soccer tend to augment their sound localization capability for static sources through more pronounced and frequent head movements. Conversely, visually impaired players exhibit superior localization accuracy for both types of sound sources with minimal, yet efficient, head movements. A critical observation from this study is the differential performance in localizing dynamic sound sources; sighted players, despite active head movements, were unable to match the localization precision of their visually impaired peers. This disparity underscores the necessity for sighted players to refine their head movement techniques for improved sound localization. Importantly, this research also introduces a comparative analysis of simultaneous static and dynamic sound source localization, highlighting the complexities and adaptive strategies required for effective auditory perception in blind soccer.},

In this work, we introduce a multi-level feature matching framework for person re-identification that leverages both local and global visual cues. The framework stratifies the re-identification task into two concurrent pipelines. Within these pipelines, this paper presents a pair of novel semi-coupled dictionary learning (SCDL) algorithms to develop distinct yet complementary feature representations: (1) The Local SCDL (L-SCDL) algorithm focuses on region-level descriptors, mapping them to a mutual feature space that diminishes the influence of camera-specific variations. (2) The Global SCDL (G-SCDL) algorithm, on the other hand, is designed to harmonize global appearance attributes, thereby enhancing the robustness of image-level descriptor matching. These two complementary components synergistically exploit both global and local visual cues, thereby enhancing the discriminative ability of our approach. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed person re-identification framework compared to several mainstream approaches.},

Nevertheless, in the face of sudden disasters, the traditional multi-machine collaborative operations have unclear operation area allocations, simplistic path planning, and scheduling algorithms easily falling into the local optimal solution, resulting in low efficiency and inability to meet the task needs of urgent tasks. A multiple agricultural machine cooperative scheduling method based on farmland segmentation is proposed to solve these problems. The method first segmented large-scale farmland based on multiple machine task requirements to obtain location information for the segmented sub-regions. Next, to minimize the turning time in the headland, complete coverage path planning inside the field is planned to obtain the best coverage angle and the shortest operation time. Lastly, an optimal simulated annealing algorithm is employed to obtain the task allocation of agricultural machinery to minimize the longest working time. The simulation results show that the study has achieved optimization results. Under urgent tasks, the method can effectively schedule agricultural machine resources, ensuring task completion and generating a high-yield solution.},

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is effective and simple to implement and has minimal parameter requirements, making it highly suitable for FS challenges. However, PSO can suffer from premature convergence and difficulty escaping local optima. To address this issue, our paper proposes a novel PSO-based feature selection technique featuring a multilevel updating strategy (MLUSPSO). This method starts with a unique classification approach in which the particle swarm is divided into three groups: elite, medium, and weak. This division is based on each particle&#39;s fitness and exploratory abilities, thereby fostering diversity in each group. Next, we define specific updating strategies for the feature subsets chosen by these particle groups. Notably, we devise a new correlation-based strategy to update weak-class particles, enhancing their exploratory potential in the feature space through the incorporation of correlation data. Comparative tests revealed that MLUSPSO outperforms other high-dimensional classification feature selection methods by delivering feature subsets with superior classification accuracy and fewer features.},

Although conventional algorithms are effective in exploring solution spaces and generating non-dominated solutions, solution quality and dynamic adaptability of true Pareto fronts need to be improved. This work proposes a multi-objective algorithm that integrates Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (N-MORL). N-MORL consists of two parts including upstream and downstream components. In the upstream component, this work improves the Variance-stabilized Multi-objective Proximal Policy Optimization (VMPPO) for enhanced convergence stability by adjusting its iteration mechanism. Additionally, this work optimizes variance networks and action sampling to balance exploration and exploitation, which improves experience sampling efficiency. This work adopts high-quality solution sets yielded by MORL as the initial solution set for downstream NSGA-II, guiding the exploration space and increasing the solution number. High-quality initial solutions significantly accelerate the iterative convergence speed of N-MORL. N-MORL provides the quality and the number of solutions, better covering or approaching the true Pareto front. Experimental results with five benchmark multi-objective functions demonstrate that N-MORL outperforms the other three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms regarding high-quality solutions with the same iterations.},

Firstly, learning factors and inertia weights are dynamically adjusted in the search process to achieve a balance between global exploration and local exploitation. Subsequently, the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is utilized in the early search phase to help the algorithm escape from local optima and enhance its ability to discover the global optimal solution, while retaining the fast convergence characteristic of PSO. Moreover, to rectify the challenge of particle oscillation appeared in the search process, SDPSO embeds a dimensional learning strategy (DLS), which enables all dimensions of each particle to learn useful information from the global optimal. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating SA in the first 30 iterations of the algorithm not only enhance the capability of jumping out from local optima, but also maintains the rapid convergence characteristic of PSO. Comparative experiments conducted in two distinct environments reveal that SDPSO exhibits advantages in terms of optimization capability, convergence rate, and robustness when compared to other algorithms.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel Feature Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network(FP-GCN) that enhances the representational capability of the model by capturing the multi-scale spatial features of the skeleton sequence. In detail, we propose an attention-based graph pooling module that effectively contracts the skeleton to multiple lower-order sub-graphs, which serve as spatial representations of the skeleton at corresponding levels. The original skeleton and these sub-graphs are combined to form the feature pyramid, where joints of each level span in the same semantic space. Additionally, we introduce a graph unpooling module to restore the pooled sub-graphs to their original topology. Moreover, we adopt a multi-loss strategy across different spatial scales, encouraging the model to learn more comprehensive skeletal features. Finally, we validate our proposed model on three large-scale datasets, achieving the highest accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract  = {Virtual reality (VR) simulation can improve the outcomes of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNCL) - a surgery to extract kidney stones using ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy image guidance. These simulators almost exclusively employ fluoroscopy, and no commercial VR simulator is available for US-guided PNCL (usPCNL). In this paper, we proposed the first step towards developing an usPCNL simulator that integrates a volumetric US model of the patient&#39;s anatomy derived from parallel 2D computed tomography (CT) scans. A critical challenge in US image generation from CT scans is that the limited spatial resolution of CT slices may lead to inaccuracies in the simulated US images. The proposed algorithm interpolates successive CT images to create an augmented dataset with increased spatial resolution. Each CT slice is then converted into a US image based on principles of linear acoustics and spatial impulse response. These images are then combined to form two different volumetric US images, one derived from the original sparse CT scans, and one created with the augmented data. From these volumetric US images, new images can be formed along arbitrary imaging planes not captured in the original CT data. The obtained simulated images are compared with their corresponding real US images acquired experimentally, and further evaluated quantitatively using normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The results reveal an NRMSE of $\mathbf{0.235}\pm \mathbf{0.051}$ and a DSC of $\mathbf{0.9139}\pm \mathbf{0.062}$, showcasing a close resemblance between simulated and actual ultrasound images. Additionally, we show that denser CT scan data leads to a 25% improvement in image quality based on peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to the original dataset. This initial work is laying the foundation for the development of the usPCNL simulator, which could potentially have significant benefits for training and enhancing skills in this medical procedure.},

The degradation diminishes the clarity and readability of document images, thereby complicating their application to OCR downstream tasks. Existing methods typically address only one or a limited number of degradation types and do not consider the diversity of image degradation types. Additionally, these methods typically involve a pre-trained fixed sub-network to estimate background light or shadows, which lacks flexibility and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel framework named DLE, which comprises a two-loop generative adversarial network and a multi-modal discriminator. Specifically, to improve the quality of image representation, a mask extractor is embedded before the image input generator. This forces the model to focus on the distinct features in the image, enhancing the representation of illumination anomalous and degraded regions. The mask extractor generates a luminance mask to evaluate the difference in illumination between the input and target images. Subsequently, the consistency loss computation incorporates a dynamic optimization of the mask extractor, strengthening its ability to estimate the illumination degradation part. Moreover, a pre-trained visual-language model is introduced into the multi-modal discriminator, leveraging its robust cross-modal alignment capability to improve the semantic consistency of the generated images with the preset input text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves the SOTA performance in terms of edit distance (ED) and character error rate (CER).},

We address this problem from the perspective of audio watermarking; to our best knowledge, this is the first-known watermarking based approach to solve the problem of distinguishing realistic songs synthesized from generative AI models from real songs sung by humans. In more detail, our approach specifically utilizes the SHA-256 hash function, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for robust audio watermarking of synthesized songs. Before embedding, the audio is subjected to an attack phase to pinpoint less vulnerable regions for QR watermark placement. During the embedding process, the audio chunks first undergo a 1-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and then the resulting approximate coefficients go through Singular Value Decompo-sition (SVD). Additionally, the watermarked array is subjected to SHA-256 hashing for collision-resistant conciseness, which is subsequently embedded into the singular values of the audio. Experimental findings demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing audio watermarking approaches under various signal attack scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Textural Vulnerability Descriptions(TVD) refers to the natural language description of a vulnerability in databases like National Vulnerability Database(NVD) and China National Vulnerability Database(CNVD), which typically provides a concise summary of critical vulnerability details. To facilitate the understanding of domain-specific terms in TVD and the accurate extraction of information, we have introduced a bilingual domain-adaptation pre-trained model called BTVD-BERT, aimed at enhancing the model&#39;s capability to process and understand vulnerability descriptions in both Chinese and English. We explore three issues, the first being the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the model. Second, how should the dataset be proportioned to best enhance the model&#39;s generalization capabilities across both Chinese and English. Third, the addition of extra task-related metric information to the original dataset to construct a higher quality dataset, and whether training with this high-quality dataset can further improve model performance. We attempted to study the issues from a data engineering perspective and conducted numerous ablation experiments to find answers to these three questions. The experimental results indicate that catastrophic forgetting adversely affects the model, causing it to forget previously acquired knowledge while better retaining more recently obtained information. By employing a training approach using a mix of Chinese and English data, we were able to mitigate the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the model to some extent. Optimizing data proportions and improving data quality can effectively enhance the overall performance of the model. This study not only enhances the identification and analysis of security vulnerabilities but also offers new perspectives and empirical support for the research of multilingual domain-adaptive models.},

  abstract  = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification is an important task in healthcare as it plays a vital role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we propose an attention-based hybrid ResNet-Transformer network (ART-Net) for 12-lead ECG signal classification. It is comprised of a stacked multi-scale attention-based ResNet and self-attention-based Transformer. At first, ECG signals are divided into several signal segments with the same length. Then multi-scale features are extracted by attention-based Resnet through signal segments, and attention mechanisms are used to adjust the weight of different channel features based on their importance. Next, these multi-scale features from a same ECG signal are integrated in chronological order as input to the Transformer network. In this end, extracting and fusing contextual information based on self-attention mechanism, and extracting the correlation between beats at different positions. The experimental results on CPSC2018 indicate that our model outperforms three state-of-the-art methods, and achieve 85.27% of accuracy, 86.01% of sensitivity and 85.59% of specificity, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across various domains in natural language processing. However, LLMs can produce fictional content, which we refer to as hallucinations, and it makes the LLMs unreliable. An important research topic is how to make LLMs accurately express the confidence to their answers, so they can refrain from outputting or regenerate output in cases of low-confidence predictions. It facilitates the application of LLMs in high-stakes areas. Currently, research on eliciting calibrated confidence from LLMs is still insufficient. Additionally, methods for estimating uncertainty in responses based on internal parameters of LLMs become unavailable, as many existing LLMs are black boxes served via APIs. Therefore, we analyze the existing confidence elicitation methods and propose COVO, a new confidence elicitation method that allows the black-box LLMs to output their confidence levels by letting the LLM itself judges whether the answer comes from a reliable source. Our method does not require external knowledge and it has high computational efficiency. Experiments show that COVO achieves better calibration and effectively reduces hallucinations in LLMs through selective generation. Additionally, the confidence scores enhance the reliability of the LLMs&#39; responses.},

To solve this challenge, this paper presents a novel solution termed the Meta-learning ID Embedding Generator (MIG). MIG addresses the cold-start problem in task recommendation systems by efficiently learning suitable ID embeddings for new workers. MIG consists of an initial embedding generator for generating the initial ID embedding, alongside two adaptors designed to iteratively refine this embedding on the worker&#39;s competence and interest. The efficacy of this method has been assessed using authentic data sourced from Freelancer.com, a leading online labor marketplace. The empirical findings demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods when addressing the needs of two challenging user segments: newcomers to the platform and long-inactive users whose bidding records are sparse. MIG can seamlessly integrate into existing task recommendation systems, thereby enhancing their effectiveness, particularly in cold start scenarios.},

In this transformation process, knowledge tracing technology is a key tool for assessing student learning behavior. Knowledge tracing aims to trace and assess students&#39; understanding and mastery of individual knowledge points in real-time by analyzing data from students&#39; previous answers to construct models. With the continuous advancement of deep learning technology in recent years, knowledge tracing has evolved into a mainstream approach for modelling students&#39; mastery of knowledge in educational assessment, predominantly employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Aiming at the challenges RNN face in handling long-term data dependencies, this paper proposes a hybrid knowledge tracing model that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed model is tested and evaluated on three public datasets, ASSISTments2009, ASSISTments2017, and Statics2011.

First, we propose a cluster segmentation method based on region preference similarity, aggregating users from similar regions into the same cluster by considering content similarity and region distance similarity. This fine-grained segmentation method effectively enables each SBS better to provide personalized services to users in specific groups. Second, we adopt a comprehensive approach that considers multiple contextual features to train the Variational Auto-Encoder(VAE) model in SBS and learn its latent representations to improve the accuracy and reliability of model prediction. Finally, we construct a personalized model for SBS based on elastic federated learning. Specifically, we achieved personalized learning and prevalence prediction of SBS by dynamically adjusting the learning process of each SBS and comprehensively considering the differences between global and local models. Experimental results show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 28.10% compared to existing strategies.},

  abstract  = {In actual conversational scenarios, we can often determine which parts of the previous dialogue are more critical based on the current inquiry. However, the existing contextual modeling methods often encode the query sentence and the dialogue history in a unified manner, which fails to effectively highlight the inference effect of the query sentence. Moreover, these methods typically process the dialogue history only at the information extraction level, neglecting the treatment of the context itself. In this paper, we propose a novel conversational context modeling technique called DialogNTM. Based on the guidance of the query sentence, the technology can effectively eliminate redundant information by reconstructing the representation of the context. Specifically, we have tweaked the memory and input flow of the Neural Turing Machine (NTM) to encode contextual information in memory and guide the read, write, and erase operations of memory through query sentence. This design simulates the human brain&#39;s dynamic retrieval and renewal mechanism of previous memories when dealing with current problems. We have conducted extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets to verify the effectiveness of the DialogNTM model. Compared to the benchmark model, DialogNTM showed significant performance improvements ranging from 11% to 73% across multiple automated evaluation metrics (3.52% to 8.68% in absolute terms).},

Accurately anticipating driving behaviors (e.g., left turn, right turn) of ego-vehicles 3–5 seconds before actual occurrences of maneuvers can help AI pilots planning safer trajectories or informing possible dangers to drivers. However, current DBP benchmark datasets, e.g., the Brain4Cars, are restricted by the limited amount of data samples and small number of behavior categories. Thus, there is an urgent need for creating a new larger-scale benchmark to help boost the studies of DBP. In this work, based on the annotations in the HRI Driving Dataset (HDD), we extract 5000+ clips from untrimmed multi-modal data sequences to form a new dataset, termed the HDD4DBP, as a convincing large-scale testbed for evaluating various DPB methods. Furthermore, inspired by the success of transformers on modeling long range dependence in sequences, we build a strong baseline with the vision transformer (ViT) backbone for predicting driving behaviors. Compared to previous representative baselines, a large margin performance gain can be achieved by our strong baseline on the HDD4DBP. Moreover, simply fine-tuning the pre-trained strong baseline can obtain the state-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset, thereby futher confirming the benefits of the HDD4DBP.

In this work, we present a model termed Charge Prediction Sequence Graph with External Knowledge (EK-CPSG), which integrates information about Criminal Charge Definitions (CCDs). This method is based on the charge prediction model CP-KG, which overcomes the problem of inaccurate charge prediction due to unbalanced data and incomplete extraction of key elements.

The experimental results indicate that EK-CPSG achieves scores of 90.96% in Macro-F1. Compared to the baseline model TFIDF-SVM, EK-CPSG shows significant improvements with 14.55%.

  abstract  = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing and learning representations from graph-structured data. A crucial prerequisite for the outstanding performance of GNNs is the availability of complete graph information, i.e., node features and graph structure, which is frequently unmet in real-world scenarios since graphs are often incomplete due to various uncontrollable factors. Existing approaches only focus on dealing with either incomplete features or incomplete structure, which leads to performance loss inevitably. To address this issue, this study proposes a mutual dual-stream graph neural network (MDS-GNN), which implements a mutual benefit learning between features and structure. Its main ideas are as follows: a) reconstructing the missing node features based on the initial incomplete graph structure; b) generating an augmented global graph based on the reconstructed node features, and propagating the incomplete node features on this global graph; and c) utilizing contrastive learning to make the dual-stream process mutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDS-GNN on incomplete graphs.},

  abstract  = {Water quality prediction has emerged as a prominent research problem in recent years, which entails a spatiotemporal prediction task. However, several challenges are associated with water quality prediction: 1) water quality time series exhibit complex nonlinear relationships, making prediction challenging; 2) water quality sensors are distributed across river networks, leading to strong spatial dependencies in water quality prediction; 3) current methods like traditional machine learning methods have poor accuracy in long-term water quality prediction. To solve these problems, this work proposes a spatiotemporal prediction model named Graph Attention Transformer with Dilated Causal Convolution and Laplacian Eigenvectors (GTDL). First, dilated causal convolution is adopted to extract temporal features of input sequences. Second, a transformer with Laplacian eigenvectors is designed to extract spatial dependencies of river networks. Third, residual connections are utilized at the output stage to enhance the accuracy of the long-term prediction. Finally, GTDL is evaluated with two real-world water quality datasets and experimental results prove that GTDL outperforms other baseline methods regarding the prediction accuracy. Specifically, compared with five state-of-the-art prediction models, GTDL improves the prediction accuracy by 11.3%-63.5% and 6%-52.4% on two datasets, respectively.},

The results show that the deliberate attack strategy has greater destructive power compared with the random attack strategy. Among them, the station-degree attack strategy has the greatest impact on the recovery capability of the metro network. Among the recovery strategies, scenarios 1 and 2 have the most effective inter-degree centrality-based recovery strategies, while scenarios 3 and 4 have the best station-degree-based recovery strategies.

However, current methods make it difficult to interpret different correlations among water quality parameters effectively. To solve this problem, this work proposes a parameter correlation-aware anomaly detection model, which integrates Dual sliding windows, Convolutional LSTM, and a Deep neural network with dropout, called for DCLD short. First, DCLD designs dual sliding windows to capture local and global patterns within the sequence of water quality. Second, DCLD adopts a stacked long short-term memory with a convolutional neural network to capture complex features and long-term dependencies in the time series.

However, existing studies mainly concentrate on energy consumption and latency problems, often neglecting issues about user mobility and potential privacy leakage within the MEC environment. Therefore, optimizing computation offloading and resource allocation for MEC-enabled IoT networks is essential.

  abstract  = {High quality spatiotemporal signal is vitally important for real application scenarios like energy management, traffic planning and cyber security. Due to the uncontrollable factors like abrupt sensors breakdown or communication fault, the spatiotemporal signal collected by sensors is always incomplete. A dynamic graph convolutional network (DGCN) is effective for processing spatiotemporal signal recovery. However, it adopts a static GCN and a sequence neural network to explore the spatial and temporal patterns, separately. Such a separated two-step processing is loose spatiotemporal, thereby failing to capture the complex inner spatiotemporal correlation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Compact-Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (CDGCN) for spatiotemporal signal recovery with the following two-fold ideas: a) leveraging the tensor M-product to build a unified tensor graph convolution framework, which considers both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously; and b) constructing a differential smoothness-based objective function to reduce the noise interference in spatiotemporal signal, thereby further improve the recovery accuracy. Experiments on real-world spatiotemporal datasets demonstrate that the proposed CDGCN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of recovery accuracy.},

In terms of accuracy in defending against malicious attacks, the GPNS achieves 96.49% and the CNC reaches 94.86%.

This greatly improves the efficiency of data processing, saves network bandwidth and cloud resources, and reduces operating and maintenance costs. However, it is a challenge of how to perform task scheduling. It is difficult to schedule tasks for joint optimization of the total energy consumption and completion time of a task sequence within a limited time in a resource-constrained cloud-edge system. The work proposes an improved Simulated-Annealing-based Firefly Algorithm with Linear position update, called SAFAL for short. SAFAL incorporates a simulated annealing mechanism and an efficient position update strategy into the firefly algorithm, enabling fireflies to find the optimal solution more quickly and avoid getting trapped in local optima. SAFAL adopts a probabilistic mapping operator to map the position of each firefly to a task scheduling sequence, thus linking the firefly space and the task space. Several test instances in cloud-edge systems are designed to validate the superiority of SAFAL over the firefly algorithm, simulated annealing, and firefly algorithm with a self-adaptive strategy. Results show that the weighted cost of total energy consumption and completion time of SAFAL is reduced by 16.32%, 17.62%, and 14.21%, respectively, with 20 tasks.},

Both approaches used the criticality of the situation to choose an assistance level, with one approach additionally integrating an eye-tracking-based measure of Situational Awareness (SA). Based on these triggers, the adaptive system used different levels of assistance for mission planning support. We compared these two adaptive conditions to a baseline setup without assistance and evaluated performance, workload, usability, and subjective SA. Performance was assessed by flight data and mission completion times, while workload, usability, and SA were assessed with standard questionnaires. Both assistance systems exceeded the non-assisted baseline in terms of mission time, workload management, SA, and usability. Pilots supported by adaptive assistance integrating both, criticality, and SA, showed improvements in subjective SA over the criticality-only-condition while demonstrating faster mission completion. The findings suggest that adaptive assistance, particularly when incorporating SA, can enhance pilot performance in MUM-T operations.},

The aim is to enhance mission planning, replanning, and execution in complex military air operations. The agent employs a hybrid Mixed-Initiative-Planning approach to autonomously adjust and optimize mission plans in real time, with the objective of reducing pilot workload, increasing situational awareness, and maintaining high mission success rates without increasing the risk of losses of unmanned assets. The agent integrates current environmental data and tactical situation changes into its planning processes, thereby closing the so-called “cognitive loop”. This is made possible by the use of sophisticated algorithms and planning problem modeling languages. The effectiveness of the Agent was evaluated through the participation of German Air Force pilots in both static and dynamic mission simulations. The dynamic simulations were conducted in a fully integrated Manned-Unmanned-Teaming fighter simulator, while the static missions required the pilots to create mission plans on a separate workstation. The simulations assessed the impact of the Agent on mission success and the pilot performance under varying levels of assistance. The results demonstrated that a situation-adapted assistance, which allows for dynamic and autonomous tactical adjustments by the Agent, most effectively enhances operational performance and pilot engagement without overwhelming the pilot or causing the pilot to over rely on automated systems.},

To assist wearers walking on various terrains in daily environments, accurate gait-mode recognition and seamless transition of control strategies are crucial for these devices. Due to the high diversity of terrains, such capabilities are usually subject to terrain conditions, making terrain detection an essential issue for LLPE control. In the paper, we proposed a method for terrain detection and modeling aimed at reconstructing terrains rather than merely classifying them to provide richer information for LLPE control, including online 2D terrain information and the relative foot position. The implementation of the proposed method relies on a sensor group consisting of a low-cost single-point laser sensor and two inertial measurement units (IMU) to simultaneously and continuously capture lower limb kinematic features and terrain features. A time-varying Kalman filter is employed to fuse these features, facilitating rapid and accurate modeling of different terrains such as level ground, stairs ascend/descend, and ramp ascend/descend. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated via experiments with two healthy subjects. The results show that the reconstructed terrains can provide accurate information for LLPE control, demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {In postural control, the light touch effect stabilizes posture by adding sensory cues when a part of the body, such as the fingertips, lightly touches a support surface. However, maintaining light touch can be difficult depending on individual characteristics and task difficulty. To address this challenge, we previously proposed a system that utilizes electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) on the index finger extensor muscle to maintain light touch. The present study aims to investigate the immediate after-effects of sustained light touch through the EMS-based system on postural control. Participants performed an eyes-closed single-leg stance without touch in the pre- and post-tests and performed the same task with their index finger lightly touching a handrail between the two tests (LT-test). During the LT test, the EMS group (n=10) lightly touched the handrail while EMS was administered, and the control group (n=10) performed the light touch without EMS. The postural sway parameters and electromyography were compared within each group between pre- and post-tests. The results showed a significant difference in the center of pressure sway in the EMS group, indicating decreased postural sway immediately after the LT test. This suggests that the sustained light touch with EMS enabled users to perceive more detailed sensory cues and facilitated the subsequent retention of postural control. Moreover, the postural stability was strongly associated with pelvic stability.},

  abstract  = {A dynamic weighted graph is frequently encountered in real-world industrial applications like Internet of Things, which can be modeled into a Third-order Incomplete (ToI) tensor. Correspondingly, each element of the ToI tensor represents an observed link of dynamic weighted graph. A nonnegative tensor CP decomposition (NTC)-based link prediction model has proven to be efficient in predicting the missing links of a dynamic weighted graph. However, the learning objective of existing NTC model is usually built via a standard Euclidean distance, which restricts model prediction ability due to its low generalization. To address this issue, this paper presents an Adaptive Nonnegative Tensor CP decomposition (ANTC) model with two ideas include: a) adopting the $\beta$ -divergence to build the learning objective for improving the generalization of the model; and b) implementing hyper-parameters self-adaptation via utilizing a differential evolutionary algorithm. Empirical studies on four dynamic weighted graphs generated by a real application illustrate that the proposed ANTC model achieves higher prediction accuracy and computational efficiency than state-of-the-art predictors in predicting the missing links.},

  abstract  = {In opportunistic networks, it is a challenge to find the best relay node instead of blindly selecting from among available nodes to forward messages and effectively transmit them to their destinations. By comparing the similarity between nodes, the next hop node that is most similar to the destination node is found in time. Existing node similarity-based opportunistic networks routing algorithms only calculate similarity between nodes according to nodes&#39; properties that can be directly obtained from the network, such as the historical meeting record between nodes, etc. However, this superficial similarity calculation is obviously inadequate to describe the inherent dynamic nature of opportunistic networks at both spatial and temporal levels, and ignores the salient movement characteristics of nodes, resulting in poor routing performance. Therefore, this paper proposes an opportunistic network routing strategy based on pre-training and fine-tuning (PTFT) model. Firstly, an autoencoder is added to the graph neural network model to encode node movement behavior. Then, a pre-training graph neural network model in large scale opportunistic network scenarios is applied to learn potential features of nodes through fine-tuning. Finally, we calculate the similarity between nodes based on the node potential feature, thereby assisting the nodes to achieve an efficient routing decision. The simulation results show that our PTFT-based algorithm not only has superior performance compared to traditional routing algorithms, but also faster learning speed than other machine learning-based routing algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to form legal judgments based on the criminal fact description. However, researchers struggle to classify confusing criminal cases, such as robbery and theft, which requires LJP models to distinguish the nuances between similar crimes. Existing methods usually design handcrafted features to pick up necessary semantic legal clues to make more accurate legal judgment predictions. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model (SEMDR), which designs a novel legal clue tracing mechanism to conduct fine-grained semantic reasoning between criminal facts and instruments. Our legal clue tracing mechanism is built from three reasoning levels: 1) Lexicon-Tracing, which aims to extract criminal facts from criminal descriptions; 2) Sentence Representation Learning, which contrastively trains language models to better represent confusing criminal facts; 3) Multi-Fact Reasoning, which builds a reasons graph to propagate semantic clues among fact nodes to capture the subtle difference among criminal facts. Our legal clue tracing mechanism helps SEMDR achieve state-of-the-art on the CAIL2018 dataset and shows its advance in few-shot scenarios. Our experiments show that SEMDR has a strong ability to learn more uniform and distinguished representations for criminal facts, which helps to make more accurate predictions on confusing criminal cases and reduces the model uncertainty during making judgments.

  abstract  = {The widespread adoption of social networks facilitates the dissemination of authentic information while also accelerating the spread of misinformation, such as rumors. The propagation of positive information can enhance user awareness and mitigate the hazards of misinformation. The misinformation containment (MC) problem aims to identify a set o $k$ nodes that initiate the spread of positive information, maximizing its influence while minimizing the hazards of misinformation. The greedy approach, which employs extensive Monte Carlo simulations to estimate influence, is time-consuming and can only prioritize either propagation or containment, but not both. This paper studies the MC problem under competitive activation models. Based on geometric models of probability, we calculate the approximate probabilities of nodes being activated by positive information and misinformation at various times. Taking into account the two-hop theory, we propose a consistent and efficient computational method to assess node influence distribution from the perspectives of propagation and containment. This method strikes a balance between propagation and containment, surpassing degree centrality, further informing a heuristic solution to the MC problem. The heuristic solution&#39;s overall performance surpasses that of greedy approaches, which can only prioritize one aspect. Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that our approach effectively balances the propagation of positive information and misinformation containment with low time complexity.},

  abstract  = {Outlier detection identifies rare items, events, or observations in data analysis and has critical applications in many fields. In most such applications, datasets are high-dimensional. To reduce the impact of the “curse of dimension-ality”, many such applications decompose the entire feature space into different subspaces with two or more “relevant” features for deviations of interest. Those approaches often ignore the case for subspaces with a single feature. Due to the low dimension and high data density, it sometimes sufficient to identify univariate outliers. Thus, this paper proposes a multi-view outlier detection algorithm MVOD to ensemble outlier detection from three views: single feature view, local view, and global view. More specifically, we design a general outlier score function based on the quantities of information to evaluate the strength of the data distribution structure. Then, the outlier score for each point from different views is normalized and combined to reduce representational bias under different views. Extensive experiments are carried out on ten public benchmark datasets with ten state-of-art baselines. Experimental results show that MVOD is significantly better than those baselines in terms of AVC_ROC.},

While decision trees are known for balancing representability with interpretability, enabling humans to understand decision rules, their interpretability decreases as the complexity of the task increases and the tree size expands, making it difficult to trace and interpret the decision flow. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of decision tree called Bivariate Nonlinear Node Decision Tree (BINN-DT), designed to enhance the interpretability of decision trees. BINN-DT selects bivariate features at each node and utilizes nonlinear splitters to learn the data splitting rules. Additionally, each node visualizes the relationship between the data distribution and split boundaries through a two-dimensional map using the selected bivariate features. Our experiments compared the proposed BINN-DT method with traditional univariate decision trees. The results demonstrate that our approach not only maintains classification accuracy but also produces more compact models. BINN-DT clearly depicts the entire decision boundaries of a model as a tree-structured collection of two-dimensional maps with the bivariate feature axes selected from the entire features. Our method significantly improves the interpretability of models by producing more compact models than the traditional decision trees, without sacrifice of accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Predictions using a combination of decision trees are known to be effective in machine learning. Typical ideas for constructing a combination of decision trees for prediction are bagging and boosting. Bagging independently constructs decision trees without evaluating their combination performance and averages them afterward. Boosting constructs decision trees sequentially, only evaluating a combination performance of a new decision tree and the fixed past decision trees at each step. Therefore, neither method directly constructs nor evaluates a combination of decision trees for the final prediction. When the final prediction is based on a combination of decision trees, it is natural to evaluate the appropriateness of the combination when constructing them. In this paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework that constructs decision trees simultaneously and evaluates their combination performance throughout the construction process. Our framework repeats two procedures. In the first procedure, we construct new candidates of combinations of decision trees to find a proper combination of decision trees. In the second procedure, we evaluate each combination performance of decision trees under some criteria and select a better combination. To confirm the performance of the proposed framework, we experiment with synthetic and benchmark data.},

  abstract  = {A dynamic graphs (DG) is frequently adopted to describe the evolving interactions between nodes in real-world applications such as device communication networks. Temporal patterns are the natural characteristics of DG and are also the key to representation learning. However, most of the existing dynamic GCN models consist of static GCN and sequence modules, resulting in the separation of spatiotemporal information and the inability to effectively capture the complex temporal patterns in DG. To solve this problem, this study proposes a Diverse Transformation-Augmented Graph Tensor Convolutional Network (DTGTCN) with three-fold ideas: a) leveraging the tensor M-product to formulate the unified graph tensor convolution network (GTCN) without separate representation of spatiotemporal information; b) introducing three transformation schemes into GTCN to model complex temporal patterns for aggregating temporal information; c) building the ensemble of diverse transformation schemes to obtain high representation capacity. Empirical studies on four DGs emerging from communication networks demonstrate that owing to diverse transformation, the proposed DTGTCN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in addressing the task of link weight estimation.},

  abstract  = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the foundation for numerous biological processes within cells, which are crucial for understanding cellular signaling networks, disease mechanisms, and drug development. Recently, numerous artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have emerged for predicting PPIs. Nevertheless, existing AI-based approaches either partially or loosely consider these relationships and mechanisms by a non-end-to-end learning framework, resulting in sub-optimal feature extractions and fusions for prediction. To address this issue, this paper proposes an end-to-end graph neural network model for protein-protein interaction prediction, termed the Knowledge Graph Fused Graph Neural Network (KGF-GNN). First, protein associated network (PAN) is constructed by comprehensively exploiting protein-associated relationships and mechanisms among drugs, diseases, ribonucleic acid, protein structures, etc. Then, a graph neural network (GNN) is built to extract both the topological and semantic features from PAN. Secondly, the observed interactions between proteins are constructed into a PPI network, and another GNN is built to extract the hidden topological features within the PPI network. Third, a multi-layer perceptron is designed to fuse the extracted various features by end-to-end learning. With such designs, the feature extractions and fusions of PPIs are guaranteed to be comprehensive and optimal for prediction. Finally, by conducting extensive experiments on real PPI datasets, we demonstrate that our KGF-GNN can accurately predict PPIs and significantly outperform state-of-the-art models.},

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are critical subtypes of this condition. Clinically, when such hemorrhages are suspected, immediate CT scanning is essential to assess the extent of the bleeding and to facilitate the formulation of a targeted treatment plan. While current research in deep learning has largely focused on qualitative analyses, such as identifying subtypes of cerebral hemorrhages, there remains a significant gap in quantitative analysis crucial for enhancing clinical treatments. Addressing this gap, our paper introduces a dataset comprising 222 CT annotations, sourced from the RSNA 2019 Brain CT Hemorrhage Challenge and meticulously annotated at the voxel level for precise IPH and IVH segmentation. This dataset was utilized to train and evaluate seven advanced medical image segmentation algorithms, with the goal of refining the accuracy of segmentation for these hemorrhages. Our findings demonstrate that this dataset not only furthers the development of sophisticated segmentation algorithms but also substantially aids scientific research and clinical practice by improving the diagnosis and management of these severe hemorrhages.

To solve this issue, this study integrates the construction material distribution (CMD) with the repair crew scheduling and routing problem (RCSRP), and determine the level of road recovery through the CMD. Then, a bi-level optimization model is proposed with network performance resilience and recovery speed resilience as the optimization objectives. A two-stage optimization algorithm (TSOA) composed of a genetic algorithm with an improved coding method (ICM-GA) and the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) is then employed to solve this model. Finally, the effectiveness of the model and algorithm is validated through simulation experiments. The results indicate that, under given material and time constraints, the optimal repair strategy proposed in this study outperforms the repair strategy without considering road recovery level by 17.51% and 5.42% in terms of network performance resilience and recovery speed resilience, respectively. This demonstrates the positive significance of considering road recovery level in formulating road network repair strategies. Besides, this strategy can be applied to optimize the configuration of workstation count for different-scale networks.},

Accordingly, this paper aims to introduce the power asymmetry into basic HGMCR (B HGMCR) to resolve more complex hierarchical conflict problems. Initially, power dynamics are defined to capture the preference relations of DMs under power asymmetry. Then, matrix-based BHGMCR modeling under power asymmetry is presented, followed by the expansion of four classic stability definitions. Finally, a case study on carbon emission conflict is used to demonstrate that the proposed approach can handle the real-world hierarchical conflicts.

Our approach models microservices as a graph, with services as nodes and their interactions as edges, illuminating complex dependencies and enhancing the depth of data analysis. The method integrates expert knowledge with a unique blend of multi-class decision trees and strategy models derived from a knowledge base, enabling effective de-tection of diverse patterns and anomalies. Additionally, a meta-learner refines the outputs from base models using a weighted decision-making process, significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of fault detection. Compared to traditional models, including graph neural networks, our approach sub-stantially reduces model complexity and enhances adaptability to evolving service patterns. It demonstrates superior scalability and real-time processing capabilities, offering a robust solution to the challenges of fault localization in dynamic microservice environments.},

  abstract  = {In the current era, a Li-ion battery pack, typically comprised of multiple cells, can offer higher voltage and output power. This plays a crucial role in various applications, including electric vehicles and energy storage. Accurate estimating the battery pack&#39;s state of charge (SOC) is crucial to offer users a clearer understanding of the battery status and to alleviate range anxiety. In the industry, it&#39;s common practice to precisely estimate the SOC for each cell, enabling an accurate assessment of the battery pack&#39;s overall SOC. However, most current methods for estimating the SOC in battery packs are centralized. In such cases, a problem with estimating the SOC of a single cell can greatly impact the overall SOC estimation of the entire battery pack. Likewise, if centralized equipment encounters issues, the SOC estimation for the entire battery pack is likely to be interrupted. This paper presents a distributed method for estimating battery pack SOC, utilizing a digital twin-based simulation platform. In the following, the each node that measures the SOC of cell is regarded as an agent that can communicate. Through communication among agents, each agent can converge to a reliable battery pack SOC estimation. In the event of a sudden issue arising in the SOC estimation of a cell, the proposed method can still uphold a dependable estimate of the battery pack&#39;s SOC, thereby bolstering the overall robustness of the SOC estimation system for the entire battery pack.},

Our results indicated a meaningful difference in students&#39; interpretability perceptions between the expert and AutoML features across two diverse datasets.

Firstly, many existing methods struggle to fully utilize previous knowledge and fail to effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Secondly, current online hashing methods lack targeted guidance for hash function learning, resulting in weak discriminative ability. Thirdly, many current methods adopt ineffective optimization methods to learn hash code. This paper proposes a Discriminative Visual-semantic Collaborative Online Decomposition Hashing method, abbreviated as DVsCODH. It includes two steps: hash code learning and hash function learning. In the first step, DVsCODH adopts an online pairwise similarity supervision to guide hash code learning, and simultaneously introduces a visual-semantic collaborative online decomposition strategy to adaptively fuse visual and semantic information. Through incremental online learning, DVsCODH is capable of extracting complete similarity, visual and high-level semantic information of the database. In the second step, DVsCODH leverages database-wide similarity to supervise hash function online learning. Furthermore, we propose an effective online discrete optimization algorithm that directly generate hash code, thereby enhancing model training efficiency. Experimental results on three public image datasets demonstrate the excellent retrieval performance of DVsCODH.},

However, the effectiveness of SAM is hindered in the medical domain due to the scarcity of available medical images, leading to suboptimal training and inadequate adaptation of its feature extractor to medical imagery. In this work, we propose PSAM, which built upon SAM to explore a new research paradigm of customizing large-scale models to meet the demands of medical image segmentation tasks.

To address this challenge, we introduce a neural operator-based framework for denoising measured displacement fields in ultrasound elastography. By utilizing neural operators to learn a general solution operator for the denoising equation, the framework aims to achieve fast and accurate denoising of displacement fields. Experiments conducted on simulated data and tissue-mimicking phantom data demonstrate that this method performs comparably to traditional methods across various metrics. In particular, the proposed approach achieves processing speeds approximately 30 to 577 times faster than the finite difference method (FDM) in various data dimensions, making it a highly effective solution for rapid and scalable data processing in ultrasound elastography.},

However, existing fully supervised learning methods (CNN-based) to achieve this often suffer from non-robust loss functions and insufficient training data. Previous work on cellular segmentation did not consider topological information and biological constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method using topological loss and biologically boundary-aware synthetic (labeled and unlabeled mixed) ground truth for 3D cellular segmentation of live embryos. The topological loss function guides the model to extract features in latent space. Semi-supervised learning and synthetic datasets improve the accuracy of inner and outer membrane recognition on a large number of unlabeled images. Experiment results and evaluation on 1472 live embryo images show that our method outperforms existing deep-learning models. This method can be adapted to images of live embryos of other animals.},

  abstract  = {There are noticeable studies where Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been utilized effectively in the field of neuroimaging, mostly on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and their implementation on structural MRI (sMRI) has not been investigated much. GNNs perform better than traditional deep learning methods in capturing the intricate brain&#39;s anatomical attributes and the relationships between the brain regions of interest (ROIs). This is because of GNN&#39;s capacity to efficiently capture intricate information by leveraging the structural information of the underlying graph. Additionally, GNNs have relatively fewer message-passing stages, which makes them computationally efficient. This study presents a GNN-based framework for brain age prediction at the ROI level by utilizing volumetric information of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM). The dataset comprises 232 T1-weighted sMRI scans (98 males, 134 females) of healthy controls obtained from ADNI. The brain was segmented into 56 ROIs using the LPBA40 brain atlas in CAT12. Subsequently, GM and WM volumes were extracted from these ROIs, and anatomical graphs were constructed based on GM volume information. These graphs served as inputs for different GNN models, including GCN, GraphSage, GAT, and GIN layers-based models. These models have been trained to predict brain age, and the model&#39;s effectiveness evaluation demonstrates that the GCN-based GNN model outperforms other models, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) value of 5.06 and Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.76.},

  abstract  = {Spectral clustering is a popular clustering method. It first maps data into the spectral embedding space and then uses Kmeans to find clusters. However, the two decoupled steps prohibit joint optimization for the optimal solution. In addition, it needs to construct the similarity graph for samples, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the data are high-dimensional. To address these two challenges, we introduce Deep Spectral Clustering (DSC), which consists of two main modules: the spectral embedding module and the greedy Kmeans module. The former module learns to efficiently embed raw samples into the spectral embedding space using deep neural networks and power iteration. The latter module improves the cluster structures of Kmeans on the learned spectral embeddings by a greedy optimization strategy, which iteratively reveals the direction of the worst cluster structures and optimizes embeddings in this direction. To jointly optimize spectral embeddings and clustering, we seamlessly integrate the two modules and optimize them in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DSC achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance.},

Thus, existing methods fail to reconcile the tension between maintaining texture detail fidelity and achieving diverse color variations. In this paper, we propose a Multi-scale HSV Color Feature Embedding Network (MCFNet) that decomposes the mapping process into three sub-tasks, including NIR texture maintenance, coarse geometry reconstruction, and RGB color prediction. Thus, we propose three critical modules for each corresponding sub-task: the Texture Preserving Block (TPB), the HSV Color Feature Embedding Module (HSV-CFEM), and the Geometry Reconstruction Module (GRM). These modules contribute to our MCFNet by methodically tackling spectral translation through a series of escalating resolutions, progressively enriching images with color and texture fidelity in a scale-coherent fashion. The proposed MCFNet demonstrates substantial performance gains over the NIR image colorization task. The code is available at: https://github.com/AlexYangxx/MCFNet.},

  abstract  = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are prevalent in real-world applications, dealing with multi-objective and constraint functions. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) has proven effective for unconstrained multi-objective optimization problems with complex Pareto front (PF). However, in CMOPs, the conflicting nature between objectives and constraints often makes it challenging to appropriately manage constraints while ensuring convergence, diversity, and feasibility of the solution set towards the PF. To address this issue, this paper proposes a bilayered decomposition technique. The proposed algorithm treats constraints as an additional objective function, separately decomposing the objective space and the constraint violation space. This method allows for the simultaneous attainment of convergence, diversity, and feasibility in the solution set while efficiently exploring the PF. Experimental results demonstrate that, within the MOEA/D-DE framework, our algorithm efficiently navigates complex PFs on challenging problems such as LIR-CMOPs and DAS-CMOPs, matching the performance of state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.},

In addition, while a white walking cane is commonly used to move around when going out, there is a problem of not being able to recognize a wide range of areas. Many studies have been conducted to support the movement of visually impaired people using camera images, and many methods have been proposed to support walking on sidewalks and crossing intersections. However, when considering walking on a sidewalk, there are cases where the sidewalk is broken by a side street intersecting the roadway, and few studies have focused on such a break in the sidewalk. In many cases, there are no traffic signals or pedestrian crossings at such breaks in the sidewalk, making them dangerous places for people with vision difficulties. In this study, we propose a walking assistance method at a break in the sidewalk using images obtained by MY VISION (a Magic eYe of a Visually Impaired for Safety and Independent actiON) and deep learning. MY VISION is a system that analyzes videos obtained from a camera attached to the user&#39;s body and provides useful visual information, functioning as a virtual eye for visually impaired people. The proposed method provides a model for recognizing the sidewalk environment and a model for guiding a user to the center of the sidewalk in order to guide the visually impaired people safely. Experiments were conducted to verify the accuracy of each model, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was shown.},

To overcome safety impairments caused by latencies in data transmission and reduced situational awareness of the remote operator, this work proposes a shared control framework that assists the operator. To enable teleoperation in dynamic environments, risk assessment and prediction methods are integrated into the framework. As a proof of concept, two system implementations are shown. One implementation uses the time-to-collision metric to enhance teleoperation safety in presence of dynamic objects. The second implementation integrates an open-source occlusion awareness module that allows to consider risk arising from traffic participants potentially emerging from occluded areas. The risk and criticality of situations with dynamic objects are reduced by both implementations.},

In this context, we combined Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) signals with surface electromyography (sEMG) data, utilizing an improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (ICEEMDAN) to enhance adaptive noise reduction. This approach enabled the extraction of Intrinsic Mode Functions reflecting muscle activity characteristics from complex physiological signals. Through correlation analysis, redundant components were eliminated. We proposed a methodology that adeptly captures intricate features and long-term dependencies in time-series data while preserving sensitivity to short-term dynamics, thereby enhancing the precision of joint angle decoding. Following fatigue induction in subjects, the inclusion of near-infrared compensation led to a variable reduction in RMSE values, all of which remained below 5. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient R was enhanced, never falling below 93%. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that integrating near-infrared spectroscopy features into the model exhibits fatigue resistance, thereby improving the precision of joint angle predictions under conditions of fatigue to a certain degree.},

Recent progress utilizes Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to analyze human skeleton data, yielding promising results. In this paper, we introduce an improved Attention-Based Graph Convolutional Network framework for motion completion that tackles two key challenges: modeling correlations across indirectly connected joints and modeling correlations across frames in motion sequences with diverse sparsity. The method is designed to augment the learning capability of the GCN-based model without being constrained by the inherent human skeleton structure. Furthermore, this design can be concurrently applied to scenarios involving the completion of both single-person and multi-person motions.

Appropriately calibrated trust levels can enhance robots&#39; safe and successful adoption into our society and their unique applied environments. The current research aims to assess individuals&#39; self-reported trust levels in a triadic human-robot-human interaction concerning a collaborative haptically enabled “sonography” style robot (having tele-operative capabilities) to assess moderators of trust unique to this specific domain. The objectives of the current research are to identify participants&#39; trust levels in a triadic interaction focusing on the operator&#39;s proxemic location while operating the robot (1) and to compare self-reported trust levels across conditions suggested by the literature to have an influence (2). A repeated measures ANDVA revealed a significant association between the replicated traditional sonography assessment and participants possessing higher trust levels than all robot-related conditions. Further, participants had greater trust for the smooth and slow-functioning robot than the non-smooth functioning robot. Lastly, the current study&#39;s findings suggest that, compared to the other robot-related conditions, the experimenter&#39;s location operating the tele-operative robot does not significantly influence participants&#39; trust levels. Future research should consider exploring humans&#39; qualitative perceptions of their interactions with sonography robots and whether trust can be more accurately calibrated over time. Doing so may assist in developing an in-depth understanding of the discrepancies between human-human interaction and human-robot interactions unique to this setting.},

The emergence of serverless edge computing provides a solution where users can deploy models as serverless functions and delegate provisioning and scaling to the platform. However, the resource-constrained nature of edge resources leads to their inefficiency or inability to serve large neural networks. Therefore, this paper emphasizes collaborative inference between devices and serverless edge computing for DNN models. Specifically, we consider the partitioning and offloading of DNN models and propose a DRL-based strategy to learn the joint decision of model partitioning and function memory type selection to achieve a cost-optimal service that meets the SLO requirements. In addition, we introduce a simulated annealing algorithm in deep reinforcement learning that focuses on exploration in the early stage and empirical value in the later stage. Finally, experimental results show that our algorithm can satisfy various SLOs at a low service cost and outperform three benchmarking strategies.},

  abstract  = {Two-Wheelers (TWs) such as bikes, e-bikes, and motorcycles often occupy lanes illegally and exceed speed limits, which leads to many traffic accidents. Therefore, we use deep reinforcement learning to design driving strategies for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to avoid collision with TWs and reduce injury of TW riders with irregular riding behaviors at un-signalized occluded intersections. First, the collision-avoidance behaviors of TWs are modeled, respectively. The state spaces integrate a safe avoidance range of AVs, a new position of AVs after taking deceleration and a steering angle, a predicted acceleration, and position, speed, and steering angle of AVs and other vehicles. At the same time, a reward function is designed based on the injury of TW riders and the driving safety and comfort of AVs. Secondly, a reinforcement learning model for autonomous driving strategy is constructed. Finally, Soft Actor-Critic is used to train the model, and the randomness policy is used to help AVs flexibly deal with the uncertain behaviors of TW riders and realize the balance between exploring unknown behaviors and using existing information. The simulation results show that compared with an autonomous emergency braking system, the injury of the riders using the driving strategy is reduced by 18.02% on average; compared with a risk-aware high-level decision strategy, the injury is reduced by 41.24% on average.},

  abstract  = {Transformer-based models have shown remarkable success in Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF). Previous methods apply Attention mechanisms to capture temporal and spatial (variable) dependencies separately. However, they struggle to model intricate local spatiotemporal correlations. To address this limitation and enhance performance, we propose CSTformer, a novel Transformer-based model that enables capturing Cross Spatio- Temporal (CST) dependency for MTSF. In CSTformer, through a Variate Compete Linear Attention (VCLA) mechanism, each variable efficiently achieves specific CST features, which compete against the backdrop of the local multivariate. Additionally, we develop a Mixture of Latent (MoL) module to provide adaptive predictions for variables with varying degrees of CST dependencies. Our experimental results on nine benchmarks indicate that, compared with the state-of-the-art method, CSTformer yields a 2.7% relative improvement.},

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed to address online rumors, most lack efficient feature fusion for multimodal rumor detection, leading to suboptimal detection performance. Therefore, we introduce the Multimodal Rumor Detection with Dual Augmentation at Textual and Feature Levels model (MDTF), which utilizes feature extraction modules to separately extract textual and visual features. The model employs a cross-attention mechanism to enhance visual features and incorporates a gradual feature fusion approach. Considering the potential signal interference and feature coverage issues from feature fusion, we implement residual connections to mitigate these effects. Additionally, due to the limited data volume in rumor detection datasets, we employ a text data augmentation module to generate a substantial amount of text based on images, thereby enriching the textual dataset. To evaluate the performance of the MDTF model, experiments were conducted on the Twitter dataset, demonstrating that the MDTF model surpasses the most advanced models in terms of accuracy and F1 score.},

However, their deployment is constrained by limited computational resources, energy concerns, and low-latency processing requirements. While existing works employ logit-based knowledge distillation from GNNs to guide Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) training, these methods may lead to reduced accuracy and compromised robustness. These drawbacks arise from two primary factors: the insufficient exploitation of the rich information embedded within the graph structures and the inherent susceptibility of MLPs to noisy data. To tackle these issues, we propose a Mixed Multi-order Knowledge Distillation (MMKD) method, which combines the GNN&#39;s logits with hidden layer information through the multi-order distillation to improve the accuracy of the MLP. Moreover, we employ both raw data and perturbed data as input, enhancing the density of knowledge extraction as well as the MLPs&#39; generalization. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets verify the superior performance of our approach in terms of effectiveness and robustness. In comparison with the baseline, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8.68% in typical GNN tasks.},

  abstract  = {Speech recognition serves as the foundation for human-computer interaction. To attain more accurate speech recognition results, the models for speech recognition are becoming increasingly sophisticated, demanding a greater volume of training data. In situations where data and computational resources are limited, the rapid development of usable speech recognition models becomes crucial for the future of this field. Currently, mainstream speech recognition models rely on attention mechanisms. These models employ cross-attention during decoding to address the relationship between the encoded speech input and the textual representation of the output. This mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of one sequence while generating elements of another sequence, facilitating a better understanding of their relationships. However, stacking numerous layers of cross-attention is required to increase the model&#39;s expressive power. Yet, too many layers can impact model training and inference speed, and necessitate more data for training. We introduce a dynamic attention fusion speech recognition decoder designed for small datasets to address this issue. The decoder utilizes enhanced positional information during the decoding process to query the positional correspondence between the output text and the input speech encoding. This approach eliminates the need for extensive stacking of cross-attention mechanisms. Subsequently, a dynamic fusion module integrates these correspondences with the original decoding information. This method effectively establishes improved correspondences between the input and output, eliminating the need for stacking additional decoder layers and thereby reducing the model&#39;s parameter count. Our model achieved Character Error Rates (CER) of 4.60%, 12.67%, and 7.06% on the Aishell1, Primewords, and Free ST Chinese Mandarin Corpus datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, on the Uyghur dataset, our model attained a Word Error Rate (WER) of 4.23%. These results outperformed the baseline systems. The error rates decreased by 0.05%, 0.23%, 0.21%, and 1.52% on four datasets respectively compared to the baseline system. Additionally, our model&#39;s parameter count also decreased by 6.7%.},

Simultaneously, it introduces model watermarking and ECC public-key encryption mechanisms to secure parameter transmission. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated learning system achieves superior model convergence. Furthermore, it is more effective in defending against poisoning attacks.

First, a back-translated enhanced label set is constructed by back-translated splicing enhancement of the original label set. This set, together with the text, is then input into the embedding layer, which consists of the pre-trained model of bert-baseChinese, thus establishing the initial connection between the text and the labels within the same vector space. Then, to comprehensively extract multi-level semantic features, the model uses a convolutional layer to extract local features and an embedding layer to extract sentence-level features. A bidirectional attention embedded GRU (BAE-GRU) layer is used to extract hybrid finegrained features, which are then fed into the attention layer to further extract hybrid labeled features based on labeling information. Finally, these three different types of features are fused and multi-label text classification results are obtained using a classifier. The experiments proved that the MFFLEN model achieved 73.82% and 88.44% macro-F1 and 88.00% and 88.86% micro-F1 on the two datasets CAIL 2018 Small and CAIL 2018 Split, respectively, which is better than other baseline models.},

  abstract  = {Chinese short text similarity computation stands as a pivotal task within natural language processing, garnering significant attention. However, existing models grapple with limitations in handling intricate semantic relationships, such as the challenge of discerning subtle semantic nuances in text, inadequacies in effectively integrating diverse levels of semantic information, and the struggle to capture polysemous meanings accurately. In addressing these issues, this paper introduces an innovative Chinese short text similarity computation model, SMGC-SBERT. This model addresses shortcomings of the existing models by employing a multi-module fusion strategy, thereby enabling a more precise measurement of semantic similarity between texts. Primarily, the model incorporates SAT embedding to acquire phrase-level semantic information and leverages the MS-BERT model to encode text, improving the model&#39;s comprehension of textual polysemy and obtaining richer semantic representation. Then, the fusion of module features, including multi-branch convolutional networks and mix pooling, enables the extraction of textual features from varied levels, bolstering the model&#39;s representational capacity. Additionally, to further reduce overfitting risks while improving accuracy and other performance, a multi-layer feature adjustment network is utilized for short text similarity calculation. The final resultant experimental findings showcase the superiority of the SMGC-SBERT model over other neural network models, demonstrating significant advancements across both Chinese-SNLI and CCKS2018_Task3 Chinese short text datasets.},

  abstract  = {As e-commerce continues to grow, comprehending consumer emotions has be-come crucial, directly influencing product sales and corporate reputation. Yet, the high dimensionality and complexity of e-commerce platform comment data pose significant challenges to conventional sentiment analysis techniques. In response, this paper presents an innovative sentiment analysis model for e-commerce re-views, leveraging GPT-3.5 embeddings, convolutional neural networks (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and Self-Attention mechanisms. Initially, GPT-3.5 is employed to transform input text into dynamic word vectors, thereby capturing subtle semantic distinctions. Subsequently, the CNN layer is utilized to extract textual emotional features, while the Self-Attention mechanism enhances the model&#39;s sensitivity to subtle emotional shifts. The BiLSTM layer further captures bidirectional, backward and forward contex-tual information, offering a holistic grasp of textual sentiment. Emotional features are ultimately classified using the Softmax function. Relative to existing models, our proposed model exhibits superior performance in e-commerce dataset exper-iments, demonstrating notable enhancements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. This validation underscores our solution&#39;s effectiveness in conducting sentiment analysis within the e-commerce domain.},

  abstract  = {Encrypted traffic classification using deep learning models based on packet length sequences has shown promising results. However, in real-world network conditions, network-induced phenomena such as packet loss, packet retransmission, and packet disorder are prevalent, leading to a decline in performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fractal, a novel approach designed to enhance existing deep learning models by integrating data augmentation and contrastive learning, thereby facilitating robust encrypted traffic classification under various network conditions. Specifically, Fractal employs three data augmentations to simulate different network conditions, generating diverse packet length sequences from the same flow. Contrastive learning is then leveraged to distill robust features from these augmented sequences. Fractal enables deep learning model to discern the intrinsic patterns of each flow, regardless of the variance in packet length sequences caused by network-induced phenomena. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Fractal enhances the classification performance of deep learning models under different network conditions, achieving 23% increase in accuracy and 15% improvement in F1-score.},

This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing hand tracking data for implicit authentication in virtual reality as users type fixed text. We create an undirected graph from hand key-points to model the user&#39;s typing habits. We collected hand tracking data from 51 participants twice, two weeks apart. They used a QWERTY keyboard to input text in a virtual space. A spatial-temporal graph convolutional network was employed to extract the user&#39;s typing habits, resulting in an equal error rate of 0.048 in the case of internal spoofing attacks and 0.055 in the case of external spoofing attacks.},

  abstract  = {Traffic flow prediction, as one of the problems of spatial correlation analysis of time series, has been extensively studied. The extraction and fusion of effective spatio-temporal features are crucial for achieving high-precision traffic flow prediction. Traditionally, the adjacency graph designed based on the neighboring nodes of real-world road networks has been indispensable for learning spatial features. However, this single connected component graph structure is prone to the phenomenon of over-smoothing, leading to homogenization of the learned spatial feature. Addressing this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Multi-connected Graph Neural Network (SMGNN) aimed at mitigating the homogeneity of spatial features and effectively modeling spatio-temporal interactions. Firstly, considering the existence of several nodes in large-scale road networks with similar traffic flow variation patterns, we semantically connect these nodes to construct multi-connected semantic spatial graphs (MSSG), replacing the traditionally used neighboring node graph in conventional graph neural networks. Correspondingly, we design a novel graph neural network architecture that cyclically fuses dynamic scale spatio-temporal features from MSSG using an improved Dynamic Spatial Graph Attention (DSGA) module. Secondly, to achieve a more effective representation, we design a Inverted Temporal Attention (ITA) module to supplement static scale temporal features. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-dimensional and Multi-scale Feature Extraction (MMFE) module to fuse spatio-temporal features at various scales within different receptive fields. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets have verified the effectiveness of our proposed method, significantly outperforming various baseline models.},

  abstract  = {Symptom status tracking poses a significant challenge due to the intricate nature of symptom identification and inference from medical doctor-patient dialogues. Numerous prior studies in this domain have relied on approaches involving multi-label classification and multi-task learning. Multi-label classification methods typically consider symptoms and statuses within a unified label space. Nevertheless, this approach frequently results in sparse predictions, eroding semantic relationships among labels and causing instability in prediction outcomes. In contrast, multi-task learning segregates symptom prediction and status prediction into separate tasks, thereby improving performance relative to conventional multi-label classification methods. Nonetheless, despite these advancements, the imbalance in training task weights persists, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we employ a cascaded model structure rooted in the Question-Answering (QA) paradigm in this study. Our approach utilizes dialogue content to create context-inquiry pairs and introduces two novel modules: inquiry-aware attention and multi-perception pooling. Inquiry-aware attention enhances the contextual relationship between inquiries and dialogues, while multi-perception pooling extracts diverse semantics from the dialogue. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate our method&#39;s efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques in symptom status tracking and indicating its superior effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {Entity alignment(EA) aims to identify equivalent entities in different knowledge graphs or data sources and establish correspondences between them. In recent years, embedding-based methods have made significant progress in the field of entity alignment, yet the shortage of adequate training data (i.e., seed entity pairs) continues to be a primary challenge. Traditional semi-supervised methods typically address this issue by generating potential mappings (i.e., pseudo-mappings) for unlabeled entities. However, these methods often suffer from the influence of erroneous potential mappings or overlook the uncertainty of potential mappings. Therefore, we propose a novel semi-supervised entity alignment method called JTEA. This method combines seed entity pairs with potential mappings through end-to-end joint training, providing strong guidance for model training. In constructing potential mappings, we propose a bidirectional matching strategy (BMS), which generates more detailed potential mappings by jointly adjusting decisions in different directions and uses a joint matching confidence score to characterize its uncertainty. Furthermore, we also introduce a method of matching diversity alignment selection, aiming to screen out more reliable entity alignments to further improve the performance and stability of the model. We conducted a large number of experiments on the benchmark dataset to fully validate the effectiveness of the JTEA method.},

Consequently, this paper proposes a novel click-through rate prediction model, named Interest Evolutionary Network with Hash and Multiple Attention Network (IEHAN). The model categorizes user behaviors into long-term and short-term categories, employing a hash sampling method to model long-term user behaviors. By directly filtering behavioral items with the same hash signature as the target item from the entire sequence, the IEHAN model effectively models long-term user interests, thereby reducing information loss. Additionally, the model employs the multi-head attention mechanism and the GRU model with an attention update gate to integrate the relevance of the user&#39;s interest state and the target item, thereby enhancing the impact of relevant interests on interest evolution and shaping short-term user interest. Experimental results demonstrate that the IEHAN model achieves higher AUC and lower LOSS evaluation metrics on the Taobao dataset and the Books subset of the Amazon dataset, surpassing other existing models and exhibiting superior prediction accuracy.},

However, this task is under-explored due to the scarcity of data, whose annotation cost is relatively high, demanding domain-specific knowledge. Some methods attempt to expand data scale through mitigation strategies based on large-scale unsupervised corpora. Despite their promising results, pre-trained language models, lacking medical knowledge, fail to make accurate predictions for professional questions about medicine. To address this, we applied the Retrieval-Augmented method to Medical MCQA and proposed a new framework based on interactive retrieval augmentation. This framework consists of two parts for adapting knowledge to the medical domain. Firstly, the dynamic interplay between inquiries and contextual nuances is learned in the data-rich domain through QA modeling of language models. This procedural knowledge and these implicit semantic associations embedded in vocabulary representations are adapted to the medical domain for better understanding. Secondly, an adaptive retrieval network is designed to inject knowledge into the model. Our method has shown superior performance on multiple Medical MCQA datasets compared to baseline models, effectively addressing the challenges posed by data scarcity and domain specialization of Medical MCQA. Analysis showcases that our model has a better ability to retrieve and comprehend medical details.},

  abstract  = {In the past few years, learned video compression has received increasing attention. However, most current learned methods rely on the bilinear warping operations in motion compensation, which is equivalent to a low-pass filtering operation and brings the distortion of reconstruction. To address this problem, we propose a spatial-temporal motion compensation for learned video compression (STMC-LVC). STMC-LVC uses a spatial-temporal motion compensation network (STMC-Net) to fully consider the spatial-temporal correlation between successive frames, performing accurate motion compensation. Specifically, STMC-Net mainly consists of the initial feature prediction module and the fusion module. The initial feature prediction module predicts reference features based on DCN to provide sufficient information for motion compensation. The fusion module obtains temporal attention information by calculating the similarity between features, performs spatial attention operations, and finally performs spatial-temporal fusion, further improving the robustness of motion compensation. In addition, STMC-LVC uses a conditional coding framework. We use a concatenation of the current feature and predicted feature as context to explore spatial-temporal correlations in feature space. Experimental results show that our method effectively improves video compression. Specifically, our model achieves an average of 33.86% and 58.70% bitrate savings than x265 (veryslow) on PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning methods are widely used to predict energy consumption, aiming to enhance efficiency and support environmental goals. However, developing these models is traditionally time-consuming and expert-dependent. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has emerged as a valuable approach to streamlining machine learning pipelines, including appropriate preprocessing and learning algorithms, it may still require human experts. These experts might be needed to generate new, interpretable features that could significantly improve model performance. This is particularly relevant in complex settings such as the energy domain, where deep learning&#39;s automatic feature extraction lacks interpretability. To address this challenge, this exploratory work introduces an automated feature engineering method tailored for energy forecasting problems. It involves generating a comprehensive set of features that can be fed into AutoML, thereby reducing the need for domain knowledge in feature engineering. The proposed method has been validated using eleven datasets from various energy domains, including residential buildings, renewable energy, and regional energy consumption, with state-of-the-art AutoML methods, namely H20, TPOT, AutoGluon, and FLAML. The results demonstrate a noticeable reduction in prediction errors across all the examined datasets.},

  abstract  = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to represent graph data. Among various GNN variants, graph attention network (GAT) stands out since it is able to dynamically learn the importance of different nodes. However, present GATs heavily rely on the smoothed node features to obtain the attention coefficients rather than graph structural information, which fails to provide crucial contextual cues for node representations. To address this issue, this study proposes a neighbor overlay-induced graph attention network (NO-GAT) with the following two-fold ideas: a) learning favorable structural information, i.e., overlaid neighbors, outside the node feature propagation process from an adjacency matrix; b) injecting the information of overlaid neighbors into the node feature propagation process to compute the attention coefficient jointly. Empirical studies on graph benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed NO-GAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.},

The rich semantic information of camera images and the precise location of LiDAR point clouds are combined. An R-tree spatial indexing algorithm is used to match and process data swiftly. Accurate object localization can be achieved by using the provided method based on the fused data.

  abstract  = {Efficient leak detection and localization in water distribution networks (WDNs) are essential for mitigating disastrous losses from leak incidents. Current unsupervised learning-based methods excel in detecting single leaks but struggle with multi-leak scenarios, limiting their practical applicability. Additionally, leak localization methods relying on simulation optimization can be computationally intensive for large-scale WDNs. Meanwhile, purely data-driven approaches struggle to leverage network topology and hydraulic characteristics, hinde ring accurate leak localization. To address these challenges, we propose a leak detection and localization framework that employs online change-point detection and leak sensitivity modeling to achieve real-time detection and localization in multi-leak scenarios. For leak detection, the framework utilizes an unsupervised One-dimensional Convolutional Auto-encoder (1D-CAE) to reconstruct the pressure data collected from sensors deployed over a WDN. The residuals between the reconstructed values and the observed values, also known as reconstruction errors, are then analyzed using a Sequentially Discounting Normalized Maximum Likelihood (SDNML) change-point detector. Equipped with a customized scoring function designed for robust multi-leak detection, this detector computes anomaly scores in real-time at each time step, facilitating effective leak detection. Furthermore, we simulate leaks at different nodes of the WDN to quantify their impact on the sensor nodes using pressure residuals-based leak characteristic factors. By comparing reconstruction errors with these factors, we identify the nodes that best match the current leak event, achieving precise leak localization. An evaluation on the L-Town dataset demonstrates the superior performance of our method for multi-leak detection and localization.},

Unlike previous works which attach a device to a person for active localization, this paper presents a cross-temporal domain device-free fingerprinting localization system based on LoRa technology. The rationale of this work is that the person standing on different positions can induce different multipaths, and the challenge is to extract locations from receiving signals over time. Through careful mathematical analysis, we observe the key factors that can characterize the location features and then propose a novel fingerprinting construction method leveraging frequency-hopping to expand the locations&#39; resolution. Considering the temporal instability of the signal, we establish a domain adversarial-based localization model for position estimation. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate our design, and results indicate that the fingerprinting construction approach can well express the location diversity even across different time and the designed model achieves decimeter-level localization in long-range indoor and multipath environments.},

  abstract  = {Supercapacitors, leveraging their distinctive characteristics and advantages, have evolved into efficient energy storage solutions. State of Charge (SOC) is a crucial parameter for supercapacitors, and the estimation of SOC for individual supercapacitor cells has been extensively researched. In practical applications, it is common to assemble hundreds or even thousands of cells to form a supercapacitor pack, particularly in fields like electric vehicles a nd electric b uses. Therefore, estimating the SOC for the supercapacitor pack becomes imperative. In response to the demands for supercapacitor pack SOC $(SOC_{pack})$ estimation and wireless management, this paper proposes a distributed method. After modeling the supercapacitor cells, the definition of $SOC_{pack}$ is introduced. The SOC of a cell in the definition is estimated based on Kalman filter. The proposed distributed method relies on wireless communication and computational updates between cells. Through iterative processes, it ultimately converges to the estimated $SOC_{pack}$. Finally, we conducted simulation experiments to analyze the performance of the proposed method under various communication conditions, thereby validating its effectiveness and robustness.},

The results showed that adding speech information improved the estimation performance, especially the Transformer model with Mel-Spectrogram as a feature.

In a multi-agent formation path planning system, a number of aspects including formation maintenance, collision avoidance, control consumption, reaching the destination and the interactions among agents need to be considered together. To solve this, we model multi-agent formation path planning in the Stackelberg-Nash game (SNG) framework to address the mentioned issues. In the SNG, the leader can adopt a global perspective and make multi-step predictions to plan a formation path that avoids obstacles. However, the followers can only perform myopic planning due to their limited capabilities. We introduce the natural logarithm barrier functions penalizing the collision constraints and we utilize the first-order condition to approximate the optimality condition, serving as a consideration term for all followers&#39; potential reactions. We employ the receding horizon algorithm (RHA) to plan the formation path for the leader and followers. Case studies in an environment with obstacles demonstrate the superior performance of our SNG framework. Compared with the Nash-game and Non-game frameworks, our framework outperforms in maintaining standard formation and effective control consumption.

Traditional neural signal decoding algorithms typically rely on Gaussian noise assumptions and static functional relationships between neural activities and movements, overlooking the common presence of non-Gaussian noise in the neural encoding process and the dynamic variations in neural tuning over time. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel decoding algorithm that integrates maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) with dual Kalman filters. By incorporating MCC, the algorithm enhances the filter&#39;s robustness to non-Gaussian noise by capturing higher-order statistical properties of information. Additionally, a pair of mutually communicative dual filters are used to estimate states and periodically update parameters. Tested within a simulated Skinner box experiment, our algorithm exhibits superior performance in tracking the dynamic variations of neural tuning under non-Gaussian noise conditions compared to traditional Kalman filter with fixed tuning parameters and dual Kalman filter without MCC incorporation, and provides a new solution for BMI applications requiring long-term stable operation.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have many potential applications for individuals with physical disabilities; however, their usage is limited due to unreliable performance. While users can improve performance via training, the effectiveness of current training approaches may be limited by inaccurate performance assessments and confusing feedback. Herein, we render recently proposed user performance assessments for mental imagery electroencephalography (EEG)-BCIs conducive to online deployment. The approach uses $K$-means clustering to segment the EEG signal space into pattern states and then models transitions between these states using Markov chains. A metric, taskDistinct , uses the Markov chain steady-state distributions to measure user ability to produce task-specific EEG patterns. The objective of this work was twofold: first, to assess the sensitivity of the adjusted metrics to performance variations throughout a session; and second, to examine the influence of the number of pattern states in the models on this sensitivity. To meet these objectives, we performed pseudo-online analyses where the taskDistinct metric was computed with various numbers of pattern states throughout simulated data collection sessions. Analysis revealed significant positive correlations between the adapted taskDistinct metric and other performance metrics. Additionally, the metric sensitivity to performance changes was not significantly affected by the number of pattern states. The results indicate that the adapted Markov chain-based metrics could be used for assessing performance in online user training for mental imagery EEG-BCIs.},

This reduction leads to a decrease in the Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making it more difficult to classify these signals accurately. Conversely, combining Fuzzy Neural Block (FNB) that includes Type-l Fuzzy (T1F) in deep learning architecture has improved classification accuracy over data obtained in noisy environments. However, T1F has limitations in accurately modeling uncertainty and handling complex systems compared to Interval Type-2 Fuzzy (IT2F), which is particularly suitable for applications where robustness, adaptability, and accuracy are crucial. In this work, we proposed a deep learning framework that integrates the FNB using IT2F called FNB- IT2F. It is included parallel to the linear and final layers to assess their effectiveness. Thus, this study presents a unification of EEG- TCNet-LSTM with FNB-IT2F, which we call EEG- TCNet-LSTM-FNB-IT2F (i.e. EEG- TCF2Net). Our results reported a maximum recog-nition accuracy of 51.0% to 76.5% using the proposed method of EEG- TCF2N et in a subject-independent classification across all 10 subjects for 0.2 to 0.5 s time window. Overall, including FNB- IT2F in this deep learning architecture outperformed those without it, as well as baseline methods such as Filter-Bank Canonical Correlation Analysis (FBCCA) [1] and Task-related component analysis (TRCA) [2].},

  abstract  = {As biometric authentication has become common-place in recent years, electroencephalography (EEG)-based user authentication research has gained significant attention from researchers. The practicality of enhancing authentication requires users to be classified effectively with fewer channels, which necessitates research on spatial information across brain regions to identify optimal channels for authentication protocols. While previous research has examined different acquisition protocols, comprehensive studies that have investigated the influence of spatial information from various brain regions are lacking. Therefore, in this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning model was trained using EEG signals obtained from one of the most promising protocols, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) experiment. By using a pre-trained model, the effect of spatial information specific to each brain region was examined by classifying data masked for each respective region. Through this study, we confirmed that the amount of information used to classify users is distributed more in the occipital and parietal regions than in the frontal and temporal regions. These insights suggest that focusing on channels in the occipital and parietal regions may be important in SSVEP-based user authentication research.},

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the preferred input signal in non-invasive BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. EEG-based BCIs have been successfully used in many applications, such as neurological rehabilitation, text input, games, and so on. However, EEG signals inherently carry rich personal information, necessitating privacy protection. This paper demonstrates that multiple types of private information (user identity, gender, and BCI-experience) can be easily inferred from EEG data, imposing a serious privacy threat to BCIs, To address this issue, we design perturbations to convert the original EEG data into privacy-protected EEG data, which conceal the private information while maintaining the primary BCI task performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the privacy-protected EEG data can significantly reduce the classification accuracy of user identity, gender and BCI-experience, but almost do not affect at all the classification accuracy of the primary BCI task, enabling user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.},

Source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation (SF-SSDA), which transfers a pre-trained model to a new dataset with no source data and limited labeled target data, can be used for privacy-preserving seizure subtype classification. This paper considers two challenges in SF-SSDA for EEG-based seizure subtype classification: 1) How to effectively fuse both raw EEG data and expert knowledge in classifier design? 2) How to align the source and target domain distributions for SF-SSDA? We propose a Knowledge-Data Fusion based SF-SSDA approach, KDF-MutuaISHOT, for EEG-based seizure subtype classification. In source model training, KDF uses Jensen-Shannon Diver-gence to facilitate mutual learning between a feature-driven Decision Tree-based model and a data-driven Transformer-based model. To adapt KDF to a new target dataset, an SF-SSDA algorithm, MutualSHOT, is developed, which features a consistency-based pseudo-label selection strategy. Experiments on the public TUSZ and CHSZ datasets demonstrated that KDF-MutualSHOT outperformed other supervised and source-free domain adaptation approaches in cross-subject seizure subtype classification.},

Leveraging the dual expertise of the Wav2Vec and Wav2Vec2 models, the T2T framework utilizes unsupervised and self-supervised learning knowledges to effectively address the unique challenges posed by tonal languages. By integrating these two powerful models into a unified SER framework, T2T enhances its capability to process and interpret nuanced emotional cues in speech, achieving superior performance compared to traditional SER methods. Evaluated across three major datasets—ThaiSER, EMOLA, and MU—the framework demonstrates significant improvements in unweighted accuracy and F1-score. Innovations such as emotional clustering representation and targeted emotional representation contribute to its high precision in detecting and differentiating subtle emotional states. Additionally, the integration of a fine-tuned teacher module aligns these advancements with practical SER applications, further increasing the framework&#39;s accuracy and sensitivity in real-world scenarios. The successful implementation of the T2T framework opens new avenues for enhancing SER technologies in other low-resource languages and extends its applicability to real-time processing applications, thereby advancing the field of computational emotion recognition.},

This study investigates the differences in SPS among learners and the impact of various avatars on video presentations, a medium that has seen increased use due to COVID-19. We surveyed 20 participants who engaged with SDG instructional videos featuring four different avatars. Using the HSPS-J19 self-assessment tool, analysis of their SPS responses revealed a normal distribution of SPS scores, indicating individual differences. Additionally, correlations were found between HSPS-J19 scores and participants&#39; impressions and motivation regarding avatar presentations. Cluster analysis results suggested that the group with a higher tendency towards HSP traits benefited more from appropriate avatar use. Based on these findings, we designed an online lecture support environment that allows for the control of video stimuli. This research explores an underexamined area and aims to enhance online lectures for HSPs, who constitute approximately 15% to 20% of the population.

  abstract  = {Session-based recommendation aims to make recommendations for anonymous users based on limited session data. However, traditional session-based recommendation methods fail to capture complex item transitions and simply represent the user&#39;s last clicked item as a short-term preference, neglecting the global sequential information of the session. This approach struggles to consider transitions between contexts and cannot accurately capture the user&#39;s true intentions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a session recommendation method based on self-attention residual connections and graph neural Hawkes (SRGNH). This method introduces a duallayer network structure consisting of graph neural self-attention residual connection layers and graph neural Hawkes layers, designed to learn users&#39; long-term and short-term preferences, respectively. SRGNH employs a Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) to capture complex interactions between nodes, obtaining latent vectors for each item. It incorporates self-attention networks and residual connections to effectively utilize low-level inspired information for capturing users&#39; long-term preferences. The graph neural Hawkes layer combines the Hawkes process with GGNN to capture the relationship between user item clicks over continuous time, accurately representing users&#39; short-term preferences. To better represent user intent, we linearly combine users&#39; long-term and short-term preferences in the end. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRGNH outperforms other recommendation models on the Diginetica, Yoochoose1/64, and Yoochoose1/4 datasets.},

  abstract  = {Few-shot multi-modal sentiment analysis (MSA) is a crucial task in the field of visual-language understanding and playing a pivotal role across various application domains (e.g., interaction, e-commerce promotion and social media analysis, etc). Recently, with the development of pre-trained language models, prior works have predominantly utilized a combination of pre-trained language models alongside visual encoders and employed prompt learning to generalize pre-trained language models to the MSA tasks. However, there are specialized vision-language pre-trained models (VLPM) designed to handle visual-language tasks, such as visual question answering. There are little explorations on VLPM and its prompt learning method for multi-modal sentiment analysis. Therefore, our work fills this gap by proposing the Two-stage Multi-modal Prompt Tuning (TSMMP) for few-shot sentiment analysis based on VLPM. TSMMP consists of two stage prompt tunings. In the first stage, we encode the images and text separately and feed them into a VLPM to obtain three outputs: Multi-modal Prompt (MM), Sentiment Answer (ANS), and Visual Prompt (VP). Subsequently, we design a parameterized fusion module to merge the three outputs. The merged representation is served as initialization for the prompts in the second stage. We design a multi-modal prompt approach for the second stage, which consists of Manual Prompts, Learned Prompts, and Fusion Prompts. Manual Prompts are manually crafted natural language templates, Learned Prompts are a series of continuously trainable prompt vectors and Fusion Prompts are the result of merging MM, ANS, and VP via the fusion model. Through thorough experimental analysis, we demonstrated that our method performs well on both coarse-grained and fine-grained datasets. By conducting ablation studies, we have shown that each component of our proposed multi-modal prompt template is effective, and the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach entirely.},

To address this, we propose a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) framework called CBR-KNOWLEDGE for autonomously select precise knowledge enhancement configurations tailored to specific empathetic dialogue contexts. Firstly, CBR-KNOWLEDGE establishes a case base that mirrors the overall quality of empathetic dialogues generated under various knowledge enhancement configurations. Subsequently, CBR-KNOWLEDGE employs an innovative text representation method, integrating an additional representation for words with noteworthy emotional impact. This approach facilitates the retrieval of analogous empathetic dialogues, enabling the reuse of their knowledge enhancement configurations to determine a new knowledge enhancement configuration. Ultimately, CBR-KNOWLEDGE employs this precise knowledge enhancement configuration for the purpose of empathetic dialogue generation. Experimental results demonstrate that CBR-KNOWLEDGE effectively enhances the performance of empathetic dialogue generation task.},

In particular, when addressing problems involving the non-homogeneous 2D fluid dynamics equations, the characteristic parameters of the phys-ical processes were redefined.

Comparative experiments involving five benchmark physics-informed neural network methods emphasize the significant improvement in capturing time-varying features and prediction accuracy brought by the proposed approach.

Recognizing the limitations of current deep learning methods that rely heavily on large-scale datasets and extensive pre-training, we propose a method for handling small datasets. Our model can effectively han-dle smaller data volumes without the need for pre-training weights. The key to our approach is in the introduction of an efficient positional embedding (EPE) module, which improves parameter utilization and network expressiveness through a grouped convolutional architecture and shuffling operations for dynamic information exchange. In addition, we integrated the Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) module in Windows Multi-Head Self-Attention (W-MSA) and named the new module PSA-W-MSA; PSA addresses the complexity of learning element-specific attention by combining polarization filtering with augmentation techniques. Through a series of experiments on the Mini-Imagenet dataset, the PSA-Swin Transformer demonstrates notable performance, especially in environments where high-quality annotated data is scarce or costly to acquire.

  abstract  = {Existing deep neural network (DNN) pruning methods can be classified into two main categories: structured pruning and weight pruning. Structured pruning is a representative model compression technology of DNN to reduce the storage and computation requirements and accelerate inference, which mainly includes filter pruning and channel pruning. However, they both belong to coarse-grained methods, which can only decide whether to prune a whole filter or channel or not and provide limited decision space. On the other hand, structured stripe-wise pruning has finer granularity than filter pruning, and shape-wise pruning also has finer granularity than channel pruning. These two fine-grained methods are related to two dimensions: rows and columns from the general matrix multiplication (GEMM) perspective of convolution operations. Considering that combining pruning decisions in finer granularity from multiple dimensions will produce a larger solution space, in this paper we propose a joint multi-dimensional fine-grained pruning scheme (JFP) for DNN compression, which simultaneously prune elements in filters and channels. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that: (1) JFP achieves stabler pruning ratios compared to stripe-wise pruning (2) JFP effectively compresses DNN parameters and reduces calculation amount while maintaining the accuracy compared with counterparts.},

  abstract  = {Pressure-sensitive smart textiles are widely applied in the fields of healthcare, sports monitoring, and intelligent homes. The integration of devices embedded with pressure sensing arrays is expected to enable comprehensive scene coverage and multi-device integration. However, the implementation of identity recognition, a fundamental function in this context, relies on extensive device-specific datasets due to variations in pressure distribution across different devices. To address this challenge, we propose a novel user identification method based on contrastive learning. We design two parallel branches to facilitate user identification on both new and existing devices respectively, employing supervised contrastive learning in the feature space to promote domain unification. When encountering new devices, extensive data collection efforts are not required; instead, user identification can be achieved using limited data consisting of only a few simple postures. Through experimentation with two 8-subject pressure datasets (BedPressure and ChrPressure), our proposed method demonstrates the capability to achieve user identification across 12 sitting scenarios using only a dataset containing 2 postures. Our average recognition accuracy reaches 79.05%, representing an improvement of 2.62% over the best baseline model.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning (DL) is characterized by its demanding computational and memory requirements, which creates a significant challenge when deploying on edge devices. These devices often have limited computational capabilities and constrained resources. Most existing methods primarily focus on model-level techniques, such as model pruning or parameter quantization, to reduce model size and computation for accelerating inference. Considering the prevalent programming paradigms in DL, we propose a host memory optimization method, namely HMO, which can be integrated into DL programming framework, e.g., PyTorch, to improve the inference efficiency of DL models without modifying any model code. We particularly focus on memory optimization for intermediate variables in inference, aiming to enhance inference speed while maintaining a lower memory footprint. HMO involves a single profiling of inference to gather memory statistics about intermediate variables. These statistics are then used to guide subsequent inference. Additionally, we incorporate huge pages in operating systems to improve the memory access performance of HMO. Our experimental results show that HMO can achieve an average inference latency optimization ratio of 20.13 % compared with native PyTorch on six typical DL image representation models while effectively managing memory usage. Importantly, this is achieved without compromising model accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Suicide and suicidal behaviors remain significant challenges for public policy and healthcare. In response, psy-chological support hotlines have been established worldwide to provide immediate help to individuals in mental crises. The effectiveness of these hotlines largely depends on accurately identifying callers&#39; emotional states, particularly underlying negative emotions indicative of increased suicide risk. However, the high demand for psychological interventions often results in a shortage of professional operators, highlighting the need for an effective speech emotion recognition model. This model would automatically detect and analyze callers&#39; emotions, facil-itating integration into hotline services. Additionally, it would enable large-scale data analysis of psychological support hotline interactions to explore psychological phenomena and behaviors across populations. Our study utilizes data from the Beijing psychological support hotline, the largest suicide hotline in China. We analyzed speech data from 105 callers containing 20,630 segments and categorized them into 11 types of negative emotions. We developed a negative emotion recognition model and a fine-grained multi-label classification model using a large-scale pretrained model. Our experiments indicate that the negative emotion recognition model achieves a maximum F1-score of 76.96%. However, it shows limited efficacy in the fine-grained multi-label classification task, with the best model achieving only a 41.74% weighted F1-score. We conducted an error analysis for this task, discussed potential future improvements, and considered the clinical application possibilities of our study.

This study first proposes an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on a hybrid model using quantum-inspired evolutionary neural networks. The model integrates a deep neural network (DNN) and a global best-guided quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm (GQTS). To safeguard against potential threats, an IDS is deployed to monitor network or system traffic and detect malicious attacks. Anomaly detection, a pivotal aspect of IDS, aims to establish a normal model to respond effectively to unknown abnormal attacks. The experiment utilizes the latest dataset, CICIDS2017, which is generated based on realistic background traffic. During the training phase, GQTS selects valid features from the dataset and optimizes the hyperparameters of the DNN setting automatically, significantly contributing to improving accuracy and reducing the false negative rate. The results highlight that the proposed hybrid model decreases computational complexity through feature selection and enhances model accuracy via suitable hyperparameter optimization compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract  = {This paper explores the application of driving simulator across multiple sectors, highlighting the challenges associated with refining motion cueing algorithms (MCA) through model predictive control (MPC). Through these platforms, drivers can simulate the sensation of motion. The implementation of MPC-based MCA, while advantageous for its precision in controlling motion simulations, encounters significant hurdles such as the requirement for highly accurate system models and the extensive parameter tuning needed for each specific control scenario. These issues create a critical gap in achieving optimal simulation fidelity and efficiency with lower computational time, necessitating a novel approach to improve the MCA domain. Addressing these challenges, the study pioneers the use of Deep QNetwork (DQN), a reinforcement learning (RL) technique, to optimise the horizons of MPC within the MCA domain. This innovation is significant as it introduces, for the first time, a method to dynamically adjust MPC-based MCA horizons using DQN, which learns through continuous interaction with the simulation environment. This approach is set to overcome the limitations of traditional meta-heuristic optimisation methods, such as the Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithms (GOA) and Butterfly Optimisation Algorithms (BOA), by offering a more flexible and adaptable solution. The overarching goal of this research is to minimise the system&#39;s cost function by maximising a reward function that encompasses key performance metrics such as specific force sensation, angular velocity, linear displacement, linear velocity, and angular displacement. By integrating DQN into the MPC-based MCA environment, this study demonstrates a faster computational running time and improves the precision and efficiency of the simulations. This innovative approach enhances the efficiency of the horizon determination process, showcasing promising implications for the MCA domain&#39;s advancement.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, addressing large-scale machine learning problems using high-performance computing (HPC) clusters has gained significant importance. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in machine learning for solving optimization problems on clusters. However, ADMM&#39;s performance is greatly affected by imbalanced datasets on the HPC cluster. In this paper, we propose the distributed shunt ADMM with a new adaptive penalty method based on the hybrid MPI/OpenMP programming model (S-ADMM). The proposed shunt strategy chooses different sub-problem optimization algorithms to improve the accuracy with the imbalanced datasets. Additionally, we design a novel adaptive penalty parameter method and improve a sub-problem optimization algorithm for S-ADMM. The adaptive penalty parameter method accelerates the algorithm&#39;s convergence and the sub-problem optimization algorithm improves the training efficiency of ADMM. Moreover, S-ADMM reduces communication cost by exchanging parameters among nodes using the MPI and saves calculation time by parallel computation within nodes via OpenMP threads. For the SVM classification problem, experiments conducted on the Tianhe-2 supercomputing platform show that S-ADMM has competitive running efficiency and up to 43% accuracy improvement compared to existing distributed ADMM implemented with pure MPI or MPI/OpenMP on imbalanced datasets.},

Many prior works have primarily emphasized the dependencies among channels in the spatial domain, neglecting the dynamic interaction of EEG in both spatial and frequency domains, which may limit the performance of EEG emotion recognition. To address these issues, we propose the dual-domain attention based adaptive graph convolutional network (DDA-AGCN) for EEG emotion recognition. Specifically, we propose the lightweight dual-domain attention mechanism (DDA) based on random vector similarity measurement and the squeezeexcitation technique to capture important characteristics in the channel and frequency domain respectively. Furthermore, the adaptive graph convolutional network (AGCN) is utilized to adaptively filter and refine low signal-to-noise ratio EEG data, while also learning the dynamic connectivity patterns among important EEG channels and extracting higher-level abstract features for emotion recognition tasks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental comparisons were conducted on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED. The experimental results show that our method achieves highly competitive classification performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, under fair comparison, the DDA demonstrates better performance and computational efficiency than self-attention.},

In essence, LRT-2DP embraces the global self-expressiveness property to denoise the corrupted data, from which a 2D projection basis is learned for robust feature extraction. The proposed LRT-2DP can be efficiently optimized with an alternative optimization scheme.

Human hands are unique and can leave distinct patterns, marks, or prints that can be utilized for forensic examinations. This paper compares various machine learning approaches to hand detection and presents the application results of employing the best-performing model to identify images of significant importance in forensic contexts. We fine-tune YOLOv8 and vision transformer-based object detection models on four hand image datasets, including the 11k hands dataset with our own bounding boxes annotated by a semi-automatic approach. Two YOLOv8 variants, i.e., YOLOv8 nano (YOLOv8n) and YOLOv8 extra-large (YOLOv8x), and two vision transformer variants, i.e., DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and Detection Transformers with Assignment (DETA), are employed for the experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOv8 models outperform DETR and DETA on all datasets. The experiments also show that YOLOv8 approaches result in superior performance compared with existing hand detection methods, which were based on YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 models. Applications of our fine-tuned YOLOv8 models for identifying hand images (or frames in a video) with high forensic values produce excellent results, significantly reducing the time required by forensic experts. This implies that our approaches can be implemented effectively for real-world applications in forensics or related fields.},

In contrast to former methods that focus on filtering vertex coordinate and face normal apart, MSE-Net innovatively fuses more structure features like face area, inner product between face normal and vertex normals, and the interior angles of face to guide the face normal and vertex position updating, utilizing the inherent structural characteristic of Mesh. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {Weed detection is crucial for the healthy growth of crops, yet existing detection models struggle to perform high-accuracy real-time detection of weeds in natural environments on edge computing devices. This paper introduces EMPA-YOLO, a model designed for rapid, accurate, real-time weed detection on low-performance edge computing devices. It incorporates an efficient multi-scale convolutional structure, C3EMSC, and a lightweight, adaptive weight subsampling layer, LAWDS, into YOLOv5s. Additionally, a logical distillation algorithm, AlignSoftTarget, is proposed for knowledge distillation. Validation on a mixed dataset of crops and weeds showed that EMPA-YOLO improved mAP50 by 11.2%, reduced parameter count by 4.8M, decreased computational load by 8.7GFLOPs, and increased inference frame rate by 58% compared to the original YOLOv5s algorithm. When compared to YOLOv3, YOLOv5s, YOLOv6, YOLOv8s, and RT-DETR, inference speed improved by 89.2%, 60.8%, 77.5%, 76.5%, and 94.7%, respectively, with mean accuracy enhancements of 7.3%, 11.2%, 16.7%, 0.9%, and 1.2%. Real-world testing on edge computing devices met real-time detection requirements, proving its efficacy and practicality in weed detection.},

However, there are still some issues, e.g., how to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting, how to adequately extract high-level semantic information of multi-view streaming data and improve the discrimination of hash models, and how to effectively optimize the binary constraint problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic Consistency based Dual-asymmetric Discrete Online Hashing method, SC-DDOH for short. It adopts a dual-asymmetric distance-based similarity supervision to retain similarities of new data chunk and database. To extract efficient high-level semantic information, an online semantic consistent supervision to mine the semantic related information from word embedding labels. Moreover, an efficient discrete iterative optimization algorithm is introduced to directly learn hash code in the Hamming space.

However, the performance of LSMs significantly depends on the design of their network architecture, which is overly reliant on existing human experience. Furthermore, as the network scale increases, the computing resources required for deployment and operation also increase, so we regarded the network design as a multi-objective problem. To address these challenges, we introduced an effective surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary neural architecture search algorithm that balanced the accuracy and network scale. Our approach utilized parameter sensitivity analysis followed by the upper confidence bound algorithm to reduce the search space. Experimental results demonstrate that we successfully reduced the dimensions of the search space by 11% and the size of the entire search space by 75%. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach offered better trade-off solutions, such as a solution that reduced network scale by 32.5% while maintaining the same accuracy, and another that improved accuracy by 1.4% without changing the network scale. Furthermore, the knee point reduced network scale by 25 % and simultaneously increased accuracy by 0.7%. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/XinSida/MOENAS-PSA.},

The current methods are struggling to model the overall trend of traffic flow series and are unable to utilize dynamic information about spatial dependencies. In this paper, we propose an adaptive graph spatial temporal Fourier-enhanced transformer networks (ASTFETN) to tackle the above traffic prediction problems. ASTFETN adopts an encoder-decoder architecture, the encoder and decoder are both composed of multiple spatial-temporal blocks to capture dynamic spatial and nonlinear temporal correlations. Furthermore, there is a transformer attention layer to capture the relationships of historical and future time.

This integration with RGB images aims to enhance crack detection performance. However, the generation of disparity maps is susceptible to image noise and matching errors, leading to inaccurate or mismatched disparity values that may impede precise ground crack detection. To mitigate this challenge, we apply a disparity transformation technique to refine the estimated disparity map, improving the differentiation of crack regions. Additionally, we employ a feature fusion method based on a connected low-loss subspace. This approach adaptively assigns feature weights to facilitate the complementary fusion of disparity and RGB features. Fur-thermore, the decoder includes a multi-scale feature alignment module that uses the fused encoder features to align each layer in the decoding process. This preserves image details and local features, enhancing the overall detection accuracy. Extensive testing experiments demonstrate a significant breakthrough in crack detection performance, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 80.48%.

  abstract  = {The rise in wearable devices has led to the generation of a large amount of unlabeled electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Effectively utilising this data has been a challenge. One approach to address this issue is contrastive learning. However, most existing contrastive learning methods based on data augmentation primarily utilize the augmented electro-cardiogram (ECG) signals for comparison. These approaches have certain drawbacks. While the augmented ECG signals may help highlight certain features, they could also potentially mask important variations in the original signal, leading to the loss of crucial information. Moreover, solely relying on augmented data may lead to the model relying too heavily on specific variation patterns, overlooking the authentic features present in the original signal, resulting in poor generalization and robustness for downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose a multi-lead electrocardiogram signal classification method based on temporal and multi-view contrastive learning. The method utilizes the time invariance of ECG signals and the multi-view information provided by the original ECG signals and augmented signals for contrastive learning. Through this approach, it not only addresses the limitations of relying solely on augmented signals but also leverages the prior knowledge that ECG signal categories remain stable over short periods of time to fully model the time context of ECG signals, capturing dynamic features. The integration of the temporal context comparison module and the multi-view comparison module significantly enhances the performance of downstream classification tasks. The outcomes of our experiments show that our method performs better on four datasets than previous approaches, which even exceeds supervised performance. When we pretrain on the SPH dataset and fine-tune on the PTB-XL dataset, our approach shows the best performance. Specifically, our method&#39;s AUROC exceeds that of the best baseline model by 4.9% and surpasses supervised performance by 1.3%.},

However, major challenges still remain in perception, navigation and manipulation while implementing an autonomous robotic system for this purpose. We present a system aimed at addressing some of these challenges through novel approaches. In terms of perception, we have developed a transformer-based local anomaly detection algorithm that can identify misplaced items without the need for a central database. Navigation of the omnidirectional mobile base is performed through stereo vision and LiDAR sensors. Finally, identifying grasping and manipulation as one of the key shortcomings of present robotic systems in this domain, we have developed a customized soft robotic gripper targeted at retail objects. It has compliant cable-driven fingers, and a palm configuration that can be adapted in real-time based on the target object&#39;s geometry. Coupled with a conventional two-fingered gripper in a dual-arm setup, this system is equipped to handle most objects encountered in a retail setting. We describe the underlying hardware and algorithms for each component of the system, evaluating their individual performance. We then evaluate the whole system in a mock retail setup, demonstrating promising results for autonomous management of shelves.},

  abstract  = {Declining birthrate and aging populations are progressing all over the world. This has led to labor shortage, making visual inspections more challenging in various industries. Recently, visual anomaly detection methods using deep learning have been proposed to solve these problems. However, they are computationally expensive and difficult to infer in real-time, even in a GPU environment. In addition, while they detect structural anomalies (e.g., scratches and stains), logical anomalies (e.g., mis-position and mis-number) cannot be detected. This work proposes an anomaly detection method to detect both structural and logical anomalies with high speed by improving Patch Core. The proposal applies self-attention mechanism for the intermediate layer of the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) model. Self-attention mechanism enables the model to understand the relationships between image features and detect logical anomalies. In addition, the global and local features are extracted from the intermediate layer of the pretrained CNN model and stored in Separate Memory Bank (SMB). SMB leads to improving AUROC, which represents accuracy, by calculating features for each feature type. It also avoids unnecessary upsampling and reduces the dimensionality, thus improving inference speed. Experiments validate the proposed method and compare previous anomaly detection methods. Experiments evaluate the performance of the proposal for the CAD-SD dataset and MVTec LOCO dataset, which contains structural and logical anomalies. For Co-occurrence dataset, the experimental results show that the proposal achieves 98.5% (improving 2.2%) for AUROC and 16.1 (improving 66.6%) for FPS compared to the state-of-the-art method. Also, the experimental results show that the proposal achieves 82.8% (improving 0.9%) for MVTec-LOCO dataset. Hence, the proposal can contribute to the efficiency and automation of manufacturing, medical, and other fields.},

Our system triggers alerts when sensor readings exceed 10 ppm for toluene, 35 ppm for carbon monoxide, and 5000 ppm for carbon dioxide.

Data from these sensors is transmitted via low-power Bluetooth to a mobile APP, enabling real-time monitoring of the wearer&#39;s condition. In case of cartridge failure or abnormal physiological readings, the APP triggers vibrations on the mask and automatically sends an SOS to the employer&#39;s server via UDP protocol, ensuring immediate intervention.

However, this kind of enhancement is only significant on monolithic architectures, and when it runs on large-scale distributed training, data security and privacy issues will be reconsidered, and its prediction performance is unknown. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework: FedBChain, which integrates the federated learning paradigm based on a modified DeepConvLSTM architecture with a single LSTM layer. This framework performs comparative tests of prediction performance on three different real-world datasets based on three different hidden layer units (128, 256, and 512) combined with five different federated learning strategies, respectively. The results show that our architecture has significant improvements in Precision, Recall and F1-score compared to the centralized training approach on all datasets with all hidden layer units for all strategies: FedAvg strategy improves on average by 4.54%, FedProx improves on average by 4.57%, FedTrimmedAvg improves on average by 4.35%, Krum improves by 4.18% on average, and FedAvgM improves by 4.46% on average. Based on our results, it can be seen that FedBChain not only improves in performance, but also guarantees the security and privacy of user data compared to centralized training methods during the training process.

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a real-time pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) algorithm for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It is motivated by a practical challenge encountered during the development and operation of a positioning system named KAILOS, which provides positioning services via a smartphone application. Its dependence on smartphones causes data collection constraints imposed by operating systems. To mitigate this issue, we designed and incorporated a dedicated IoT device into the system, enabling full access to sensing data. This invention demands developing and porting a PDR algorithm into the IoT device to address the communication bottleneck with a remote positioning server. Our goal was to process a large amount of data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) instantly on the device to produce precise relative location information without forwarding all of it to the server. To this end, we propose a new approach for detecting steps using acceleration differential in our PDR. Additionally, a dynamic gyroscope bias update strategy is also included to enhance the capability of heading estimation. These advancements not only enhance the accuracy of the PDR algorithm but also facilitate its implementation on IoT devices. We practically deployed the PDR algorithm into our IoT hardware platform called Kailos Tag (K-Tag). Via the extensive experiments conducted both indoors and outdoors, we found that our real-time PDR outperformed the conventional methods. It reduces step detection errors (SDE) to approximately 1.6%, travel distance errors (TDE) to below 1.8%, and end/start errors(E/SE) to about 3.2m regardless of environment. Moreover, it enables an average positioning latency of 2.49 ms, while consuming only 20% of CPU usage and 8.6% of total power consumption.},

In contrast, the human brain exhibits robust and efficient recognition of sensitive targets. To leverage the strengths of both computer calculation and human cognition, we propose a multimodal mutual learning with online knowledge distillation method (MMOKD) for object recognition. Our approach enables simultaneous training and mutual learning between modalities, where each modality serves as both a teacher and a student.

The primary challenge lies in the significant variation in appearance and background due to different camera angles, which complicates the retrieval of consistent vehicle images from a database. The variability directly impacts the effectiveness of re-identification techniques. This paper proposes a novel learning approach that leverages a view-consistent triplet loss framework and region segmentation to address the challenges of pose variation and background complexity in vehicle re-identification due to multi-view imaging. Specifically, the consistency of segmentation area distribution is used to estimate view consistency, and then triplets are selected based on it. Concentrating on distinguishing features between sample pairs that are likely to be confused, our approach markedly enhances model robustness in scenarios involving multiple perspectives. Experimental evaluations on the Veri776 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses several state-of-the-art techniques across various metrics and shows exceptional performance in recognizing samples with complex viewpoints, thus validating the efficacy of our approach.},

This paper puts forward a reversible neural NLW approach with improved capacity and text quality. Specifically, we construct a novel lexical substitution system (LSS), utilizing prompt learning for candidates generation and comprehensive assessment features for candidates ranking. A reversible watermarking scheme is then presented by ingeniously screening recoverable positions and enabling multi-bit substitutions via the proposed LSS.

  abstract  = {Derivative-free optimization has achieved remarkable success across a variety of applications where the explicit formulation of an objective function is inaccessible. Learning an accurate surrogate model from solutions and their function values is crucial for derivative-free optimization. Methods for constructing global surrogate models, such as Bayesian optimization (BO), encounter the challenge of high learning cost, which impairs optimization efficiency. Splitting the entire search domain into smaller regions, a series of domain partition methods are proposed, like simultaneous optimistic optimization (SOO). It has demonstrated notable effectiveness in derivative-free optimization but still has room for improvement due to its relatively coarse-grained partition strategy. To this end, this paper proposes a fine-grained simultaneous optimistic optimization (FGSOO) method with local Gaussian process. Specifically, FGSOO designs a fine-grained partition strategy to endow SOO with the capability of cross-height comparison, and utilizes local Gaussian process to make nodes&#39; potential more representative, so as to reduce the required number of solutions for learning surrogate models. Compared with BO, FGSOO reduces the learning cost. Meanwhile, compared with SOO, FGSOO could avoid unnecessary partition. The experimental results on real-world tasks, such as trajectory optimization and molecule substructure optimization, verify that FGSOO surpasses the compared methods in improving efficiency while maintaining effectiveness.},

  abstract  = {Dialogue State Tracking (DST) aims to convert dialogue history into dialogue states of slot-value pairs. Many existing studies usually utilize deep neural networks to learn the representation of dialogues and slots. However, these studies usually do not adequately consider the fine-grained relation-ships between each word and slot in a dialogue. Meanwhile, due to the complexity of the task, there needs to be more textual and semantic diversity in dialogues. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained relation-driven model (FRD-DST) to synthesize the dialogues and the connections between words and slots. In this approach, each word and slot of information in a dialogue context is constructed as a dialogue word-slot heterograph, and a relationship aggregation network is used to capture the fine-grained features between them. Meanwhile, to complement the contextual association features that the relational aggregation network may not adequately capture, we use a conditional random field (CRF) to capture the dialogue contextual association features after synonym replacement. The two feature information sets are fused in a hidden space, which can create new features by mixing the hidden states of different texts to create new semantic variants, thus enhancing the diversity of dialogue texts and semantics. The experimental results show that FRD-DST achieves state-of-the-art DST performance on the MultiWOZ 2.1 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets compared to existing DST methods.},

  abstract  = {High detail and fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are highly demanded in clinical settings, as inadequate imaging information can lead to diagnostic difficulties. MR image super-resolution (SR) is a promising way to address this issue, but its performance is limited due to the practical difficulty of acquiring paired low- and high-resolution (LR and HR) images. Most existing methods generate these pairs by down-sampling HR images, a process that often fails to capture complex degradations and domain-specific variations. In this study, we propose a domain-distance adapted SR framework (DDASR), which includes two stages: the domain-distance adapted down-sampling network (DSN) and the GAN-based super-resolution network (SRN). The DSN incorporates characteristics from unpaired LR images during down-sampling process, enabling the generation of domain-adapted LR images. Additionally, we present a novel GAN with enhanced attention U-Net and multi-layer perceptual loss. The proposed approach yields visually convincing textures and successfully restores outdated MRI data from the ADNI1 dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art SR approaches in both perceptual and quantitative evaluations.

  abstract  = {3D medical image segmentation is an essential task in the medical image field, which aims to segment organs or tumours into different labels. A number of issues exist with the current 3D medical image segmentation task: existing models cannot simultaneously obtain the space correlation and depth correlation of 3D slices; previous models suffer from local detail loss of positional embedding in 3D images; previous approaches often have blurring of boundaries in segmenting 3D images. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation model named TPM-SAM. In our model, we design a twinchannel image encoder to simultaneously capture the space correlation and depth correlation of 3D slices through a multi-head attention mechanism and improved adapters. Furthermore, we design a prompt encoding generator, which divides the volumetric image into small blocks and better captures the local detail information. In addition, we introduce a multi-layer aggregation decoder by employing U-Net with multi-level skip connection to solve the blurring of boundaries in processing 3D images. Finally, we experimented and evaluated our model on KiTS21 and LiTS17 datasets to compare with other baseline models.},

  abstract  = {Radiology report generation is an essential task in the medical field, which aims to automate the generation of medical terminology descriptions of radiology images. However, this task currently suffers from several problems: 1) existing methods need to manually build knowledge graphs or templates (consuming time and effort) to introduce medical or prior knowledge to assist in report generation; 2) previous models cannot handle the problem of data bias well (anomaly reports and anomaly descriptions make up only a tiny portion of the dataset), causing the models to ignore the learning of anomaly descriptions easily; 3) existing approaches cannot robustly supervise the model, resulting in incomplete and inconsistent reports being generated. To address these issues, we propose a cross-modal interactive memory network based on fine-grained medical feature extraction. In our model, we design a cross-modal interactive memory network to automatically store and remember the required medical text knowledge and use this medical knowledge to help generate reports. Furthermore, we design an abnormal medical knowledge enhancement module to enhance the learning of abnormal fine-grained knowledge through the interaction of disease topics and their states to interact with text features. In addition, we design a cross-modal joint semantic loss unit to reduce semantic differences between different features and improve the visual representation ability of the model.

  abstract  = {Peripheral waveform analysis (PWA), which is generally used to reveal hidden health status information from peripheral pulse signals, typically involves three procedures: signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern classification. With the advancement of data-driven deep neural network methodologies, feature extraction and pattern classification have progressively converged into end-to-end neural networks, where the final layer of the network is equivalent to conventional pattern classifiers. However, the performance of deep learning models heavily relies on the quality of the dataset, rendering data signal preprocessing a crucial component. This study proposes a framework that integrates signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern classification into a unified learning approach using heuristic algorithms, enabling the automatic discovery of optimal data encoding methods and their corresponding models. Initially, the search space is defined based on parameters relevant to signal preprocessing, and a fitness function is constructed utilizing CNN. Subsequently, the optimal combination of data preprocessing and CNN is determined through the heuristic algorithm Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed method was evaluated in the dataset comprising authentic clinical cases of type 2 diabetes screening involving approximately 200 volunteers. The model derived from this framework demonstrates the capability to effectively discriminate between healthy volunteers and those with diabetes, achieving the highest accuracy of 93.6%. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed model was shown to be competitive in both accuracy and time cost.},

Many approaches aim to verify the robustness of neural networks by defining robust regions. However, these approaches do not fully represent the feature regions accurately, leading to imprecise robustness boundaries. In this paper, we propose a method to capture the abstract features based on abstract interpretation theory, and then to verify the robustness of the neural networks. Firstly, samples are divided into decision-making and non-decision-making states, the decision-making states correspond to real output classifications in the abstract output domain. Then, iterating from the abstract output domain to the input domain, to obtain the abstract features associated with the decision-making states. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained abstract features, and more accuracy in verifying robustness boundaries compared to the strategy of defining robust regions.},

However, these datasets are often voluminous, repetitive, and contain a substantial proportion of low-quality data, necessitating effective selection. Traditional data selection methods are plagued by challenges such as insufficient diver-sity, unclear selection criteria, biases from external LLMs, and excessive resource consumption. This paper proposes AlpaCream, a novel instruction data selection methodology designed for industrial applications that aligns with expert insights and ensures maximum diversity of the data. Our approach involves initially categorizing the instruction data into dense clusters using a topic model and then employing a quality assessment model to isolate high-quality instruction data subsets based on their categorizations. The selected data is further improved by using prompt to enhance the data quality. Finally, the augmented data are used to fine-tune the base LLM to get a model with instruction-following solid capability. It can achieve an average performance increase of 31.3% to 39.8% on the Alpaca_52k dataset, which uses 5.76% of the total instruction data. In general, AlpaCream achieved superior performance over comparable instruction data selection methods.},

  abstract  = {The aim of sequential recommendation is to predict the next possible interaction item in a sequence by interpreting the dynamic preferences derived from users&#39; historical interactions. However, these methodologies encounter challenges in effectively leveraging side information that could offer a more precise depiction of user preferences. Furthermore, the presence of noise in the user visit sequence, caused by accidental clicks, hampers the prediction of the subsequent item, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the recommendation. To address these issues, we propose a novel model, LFDF-SR. This model combines a Learnable Filter with Decoupling Fusion Method for Sequential Recommendation. It uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model the interactive items and their corresponding side information separately. To minimize noise, the encoder component incorporates a learnable stacked filter layer to refine item embeddings. In order to more efficiently characterize side information, we innovatively integrate the heterogeneous side information from different sources into a holistic feature representation, which are then embedded through a linear layer. Then the decoder component acquires fused embeddings through a decoupled fusion method of side information, and subsequently merges the denoised item embeddings and fused embeddings using cross-attention to generate the final representation of each item. Extensive experiments on three publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms nine baseline methods in recommendation performance. These results highlight the advantages of LFDF-SR in handling noise and effectively utilizing side information, showcasing its potential to enhance sequential recommendation performance.},

The title of an issue, which is a mandatory field, should accurately describe the core content in a concise way. However, developers often face challenges in crafting high-quality issue titles due to insufficient experience or limited proficiency. As a result, researchers have proposed several methods for automatically generating issue titles, but typically relying on constructing large datasets to train models. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a variety of general tasks, suggesting significant potential for issue title generation. Initial experiments indicate that the direct application of LLMs fails to yield satisfactory results. Therefore, we propose a method named LBITG (LLMs-Based Issue Title Generation). LBITG enhances the effectiveness of LLMs by providing contextual information through four types of prompts, which include example prompt and label prompt. These prompts serve as guidance for LLMs, thereby further improving their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LBITG can significantly enhance the quality of issue titles generated by LLMs without any training. In the within-project scenario, LBITG achieves a minimum improvement of 111.29% in ROUGE, 104.54% in BLEU, and 188.48% in METEOR compared to iTAPE, and achieves performance comparable to that of the SOTA method iTiger. Moreover, LBITG demonstrates superior performance in the cross-project scenario, which outperforms iTiger by 25.33%, 30.14%, and 27.29% in terms of ROUGE-1, BLEU-1, and METEOR, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Thyroid nodules, which can manifest as solitary or multiple growths, are among the most prevalent diseases with a high incidence rate. When examining thyroid nodules, ultrasound is typically the first step. Ultrasound image segmentation of thyroid nodules can assist physicians in diagnosis. However, the following three factors limit the development of thyroid nodule segmentation: (1) most of the existing studies optimize the segmentation of single nodules, and the incidence of multiple nodules is higher, so the segmentation of multiple nodules is also very important; (2) the ultrasound image of thyroid nodules is difficult to segment because of its low resolution and fuzzy boundary; (3) Due to the small data set of thyroid nodule ultrasound, in such a small dataset, attention mechanisms may be prone to overfitting, resulting in poorer generalization performance. Therefore, the attention-based model may not be suitable for the segmentation of thyroid nodules. Hence, we propose Hybrid Convolutional U-Net (HCU-Net), a simple and strong fully convolutional neural network for the segmentation of single or multiple thyroid nodules. HCU-Net incorporates a large receptive field to ensure accurate and stable segmentation. Specifically, we design Hybrid Branch Block to enhance the network&#39;s feature extraction capability for single or multiple nodules in ultrasound images by integrating multi-scale features. Furthermore, we add Enhanced ConvNeXt Blocks to the U-Net&#39;s final layer, enabling the extraction of global contextual information for segmentation performance. The Experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively improve these issues on two publicly available datasets. In addition, compared to attention-based models, our network is simpler and more suitable for small datasets like ultrasound images.},

Instead of the pinhole camera model, pseudo linear genetic programming generates mathematical functions which allow for far greater precision in the calibration process than classical methods, regardless of the environmental conditions. The method has several challenges such as identification of suitable calibration functions and creation of an extensive training database.

  abstract  = {Energy Internet exploits a network of sparsely in-terconnected prosumers and maximizes the peer-to-peer power exchanges by routing power through intermediate peers. A novel graph theory-based deterministic approach for P2P power routing that aids efficient distance-based prosumer matching while addressing limited connectivity challenges is presented here. The proposed Optimal-Walk Multi-path Power Routing (OMPR) approach consists of two steps. First, an optimal-walk connectivity algorithm calculates the shortest path between all the nodes. Leveraging this data, in the second part, the Multi-path Power Routing (MPR) algorithm, identifies optimal paths for handling multiple simultaneous P2P exchanges. In the MPR algorithm, the power scheduling and routing are formulated and solved as a Multi-path Power Scheduling Optimization (MPSO) problem, which is compared as both linear and nonlinear programming. Performance evaluation of the OMPR approach demonstrates the algorithm&#39;s scalability and capability to handle complex scenarios efficiently, including rerouting upon connectivity disruptions. The linear MPSO formulation within the OMPR facilitates real-time implementation compared to nonlinear MPSO by solving an 18-walk P2P exchange in a 100-node community in 0.18 seconds.},

  abstract  = {In the real world, due to various challenging lighting conditions such as low light, underexposure, and overexposure, captured images often exhibit undesirable appearances. Given that images with different exposure levels require different correction processes, a single neural network struggles to produce satisfactory results. We propose a coarse-to-fine exposure correction model for learning exposure consistency representation to address underexposure and overexposure issues. Building upon the bilateral activation mechanism, we introduce the Fourier transform to capture global information and fuse it with locally extracted information through convolution to achieve superior feature representation. Additionally, we employ Laplacian pyramids to decompose the source image into different spatial frequency bands, then the image details are enhanced by denoising high-frequency layers. Experimental results on the MSEC and SICE datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over current state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be made available on GitHub.},

The random intermittent data dropouts in each channel between the system and FDF modeled as a Bernoulli process are considered. Leveraging the Lyapunov theory and slack matrix technique, switching-channel-dependent FDF is crafted to detect faults for USVs and ensure that the augmented system keeps stochastic stability while attaining a strictly dissipative performance.

  abstract  = {Strategically allocating capital and safeguarding investors from potential adverse conditions are important challenges in finance. Building upon Markowitz&#39;s Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), which advocates diversifying investments across uncorrelated assets, we extend this principle to encompass diversified trading strategies. Previous works in portfolio optimization have explored various assets and methodologies, including machine learning and evolutionary algorithms. The Group Trading Strategy Portfolio (GTSP) framework, which utilizes the grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) to optimize portfolios of trading strategies, has also been proposed. However, challenges persist in the GTSP framework, such as the absence of a mechanism in fitness evaluation to ensure dissimilarity among trading strategies within the same group, leading to the inclusion of highly correlated trading strategies in the portfolios generated. Additionally, in the GTSP framework, strategies rely on a single stock series, which poses a risk, as the underlying risk profile remains uniform across strategies, limiting diversification opportunities. To overcome these challenges, we integrate the GTSP approach with network theory, specifically modularity, to create a model we call GTSP-Modu. By introducing diverse underlying assets, ensuring similarity within groups, and re-designed the fitness function, experiments on the real datasets show that the proposed approach is better than the previous approach in terms of risk-adjusted returns.},

However, the traditional retail mode solely focuses on presetting routes for delivery, but fails to deal with the real-time change of customers orders with the assistance of UAVs and UGVs. In this paper, we propose an air-ground cooperative real-time delivery scheme based on joint scheduling. Specifically, UGVs deliver commodities to customers based on spatial-temporal costs (e.g., delivery distance and order urgency). The UAV serves to replenish UGVs with commodity resources, achieving a balance between regional resource consumption and UAV resource replenishment based on joint scheduling. Finally, experimental results show our scheme outperforms other baseline schemes in terms of customers average waiting time, UGVs average delivery delay time, and UAV total flight distance.},

A robot-assisted order picking process revolutionizes the traditional labor-intensive person-to-goods order picking technology, leading to a goods-to-person (G2P) smart warehouse. Within it, robots transport pods to predefined picking stations, where human pickers retrieve the requested goods from these pods to fulfill customer orders. The allocation of pods to robots and the scheduling of picking operations are key optimization issues in G2P order picking systems. Although they play a key role in improving operational efficiency, existing research has paid limited attention to their joint optimization. This study considers a lexicographic multi-objective optimization problem to shorten the order picking cycles under the premise of optimizing the picking efficiency evaluated by makespan. We build a mixed integer program for the newly proposed problem and develop a matheuristic algorithm by integrating a commodity-order model into a metaheuristic algorithm to solve it. Experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly shorten the total order picking cycles while keeping the minimum makespan. It outperforms a recent state-of-the-art algorithm. This work emphasizes the importance of joint optimization within G2P smart warehouses and reveals the high potential of the proposed method to be used in practice.},

By integrating HIF vectors into the training of KGE models, notable improvements are observed across various benchmarks and metrics, accompanied by accelerated model convergence. Our results underscore the effectiveness of human-designed DP in the task of LP, emphasizing the pivotal role of collaboration between humans and AI on KG.

Then, the automatic feature extraction method based on gaze estimation, facial expression recognition, pose estimation, and object recognition models is illustrated to extract features to compute the engagement levels. Videos of 24 children, including 13 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in triadic social interaction were collected for the engagement recognition experiment and cross-group analysis.

Existing water quality prediction methods only consider the historical data of single-type or multi-type water quality. However, meteorology and other factors also have a significant impact on water quality indicators. Therefore, only considering the historical data of water quality is not feasible. Unlike existing studies, this work proposes a hybrid water quality prediction model called CMI to solve the above problem. Before prediction, CMI incorporates a multimodal fusion mechanism of water quality time series and remote sensing images of meteorological rainfall. Moreover, CMI integrates the model of ConvNeXt V2 and a multimodal bottleneck transformer to extract image features for fusing the time series and images. Furthermore, it utilizes an emerging model of iTransformer to realize prediction with the fused features. Experimental results with real-life water quality time series and remotely sensed rainfall images demonstrate that CMI outperforms other state-of-the-art fusion algorithms, and the water quality prediction accuracy with fused meteorological data is 13% higher on average than that with only water quality time series.},

  abstract  = {Lesion segmentation plays a crucial role in various medical image analyses, which not only improves the efficiency in clinical diagnosis but also assists in detecting early symptoms of various diseases. Most existing studies focus on directly extracting lesion information from specific types of medical images with pre-trained weights, often neglecting the underlying topological and pathological causes which lead to these lesions. Furthermore, they overlook to capture general anatomical features among lesions, which are related to the distribution of lesions, and thus the model is poorly generalized in different medical datasets. Inspired by these insights, we propose a Triple Fusion Net (TF-Net), a network structure divided into three branches: left, middle and right. The left and right branches are designed to extract lesion features and associated topological style features within various medical images, respectively. And these features are further fused and modeled in the middle branch. The proposed structure of triple branches for features fusing effectively learns multi-feature information and improves the performance of TF-Net. And our work experiments validate various feature fusion methods in the middle branch, including channel-wise concatenation, element-wise addition, attention gate, and transformer encoder block. Without using pre-trained weights in our network, the transformer encoder block performs best on some tasks of DDR and surpasses other pre-trained models. Channel concatenation exhibits performance close to other pre-trained models in both the IDRiD, Kvasir-Seg and TN3K. Attention gate fusion also shows competitive results in thyroid ultrasound segmentation. Our approach, leveraging a unique network structure and four different feature fusion methods, demonstrates remarkable generality across a spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel method to quantify Trust in HRI. It proposes an HRI framework for estimating the Robot Trust towards the Human in the context of a narrow and specified task. The framework produces a real-time estimation of an AI agent&#39;s Artificial Trust towards a Human partner interacting with a mobile teleoperation robot. The approach for the framework is based on principles drawn from Theory of Mind, including information about the human state, action, and intent. The framework creates the ATTUNE model for Artificial Trust Towards Human Operators. The model uses metrics on the operator&#39;s state of attention, navigational intent, actions, and performance to quantify the Trust towards them. The model is tested on a pre-existing dataset that includes recordings (ROSbags) of a human trial in a simulated disaster response scenario. The performance of ATTUNE is evaluated through a qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results of the analyses provide insight into the next stages of the research and help refine the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {Rehabilitation therapy involving repetitive exer-cises targeting specific human joints under the supervision of a doctor is crucial for patients with movement disorders. Yet the cost of commuting and the demand for medical resources are inconvenient for patients. Human-computer interaction can provide remote rehabilitation guidance for patients at home through human pose estimation technology, but privacy concerns with optical sensors and the cost and discomfort of wearable sensors have hindered progress in this field. To address the above challenges, we propose mmHPE, an innovative 3D human pose estimation framework that uses millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensors. It initially manipulates the raw data captured from radar sensors to generate a spatiotemporal sequence point cloud dataset. Afterward, we create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is linked to a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network. Moreover, a multi-head attention mechanism is employed to boost the network&#39;s performance and to accurately estimate the locations of human skeletons. Ultimately, the 21 points with the corre-sponding human pose position are successfully reconstructed. We investigate the mmHPE framework&#39;s feasibility and cross-domain stability in different home environments in real-world scenarios. This innovation proffers patients a convenient and privacy-conscious solution for their rehabilitation training req-uisites.},

  abstract  = {Various kinds of natural reaching behaviors, such as reaching for a cup or learning a new tennis shot, require adaptive changes in response to error signals. Since reaches are usually coordinated with preceding eye movements to a reach target, learning to reach often occurs under coordinated eye-hand movements. To understand the computational mechanism of eye-hand coordination, we examined whether/how preceding eye movements contribute to the formation of motor memory for reaching. In the experiment, participants were asked to perform sequential eye and hand movements toward a visual target (i.e., eye-then-reach) and to learn two opposing visuomotor perturbations (i.e., clockwise and counterclockwise visuomotor rotations), which normally prevent learning due to memory interference. We found that two visuomotor maps for reaching could be learned simultaneously when each was uniquely associated with preceding static and dynamic gaze states. This gaze-dependent learning effect also attenuated as the pause between eye and hand movements increased. These results demonstrate that the brain encodes reaching memories in tight association with the recent history of preceding dynamic gaze states.},

  abstract  = {Medical image segmentation faces problems such as the unbalanced foreground and background of medical images and the limited dataset size. Meanwhile, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have shown the great application potential and value in medical image segmentation tasks. Compared to the manually-designed medical image segmentation models, the NAS methods can improve the model accuracy, but the complexity and the computing cost of the searched medical image segmentation model is relatively high. In this work, we propose a high-precision but low-complexity scalable medical image segmentation model (Scalable Iterative Dense Network, SIDN) with NAS optimization. The proposed SIDN model consists of scalable iterative U-shape encoder/decoder stacks, uses fewer convolutional kernels in each encoder or decoder and performs dense multi-scale residual semantic connections between encoders and decoders, which can make up for the semantic differences between different levels. It then uses a gradient-based NAS algorithm to further reduce the model complexity and improve the segmentation accuracy. The SIDN model training and NAS optimization only require 1 GPU hour, and the segmentation accuracy has been improved by 7% to 10% on multiple medical image datasets. More importantly, the number of model parameters has been reduced by 31% to 88%, and the amount of calculation has been reduced by 32% to 44 %, greatly improving the model inference speed.

  abstract  = {Image clustering, a fundamental task in computer vision, entails grouping images into distinct categories based on their intrinsic properties and similarities. Traditional (non-deep) image clustering models often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to variations in pose, illumination, or occlusion within image datasets, which frequently lead to multi-modal clusters. In recent years, deep neural networks, with their robust representation learning capabilities, have demonstrated considerable accuracy in image clustering tasks. However, the high computational costs and lack of interpretability of deep models have limited their practical application. In this paper, we introduce the MaxFeature Torque Clustering (MFTC) model, a non-deep approach designed as a transitional solution that bridges the gap between traditional and deep image clustering models. MFTC stands out for its accuracy, outperforming conventional image clustering methods, and provides greater interpretability, an aspect often lacking in deep models. Across six publicly available image datasets, the non-deep MFTC model achieved accuracy comparable to or better than previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep image clustering models.

However, in medical image segmentation, this method still encounters challenges such as suboptimal pseudo-labeling and insufficient feature extraction because of the confirmation bias problem induced by erroneously fitting unlabeled data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates correction modules and contrastive learning. First, our method exploits the difference in the output predictions from two different decoders and employs two rectification losses in the inconsistent regions for labeled and unlabeled data respectively, which mitigates the confirmation bias problem. Additionally, we incorporate two uncertainty-guided pixel-prototype contrastive learning modules, which are designed to perceive complete sample distribution information and optimize the features of pixels with low-uncertainty pseudo labels. Both modules complement each other and enable the encoder to generate class-discriminative features, thereby enhancing the final segmentation performance. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on the two widely used medical image datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

Most previous works strive to mine more semantically effective information from the support to match with the corresponding objects in query. The traditional models generally input the whole image into the deep neural network to obtain the feature representation, and use only one measurement method to improve efficiency. If the objects in them show large intra-class diversity, the discrepancy gap between query and support images is ignored. To solve this problem, we propose an enhanced slicing prototype and multidimensional metric mechanism to address the inefficiency of existing few-shot learning methods in medical image classification. Instead of whole image is input into the deep neural network, our proposed model segments the image into slices, and then use the self-attention mechanism to generate enhanced feature vectors based on transformer. And then, a hybrid metric is used to measure similarity between features by calculating the distance between the support set and query set slice prototypes to improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our model has better classification effect on mini-MedMNIST, which is a few-shot medical image dataset constructed from MedMNIST dataset.},

With the success of multimodal fusion techniques, lots of fusion strategies have been proposed to obtain a favorable multimodal joint representation for MSA. However, existing studies hardly consider the problem of redundant information in unimodal, resulting in the joint representation may contain much redundant information from different modalities, thus limiting the accuracy of sentiment prediction. In this work, we propose a Cross-Modality Disentangled Information Bottleneck Strategy (CMDIBS), which consists of a Cross-Modality Knowledge Awareness (CMKA) module and a Multimodal Disentangled Information Bottleneck (MDIB) mechanism. Specifically, the CMKA module encourages in-teractions among different modalities to learn the sentiment embedding relevant to the predicted goals. In particular, MDIB mechanism aims to maximize the mutual information (MI) between the multimodal joint representation and the predicted label, and maximize the MI between the style embedding with the label and the input data while constraining the MI between the multimodal joint representation and the style embedding to obtain a succinct and efficient multimodal joint representation. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets, namely CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, indicated that the proposed method surpasses existing approaches and attains SOTA performance.},

While deep convolutional networks have achieved satisfactory results in medical image segmentation, they face challenges such as the loss of lesion shape information due to continuous convolution and downsampling, as well as the high cost of manually labeling lesions with varying shapes and sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel Medical Visual Prompting (MVP) framework that leverages pre-training and prompting concepts from Natural Language Processing (NLP). The framework utilizes three key components: Super-Pixel Guided Prompting (SPGP) for superpixelating the input image, Image Embedding Guided Prompting (IEGP) for freezing patch embedding and merging with superpixels to provide visual prompts, and Adaptive Attention Mechanism Guided Prompting (AAGP) for pinpointing prompt content and efficiently adapting all layers. By integrating SPGP, IEGP, and AAGP, the MVP framework enables the segmentation network to better learn shape prompting information and facilitates mutual learning across different tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in various challenging medical image tasks while simplifying single-task medical segmentation models. This novel framework offers improved performance with fewer parameters and holds significant potential for accurate segmentation of lesion regions in various medical tasks, making it clinically valuable.},

Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and transurethral lithotripsy (TUL) are the primary treatments. Although ESWL is less invasive and requires shorter hospital stays, its lower success rate compared to TUL, often necessitates additional treatments, increasing both the physical and financial burdens on patients. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of predicting ESWL outcomes by using advanced machine learning methods to analyze both CT and X-ray images together with clinical findings. Particularly, X-ray images, which have been less frequently in past studies, are anticipated to provide detailed analytical features. Addressing the limitations of current predictive methods, which often suffer from excessive irrelevant features and low interpretability, this study introduces three sophisticated feature selection approaches: P-value, AUC, and SHAP value. These approaches aim to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, SVM, adaboost, and Gaussian NB. Results from 139 subjects with ESWL show that logistic regression and SVM perform optimally, with SHAP-based feature selection significantly boosting outcomes, demonstrated by the increase in the AUC from 0.791 to 0.845 for logistic regression, and from 0.750 to 0.764 for SVM. Furthermore, the study decreases the number of features used in the model from 55 to 19, simplifying the prediction process. However, features extracted from X-ray images showed limited effectiveness.},

To address the problem of large measurement errors due to camera pose changes in train visual positioning, this article proposes a monocular ranging method based on visual beacon imaging size correction. A kilometer post is used as a visual beacon, and a deep neural network is used to detect the visual beacon and extract its feature points&#39; pixel coordinates. The PnP algorithm is used to estimate the camera pose and correct the visual beacon imaging size through the camera pose angle, the average relative error of ranging is stabilized at 2% ~ 3%, and the ranging effect is improved by about 60%, which effectively reducing the ranging error of the monocular ranging model based on known references.},

  abstract  = {Point cloud panoptic segmentation is a 3D scene perception task that provides a holistic solution for both semantic and instance segmentation. The sparsity and lack of texture features in LiDAR point cloud, coupled with the relatively narrow field of view of camera, make multi-modal fusion challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion based point cloud panoptic segmentation method, named FP3Seg, with main contributions including Hybrid Domain Adaptive Fusion (HDAF) module and Progressive Decoder. HDAF employs learnable weights to adaptively fuse multi-modal features in both the channel and spatial domains. Through knowledge distillation, FP3Seg extends the benefits of multi-modal fusion beyond the camera field of view. Pro-gressive Decoder embeds semantic and instance information into the input of panoptic decoder, assisting the decoder in understanding the distinctions between stuff and thing classes. The proposed method is benchmarked on the SemanticKITTI test set, achieving 57.7% PQ, showing a 1.7% improvement over baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that FP3Seg possesses advantages over single-modal approaches in multiple aspects, especially for the segmentation of thing classes.},

Automating deformation detection through computer vision is crucial for efficient monitoring, but it faces significant challenges in creating a comprehensive dataset of both deformed and non-deformed objects, which can be difficult to obtain in many scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generating controlled synthetic data that simulates deformed objects. This approach allows for the realistic modeling of object deformations under various conditions. Our framework integrates an intelligent adapter network that facilitates sim-to-real domain adaptation, enhancing classification results requiring limited real data from deformed objects.

Unlike 2D models, 3D models can simultaneously utilize multiple slices as input to capture features. However, 3D models face challenges in capturing nodule features in different directions and discerning feature differences in various positions of computed tomography (CT). We introduce a pulmonary nodule classification model, SMDNet. Firstly, a multi-direction attention is proposed to capture nodule features from sagittal, coronal, and axial axes. Secondly, distinct labels are assigned to the cubes at different cropping positions from CT for binary classification to capture local differences. Besides, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is employed to combine shallow features with deep features to improve accuracy. Comparative experimental results on the largest publicly available dataset of pulmonary nodules, LIDC-IDRI, showed that SMDNet achieves a 4.81% improvement in accuracy under identical data processing.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown ex-ceptional performance in various domains, leading to their widespread adoption. However, the necessity to deploy DNNs on resource-constrained devices calls for improved model efficiency. Accordingly, DNN pruning has emerged as a critical technique in the field of machine learning, offering significant improve-ments in computational efficiency and model simplicity. This paper introduces an innovative post-training pruning approach for DNNs without any retraining, that utilizes multi-objective optimization to achieve substantial sparsity rates while preserving significant accuracy levels. The proposed method transforms the post-training weight pruning challenge into a two-variable, bi-objective optimization problem. The optimizer finds the optimal minimum and maximum threshold values through optimization, effectively converting the real-valued weights between these two thresholds to zero. The task and model-independency of the proposed framework make it applicable across various models, tasks, and datasets without constraints on the number of weights. The approach provides a decision-maker, where users can select the best strategy within resource constraints to achieve their desired accuracy. In order to assess our method, we evaluated the pruning of RESNET50 model on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmark datasets. In CIFAR10, by reducing 70% of the weights within the optimal threshold values, the network&#39;s accuracy only decreases by 0.1. Similarly, in CIFAR100, an appropriate weight range was selected, resulting in a 65 % reduction in weights while maintaining a negligible 0.1 decrease in network accuracy. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimization in achieving significant model size reduction without compromising performance on large DNNs.},

Small-scale Large Language Models (SLLMs), which are smaller, compact LLMs with fewer than 10 billion parameters, could significantly reduce production costs compared to LLMs. However, they typically perform less effectively than LLMs in general. Although In-context learning prompting has successfully enhanced the capabilities of SLLMs, the construction of prompts requires a certain level of human expertise. In this study, we explore enhancing SLLMs in emulating the performance of LLMs in reasoning tasks at a minimal cost, without any prompts provided by humans. We employ two SLLMs and incorporate a ranking model based on a Semantic Verifier between them to facilitate reasoning tasks. Experiments conducted on four publicly available datasets for reasoning tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the inference performance of SLLMs, and it achieves new state-of-the-art results.},

In recent years, multiple variations of SMOTE, including the clustering &amp; SMOTE based oversampling methods are proposed. Nevertheless, these methods often neglect the calculation of importance measurement for minority class samples while generating noise, boundary, or overlapping samples in some cases. To solve such problems, we propose a novel importance measurement based on sampling region information (SRI) in minority class samples by using clustering. The measurement focuses more on important samples. Based on the measurement, we also propose an oversampling method called KRISMOTE. The method not only reduces noise, but also clarifies the classification boundaries, effectively enhancing the classification performance of imbalanced data. Experimental results over the publicly available KEEL dataset demonstrate that the proposed KRISMOTE method outperforms other popular oversampling algorithms.},

In practical scenarios, multiple types of interactive behaviors usually constitute users&#39; complex interests and preferences. However, existing CTR prediction models based on multi-type interactive behavior modeling have two limitations: (1) they cannot handle noise in users&#39; global interests, resulting in the inability to model accurate global interest preferences; (2) they struggle to depict users&#39; local interest patterns and cannot model the complex patterns embedded in multi-behavior sequences. To overcome these limitations, an Adaptive Local and Global Interests Network For Click-Through Rate Prediction (ALGIN) is proposed, which effectively models global and local interests within multi-behavior interaction sequences through a unified framework. Firstly, ALGIN employs a Fourier Global Interest Modeling module to eliminate noise in the behavioral sequence; secondly, ALGIN designs a Multi-Scale Local Interest Extraction module to capture behavioral patterns within multi-type interactive sequences; finally, an Item-driven Interest Selector is used to integrate users&#39; local interests with their global interests. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the ALGIN model outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA), and ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each module within the model.},

Connectivity robustness and controllability robustness are two important measures. They refer to a network&#39;s ability to maintain connectivity and controllability during malicious attacks or random failures. Traditional methods for assessing network robustness, which typically involve time-consuming attack simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy and computational inefficiency. Thus, this paper proposes a simple yet effective method, NRPP, for predicting network robustness using a learning graph representation. This method transforms local nodal information into a graph representation and extracts multi-scale features. Extensive experiments on undirected synthetic networks show: 1) NRPP effectively combines node sorting (NR) with pyramid pooling (PP) to obtain graph-level vector representations, improving network robustness predictions. Ablation experiments validate the necessity of node sorting and pyramid pooling. 2) Experimental results demonstrate that NRPP outperforms three state-of-the-art CNN-based models in predicting network robustness.},

At the same time, for the small object detection problem, most of the detection algorithms use the detection speed as a cost to improve the detection accuracy, and cannot do a good job of balancing between the two. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an improved YOLO detection algorithm, which aims to improve the detection accuracy of small targets in complex environments while minimising the cost of detection speed. Firstly, two attention mechanisms for small target detection are added to the backbone of YOLOv8; secondly, the target detection header with unified attention is used in the head part, which improves the expressive power of the detection header without any computational expense; and finally, the Inner-MPDIoU function, which is a combination of MPDIoU and Inner ideas, is used as the localisation loss in loss functions.Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets show that the results of the network in this paper are improved in terms of both speed and accuracy compared to the original YOLOv8, enabling a better balance between detection accuracy and speed.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection is a pivotal component of machine learning and data analysis, to optimize model performance by eliminating irrelevant and redundant features, to address the challenges associated with the “curse of dimensionality” and interpretability. In this context, we present feature selection as a multi-objective binary optimization task with the dual aim of maximizing classification accuracy while minimizing the number of selected features. In order to address this optimization challenge, we introduce the Multi-objective Binary Differential Evolution algorithm (MOBDE). It&#39;s worth noting that DE originally is an extremely powerful real-value coded algorithm, and to make it binary, set-based operators must replace vector-based operations. Optimization in binary space is deemed more suitable than real-value optimization because a many-to-one mapping can waste the efforts of the optimizer when solving a binary problem like feature selection. The algorithm leverages a partial opposition-based binary operator to generate diverse solutions to enhance its exploration within the search space. Additionally, it incorporates a majority voting mechanism as a local search strategy to bolster the algorithm&#39;s exploitation capabilities. Results from experimentation on eleven datasets underscore the efficiency of MOBDE, outperforming the widely recognized NSGA-II method in terms of the hypervolume (HV) performance metric and minimizing the number of selected features. The proposed algorithm and its experimental outcomes are comprehensively detailed and analyzed, offering valuable insights into its efficacy for feature selection tasks.},

To accurately detect the wearing status of kitchen staff, the ARP-YOLO model is proposed. Firstly, images are obtained from multiple kitchens and angles to construct a dataset reflecting the wearing status of hats and masks. To simulate more complex kitchen environments, Gaussian noise is added to the data and lighting conditions are adjusted for data augmentation. Lighting conditions in the kitchen can affect detection, causing the same target to exhibit different shapes and features under different lighting conditions, leading to missed detections. To address the above issues, we propose ARCA (Adaptive-Residual-Coordinate-Attention), which uses residual connections to strengthen attention to important features while preserving original features, and employs adaptive convolution reduction to reduce module parameters. To improve target localization accuracy, P2 detection layers are added in the Neck to obtain more accurate target position information. The ARP-YOLO model demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline model, with a 13.6% increase in Recall, allowing for more effective target capture and reduced missed detection risk. Additionally, mAP@0.5 has increased by 10%, enhancing target localization accuracy. The F1-Score has also increased by 7.4%, better balancing the relationship between Precision and Recall. To validate the effectiveness of the model, comparative experiments with other models are conducted, showing that ARP-YOLO model&#39;s Recall and Average Precision(AP) are higher than those of other models.},

However, in the task of object detection, both feature-based and regression-based traditional knowledge distillation methods impose overly strict constraints on the student model. To address the above issues, this article proposes Global Fusion and Feature Restoration Knowledge Distillation(FRD). FRD integrates contextual information into the channel through a Global Fusion Module (GFM), and further utilizes attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on the distillation region after separating the foreground background. FRD also uses a Mask Feature Restoration (MFR) to mask and restore a portion of student features, improving the learnability of the model. At the same time, FRD adopts a comprehensive approach of multiple loss superposition constraints, rather than simply using MSE losses to imitate the features of teachers. Experiments have shown that FRD can effectively improve model performance in industrial defect detection tasks. On the aluminum surface defect dataset, FRD increased the mAP index of RetinaNet-Res50 from 57.7% to 61.7%. We also confirmed the effectiveness of FRD for general object detection on the Coco dataset. On a randomly selected COCO dataset containing 4000 images, FRD increased the mAP metric of RetinaNet-Res50 from 21.5% to 43.6%.},

  abstract  = {Tables, as an important means of data storage, are widely used in spreadsheets, web tables, and PDFs. By integrating information from table data with knowledge re-trieved from an external knowledge base, and examining the correspondences between cell values in the table and instances in the knowledge base, we can extract knowledge from the table to augment and enrich the knowledge base. To achieve this goal, we first need to classify table cells based on their functions in the layout. Due to the diverse structures arising from the arrangements of rows and columns, as well as the complexity of content resulting from concise data storage, current automation techniques heavily rely on stylistic features of table cells, such as font or color. Moreover, these methods are rarely experimented with or validated on tables without style features. Recent literature indicates that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an ability to understand the structure and content of tables in tasks such as table judgment reasoning. Even without extensive feature inputs or pre-training, LLMs still show comparable results to machine learning and deep learning in these tasks. Therefore, this paper attempts to apply LLMs to table cell classification without using other stylistic features. We have designed a 4-component prompt paradigm (Classification Definition, Instruction, Table, Com-pletion), representing respectively the classification definition, task instructions, table data, and result output. We conduct experiments on three datasets CIUS, SAUS, and DEEX for table cell classification with one-shot learning. Our experimental results show that with the assistance of LLMs, better results can be achieved without utilizing stylistic features.},

  abstract  = {Accurately simulating physical processes is an extremely challenging task, but the rapid development of machine learning and the availability of large datasets have made Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) a powerful tool for effectively simulating physical systems. Currently, GNNs-based methods are primarily used in simple scenarios such as the free fall and collision of objects, fluid flow, and gravitational interactions among atoms. However, in complex industrial environments, there are always intricate interference factors such as friction, bearing connections, and torque affecting the motion between objects. Consequently, GNNs-based methods largely fail to solve practical physical problems related to complex multi-body dynamics. In this paper, to address the current lack of multi-body dynamics datasets in this field, we first introduce a multi-body dynamics dataset comprising eight different scenarios, each embodying distinct physical principles. Furthermore, we explore Graph Neural Simulators (GNSs) structure and physical priors and propose an efficient novel model, the Graph Neural Network with Restrgints (GOAT), that can directly learn the relationships between systems from multi-body trajectories, thereby enhancing performance. Our results have shown significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities and data efficiency.},

  abstract  = {The seedling stage is important in the growth and development of maize, and it is also a critical period that affects maize yield and quality. Accurately recognizing this stage of maize is challenging, as current maize seedling detection methods struggle with small sizes and complex environments. This paper proposes a rapid maize seedling detection method that emphasizes spatial feature extraction in the receptive field and cross-dimensional interaction—receptive field triplet attention YOLO (RFT-YOLO). First, we design a convolutional module for cross-dimensional information interaction within the receptive field. Second, we introduce an advanced selective fusion network, which boosts the multi-scale fusion capability of small object features while reducing the GFLOPs of the model. Additionally, we employ Inner-IoU to diminish sensitivity to positional biases of small objects and expedite the convergence of the loss function. Finally, we create a dataset of maize seedlings to conduct our experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the RFT-YOLO significantly enhances performance, reducing the number of parameters by 35.3% and GFLOPs by 14.24%, compared to the baseline model. Moreover, the mean average precision (mAP) improves from 89.6% to 91.5%. These improvements confirm the model&#39;s effectiveness in detecting maize seedlings.},

Based on the assumption that the partial point clouds to be registered belong to the same target, the proposed Mutual a Priori based Completion (MPC) method uses the partial point clouds to be registered as the a priori for each other to expend each individual point clouds. The main challenge of this mutual reference approach is that the partial clouds without spatial alignment cannot provide reliable completion reference for each. Based on the mutual information maximization, a progressive completion structure is developed to make the alignment in the spatial, feature and completion space respectively. Experiments on public datasets show encouraging results. Especially for the ultra-low overlap cases, compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, the size of overlapping regions can be increased by about 14.0%, and the rotation and translation error can be reduced by 30.8% and 57.7% respectively.},

  abstract  = {Due to the exceptional performance of Transform-ers in 2$D$ medical image segmentation, recent work has also introduced them into 3D medical segmentation tasks. For instance, Swin UNETR and other hierarchical Transformers have reintroduced prior knowledge from several convolutional networks, further enhancing the volume segmentation capabilities of models. The efficacy of these hybrid methodologies is primarily attributed to the substantial quantity of parameters and the nonlocal self-attention mechanism with a large receptive field. We argue that the behavior of these methods&#39; large receptive fields can be simulated by employing fewer parameters through the utilization of depth-wise convolutions with large kernel. Within this manuscript, we introduce a lightweight volume segmentation model called MedX-Net, which uses convolutional network modules to simulate hierarchical Transformers for robust volume segmentation. Firstly, inspired by the hierarchical Transformer module of Swin UNETR, we investigate large-kernel depth-wise convolutions with different sizes to achieve a reduced model parameter count while maintaining a large global receptive field. Secondly, we replace the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the hierarchical Transformer module with Inverted Bottleneck with Depthwise Convolution Enhancement(DWCE) to improve model performance with fewer activation and normalization layers, further reducing the parameter count. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model for volume segmentation on three public datasets: Synapse, BTCV and ACDC. On the Synapse dataset, compared to Swin UNETR, our model achieves an improvement from 83.48% to 87.21% in Dice score. Compared to the result of 86.57% achieved by nnFormer, our model achieves superior performance while reducing the model parameter count by 64%.},

By collecting Wi-Fi signals form reference points and utilizing a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (lDCNN) model for distance classification, we can reduce outliers. In addition, as the number of classification categories increases moderately, the distance estimation error can be effectively reduced. Experimental results show the when the distance classification categories are set to 3, 6 and 12 respectively, the average distance estimation errors are 0.379 meters, 0.113 meters and 0.058 meters.},

Therefore, this study proposes a collaborative scheduling optimization method for multi-level hybrid flow shop of automobile engine. Initially, the collaborative production relationships between the workshops are examined. Subsequently, an optimization model of collaborative scheduling for the multi-stage hybrid flow shop is formulated, focusing on reducing collaborative production costs and minimizing the maximum completion time. Furthermore, considering the discrete nature of the scheduling problem, the study explores encoding/decoding strategies based on random key techniques to bridge the gap between continuous algorithms and discrete problems. Consequently, a distributed reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm (DRVEA) is introduced to solve the model. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated through a case study using practical data from an automobile engine enterprise.},

Consequently, safeguarding documents against potential attackers becomes increasingly crucial. Several attacks have been reported over the past years and the risk of document leak is more present nowadays. To prevent data violation, we need tools to determine the sensitivity degree of documents which allows us to guarantee that only authorized people have access to them and to adapt strategies to sensitivity levels. To achieve this, deep learning techniques have shown good performances in document classification and therefore in sensitivity identification. Such approaches require sufficiently large resources to learn robust models. However, due to the sensitive nature of documents, public datasets are missing to conduct research in this context. In this paper, we experiment with Large Language Models (LLM) to generate a multi-domain dataset of business documents in both english and french languages. Utilizing a two-step generation process, we employ several prompting strategies across six language models to create a first dataset of documents classified into 4 sensitivity classes: Public, Internal, Confidential and Restricted. We then relied on human experts to review validate the annotations generated in a sample of documents. The generated dataset has been tested over two robust baselines.},

  abstract  = {Urban autonomous driving has the potential to enhance both safety and efficiency of transportation in environments also in complex traffic conditions. However, new services and approaches are necessary to manage Autonomous Vehicles in the real traffic. This paper introduces a novel approach to optimize routing in the urban settings by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. A modular DRL architecture is proposed to obtain a route able to minimize the length of the paths, minimize the number of turns during the travel and select the dedicated lanes. The proposed DRL is implemented on a case study where the agents are trained in a simulation environment for the city center of Bari, a town of Southern Italy.},

  abstract  = {Networked devices, especially those comprising multiple identical devices, are extensively utilized in industrial scenarios. However, their complexity poses unique challenges in diagnostic processes, demanding efficient methodologies to identify and assess risks. The application of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) for analyzing complex systems, especially those consisting of networked devices, appears to be limited, particularly in identifying critical risk factors. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to diagnose networked systems by fusing FMEA with a Delphi (expert) Study. Our approach leverages the collective knowledge of a group of experts through a structured Delphi Study enabling them to contribute individually but also to interact. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through a case study involving a system of networked mobile robots. Based on a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) of minimal fault tree cut sets are calculated to identify the most critical mechatronic failures. Our findings show that our methodology provides an RPN ranking that closely aligns with expert insights, highlighting its efficacy in accurately assessing risk in complex networked systems.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCls) based on motor imagery (imagined movements, 1M) are among the most common BCls for the rehabilitation of paralyzed patients. However, it is possible that attempted movements (AM) would be more an effective alternative for 1M. Unlike 1M, AM are difficult to study outside of clinical practice. Nikulin et al. (2008) suggest that quasi-movements (QM) could help model AM in healthy participants without immobilizing interventions. QM result from the amplitude reduction of an overt movement, which leads to the practical absence of electromyography (EMG) response. The performance of QM may have features that may distance QM from AM. Here, we examined the compatibility of QM with a saccade task, which modelled visual interaction with the outside world during the practical use of a BCI. In a study involving 24 volunteers, we used electroencephalography (EEG), EMG, and conducted an extensive survey of the participants. We expected that, compared to 1M, QM in the dual-task condition would be easier and less tiring and would be accompanied by greater event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor rhythms. Our hypotheses were based on the assumption that like AM and unlike 1M, QM is a more external task, and so is more compatible with the saccade task. We reproduced the effect of greater ERD for QM in the dual-task condition but did not find any significant difference between the difficulty or tediousness of QM and 1M. Nevertheless, the survey data gave us important insights into the challenges participants faced when performing QM. Despite EMG values similar to 1M, the feeling of muscle tension experienced by the participants correlated with mean EMG values. The main challenge in performing QM by the participants was to make movements without an amplitude. Performing QM conflicted with the illusion of movement that was supposed to accompany them: without proprioceptive feedback, participants doubt the reality of QM. Our results can be used to improve the procedure of QM training, which should bring them closer to genuine attempts of movements in the eyes of participants.},

The study utilized an open-access dataset presented on four Spanish words from ten participants. The proposed system involved preprocessing to clean and enhance the signal. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) was utilized to extract features to improve the discrimination between the selected four words. A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) deep learning model was used to enhance the inner speech recognition performance from spatial features. The result shows that the model can decode the inner speech with an average accuracy of 81.40% for the un-seeing dataset and 89.80% for the entire dataset, indicating that the proposed method outperforms previous works that used the same dataset.},

In music, this could mean amplifying the sound of the instrument the listener wants to hear. One of the first steps in this research is to determine if a machine learning algorithm can identify to which instrument an individual is listening based only on a brief EEG signal. To test this possibility, participants were presented with a series of brief tones that varied in timbre (Trombone, Clarinet’ Cello, Piano and Pure Tone) while their ongoing EEG was recorded from 73 electrodes. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used. We investigated four different sets of features - Raw EEG, ERP-based features, Harmonics-based features and Regularity-based features. The Raw EEG based classifier performed significantly above chance (37%) when attempting to distinguish between responses to different musical instruments for 5-way classification. More advanced classification algorithms or different features may be able to better distinguish between tones with a musical timbre.},

We propose the novel method that utilizes the weights of the pre-trained model to generate the personalized weights, effectively combining the general MI features with the personalized features.

Therefore, in this paper, we studied how secure and efficient the Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA3) generated subkeys will be for the encryption of IoT data by just replacing the AES subkeys with it. For this purpose we used the statistical test suite provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and found that SHA-3 generated subkeys are highly random, and also it is significantly efficient for encrypting the IoT Data. However, as symmetric keys are repeatedly used, therefore, only upto 2 MB data, the encryption is significantly (∼ 1300 times) efficient. From the experimental analysis, we find that SEASHA3 generates subkeys that are random, non-linear, and irreversible, making it more secure and efficient than traditional AES subkey generation.},

In a nutshell, KI-Mix incorporates security domain knowledge into data interpolation to capture more labeled data to facilitate semi-supervised detection on cyber anomalies. We compare the performance of KI-Mix with several commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and CutMix to evaluate its effectiveness in limited annotated data settings. Through extensive experiments on five security datasets covering various aspects of network threats, we demonstrate that KI-Mix outperforms other methods with equivalent baseline models. Notably, KI-Mix is model-agnostic to enable any data-driven threats detection models to handle incomplete supervision problems in real-world cyber threat detection.},

ViTs are being used widely in many safety-critical applications ranging from health care to automotive. However, these widespread deployments also bring the risk of adversarial attacks on ViTs to the forefront. Thus, understanding the vulnerability of vision transforms against possible adversarial attacks is necessary before deployment in real-time scenarios. Adversarial patch attacks represent a practical threat to the viability of ViT-based real-world applications. This study delves into the vulnerability of vision transformers to such attacks, exploring both single and multi-patch adversarial attacks to gauge the robustness of vision transformers across benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet-1k. Experimentally, our findings reveal that poly-multi patch attacks constitute formidable adversarial threats, with vision transformers exhibiting greater vulnerability to poly-multi attacks than single, mono, and split-multi attacks. Additionally, we qualitatively elucidate the impact of patch location on the efficacy of adversarial attacks, providing insights into the factors influencing their effectiveness. Through this study, we aim to enhance our understanding of vision transformers&#39; susceptibility to adversarial patch attacks, contributing to developing strategies for strengthening their security and resilience in real-world applications.},

However, attackers can still infer private data information from the uploaded parameters. To solve this issue, differential privacy technology is introduced. The key to differential privacy lies in gradient clipping and noise addition. However, the traditional gradient clipping method often faces the gradient distortion issue and will be ineffective if the noise is large enough. Regarding noise addition, commonly used fixed or fixed decay rate noise scale settings often overlook the characteristics of gradients during training, which might lead to adding improper noise to gradients. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive optimization method for differentially private federated learning (AODPFL). Specifically, we adopt a strategy of clipping the gradient by grouping, effectively reducing gradient distortion. We design an adaptive clipping threshold based on the gradient changes during training to improve model accuracy under large noise conditions. We design a noise scale decay method with a dynamic decay rate to allocate the privacy budget more reasonably and inject appropriate noise into gradients. Experimental results show that compared to other gradient clipping and noise addition methods, our method achieves higher accuracy under the same privacy budget.},

In this study, an improved detection algorithm based on a generative adversarial network is proposed against LR-DDoS. To learn the temporal characteristics, LR-DDoS time-series features are taken as a part of the generator&#39;s input and Long Short-Term Memory modules are incorporated. Two discriminators with adaptive weighting are employed, one for conventional LR-DDoS attacks and the other for the adversarial attacks, to generate plausible LR-DDoS samples. The generated packets are used to train the detection algorithm of an Intrusion Detection System. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 94% in detecting adversarial LR-DDoS packets, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by at least 10%.},

  abstract  = {Obstacle avoidance is a crucial task in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) motion planning. The accuracy and consistency of real-time visual information affect the gener-ation of obstacle avoidance commands, raising higher safety demands for obstacle avoidance. The neuromorphic computing-based obstacle avoidance solution can address these challenges. Dynamic vision sensors (DVS) exhibit low latency, low power consumption, and high dynamic range as novel neuromorphic sensors. Spiking neural networks (SNN) also leverage the same mechanism to efficiently process asynchronous and sparse event data generated by DVS, offering latency and energy efficiency advantages. Additionally, the optimal estimation method effectively mitigates the impact of noise and interference within the system, reducing the influence of errors on the algorithm and enhancing safety. Based on these considerations, this paper proposes a fast and safe obstacle avoidance framework. DVS is used to acquire event data from the environment, and a hardware-compatible lightweight SNN is employed to extract dynamic obstacle position information from the data. Compared to baseline methods, this approach reduces latency by 85%. Furthermore, two estimation methods are used to predict the movement of obstacles, ensuring flight safety by generating different UAV obstacle avoidance actions based on confidence intervals, even in the presence of obstacle information errors and omissions.},

  abstract  = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) as a cutting-edge domain blending computer vision and natural language processing has garnered significant research momentum. Nev-ertheless, latest VQA frameworks which leverage CNN and RNN technologies to extract features and delve into the multimodal interplay between text and images, encounter difficulties in integrating local features with global dependencies. This integration challenge hinders the models&#39; ability to precisely grasp the pivotal aspects of the answer. Furthermore, the dearth of training data poses a significant impediment to models&#39; effective learning of multimodal information exchange and problem semantics. To address these issues, our model introduces a new method called CMACC (Cross-Modal Adversarial Contrastive Learning Based on Co-Attention). Through cross-modal adversarial contrastive learning, combined with common attention, image and text information are integrated. Adversar-ial learning aligns the latent feature distribution between text and images, and contrastive learning aligns multimodal sample features in the same context to enhance the adaptability of the model. In addition, advanced data augmentation techniques are integrated to further enhance the model&#39;s adaptability to different scenarios and problem types. We conducted experimental evaluations on three widely used VQA datasets (VQA v1.0, VQA v2.0, and COCO-QA) and the results showed that CMACC has significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance compared to traditional methods.},

Most researches on multi-modal physiological signal fusion are based on heterogeneous graph fusion networks (HGFNs) while they ignore the high-order correlations between multi-modal physiological signals. Moreover, most HGFNs suffer from the over-smoothing problem, causing failures in deeper networks. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deep hypergraph convolutional network called DHFusion for multi-modal physiological signal fusion. Specially, DHFusion designs deep hypergraph convolution (DHGCN) layer to effectively integrate multiple physiological signals and obtain multi-modal features. DHFusion then introduces JK readout layer to enable multi-layer DHGCN to capture deep multi-modal features based on high-order correlations. DHFusion effectively solves the over-smoothing of HGFNs and performs well in representing deep multi-modal features. Experimental results over the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Various defects arise during textile production, making fabric defect inspection essential for production and quality management in the textile industry. However, fabric defect detection techniques face challenges due to defects with disparate aspect ratios, high foreground-background similarity, and tiny sizes. Based on these issues, we propose a fabric defect detection method that combines an improved Cascade R-CNN (SPCNet) network and Super-Resolution reconstruction technology. Firstly, defective images are reconstructed using a hybrid attention Transformer (HAT), enhancing texture details and edge information. We design a new multi-stage defect detection model SPCNet to identify fabric defects. The architecture includes a feature extraction module based on Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC). SAC can obtain a larger receptive field for better detection of tiny defects. Path Aggregation Network (PANet) is introduced to improve the recognition of scale-unbalanced defects. In addition, Cascade RPN (C-RPN) is adopted to fully use deep and shallow features. To solve the issue of imbalanced defect classes, we adopt Class-aware Sampling (CAS) strategy. Soft-Nmsis used to reduce the false deletion of defective feature detection boxes. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the defect detection method combining HAT and SPCNet can significantly raise the overall recognition rate of multiclass fabric defects, exceeding the performance of other current methods.},

Current approaches to tackle ellipsis primarily involve fine-tuning pretrained language models like BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This approach encompasses two subtasks: 1) detecting ellipsis positions, i.e., identifying locations where ellipsis occurs within a sentence, and 2) completing the elliptical content by predicting the missing information based on the detected positions. This paper proposes a novel model that combines fine-tuned BERT with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), incorporating a sampler between the generator and discriminator. The proposed method simultaneously utilizes the generator, discriminator, and sampler to locate and complete ellipsis. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an F1 score improvement of 0.03 in ellipsis position detection and an EM (Exact Match) improvement of 0.1 in ellipsis content completion compared to the baseline method.},

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a genetic programming method for data-efficient image recognition, leveraging novel function sets, terminal sets, and program structures. This method transforms tree-based data structures in GP into trainable CNN architectures. Further, by employing block structures instead of single operations in the search space, the search space is reduced and the stability of the search structures enhanced. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art neural network methods and GP-based methods on data-efficient classification datasets validate the GP-CNN method offering higher performance.},

This paper addresses the battery swapping station (BSS) recommendation problem by proposing a novel conflict-free genetic algorithm (CFGA) integrated with a Nash equilibrium seeking (NES) approach to identify optimal Nash equilibrium (ONE) solutions to such a non-cooperative optimization problem. The CFGA employs specialized crossover and mutation operators to generate offspring that satisfy the constraints of the problem, ensuring that each EV decides a unique battery swap strategy without conflict. Firstly, an order crossover operator is proposed to preserve the order of genes in the chromosomes. Secondly, a replacement and exchange mutation operator is proposed to enhance mutation diversity. The resulting optimal solution is then used as the initial strategy for the NES, which iteratively converges to the ONE. The proposed CFGA with NES algorithm is evaluated under both small-scale and large-scale cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving a balance between costs for EVs and utilization for BSSs. The study&#39;s findings have practical implications for the smart grid and EV integration, offering a robust method for optimizing EV infrastructure and operations.},

Drawing inspiration from the evolved neural systems (e.g., visual cortex), deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in visual tasks, among others. While the success of training deep neural networks has been relying on back-propagation (BP) and its variants to learn representations from data, BP does not incorporate the evolutionary processes that govern biological neural systems. This work proposes a neural network optimization framework based on evolutionary theory. Specifically, BP-trained deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks obtained from the ending epochs are considered the primordial ancestors (initial population). Subsequently, the population evolved with differential evolution. Extensive experiments are carried out to examine the relationships between Darwinian evolution and neural network optimization, including the correspondence between datasets, environment, models, and living species. The empirical results show that the proposed framework has positive impacts on the network, with reduced over-fitting and an order of magnitude lower time complexity compared to BP. Moreover, the experiments show that the proposed framework performs well on deep neural networks and big datasets.},

To address this problem, a self-supervised generative pre-trained model with a learnable mask network (SSGPM-LMN) is proposed in this paper. First, the multivariate time series are made into patches channel-independently. Then, these patches are fed into a Transformer encoder with the learnable mask-reconstruction paradigm, drawing mask indices with high temporal features by calculating the cosine similarity in low-dimensional feature space to better learn general representations. Furthermore, a two-step fine-tuning strategy, including linear probing and full fine-tuning, is adopted for various downstream scenarios.

  abstract  = {Image anomaly detection usually relies on a large set of training samples and abnormal samples are relatively rare and challenging to obtain in daily industrial scenarios. In the scenario of Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD), how to better utilize the fine-grained features of the few images is a key issue. To solve these problems, a Finer-Grained Siamese Network (FGSNet) is proposed in this paper. FGSNet considers the setting of Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) and consists of two stages. The first stage is responsible for extracting finer-grained features and roughly aligning the image features, while incorporating an efficient Fine-grained Feature Fusion Module $(\mathbf{F}^{3}\mathbf{M})$ to enhance feature representation. Meanwhile, we design a Deep-supervised Loss to improve the level of fine-grained information extraction. The second is primarily used to refine and denoise the fused features, followed by detailed alignment operations for subsequent feature distribution modeling. Compared to most existing FASD models that use single-class training and single-model evaluation, FGSNet is more suitable for existing industrial scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available MVTec AD and MPDD datasets in this paper. The results show that, for 2, 4 and 8-shot cases, FGSNet can increase the average Image-AUROC on MVTec AD by 0.87%, 1.27% and 1.33% respectively, compared to RegAD.},

Anomaly detection methods based on knowledge distillation demonstrate promising performance in addressing the unpredictability and diversity of anomalies. However, they suffer from a lack of effective guidance from anomaly-free priors when handling anomalous features and underutilize multi-scale features during the segmentation scoring stage, yielding suboptimal detection results. To alleviate these issues, we propose an Anomaly-free Prior Guided knowledge distillation (APG) for industrial anomaly detection. Firstly, it filters the abnormal features by training the de-noising target network with knowledge distillation structure. Concurrently, we propose the Prior Perception Propagation Module (P3M), which extracts more efficient anomaly-free features by imposing constraints on anomalous features. Secondly, we propose the Multi-scale Prior Guided Fusion Module (MPGFM) to improve anomaly detection accuracy by utilizing anomaly-free features from the target network as priors to guide the generation and fusion of cross-scale differential features. Finally, the Global Perception Enhancement Module (GPEM) is proposed to construct an anomaly scoring network, leveraging comprehensive scene features to enhance the detection and localization performance of numerous small-target anomalies in industrial manufacturing. Extensive experiments on the MVTecAD and BTAD datasets show that the proposed method demonstrates a consistent and significant outperformance against competing methods.},

Then two new constraint formulas were proposed to extend the GMRA model to reduce the loss of personnel allocation and the necessary and sufficient conditions of the extended method were proved. Subsequently, two large-scale simulation experiments were carried out to compare and demonstrate the differences between the expanded new method and the original model, and to explore the sufficient and necessary conditions to increase the speed of finding feasible solutions for the new method.

  abstract  = {If drivers can be correctly recognized from their physiological signals, personalized services such as dynamical adjustments to the seat, backrest, and headrest can be provided during driving to ensure comfort and safety. However, such services require high accuracy identification of drivers, i.e., identification accuracy more than 99%. To determine whether such high accuracy can be achieved using drivers&#39; physiological signals, we propose identifying only a limited group of drivers for a particular vehicle. Specifically, we built two deep learning models from three common physiological signals. To achieve high accuracy identification of drivers, we adjusted the size of the drivers to be identified (driver pool) to achieve a high identification accuracy of drivers. Our results show that when the maximum driver pool sizes are 5 and 2, the identification accuracies reached 95% and 99%, respectively.},

Task utilities evolve dynamically, and learning, conducted in rounds, optimizes agents&#39; task selection order to enhance system performance. Our proposed DC-MATA solution approach assigns agents to tasks with highest utility over time and tends towards the Nash equilibrium that aligns with agents&#39; self-interest while improving the gap with system optimum. We propose priority-sensitive reward function and four action sampling algorithms (ε-greedy, ε-decay, Adapted Simulated Annealing, and Prior Sequence-Aware Sampling - PSAS) leveraging a Markov decision process (MDP) framework.

The switching formations consist of a pair of operations: one is the switching directed graphs and the other is the corresponding formation configurations. In real cooperative transportation scenarios, varying interaction re-lationships necessitate distinct system configurations. But it is challenging for researchers to design control law with the evolutions of not only the communication topology but also the system configuration. Drawing inspiration from advancements on switching topologies, we utilize the characteristics of the stress matrix to build up a new LMI inequality to design a novel class of distributed affine-based controller. The global convergence will be achieved as long as the feedback gain matrix and the switching signal satisfy three specific conditions. And we give the corresponding algorithm to calculate the required control parameters. A Lyapunov function is constructed to demonstrate the system&#39;s stability and simulation example is provided in detail at the end of this paper to validate our method&#39;s efficacy.},

When the number of UAVs is large or the mission is complex, problems such as poor scalability and slow convergence will be faced. This paper proposes a multi-UAV distributed hierarchical collaborative path planning method based on an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. In order to speed up the convergence and ensure the global optimality of the results, a coefficient nonlinear time-varying parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm (NTVPPSO) is designed in this method. This algorithm splits the population into multiple sub-populations. Each particle in the sub-population is updated in parallel using non-linear time-varying coefficients, and information is exchanged between the sub-populations. In order to enhance scalability, a distributed framework with a two-layer structure is designed. First, each UAV plans its own path to determine the collaborative goal. Then the collaborative path planning of multiple UAVs is completed sequentially based on heuristic priorities. The simulation results show that the proposed method can converge quickly and the collaborative path tends to be optimal, and is a feasible distributed solution to the MUCPP problem.},

  abstract  = {The Global Navigation Satellite System Network Reference Stations (GNSS-NRS) are pivotal in modern po-sitioning and navigation applications. However, GNSS-NRS face significant communication challenges, including instability during rapid user movement and inconsistent coverage by different operators, which often results in data transmission interruptions and delays. Moreover, the conventional Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) scheduling strategy does not accommodate the diversity of the data types managed by GNSS-NRS. This default approach treats all data uniformly, even under deteriorating network conditions. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a ‘Multiple Reception’ strategy based on MPTCP that ensures timely and reliable GNSS data transmission. This novel strategy differentiates between observational and control data based on their real-time criticality and applies tailored transmission techniques. Under adverse conditions, it utilizes multiple transmission paths and selectively receives control data, thus prioritizing the transfer of critical information. We conducted simulation experiments using MiniNet to compare the ‘Multiple Reception’ method against conventional and redundant strategies, demonstrating that it significantly reduces data loss rates in GNSS-NRS.},

This work studies a slope bottleneck on highway in mixed traffic scenarios and proposes a traffic flow model for slope bottlenecks incorporating CAV platooning based on cellular automata. A novel traffic flow control strategy for slope bottlenecks is proposed based on variable speed limit (VSL) and vehicle platooning. Firstly, it divides the upstream section of the slope bottleneck into two zones for implementing VSL and vehicle platooning, respectively. Via speed restrictions within the VSL zone, the inflow of vehicles into the vehicle platooning zone is effectively mitigated to create low traffic density. In the vehicle platooning zone, a hybrid vehicle platooning method for mixed scenarios is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that our strategy effectively enhances traffic flow of the slope bottleneck, thereby mitigating traffic congestion.},

  abstract  = {In Linux kernel version 6.6, the Earliest Eligible Virtual Deadline First (EEVDF) scheduler was introduced as the new default scheduler. However, due to its high computational complexity, it may not be suitable for all application scenarios. In cases where there are a large number of short-term tasks or frequent task communication, EEVDF can incur excessive context switch overhead and performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight scheduling strategy named SRAND. Leveraging the programmable scheduling framework ‘sched_ext’ and employing BPF technology, we have implemented a strategy based on global and local run queues. This strategy utilizes a five-level BPF mapped queue to partition tasks with different virtual runtimes. Tasks with smaller virtual runtimes are placed into a FIFO-type global queue first, enabling priority scheduling for tasks with smaller virtual runtimes. Additionally, we monitor CPU idle states and allocate tasks in a timely manner, enhancing task responsiveness while reducing scheduling complexity. It is worth noting that our strategy integrates user-space scheduling policies into the kernel via an eBPF program loader, thus eliminating the need for kernel code modifications. By implementing the SRAND strategy, we have observed significant improvements compared to Linux&#39;s default scheduling strategy EEVDF. Specifically, our proposed strategy averages an 11.83% reduction in process context switch time and an overall performance improvement of 7.02% in stress tests, while maintaining satisfactory load balancing.},

We propose an innovative technique, designated as “Cold-Start Self-Training” that reduces reliance on large labeled datasets for STS tasks in resource-restricted settings. This method utilizes dual-view pooling to extract semantic similarity information from unlabeled data and generates pseudo-labeled data to fine-tune the cross-encoder model. Dual-view pooling combines different pooling results of the same text to evaluate semantic similarity without additional model tuning, simplifying the self-training process. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the cross-encoder model&#39;s performance on STS tasks in the medical domain. Our findings provide new strategies for cross-domain STS tasks, challenging the traditional reliance on extensive labeled data. We also validate the potential of unsupervised pretrained models for cross-domain tasks, offering theoretical and practical support for complex challenges.},

Additionally, the public&#39;s check-in behavior may exhibit common visiting patterns, and incorporating global check-in information is beneficial for enhancing the learning of individual user preferences. Therefore, we propose a GCN-based model with Fusion of Global and Local information (GFGL) for the next POI recommendation. The model obtains global information such as spatial distance, social relationships., and transition probabilities from all users&#39; visit trajectories, and utilizes graph convolution network (GCN) for learning of multi-dimensional global information. Next, we fuse global information with user local information through the user context information embedding module. Besides., a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and transformer model are used to learn the relationship between the user&#39;s sequential preference and non-adjacent visits in trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of GFGL against state-of-the-art methods in the next POI recommendation.},

  abstract  = {Personalized News Recommendation (PNR) can enhance user experience by alleviating information overload. Traditional news recommendation methods consider all clicking behaviors as user interests, resulting in biased user modeling that fails to accurately capture user interests. In addition, although there are methods to reduce the impact of low-quality news at the representation level by simply filtering it through the attention mechanism. However, this only implicitly models the news in the interaction sequence without specifically considering the quality of each news, and thus has very limited effect in identifying noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes News Recommendation method based on News Quality-aware modeling (NQNR). We attempt to explicitly model the news in the click sequence and candidate ranking one by one to visually assess the quality of each news. Specifically, we design a detection module to detect whether the input news is low-quality news. Then, by reducing the influence of low-quality news in user modeling and candidate ranking, user interests are modeled more accurately, while recommendations of such news are reduced for users. In addition, to capture the similarity of vectors more accurately, we also design a similarity computation method based on the multiple attention mechanism in the detection module. Experiments on a large real-world Microsoft News Dataset (MIND) show that our model significantly outperforms previous models.

  abstract  = {Federated Learning (FL) is an approach that allows nodes with limited resources to collaborate without the need to share their data. However, the computational performance of local devices, the the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) nature of data, and limited communication resources inevitably reduce the model&#39;s convergence speed and accuracy. It is urgent to obtain FL models with superior performance under Non-IID data. In this paper, we propose FedCGSU, a federated learning method for client grouping based on similar uncertainty in local client distributions. FedCGSU achieves grouping by leveraging the similarity in local distributions, which reduces the impact of weight divergence among clients with different distributions. It then combines loss values and local data volumes in the aggregation method, which reduces the impact of computationally weak devices on the global convergence speed. Experiments using three public datasets are conducted, demonstrating that the FedCGSU approach exhibits outstanding performance in improving accuracy and accelerating convergence speed.},

  abstract  = {Molecular conformation generation poses a significant challenge in the field of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the representatives. In this work, we first propose a method for measuring exposure bias in SGMs used for molecular conformation generation, which confirms the significant existence of exposure bias in these models and measures its value. We design a new compensation algorithm Input Perturbation (IP), which is adapted from a method originally designed for DPMs only. Experimental results show that by introducing IP, SGM-based molecular conformation models can significantly improve both the accuracy and diversity of the generated conformations. Especially by using the IP-enhanced Torsional Diffusion model, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the GEOM-Drugs dataset and are on par on GEOM-QM9. We provide the code publicly at https://github.com/jia-975/torsiona/Diff-ip.},

  abstract  = {Predicting clinical outcomes for patients in the intensive care units (ICUs) is crucial for physicians to assess clinical risk and provide timely and appropriate interventions. Current models often fail to predict multiple clinical outcomes simultaneously, and patient similarity has not been fully utilized to improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, electronic health record (EHR) data in the ICUs often contain observations recorded at irregular time intervals, which existing prediction methods do not effectively model. To address these challenges, we propose the ICU-TGNN model. This model combines time attention-based Transformer and graph neural network (GNN) architectures to leverage temporal and relational patient data. The Transformer component analyzes time series EHR data to capture dynamic patient states over time, while the GNN component exploits the relational structure among patients based on comorbidities to enhance model generalizability. We evaluated the ICU-TGNN model on the eICU-CRD dataset, demonstrating its superior capability in predicting general clinical outcomes such as ICU mortality and length of ICU stay. Our findings highlight ICU-TGNN&#39;s capability to provide accurate outcome predictions by effectively handling the complexity of ICU data, thereby holding great potential to optimize patient management and improve clinical outcomes.},

  abstract  = {Faults in the technical process of automated production systems (aPS) are challenging to detect, report, and recover accurately. Missing physical equipment, lacking detection mechanisms in the control software, and insufficient training and experience of human operators lead to an often delayed and imprecise detection of a fault&#39;s root cause. Since fault detection and recovery typically rely heavily on human involvement, there is also a risk of operators performing only partial repairs or inadvertently introducing new faults. Thereby, even slight deviations in human-machine interactions may affect process outcomes unpredictably, which so far cannot be modelled in field-level automation. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is well-suited to address functional relations in such complex socio-technical systems and accurately represent resource requirements, preconditions, control, and time constraints, making it a promising tool to methodically investigate aPS faults. Yet, the FRAM has barely been applied in this domain. This paper thus introduces an approach relying on the FRAM to methodically derive alarm conditions and system extensions as a foundation for broader uses to investigate in future work. The FRAM-based approach was shown to reduce uncaught faults, required operator interventions, and thus unplanned downtime, in an experiment with two participants on a lab-sized demonstrator machine.},

While wearable ECG devices offer real-time monitoring capabilities, current methods for identifying dysrhythmias are often time-consuming.

The CDI architecture comprises two principal components: the Slow-Fast-Normal Indicator Circuit (SFNIC) and the Normal-Abnormal Indicator Circuit (NAIC). SFNIC monitors dysrhythmias at each RRI, while NAIC evaluates dysrhythmia status at regular intervals, indicating normal or abnormal states every 64 RRIs (64 bpm is near to normal pulse rate). Through extensive simulations conducted using 0.18 μ $m$ CMOS processes, with mixed-signal circuits operating within the (0.9-1.8) volt range, our design demonstrates successful recognition of various ECG rhythms. These findings suggest that the proposed CDI design holds promise for integration into wearable ECG devices, enabling real-time dysrhythmia detection and timely intervention.},

Thus, if the subject-specific optimal phase is known, stimulation can be timed to be more efficient. In this paper, we present a closed-loop algorithm to determine the phase linked to the highest excitability with as few trials as possible. We used Bayesian optimization with different configurations as an automated, online search tool in an EEG-TMS simulation exneriment. From a sample of 38 healthy participants (25 f, 18 m), we selected all participants with a significant single-subject phase effect (N = 5) for the simulation. We then simulated 1000 experimental sessions per participant where we used Bayesian optimization to find the optimal phase. We tested two objective functions: Fitting a sinusoid in Bayesian linear regression or Gaussian Process regression. We additionally tested adaptive sampling using a knowledge gradient as the acquisition function compared with random sampling. We evaluated the algorithm&#39;s performance in a fast optimization (100 trials) and a long-term optimization (1000 trials). We found that for fast optimization, the Bayesian linear regression in combination with adaptive sampling gives the best results with a mean phase location accuracy of 79 % after 100 trials. With either sampling approach, Bayesian linear regression performs better than Gaussian Process regression in the fast optimization. In the long-term optimization, Bayesian regression with random sampling shows the best trajectory, with a rather steep improvement and good final performance of 87 % mean phase location accuracy. In summary, we could show the suitability of closed-loop Bayesian optimization for phase selection. We show that we can increase the speed and accuracy by using prior knowledge about the expected function shape compared with traditional Bayesian optimization with Gaussian Process regression.},

  abstract  = {To address the effect of both intra- and inter-subject variability in the EEG-based motor-imagery classification, adaptive schemes have been proposed whereby the pre-trained model. However, collection and labelling of additional target data is resource intensive. Furthermore, there may exist significant signal variations across time especially across multiple recording sessions which can result in model performance deterioration following adaptation. This introduces another challenging problem to training classifiers as they are typically unable to automatically determine which data is suitable for fine-tuning purposes, leading to some subjects facing performance drops even after adaptation. To address the data scarcity and variability in adaptive performance, we propose a novel machine-relearning Siamese architecture which utilizes few samples of unlabeled evaluation data to perform data efficient model re-learning. Machine re-learning optimally selects a sub-section of previously known data to update the model parameters. This is implemented via the use of comparative contrastive loss between the Gaussian distributions of target and known data to perform data selection. The highest subject-independent performance achieved an average (N=54) accuracy of 86.63% (±11.79%) without additional data and 88.23% (±10.36%) when utilizing a single unlabeled supplementary data for two-class motor imagery. The previous best accuracy on this dataset is 85.90% (±11.20%) using the best-known method in the literature. Therefore, significantly superior adaptation performance can be achieved while utilizing lesser amount of information from the target subject through reducing EEG feature variability in the training and fine-tuning sets.

This allows them to navigate through image patches effectively, avoiding incorrect correlations and reducing ambiguity in attention maps, thus proving their efficacy in computer vision tasks. Rather than directly analyzing child sexual abuse data, we constructed two datasets: one comprising clean and pornographic images and another with three classes, which additionally include images indicative of pornography, sourced from Reddit and Google Open Images data. In our experiments, we also employ an adult content image benchmark dataset. These datasets served as a basis for assessing the performance of vision transformer models in pornographic image classification. In our study, we conducted a comparative analysis between various popular vision transformer models and traditional pre-trained ResNet models.

Our key idea is to divide images into high and low frequency components. Based on frequency representation of images, we design a new high-frequency encoding module that remains content semantic information from the original domain. We also present a novel style consistency regularization on low-frequency components, which enhances style consistency of the output images. Our approach achieves sota performance on multiple unpaired image translation tasks. Extensive experiments prove our method significantly improves semantic consistency that remains content semantics from the original images and generates style-harmonious images.},

  abstract  = {The popularity of Deepfake technology has raised the challenge of recognizing real and fake faces. While detection methods already exist, most of them are passive forensics and face challenges of generalizability and migration. Currently, some research attempts to protect the original image by priorly inserting invisible information. However, there are still shortcomings in terms of image quality and information robustness due to information embedding, i.e., watermarking. Therefore, we employ the robustness of perceptual hash coding and combine it with information hiding techniques to propose a proactive Deepfake detection solution, referred to as PWPH in this paper. Our approach is simple and efficient: first, the image containing a face is divided into two parts: FA (face area), and NFA (non-face area). A perceptual hash code is generated from the non-face area (NFA). Then, the hash codes are embedded as watermarks into the FA. At the extraction stage, we use the same method as the encoder to retrieve the embedded watermark from FA. The watermark is then compared with the hash code generated from the NFA of the detected image. The extracted watermark is sensitive to distortion and may vanish during Deepfake processing. Experimental results validate that our method, requiring just one encoder and decoder, enables active detection and source tracking. Furthermore, its efficacy in typical Deepfake scenarios such as face swapping and expression reconstruction is confirmed through comparison with prior arts.},

  abstract  = {Medical images from different healthcare centers exhibit varied data distributions, posing significant challenges for adapting lung nodule detection due to the domain shift between training and application phases. Traditional unsupervised domain adaptive detection methods often struggle with this shift, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel domain adaptive approach for lung nodule detection that leverages mean teacher self-training and contrastive learning. First, we propose a hierarchical contrastive learning strategy to refine nodule representations and enhance the distinction between nodules and background. Second, we introduce a nodule-level domain-invariant feature learning (NDL) module to capture domain-invariant features through adversarial learning across different domains. Additionally, we propose a new annotated dataset of X-ray images to aid in advancing lung nodule detection research. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple X-ray datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating domain shift impacts.},

  abstract  = {Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) is a prevalent research direction in modern logistics transportation. In this challenging problem, customers are divided into pickup nodes and delivery nodes, and vehicles must first serve each pickup node before proceeding to its corresponding delivery node. Moreover, the hard time window constraint presents an obstacle for the existing learning-to-construct methods. Hence, this paper proposes a novel learning-to-construct approach based on node-pair insertion to address the complex time window constraint. It involves predicting the insertion point for the next node pair within the current partial solution and ensuring constraint adherence. We enhance the context information for the decoder to produce better solutions. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach can construct high-quality solutions in a very short period of time.},

Despite the prevalence of transfer learning, the target model can easily inherit defects from the source model during the learning process, such as vulnerability to backdoor attacks and adversarial attacks. Thus, this work proposes a novel approach, iterative pruning learning approach (IPLA), that reduces the inheritance of potential defects during the transfer learning process. In order to reduce the vulnerability to attacks and improve the robustness of target model, IPLA evaluates the importance of weights from the source model and retains ones that are critical to the target task, then prunes the redundant weights through an iterative pruning process. Experiments are performed on 4 datasets over 2 backbone source models. Results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of our proposed method.},

In addressing speech tasks, confining the attention mechanism solely to the temporal dimension poses limitations in effectively focusing on critical speech features. Taking into account the aforementioned issues, our study introduces a novel speech enhancement framework, HFSDA, which skillfully integrates heterogeneous spatial features and incorporates a dual-dimension attention mechanism to significantly enhance speech clarity and quality in noisy environments. By leveraging self-supervised learning embeddings in tandem with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrogram features, our model excels at capturing both high-level semantic information and detailed spectral data, enabling a more thorough analysis and refinement of speech signals. Furthermore, we employ the innovative Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv) technology within the spectrogram input branch, enabling enhanced extraction and integration of crucial information across multiple dimensions. Additionally, we refine the Conformer model by enhancing its feature extraction capabilities not only in the temporal dimension but also across the spectral domain. Extensive experiments on the VCTK-DEMAND dataset show that HFSDA is comparable to existing state-of-the-art models, confirming the validity of our approach.},

This model uses a heterogeneous graph to model user check-in trajectories with spatial and temporal information. Subgraphs are extracted from the heterogeneous graph, and an adjacency matrix is built for each subgraph. These matrices are fused through a neural network to obtain vector representations for POIs and POI categories. GDB-TR&#39;s core is a double-layer bidirectional neural network: one layer describes POIs, the other POI categories. Bidirectional computation captures the influence of preceding POIs on following ones and vice versa.

For this study, new datasets were created with two image sizes: the Tomato Leaf Image Dataset (TLID) with image sizes of 256 x 256 pixels and 15,256 images, and the Patch Tomato Leaf Image Dataset (PTLID) with patch sizes of 32 x 32 pixels and 227,218 images.

  abstract  = {Traditional autofocus methods search for the optimal focal distance (FD) by evaluating image quality from focal stacks, resulting in time-consuming focusing processes. Recently, deep learning has being adopted for single-shot autofocus methods, which can predict the optimal FD directly from a single input image. However, these methods often suffer from low prediction accuracy due to the lack of global features and structured global supervisory information, as they rely solely on the image&#39;s region of interest (ROI) as input and a single value for supervision. We propose a deep learning network named MPFS (Multi-Head Network with Per-Pixel Focal Distance Supervision), which takes a full-frame photograph as input and uses the optimal focal distance per pixel for supervision, this method effectively addresses the issues of missing global features and insufficient supervisory information by leveraging these enhancements. Additionally, the network integrates current camera focal distance information to mitigate the scale ambiguity caused by the lack of absolute scale information. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we designed an experiment using a dataset annotated with optimal FD per pixel. Experimental results on this dataset indicate that our approach achieves a 0.22 decrease in the Mean Absolute Error (Mae) metric compared to the state-of-the-art models, with improvements of 0.02 and 0.004 in $\boldsymbol{d}_{\mathbf{1}}$ and $\boldsymbol{d}_{\mathbf{2}}$ metrics.},

  abstract  = {Generative linguistic steganography aims to embed information into natural language texts to achieve covert transmission. However, currently in most approaches based on subword-supporting language models, the extraction process relies on tokenizing steganographic texts into tokens, which could cause segmentation ambiguity, leading to false results or failures of extraction finally. Despite several existing countermeasures (or disambiguation) that have been proposed, they are based on removing tokens of candidate pools, which render them incompatible from the sights of keeping imperceptibility, potentially incurring safety risks. To avoid it, we focus on tackling segmentation ambiguity with near-integrity of candidate pools. In this paper, we propose a near-imperceptible disambiguating approach via verification for generative linguistic steganography. First, this paper draws an all-case extraction method to obtain possible true extracted results. Further, length verification and checksum verification are presented to filter wrong extracted results caused by segmentation ambiguity. Experiments show that our disam-biguating approach outperforms the existing disambiguating approaches, on various criteria, including about 23.49 % higher embedding capacity, about 23.46 % higher imperceptibility and about 5.73% anti-steganalysis capacity of steganographic texts.},

Firstly, the super-resolution reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the abnormal image to improve the clarity and enrich the characteristic information contained in the image. On this basis, the improved YOLOv8 network is used to detect the defects in the inspection image. The CBAM attention mechanism is fused in the Bottleneck part of the C2f module to strengthen the model&#39;s ability to locate the target; In order to further improve the detection ability of small targets in patrol inspection, a small target detection layer is added to make the network pay more attention to the detection of small targets. Finally, in order to be deployed to the edge devices, the original convolution in the network is modified to a lightweight convolution GhostConv to reduce the number of model parameters. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect abnormal defects of transmission line components on the basis of improving the quality of inspection images. mAP is improved by 3.7% and the number of model parameters and calculation amount are greatly reduced, which reflects the effectiveness of the algorithm, and it has stronger extraction ability and robustness for subtle defect targets, meeting the detection requirements of power inspection.},

To cope with this difficulty, we propose a Channel Independent Attention Network (CIAN) for electricity theft detection. In particular, electricity consumption data is firstly processed by a sequence patchfication strategy, which enables dependency capturing over suitable time intervals. A parallel structure is then constructed, where a self-attention based channel independent encoder and a mix convolution module are cooperated for learning global and local feature patterns, respectively. Lastly, the features are fused to predict whether the electricity consumption sequence data involves electricity theft. Experimental results on a real-world electricity dataset demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses other competitive electricity theft detection approaches across various evaluation metrics.},

To mitigate hallucinations induced by these ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating hallucination.

  abstract  = {Smart contracts usually hold a large amount of digital assets, which can cause substantial losses if these contracts have vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to adequately detect possible vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. There are many types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and different detection methods have their own unique advantages, some vulnerabilities may be more suitable for expert rule-based methods, while some vulnerabilities are more suitable for deep learning-based methods. A single detection method usually fails to fully use its ability to detect vulnerabilities. To address the above problems, we propose a composite approach named CDE-VD (Combining Deep Learning and Expert Rules for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection) to improve the performance of vulnerability detection. The method divides smart contract samples into deep learning-prone sam-ples and expert rule-prone samples by classifying them before detection, and extracts expert rule features to train the smart contract detection method classifier to predict the category of the samples under analysis, then selects the suitable method for detection. The experimental results show that the vulnerability detection performance of CDE-VD outperforms that of single detection methods. Compared with the SOTA method MANDO, CDE-VD achieves average improvements of 3.22%, 2.32%, 9.25%, and 6.54% in terms of the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score for five categories of vulnerabilities such as access control and time manipulation, respectively, which indicates that category prediction of the smart contract samples could improve vulnerability detection performance.},

  abstract  = {In the digital society era, the generation frequency of multimodal data is rapidly increasing. Blockchain, recognized as a trusted distributed database technology, provides a new solution for the trustworthy storage and efficient management of multimodal data. However, blockchain systems support only query that use transaction hash values as keywords and cannot directly leverage the content features of multimodal data, leading to generally low query efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient multi-layer indexing method on blockchain for multimodal data querying. It establishes an effective mapping between on-chain and off-chain data through a verifiable on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage architecture. The paper also proposes Multi-layer Bitmap Block Index (MBBI) and Cuckoo Merkel Tree (C-MT) to optimize the querying process. Experimental results demonstrate that this method not only ensures the consistency and integrity of metadata across on-chain and off-chain but also significantly enhances the efficiency of multimodal data query. This offers a feasible solution for the storage and query needs of large-scale multimodal data.},

  abstract  = {Tables play a crucial role in both documents and daily life, thus sparking significant interest in the research of automatic table structure recognition(TSR). Recent methods primarily achieve recognition by predicting makeup sequences or adjacency relationships between table cells. However, these methods have some limitations in applications. The former requires additional computation of heuristic rules to recover the structure of the table, which not only increases the computational complexity but also may affect the recognition accuracy. The later relies on huge training data and inefficiency decoders, which not only raises the cost but also limits their application in real-time or large-scale data processing scenarios. At the same time, they often ignore the significance of cell logical location and fail to effectively utilize the rich text information that naturally exists in the table. In this paper, we propose a new framework called VTLL to solve the problem. The method extracts visual and textual features to do adaptive feature fusion, and we also introduce a cascading regressors to predict the fused features multiple times, while combining intra-cell and inter-cell losses. As for the regression header part, we use a mixed context aggregator to understand the inter-cell relationships. We evaluated the proposed methods on several public datasets, experiment results demonstrate that VTLL performs better.},

  abstract  = {The reconstruction of dense point clouds is an important foundation for downstream applications, such as object detection, semantic classification and surface reconstruction. Current methods focus on dense point cloud reconstruction for objects but neglect the whole scene. To address this issue, the reconstruction of dense point clouds supervised by inverse stereo matching (IS-Dense) is proposed. In detail, the Transformer model is first used to extract deep features form the point clouds. Second, point cloud features are expanded through the base upsampler. Ultimately, the point clouds would be coordinated following the feature expansion. Due to the uneven distribution of point clouds in the whole scene, some gaps and anomalies are presented in the data. Therefore, a point location refinement module supervised by inverse stereo matching is designed to solve this problem. For this module, the key is to utilize the reconstructed dense point clouds and the right image to estimate the left image. Supervised by real left images, the reconstructed dense point clouds are precise and even-distributed. The experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed method over current methods, especially for the whole scene.},

This paper proposes a transformer-based detector TS-DETR to improve the accuracy of small object detection in autonomous driving systems.

Additionally, a content-aware deformable cross-attention mechanism is proposed to obtain more comprehensive attention weights.

Traditional active authentication methods based on passwords, faces, fingerprints, etc. authenticate only once at login, which still has some hidden dangers. Authentication methods based on behavioral biometrics such as walking gait, touch screen, keystroke, etc. can provide implicit and continuous authentication services, and thus have been widely studied recently. Considering the limited computational resources of smart devices, we first introduce the state-space model with linear model complexity, i.e., Mamba, to extract deep feature representations from raw signal sequences in the sensor-based authentication task. Then a series of auxiliary information from different domains are proposed and fused to the deep features to enhance the consistent semantic information and ultimately improve the discriminative ability of the model. Our model A-Mamba, i.e., Auxiliary-Mamba, is experimented on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our model outperforms existing approaches.},

In real-world scenarios, graphs may have nodes that exhibit both homophily and heterophily. Failing to generalize to this setting makes many GNNs underperform in graph classification. In this paper, we address this limitation by identifying three effective designs and develop a novel GNN architecture called IHGNN (Incorporating Heterophily into Graph Neural Networks). These designs include the combination of integration and separation of the ego- and neighbor-embeddings of nodes, adaptive aggregation of node embeddings from different layers, and differentiation between different node embeddings for constructing the graph-level readout function. We empirically validate IHGNN on various graph datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs for graph classification.},

Traditional MNER methods primarily rely on simple interactions between text annotations and visual features, thus overlooking the specific correspondence between text and visual objects. Additionally, irrelevant visual noise may interfere with the final recognition results. Therefore, this paper proposes a Entity label-guided Graph Fusion Multi-modal Named Entity Recognition approach(ELGF), which utilizes pre-defined entity label information from input text as a bridge. Firstly, entity label detection tasks are employed to obtain entity label information. Then, the entity label information is utilized as a bridge between the two modalities to construct a multimodal interaction graph. This graph is inputted into a graph neural network, where attention and gate mechanisms are applied to interactively fuse multimodal information. Finally, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) decoding is used to predict the final MNER label sequence. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared to mainstream methods, the proposed model achieves competitive recognition accuracy on public datasets.},

To solve this problem, we propose a multimodal sentiment analysis model focusing on each modality (MFM). In this paper, we separately integrate each modality as a primary modality interacting with other secondary modal information so that each modality can play a leading role. In addition, we use shared mask in modal interaction to capture important information in the secondary modality related to the primary modality, and improve the effectiveness of the information interaction process. The model is evaluated against baseline models using the MOSI and MOSEI multimodal sentiment analysis datasets.

This paper attempts to improve industrial security from the perspective of code security and proposes a static code analysis approach specifically designed for IEC 61131–3 Structured Text (ST) programs. This approach uses structural pattern matching and symbolic execution technology to identify program defects and improve quality by detecting problematic code structures and potential issues early in the development process, thereby reducing the debugging effort required during developments. Considering the characteristic of periodic loop execution in PLCs, we introduce the loop unwinding technique to collect constraints from subsequent execution cycles for detection purposes. Based on the aforementioned approach, we implement a static code analysis tool, ST-Checker and make a series of evaluations. The experimental results show that this method is feasible and can detect potential defects that existing PLC compilers cannot detect, improving the precision of defect detection with data dependencies.},

Specifically, the transmission risk of an infectious disease (e.g., COVID-19) is perceived as a combination of the presence of a transmission agent (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 virus or its variants) and the requisite factors that lead to infection of humans and the associated aftermath of infection. TCEA adopts a causal map to represent all possible transmission risks via a brainstorming process. Next, appropriate preventive and control actions associated with each transmission risk are identified. Similar to FMEA, a Risk Priority Number model with Severity, Occurrence, and Detection ratings is adopted for analysis, prioritization, and decision-making. To demonstrate the usefulness of TCEA, a real-world case study on COVID-19 is conducted. The empirical results indicate that TCEA provide a simple, systematic and easy-to-implement approach to effectively analyze and manage transmission risks of COVID-19 in non-healthcare workplaces.},

  abstract  = {Reed-Solomon coding has been widely adopted to protect data storage against failures in storage systems. Recently, proactive fault tolerance is coming to offer an added protection for data storage coping with the increased device failures. Reliability is critical for storage systems. Due to complex system states and fault tolerance patterns, it is very intricate to analyze the reliability of proactive-tolerance Reed-Solomon storage systems. In this paper, a reliability framework is proposed, which combines event-driven simulation with mathematical model to analyze the reliability of proactive-tolerance Reed-Solomon storage systems. Monte Carlo simulation model simulates storage systems operation according to the failure parameters of different subsystems generated from statistical data. A mathematical model is designed to analyze the probability of data loss under certain concurrent failures. The proposed framework models the impact of various device failures (including permanent device failures, transient failures and correlated failures), network bandwidth, and both accurate predictions and false alarms of proactive fault tolerance on the reliability. The proposed reliability framework can be adapted to different Reed-Solomon codes and system configurations, offering versatility in its application and assist system designers in optimizing trade-offs and comparing schemes, which is beneficial for system design and operation.},

This is necessary to guarantee the success of the final product after the expensive and time-consuming development phase. To integrate a formalized description of the required abilites of the system, ability graphs have been proposed in the literature. Up to this date, however, this ability graph has only been used to model less complicated driver assistance systems in the literature. This work aims to introduce the value of an ability graph-based description of complex driving systems.

  abstract  = {Electric Vehicle (EV) is regarded as the optimal alternative to traditional fuel-powered vehicles. However, the exponential surge in EV charging demand poses challenges in charging infrastructure planning and charging behavior management. The efficacy of traditional Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) charging mode, which obtains power from the grid, is curtailed by the limited number and uneven distribution of charging facilities, inevitably leading to charging congestion. Instead, the concept of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) charging has emerged as a spatio-temporally flexible charging mode, which expands EV&#39;s role from consumer to provider, forming V2V pairs and utilizing urban Parking Lots (PLs) as charging locations. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Heterogeneous Modes (HHM)-based EV charging optimization scheme in urban settings. Building upon the G2V mode, we introduce synchronous and asynchronous V2V charging modes as optimization strategies, integrating and exploiting the unique advantages of each mode. We also utilize global EV charging scheduling and comprehensively take four dimensions into consideration (energy trading cost, travel cost, waiting time cost and loss cost), thus achieving flexible mode selection, V2V pairing, and designated charging locations. Simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing total charging costs, optimizing user service experiences, and improving charging facility utilization rates.},

  abstract  = {With rubber wheels instead of steel wheels and no need to be guided by steel rails, Autonomous rail Rapid Transit(ART), is gradually coming into people&#39;s lives. However, ART still occupies existing lanes and the relatively small station spacing of ART means that ART needs to be started and stopped frequently, all of which can lead to fluctuations in DC bus voltage during ART operation, making it difficult for loads (such as motors, air conditioners, and sensors) to operate properly. Therefore, this paper proposes the use of predictive set-point modulation to suppress DC bus voltage fluctuations. The predictive set-point modulation method is able to predict the direction of DC bus voltage changes prospectively, and then adjust the voltage preset value to balance the fluctuation of the output voltage, optimizing the closed-loop system&#39;s transient dynamic performance. Moreover, since lithium ion battery has high power and high energy consumption, using only one DC-DC circuit can reduce system reliability and cost. Therefore, we propose to use parallel DC-DC modules to balance the excessive power of the battery and verify the feasibility of the proposed method through simulation experiments. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the DC bus voltage fluctuation and improve the system reliability.},

  abstract  = {With the rapid development of Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit technology, lithium-ion battery as its main power source, the research of its charging technology has become particularly important. At present, the charging scheme of lithium-ion battery mainly includes two ways: single high-power charging and multiple low-power charging modules in parallel. However, the single high-power charging scheme has the problems of high cost and low efficiency, and the traditional parallel charging method lacks effective module management strategy, resulting in unbalanced load between modules during charging, affecting charging efficiency a nd safety. A iming at the shortcomings of current research, this paper proposes a parallel charging scheme of multiple DC-DC modules based on cooperative control. By designing a closed-loop control system of current inner loop and voltage outer loop, the precise control and cooperative work of parallel modules are realized. The experimental results show that the scheme not only improves the charging efficiency, but also ensures the stability and safety of the charging process, which provides an effective and reliable solution for the lithium-ion battery charging of the intelligent rail train.},

  abstract  = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) shows great potential in improving controllers&#39; adaptability to real-world dynamic traffic conditions. However, most DRL-based CACCs primarily focus on fixed predecessor following (PF) information flow topology (IFT) while ignoring the heterogeneity of the vehicle. In reality, even though most CACCs separate the platoon by human-driven vehicle (HDV) while considering the HDV as the leading vehicle of the platoon, the heterogeneity of the preceding vehicle with different motion properties (i.e. HDV and CAV) still exists. The adaptability of the DRL-based CACC may be degraded if the above heterogeneity is ignored. To fill this research gap, a DRL-based CACC with preceding vehicle properties is proposed in this study. Specifically, it first designs three typical sub-controllers by considering the applicable IFTs and the properties of preceding vehicles. The proposed DRL-based CACC is established according to the aforementioned designs with the objectives of safety, efficiency, smoothness, and comfort. To enhance the efficiency of transforming acquired data into the learning experience during the exploration process of the DRL algorithm, a periodic update deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is proposed. The results demonstrate the necessity of considering the preceding vehicle properties in designing the corresponding controller for a specific IFT.},

In this paper, we propose the evaluation of post-training quantization on state-of-the-art approaches in brain-computer interfaces and assess their impact on accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the single-trial detection of event-related potentials representing one major BCI paradigm. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve drops from 0.861 to 0.825 with PTQ when applied on both spatial filters and the classifier, while reducing the size of the model by about x 15. The results support the conclusion that PTQ can substantially reduce the memory footprint of the models while keeping roughly the same level of accuracy.},

EEG is recorded from fourteen healthy subjects, while they imagined slow and fast movement of their right hand towards the right or left direction.

Selected WCSP and MRCP features are then concatenated and used to decode the imagined slow and fast bi-directional movements. Binary classification of the speed-direction pairs resulted in an average classification accuracy of 68.1% across fourteen subjects.

  abstract  = {Deep learning techniques have significantly advanced change detection in remote sensing imagery. However, building change detection presents challenges due to the varied appearance of buildings and the complexity of scenes in remote sensing images. Current deep learning-based methods encounter three primary issues. Firstly, CNN-based approaches struggle to model crucial global contextual information essential for remote sensing building images analysis. Transformer-based methods may inadvertently degrade local features. Secondly, traditional attention mechanisms fall short in effectively modeling spatial and spectral features. Thirdly, certain channel attention methods extract excessive redundant information. To address these challenges, this study proposes SFAM-Net, a two-branch hybrid architecture. Our approach initially employs orthogonal methods to minimize redundant information extracted from channels and spaces. Subsequently, we leverage the parallel structure of convolutions and visual transformers to enhance images representation, integrating local features and global representations through cross-attention to better coordinate building and background features. In the CNN and Transformer branches, we adopt spatial-spectral feature coordination and spectral multi-head attention coordination strategies to improve performance in complex scenes. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function combining edge and center guidance, focusing on changing image edges and centers to enhance sensitivity and accuracy in change area detection. Extensive experiments on widely used LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our network.},

In this study, we propose an improved version of BLS, named the KEFBLS, aimed at enhancing the feature extraction capability of the hidden layer through the integration of multi-kernel technology and network sparsification strategies, complemented by deeper feature extraction using random Fourier features. the KEFBLS first combines polynomial and wavelet kernels to boost the nonlinear mapping capabilities of data; then, it applies the elastic-net method to refine the BLS objective function, removing low-impact hidden layer nodes to reduce redundancy and create a more streamlined network; finally, KEFBLS employs random Fourier features to map the processed hidden layers, further enhancing the network&#39;s feature extraction capabilities, constructing a new learning model. Our experimental results on three UCI regression datasets demonstrate that KEFBLS surpasses other methods in terms of learning efficiency and model performance.},

  abstract  = {Learning-based image compression techniques combined with current Transformer models and with checker-board context models have shown the excellent Rate-Distortion performance. However, the mixed structure still has room for optimization in terms of redundancy information and decoding efficiency, while the checkerboard context model has redundancy in capturing correlations between latent represen-tations. To solve these problems, we propose an innovative framework that combines a mixed Transformer-CNN structure with a checkerboard context model. Specifically, we introduce a “Checkerboard Channel-wise Entropy Module” to improve coding efficiency of utilizing contexts through a two-channel decoding method with checkerboard contexts. Then, we propose the “In-slice Odd-even Context”, which improves the handling of spatial redundancy information by adding additional spatial contexts by introducing a checkerboard context model to the original mixed structure with channel contexts and global con-texts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our pro-posed method outperforms JPEG, BPG and previous learned image compression on the Kodak dataset.},

  abstract  = {Captioning Whole Slide Images (WSIs) for pathological analysis is an essential but not extensively explored aspect of computer-aided pathological diagnosis. Challenges arise from insufficient datasets and the effectiveness of model training. Generating automatic caption reports for various gastric adenocarcinoma images is another challenge. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method referred to as TransUAAE-CapGen to generate histopathological captions from WSI patches. The TransUAAE-CapGen architecture consists of a hybrid UNet-based Advereasrial Autoencoder (AAE) for feature extraction and a transformer for caption generation. The hybrid UNet-based AAE extracted complex tissue properties from histopathological patches, transforming them into low-dimensional embeddings. The embeddings are then fed into the transformer to generate concise captions. Our proposed method is validated using the PatchGastricADC22 dataset. The TransUAAE-CapGen model provides the best estimated accuracy of BLEU-4 = 86.8%, METEOR = 59.6%, a ROUGE = 89.3%, and CIDEr = 7.72%. Experimental analysis indicates that the TransUAAE-CapGen architecture outperforms the traditional LSTM-based model for the caption generation task. Our findings reveal that the proposed architecture can effectively generate accurate and precise reports for medical image analysis.},

This domain presents unique challenges, including variable object scales, complex backgrounds, prevalent small objects, and densely arranged items, distinguishing it from traditional object detection in natural images. This paper proposes a novel object detection algorithm(RS-DETR), which builds upon the DETR framework and integrates the Swin Transformer. The algorithm features a dual-branch structure in its feature extraction module, markedly improving detection accuracy, especially for objects of varying scales. The addition of the GAM convolutional attention mechanism allows the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant regions, minimizing background complexities. Moreover, we have included the scale-invariant intersection over union (SIoU) loss function to enhance the precise localization of closely packed objects. To demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, RS-DETR was applied to the HRSC2016 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets. The results show average detection accuracies of 86.1% and 57.9% on these datasets, respectively, outperforming the baseline models by 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.},

Concretely, a symmetric and uniform distribution of information granularity has been considered for intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations. However, there exist other protocols of information granularity distribution that could be used. Therefore, we aim to analyze all the information granularity distribution protocols and determine their effectiveness in building consensus through intuitionistic reciprocal preference relations.

In recent years, matrix-based EC approaches have been proposed to accelerate the computational speed, which has obtained promising results in dealing with large-scale problems. However, most existing matrix-based EC algorithms are designed for continuous optimization problems, while the matrix-based approach integrated with ACS has not attracted enough attention, which will be efficient for solving large-scale discrete optimization problems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a matrix-based ACS (MACS) algorithm and apply it to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP). MACS is an innovative improvement over the traditional ACS algorithm, utilizing matrix operations to parallelly let ants select city and update pheromone. Experimental results show that the MACS algorithm has significantly better efficiency in accelerating computational speed while maintaining the remarkable problem-solving ability in solving large-scale TSP.},

Due to the strong responsiveness to deceptive reward signals and diverse exploration, evolutionary reinforcement learning (ERL) is a more noteworthy option for training UAVs than common reinforcement learning. However, for ERL contains too many neural networks, its training efficiency is not satisfactory enough. To address this shortcoming, this paper proposes an evolutionary reinforcement learning with double replay buffers (ERLDRB) for UAV online target tracking problem. Firstly, considering the energy consumption and the possible delay of feedback signals to the UAV, a more realistic model of UAV online target tracking problem is designed. Then based on the problem formulation, ERLDRB utilizes a double experience replay buffers technique to increase learning efficiency in the training stage, which can better solve real-world UAV online target tracking problem. Simulation results show that ERLDRB outperforms multiple contrasting algorithms on the designed model.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) models TSC as a Markov decision process and learns the timing relationship of traffic scheduling from massive historical data. Due to the uncertainty and mutability of TSC problems, existing RL methods face bottlenecks in diversity and are easy to be trapped into local optima. To alleviate this predicament, this paper combines evolutionary optimization and RL to propose an evolutionary algorithm-assisted reinforcement learning (EARL-Light) method for TSC problems. EARL-Light is a population-based algorithm, in which one individual represents a policy and a population of individuals are evolved to search for near-optimal policies. The diversified search ability of evolutionary optimization can help the algorithm get rid of local optima for global optimization and the rapid learning based on the gradient of RL can achieve fast convergence. Extensive experiments on seven real-world traffic datasets demonstrates that EARL-Light achieves shorter travel time with fast convergence.},

Along this road, this paper devises an Individual-level Dominant Exemplar Selection (IDES) framework for PSO, giving rise to a new PSO variant named IDESPSO. Specifically, instead of using their own personally best positions and the globally best position of the entire swarm to update particles, IDES first randomly chooses two different exemplars for each particle from all personally best positions. Then, it compares the two selected exemplars with the personally best position of this particle. Based on the comparison results, different updating strategies are utilized to update different particles. This method notably enriches the variety among the chosen leading exemplars, thereby substantially bolstering the updating diversity of particles. Under IDES, this paper further develops seven selection strategies to help IDESPSO pick up promising exemplars for particles to evolve. Specifically, the seven selection schemes are the roulette wheel selection, the tournament selection, and five hybridizations of two basic models. A series of experiments have been undertaken on the universally used CEC2014 problem suite to compare IDESPSO with the seven selection schemes and two classic PSOs. The empirical results show that IDESPSO paired with anyone of the seven selection methods, markedly outperforms the two classical PSO variants, highlighting its significant performance.},

Addressing this gap, we propose a novel opinion dynamics model based on hierarchical thinking to describe the opinion evolution on social networks. Individuals are classified into different levels according to their cognitive abilities. They act with bounded rationality at their respective levels to optimize both the promotion of personal opinions and the avoidance of cyberbullying. Through simulation analysis, we found the crucial role of users with high levels of hierarchical thinking. They can discern the opinion climate and articulate their opinion, acting as bridges in the evolution of public opinion. Their opinion can reach the bounded confidence range of more people, thereby enabling polarization to shift to consensus under the same conditions. Furthermore, this effect is independent of individual inherent attributes, which is more in line with real-life scenarios.},

Incremental evolution handles gait generation for legged robots in two discrete increments. The first increment uses a cyclic genetic algorithm to learn the activations (pulse instructions to the servos) required for each leg to perform a single-leg cycle. This learning program takes into account the way each leg is mounted on the body and the range of movement provided by the three servos on each leg to produce a smooth, straight, and efficient leg cycle. The second increment uses a genetic algorithm to select the best combination of leg cycles for each leg and to learn the timing to execute each leg cycle to coordinate them all together into a single gait. In this work, we learn the gait incrementally in a simulation and transfer the final gaits to the real robot to confirm the method&#39;s viability.},

While existing analysis mainly focuses on individual applications of ADAS, safety violations in the overall system can be found by extensive road tests, which are not only costly in terms of time and money but also lack a formal safety guarantee. This is because tests may not cover all driving scenarios, especially the ones that involve discrete mode switching. In this paper, we focus on the longitudinal vehicle motion and provide a pipeline to perform safety verification for all the related ADAS applications. To that end, we specify safety constraints and boundaries for a vehicle&#39;s longitudinal cruising and collision avoidance and validate a longitudinal dynamic model against the high-fidelity simulation software CarSim. Then we define hybrid automata to describe the closed-loop system composed of the vehicle dynamics and the ADAS. Finally, by computing the reachable sets of the hybrid automata and comparing them with the specified safety boundaries, the ADAS is verified. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous driving demands sophisticated control systems that optimize safety, performance, passenger comfort, and fuel efficiency. This study proposes a steering control system that integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for speed planning with a novel feedback mechanism based on Subjective Vertical Conflict (SVC) in the reward function. Using simulations in MATLAB and Simulink, we evaluate the system&#39;s performance across various thresholds of SVC, examining its impact on ride comfort, fuel efficiency, and vehicle behavior during lane changes. Results reveal a trade-off relationship between ride comfort and fuel efficiency, with lower SVC thresholds generally improving comfort but potentially increasing steering input. Additionally, excessively low SVC thresholds degrade target-reaching performance and lengthen lane change distances, highlighting the need for careful parameter tuning. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning-based steering control systems to optimize multiple evaluation criteria simultaneously while emphasizing the importance of balancing trade-offs in autonomous driving scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Traffic flow prediction assumes a pivotal role in aiding governments and companies accurately forecast changes in vehicle volume, consequently enhancing transportation efficiency and facilitating vehicle travel. Presently, the majority of traffic flow prediction methods rely on centralized learning strategies, which entail the transmission of substantial data and may jeopardize user privacy. To address this issue, we propose a Federated Learning-based Attention Graph Convolutional Network (FLSTAGCN) algorithm for traffic flow prediction. Firstly, we develop a Spatial-Temporal Attention Graph Convolutional Network (STAGCN) method that employs attention mechanism to proficiently extract spatial-temporal features from traffic flow data, augmenting the model&#39;s learning capabilities. Subsequently, within the aggregation mechanism of Federated learning, we devise a bespoke optimal selection to enhance training accuracy and reduce communication costs in traffic flow prediction scenarios. Finally, we integrate Federated Learning with STAGCN and utilize the optimal selection protocol to designate participants for transmitting optimal parameters. The Experimental results substantiate that our approach outperforms advanced deep learning approaches in terms of traffic flow prediction performance while ensuring the privacy and security of traffic data.},

  abstract  = {Advanced control and safety systems are crucial for electric vehicles, and the accurate estimation of the tire-road friction coefficient (TRFC) is crucial for developing effective safety control strategies. The hybrid data-mechanism model (HDMM), introduced in this paper, addresses the performance challenges posed by the inaccuracies of physical models and the limited interpretability of data-driven models in tire force estimation for TRFC estimation. Tire dynamics often exhibit transient responses, while mechanism-based models(MBM) typically reflect steady-state characteristics. Neglecting transient characteristics leads to a decrease in model accuracy. A neural network is used to learn the transient response characteristics of tire dynamics. These characteristics are then integrated with the steady-state tire forces from MBM to estimate the lateral and vertical forces acting on the wheel. The estimated tire forces serve as virtual measurements to calibrate parameters in the TRFC estimator, based on the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). During real-world vehicle tests, the proposed method reduced the Mean Error (ME) in lateral and vertical forces by 1271.85 N and 996.7 N, respectively, compared to the estimated tire forces from MBM. Additionally, the estimated TRFC converged to the reference value approximately 40ms earlier than the result from the MBM, with an estimated deviation within 0.1.},

In this contribution, we propose the Omni-Lidar Evaluation Score (OLES), a novel metric to evaluate different LiDAR configurations based on their simulated raw data. Our OLES metric combines information-theoretic quantities with coverage-based metrics, considering both the spatial coverage and the uniformity of a LiDAR point cloud distribution. We show the need for a new metric and provide details on implementing OLES using the open-source simulator CARLA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new metric in a simulation study and highlight its usefulness in the early phases of vehicle development. This research provides a means to evaluate the quality of LiDAR configurations and provides a basis for further optimizing sensor setups for AVs.},

The resulting stochastic model can capture motion on rough surfaces, random deformation in the wheel-ground contact, or stochastic loss/gain of traction. We study a differential robot with ideal noisy and affine noisy constraints, where each case models a certain aspect of motion on rough terrains. We then investigate their corresponding stochastic dynamics and the propagation of mean and covariance through Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed model for roving rough terrains has the potential to serve as the stochastic model employed in model-based motion planning, pose estimation, and control of rover systems. The main challenge will be dealing with the nonlinear appearance of the noise and its feedback in the equations of motion.},

  abstract  = {Synchronous language is routinely used to model safety-critical control systems. In recent years, it is gradually being applied to cyber-physical systems (CPS) which emphasise high levels of correctness and safety. It is based on the assumption that the system reacts instantaneously to input events and can compute the output before the next input event, so it is well suited for expressing temporal logic. However, it lacks effective constructs for expressing spatial properties in CPS. Moreover, spatio-temporal properties in CPS are indispensable, requiring not only qualitative analysis but also quantitative analysis. Therefore, we propose SELus, a new synchronous language based on Lustre, to provide the capability of modeling spatio-temporal properties in CPS, enabling the representation of spatial topological relationships and the performance of quantitative analysis on them. To formally verify the SELus model, we introduce a set of mapping rules to transform the SELus model into the Ptolemy II model. The resulting Ptolemy II model is used in Ptolemy II to perform quantitative analysis of the SELus model. Experiments are conducted on lane changing system, showcasing the usability and effectiveness of our language.},

First, the interconnected electrical power system is accurately modelled as a FO system with time delay. Then, the FO controller is designed using the internal model control (IMC) technique, where a low-pass filter (LPF) is considered to mitigate the effect of the disturbances. The tuning parameter of the designed FO involves a single tuning parameter, which is analytically designed using gain crossover frequency criteria. The disturbance and parametric uncertainty analyses have been carried out to analyze the efficacy of the proposed method under the variation of tuning parameter. Then, the frequency and tie-line power fluctuations are estimated under nominal and parametric uncertainty conditions. Also, its performance has been compared to recent state-of-the-art techniques for precise efficacy analysis.},

  abstract  = {In focusing tasks on moving targets, traditional methods that rely on maximizing contrast struggle to capture moving objects due to insufficient focusing speed. Deep learning-based methods have attempted to directly predict the optimal focal length for the target; however, due to low prediction accuracy, they often lead to out-of-focus situations when capturing moving objects. In recent years, some approaches have utilized reinforcement learning to automatically explore focal length adjustment patterns, thus achieving better results than traditional methods. However, these approaches have not considered the motion characteristics of the targets, leading to a need for further improvement in focusing performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a motion-based feature and deep reinforcement learning-driven autofocus algorithm named MF-DRLAF (Motion Features based Deep Reinforcement Learning Autofocus Model) for moving targets. This novel method tracks the object, predicts its motion state through feature extraction, and uses deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the focus. We utilize a self-attention mechanism to adaptively learn various motion patterns and employ a feature pool structure to enhance processing efficiency. Experiments and real-world testing on a Google Pixel3 demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances autofocus performance on moving objects, highlighting its potential for broader imaging applications. This approach offers a promising direction for future development in autofocus technology.},

In order to solve the above problems, we propose a near real-time detection model RTS-DETR. In this paper, we revisit Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), which effectively handles multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion, but this will lose a lot of positive local information. To this end, we have improved the efficient hybrid encoder. We propose a new positional encoding method that enables the hybrid encoder to more accurately convert the input feature sequence into a high-dimensional representation, and propose a new feature fusion module to enhance the model&#39;s ability to capture local features. Furthermore, in order to improve the tolerance of small objects to IoU, we combine Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) with Shape-IoU for the optimization model. This method more accurately takes into account the shape and size of objects, thereby improving detection accuracy. Our model achieves an accuracy of 38.8% (in terms of mAP@0.5) on the widely used VisDrone dataset, which improves the accuracy by 2.5% compared to RT-DETR with ResNet-18 as the backbone network.},

  abstract  = {The Broad Learning System (BLS) has been established as an effective flat network alternative to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), delivering high efficiency while achieving competitive accuracy. Despite its advantages, the incremental learning methods of BLS face challenges in stability and computation when expanding with new nodes or input. We introduce two novel incremental learning algorithms based on factorization updates for BLS that optimize node and input additions to overcome these limitations. Our node addition algorithm utilizes QR decomposition and Cholesky factorization, using the update of the Cholesky factor instead of pseudo-inverse computations. For input addition, we propose an iterative Cholesky factor update algorithm. Our algorithms demonstrate not only faster computation compared to the existing BLS but also improved testing accuracy on the MNIST or Fashion-MNIST dataset. This work presents a significant step forward in the practical application and scalability of BLS in various data-dense environments.},

  abstract  = {The production of palm oil on a commercial scale is labour intensive with many of its processes handled by humans. In some countries, there can be as many as 500,000 plantation workers in the palm oil sector involved in labour intensive work in large plantations. However, such dependence on humans for low skill manual work has led to many problems. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been seen as a possible alternative to support some of these processes that require low skills in the palm oil industry. However, the flying time of the UAVs is finite and hence it is important to maximize the number of palm trees that it can service. In this paper, an Ant Colony System (ACS) with a novel path constructor was used to identify good flight paths for UAVs in large palm oil plantations to help improve the efficiency for some of the agricultural activities. Good results were obtained for various data sets especially when compared with the standard ACS as well as those by the human experts.},

We highlight core issues such as accurate labeling, keyboard navigation, error management, focus control, visual design factors, placeholder text usage, assistive technology compatibility, handling of complex inputs, responsive design, cognitive load reduction, and ongoing testing. For each of these challenges, we assess its effect on accessibility and present innovative AI-driven strategies. Our findings illustrate how AI can streamline the development process by automating label generation, improving tab indexing, enhancing real-time error detection, refining focus control, offering contrast improvement suggestions, and simulating interactions with assistive technologies. We conclude that incorporating generative AI into web form development can markedly improve accessibility, making digital experiences more inclusive for users of all abilities.

  abstract  = {Agriculture is one of the sources of income a region can rely on to support its economy. Traditional agriculture relies primarily on human performance and observation, resulting in greater production costs and, subsequently, higher selling prices. Artificial intelligence-based technology can be used to reduce production costs, increase productivity, and provide consumer convenience. An indicator that is easy to interpret in measuring the quality and optimization of plant growth is the visualization of the condition of the leaves. The artificial intelligence technique that can be implemented in this regard is the object detection model. However, the challenge is the complex, multi-object, and multi-intersection condition of the leaves, which causes the model to be less optimal in conducting classification and detection tasks regarding whether the leaf condition is good or not. A YOLOv7 model will be employed in order to detect leaf quality, whether in an “optimal” or “not optimal” condition. To enhance the model&#39;s performance by improving accuracy through feature extraction enhancement, YOLOv7 will be integrated with the attention module, called the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The case study in this research is detecting a mango plant which is one of the plants that can provide a high economic impact and the object observed is the mango plant leaf. Several previous studies related to the implementation of attention modules in object detection include the improved pest-YOLO for real-time pest detection by combining YOLOv3 with efficient channel attention (ECA) and a transformer encoder. The ECA module and transformer encoder were integrated into the backbone and neck block systems of YOLO [1]. The lightweight YOLO model combined with SE-CSPGhostnet by improving the backbone block which employs squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENet) and a convolution technique consisting of regular convolution and ghost convolution [2]. There is a highlighted improvement of YOLOv7 compared to the previous version of YOLO, which is Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (E-ELAN). YOLOv7&#39;s learning ability is enhanced by using this network while maintaining the transition layer&#39;s architecture. E-ELAN enhances the structure of computational blocks. E-ELAN can keep its transition layer while changing only the architectural component of the computational block. This allows the model to learn more different features. The fundamental purpose of model scaling is to alter certain model features in order to generate models at various scales to fulfill the needs of different inference speeds.},

  abstract  = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) continue to be a significant cause of work incapacity. Exoskeletons have the potential to prevent these disorders, with passive exoskeletons already proving their usefulness but also displaying limitations. However, currently there is a lack of suitable methods to control active exoskeletons that offer additional advantages like supporting the user just when needed. This paper proposes a novel sensor-based system and a classification methodology for various work-related activities, based on the kinematic and power tool activation signals. First, requirements and thresholds for the sensor system and its signals are derived from representative activities in the construction environment. Then, the paper introduces a sensor system that collects the tool&#39;s kinematic signals and activation. The sensor system consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), pressure sensor, and WiFi-capable micro-controller for data transmission. Based on the signals, a threshold-based algorithm, capable of identifying six predefined activities is designed. The validity of the sensor system and algorithm is assessed through a custom-designed test course, reflective of real-world construction scenarios. With the developed test course, a study is conducted, and the activities are classified using the signals of the sensor system. The results demonstrate that the defined activities can be distinguished based on the kinematic and activation signals of the power tools.},

Their application in search and rescue (SAR) operations, however, presents unique challenges. Comprehensively exploring the disaster-stricken area is often infeasible due to the vastness of the terrain, transformed environment, and the time constraints involved. Traditional robotic systems typically operate on predefined search patterns and lack the ability to incorporate and exploit ground truths provided by human stakeholders, which can be the key to speeding up the learning process and enhancing triage. Addressing this gap, we introduce a system that integrates social interaction via large language models (LLMs) with a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework. The proposed system is designed to translate verbal inputs from human stakeholders into actionable RL insights and adjust its search strategy. By leveraging human-provided information through LLMs and structuring task execution through HRL, our approach not only bridges the gap between autonomous capabilities and human intelligence but also significantly improves the agent&#39;s learning efficiency and decision-making process in environments characterised by long horizons and sparse rewards.},

The first type emphasizes that a robot&#39;s policy is the best (or only) option that satisfies a specific property produced by its decision-making algorithms. The second explanation type is used when a robot fails and describes the cause of an error state that led to the failure. This paper proposes a new explanation type derived from a robot&#39;s proficiency self-assessment. The proposed explanation type not only supplements the first explanation type under typical operating conditions but also includes the second explanation type when the robot fails. The proposed explanation type is based on assumption-alignment tracking (AAT), a novel method for robot proficiency self-assessment. AAT provides three pieces of information for explanation generation: (1) assessment of assumptions veracity on which the robot&#39;s generators rely; (2) proficiency assessment measured by the probability that the robot will successfully accomplish its task; (3) counterfactual proficiency assessment computed by hypothetically varying assumptions. The information provided by AAT fits the situation awareness-based framework for explainable artificial intelligence.

However, most gesture recognition systems rely on optical methods because of their high accuracy, despite require complex and computationally intensive processes. Moreover, these systems are associated with high construction costs and are susceptible to environmental factors. This paper introduces a novel gesture recognition system, which effectively tracks and estimates gestures using cost-effective ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors and inertial measurement units (IMU). The system acquires position data of gesture through UWB sensors and includes essential data processing steps such as the detection and removal of abnormal data via IMU, data smoothing with a Kalman filter, and data normalization and scaling. Notably, normalization and scaling are achieved by converting the position data into grayscale images, ensuring the consistency of data features and enhancing gesture recognition accuracy across diverse users. The proposed system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to estimate gestures from these images. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits superior gesture classification performance compared to systems utilizing a long-short term memory (LSTM) model and those employing the same CNN model without the aforementioned data processing steps. Therefore, this system is not only cost-effective but also efficiently tracks and estimates gestures, offering significant improvements over existing methods.},

Numerous works attempt to create robust models by encoding useful information to intermediate representations. However, they still contain too much information about the training data which hinders improving the robustness of the model. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel approach, CHBaR, that incorporates class-conditioned information into intermediate representations. The class-conditioned information plays the role of weight components which are multiplied with the intermediate representations to produce class-conditioned representations. We utilize an attribution-based explanation method to obtain this class-conditioned information. As a result, the weight components emphasize class-relevant features by highlighting relevant information from the target class. This weighting process easily integrates the target class without complex computations and conceals useless representations, thus enhancing model predictions by masking features unrelated to the class. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in enhancing adversarial robustness. Especially, on the SVHN dataset, our proposed method shows an increment of 6.98 % points compared to the baseline model in PGD40 adversarial attack with the TRADES training setting.},

  abstract  = {Fingerprints serve as a primary means of individually identifying individuals. However, employing fingerprints in online mode poses a significant privacy risk, since it is susceptible to several forms of attack. It is plagued by issues related to privacy and security. In response to this, we proposed an innovative approach to convert the original fingerprint into a secure template that may be retained and utilized for authentication purposes. The new templates bear a resemblance to the original human fingerprints and ensure privacy by possessing the characteristic of non-invertibility. This study presented a method for generating highly authentic fingerprint templates that ensure the capacity to revoke and cancel the stolen fingerprint. Throughout the training and testing phase, we utilized the dataset derived from the Vikriti-ID fingerprint. The collection has 25000 distinct fingerprint samples, divided into five classes, with each class containing 5,000 samples. Throughout the testing phase, the comprehensive performance was evaluated based on the matching performance including EER and AUC.},

Recent research has shown that diffusion-based adversarial purification methods have emerged as a promising defense technique, but often suffer from computational inefficiencies and suboptimal results. To address these issues, we propose RoPAR, an innovative approach that enhances robustness against adversarial attacks by aggregating purified images at intermediate steps of the diffusion process. Our method improves model robustness while reducing the required diffusion steps. We also introduce a technique for reordering Gaussian noise to minimize semantic information loss while removing adversarial perturbations. These enhancements significantly reduce the number of function evaluations from 200 to 6, achieving a robust accuracy of 92.39 % against preprocessor-blind PGD attacks on CIFAR-10, a 2.29 percentage point improvement over state-of-the-art. Moreover, our method demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, achieving 87.46 % accuracy on CIFAR-10C.},

  abstract  = {Concept drift refers to the probability distribution of data generation changes over time in a data stream environment. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in drift detection models. However, due to the lack of labeled concept drift datasets, most researchers tend to using synthetic drift data generators for model training. These generators only have relatively simple feature distributions, which fail to capture the complexity found in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a real scenario concept drift label generator (RealDriftGenerator). This generator aims to preserve the complexity and temporal correlation of real-world scenario while generating concept drifts with user defined drift positions and drift widths. The validation result show that the temporal correlation coefficients of RealDriftGenerator is significantly higher than benchmark drift generators. Additionally, the ability of RealDriftGenerator to capture the complexity in real-world scenarios is 20% higher than benchmark drift generators(measured by model performance).

By fusing the descriptions of entities, relations and their structural information as task-aware prompts, we input such prompts into large language models and regard the responses as prediction tasks. The experimental results on various public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms all baseline methods for the three knowledge completion tasks and attains state-of-the-art in triple classification. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning the smaller large language models (e.g., Baichuan2-13B, LLaMA2-13B, ChatGLM3-6B) with relevant data markedly enhances their KGC capabilities and significantly outperforms GPT-4.},

Deep learning has become the predominant method for traffic classification, primarily involving the transformation of network traffic into grayscale images and their subsequent classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, traditional grayscale image generation methods are plagued with issues of redundant and lost information, and conventional channel attention mechanisms are still insufficient in capturing key traffic features, collectively hindering the enhancement of classification performance. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a classification method based on Byte Transfer Probability and Coordinate Attention Mechanism in Residual Network (BTP-CAResNet). This method, on the foundation of the classic ResNet architecture, incorporates a new grayscale image generation method that utilizes Byte Transfer Probability, effectively overcoming the deficiencies of traditional approaches. Additionally, this paper integrates a Coordinate Attention Mechanism into the ResNet model, which effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional channel attention mechanisms and further improves the performance of traffic classification. Experimental validation on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset demonstrates that, compared to previous CNN-based methods, the method proposed in this paper exhibits superior performance in key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. It provides a new perspective for traffic classification based on convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are highly sus-ceptible to adversarial noise, which can lead to erroneous predictions. In high-stakes scenarios, such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, DNNs inaccuracies can be dire. To address this issue, Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely adopted as an effective defense method. However, our analysis reveals two critical flaws in the traditional AT approach that hinder its adversarial robustness: (1) focus only on a subset of robust features during the training process. This narrow focus limits the model&#39;s ability to learn and perceive a diverse range of features. (2) tend to overlook potential cues in non-robust features that could be beneficial for the model to make correct predictions. These cues, referred to as “positive activations” for simplicity, contain valuable information that can enhance the model&#39;s perception and understanding of the input data. In this way, we propose a novel and plug-and-play framework called Multi-branch Feature Fusion and Dynamic Reconstruction (MFFDR), which leverages multi-branch attention mechanisms to enhance the model&#39;s perception of robust features and enrich the diversity of learned features. Moreover, we employ a dynamic weighting strategy to reconstruct non-robust features in order to utilize the positive activations embedded within them.

Current approaches primarily rely on adversarial training, which, despite its efficacy, imposes a significant computational burden. Our research proposes an alternative strategy known as the Soft Thresholding Norm (ST Norm). This approach counters the ‘feature shift’ phenomenon, identified by a substantial Euclidean Distance Statistics (EDS) between original and adversarial features, through the imposition of sparse constraints on potential features following batch normalization. This novel method offers several advantages: it reduces the Lipschitz constant yielding smoother models, seamlessly integrates with existing models, and boasts inherent denoising capabilities, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of adversarial perturbations. Results suggest that our approach achieves robustness comparable to adversarial training but with significantly less computational overhead. Moreover, it consistently outperforms other adversarial defense strategies on BIQA datasets, highlighting its practical effectiveness in enhancing adversarial robustness. This study underscores the potential of the Soft Thresholding Norm within the realm of IQA tasks, positioning it as a resource-efficient alternative to traditional adversarial training methodologies.},

  abstract  = {Model pruning, as an effective method for compressing large language models (LLMs), has recently attracted considerable attention in the field of natural language processing. However, existing LLM pruning methods have two main drawbacks: (1) Iterative pruning for LLMs with over a billion parameters requires retraining, which leads to significant pruning costs. (2) LLMs Pruning is formalized as a weight reconstruction problem that necessitates second-order information, incurring expensive computations. To address these issues, we propose a novel pruning method named Eplra: efficient one-shot pruning of large language models with low-rank approximation, which efficiently identifies sparse networks in LLMs. Specifically, we design a novel pruning metric based on input activations for the rapid one-shot compression of LLMs. We first incorporate input activations into the calculation of weight importance to promote precise pruning of low-priority weights. Then, we perform local weight comparisons across each output of linear layers to induce uniform sparsity. Next, we expand Eplra into semi-structured pruning patterns to accommodate various acceleration scenarios. Finally, we employ low-rank parametrized update matrices to fine-tune the pruned model, facilitating a swift recovery of model performance. Experimental results on various language benchmark datasets demonstrate that Eplra outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {With the advancement of big data, microproces-sors, and other applications, the Internet of Things (IoT) has seen significant development. Owing to the lack of necessary security defense mechanisms, IoT devices are susceptible to being targeted and controlled by attackers. They can manipu-late a vast array of IoT devices to launch DDoS attacks on the network infrastructure of a country or region, leading to serious economic losses and social security risks. Intrusion detection methods based on deep learning generally rely on numerous high-quality training instances, making it difficult to apply them to network traffic lacking sufficient labeled data. Traditional machine learning (ML) methods have limited capabilities in extracting and representing features from high-dimensional data, making it challenging to discover underlying structures and patterns in the data. To address the above issues, this paper proposes an intrusion detection system (IDS) that integrates the Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) module and the multi-Grained Cascade Forest (GcForest). By utilizing FastICA to preprocess the raw data and extract significant features, as well as improving the model&#39;s feature extraction capabilities with the aid of cascade modules. Experiments have indicated that FastICA-GcF achieves the binary classification accuracy of 99.95% on CIC-DDoS-2019, and the multiclass classification accuracy of 98.77%, outperforming existing DDoS attack detection models.},

Although it is now possible to capture driving scenes and record driving paths using a dashcam, standard civilian GPS typically has the accuracy errors ranging from 3 to 5 meters. This level of precision is in general not sufficient for the rapidly evolving ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). In this paper, we present a high-precision vehicle positioning technique based on satellite map and image data. Instead of using expensive LiDAR sensors, the proposed approach utilizes lane detection, semantic segmentation and geolocation to extract environmental features from images. A* algorithm is then adopted to refine the driving trajectory for the improvement of vehicle positioning accuracy. Furthermore, we establish an image dataset containing satellite maps and latitude/longitude coordinate information of various road scenes.

Current autonomous driving approaches can be categorized into modular approaches and end-to-end approaches. To leverage the advantages of both, we propose a method for online corner case detection that integrates an end-to-end approach into a modular system. The modular system takes over the primary driving task and the end-to-end network runs in parallel as a secondary one, the disagreement between the systems is then used for corner case detection. We implement this method on a real vehicle and evaluate it qualitatively. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end networks, known for their superior situational awareness, as secondary driving systems, can effectively contribute to corner case detection. These findings suggest that such an approach holds potential for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles.},

We explore the stimulative impact of subsidy initiatives on shared autonomous driving, focusing on consumers&#39; green preferences. By constructing a Hotelling model of A V and HV service platform competition, it analyzes the optimal solutions under three scenarios: no subsidy, subsidized AV platform, and subsidized consumers, and conducts sensitivity analysis. The study found that subsidizing A V platforms can reduce their service prices and enhance market competitiveness, while subsidizing consumers may increase their service prices but not necessarily increase market share. Policy makers should adjust subsidies as A V services develop, and may gradually cancel incentives after the industry matures. At this time, A V platforms need to improve their technology and management level to achieve sustainable development.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection holds significant importance in knowledge mining as it plays a pivotal role in selecting and preserving the most informative features within a dataset while discarding irrelevant, redundant, or noisy attributes. This process contributes to enhancing model performance, reducing computational complexity, and refining interpretability, thus facilitating more accurate and efficient data analysis. In high-dimensional datasets, the necessity for feature selection becomes more pronounced due to the heightened risk of encountering the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, this study proposes a weighted fuzzy rough quickreduct (FRQR) feature selection approach employing feature weights to handle the equal situation problem inherent in FRQR. The proposed method is evaluated on ten publicly available datasets with feature sizes ranging from 2000 to 15154. The selected features are used to train and test random forest candidate models whose estimates are then combined according to the posterior probabilities by Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The performance of the model on the selected features is evaluated on four performance metrics. The essentiality of the selected features is further determined by comparing the model classification performance achieved on the non-selected features and all the dataset features. The results indicate competitiveness in the performance metric values achieved on selected features over the other two feature categories affirming the efficacy of the proposed method.},

We deduct the quantification of human capabilities based on an established assessment and documentation procedure from occupational inclusion of people with disabilities. This allows us to quantify the delta, or gap, between a team&#39;s current capability and a requirement established by a work process. The concept is then extended to the multidimensional capability space, which then allows to formalize compensation behavior and assess required actions by the autonomous agent.},

This paper presents Success-History-based Self-adaptive Differential Evolution with a Joint Point Interaction Dimension Search (SHSADE-PIDS), an evolution-ary NAS framework that encodes discrete deep neural network architectures to continuous spaces and performs searches in the continuous spaces for efficient point cloud neural architectures. Comprehensive experiments on challenging 3D segmentation and classification benchmarks demonstrate SHSADE-PIDS&#39;s capabilities. It discovered highly efficient architectures with higher accuracy, significantly advancing prior NAS techniques. For segmentation on SemanticKITTI, SHSADE-PIDS attained 64.51% mean IoU using only 0.55M parameters and 4.5GMACs, reducing overhead by over 22-26X versus other top methods. For ModelNet40 classification, it achieved 93.4% accuracy with just 1.31M parameters, surpassing larger models.

  abstract  = {Continual Learning for Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) is designed to train models capable of adapting to evolving data by continuously introducing new entity types. This approach is crucial in dynamic environments where data evolves, such as social media, healthcare, and legal documents, necessitating the model to retain the memory of previously learned entity types while learning to identify new ones. However, due to the neural network&#39;s tendency to acquire new knowledge and forget old knowledge in continual learning and the unique non-entity type annotations in NER tasks, CL-NER faces severe catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift issues. In this paper, we propose Enhanced Knowledge Distillation and Entropy-based Adaptive Pseudo Label Weights (EDAW) to address the catastrophic forgetting and semantic drift issues in CL-NER. Specifically, we develop an enhanced knowledge distillation method that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence and feature cosine discrepancy. This method effectively minimizes the variance in output probability distributions and aligns the internal feature spaces between new and old models, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based adaptive pseudo label weight method that allows the model to assign different weights to pseudo labels with varying certainties during training, effectively alleviating semantic drift and error accumulation caused by erroneous relabeling of pseudo labels. Notably, this study pioneers the in-clusion of a Chinese dataset in CL-NER, enhancing the model&#39;s robustness and demonstrating its efficacy in a multilingual context. Experiments on fourteen CL-NER settings across four public NER datasets show that EDAW improves average Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 scores by 3.44% and 3.72%, respectively, over existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods.

Mainstream SBR efforts focus on modeling information within a session and do not use information from other sessions. Although some works try to use other session information, there are still many limitations, and how to model other session information is still a challenging task. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method for learning similar intentions between sessions, aiming to better model the recommendation information contained in other sessions. Specifically, we contribute a new model named ISIM-GNN that learns and integrates three levels of information simultaneously: (i) In the intra-session representation learning layer, we represent the session as a session graph and model it using a gated graph neural network. (ii) In the global item embedding learning layer, we use the graph attention mechanism to propagate and aggregate relevant item information from other sessions on the global graph. (iii) In the inter-session similar intent learning layer, we employ both “hard similarity” and “soft similarity” to select similar sessions, and use the attention mechanism to conduct session-level aggregation on the selected similar sessions to make better use of the inter-session collaboration information. Experiments on three real-world datasets show a significant performance improvement of our approach compared to state-of-the-art work.},

To overcome this, we introduce Apache Parquet, a column-oriented data format, into CTR tasks to improve spatial efficiency. Besides, to use in production environment, we further give some high performance implementations of Parquet training scheme. Firstly, GPU data preprocessing method is adopted in replace of original Spark based solution to generate Parquet training data and accelerate data preprocessing. Secondly, we modify data loader in TensorFlow to consume the Parquet training data with high efficiency. Experimental results show that, the size of preprocessed Criteo dataset is 95.29% smaller in comparison to TFRecord and the data preprocessing time also reduces 99.6%.

  abstract  = {To reach intuitive control of partially and highly automated machines, a smooth cooperation between both, human and machine, is necessary. A natural way to design cooperation is to use the structures of mental models already established in our minds by human-human or human-animal cooperation. These cooperation designs follow certain patterns to provide solutions in a variety of scenarios. By using interaction patterns, we form and trigger mental models in the human mind, which already uses patterns in a similar way. This paper provides a description of the structure of cooperation patterns. An exemplary pattern for the use case of control transition between a human and a driving automation is modelled based on data of an experiment of human drivers reacting to takeover requests. To use the patterns in human-machine cooperation systems, the novel concept of a pattern handler is introduced. The pattern handler can be instantiated in software and hardware, and matches the human behavior, automation actions, and environment data to cooperation patterns. Within the design phase, it helps with identifying and correcting flaws within the design.},

This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans&#39;s stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.},

  abstract  = {Existing work on stationary object recognition using WiFi CSI (Channel State Information) only leverages a single feature such as profile, category, etc. However, in many situations, objects have more than one feature. Multiple features can better reflect characteristics of objects and make them easier to recognize. This paper takes the first step toward multiple feature recognition using WiFi CSI. We propose WOLFE, a WiFi based object recognition framework using multiple features. Our framework matches features and labels by decoding CSI data and multi-label matrices into Gaussian latent spaces and aligning their distributions. By resampling in this Gaussian latent space, we can restore the corresponding label information from the samples and thereby making recognition. Our framework uses different pipelines during training and inference stages to achieve end-to-end recognition. In our experiments, we collect two indoor small-scale static object datasets. WOLFE achieves the recognition accuracy as high as 84.6% and 82.87% respectively. We also consider the scenarios of multiple objects and cross-domain to verify the universality of our framework. The accuracy rate in the multiple objects scenario is over 79%, and in the cross-domain experiment is around 80%, which is less than 4% decrease from the rates in their origin domains.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the challenges of exploration and navigation in unknown environments from the perspective of evolutionary swarm robotics. A key focus is on path formation, which is essential for enabling cooperative swarm robots to navigate effectively. We designed the task allocation and path formation process based on a finite state machine, ensuring systematic decision-making and efficient state transitions. The approach is decentralized, allowing each robot to make decisions independently based on local information, which enhances scalability and robustness. We present a novel subgoal-based path formation method that establishes paths between locations by leveraging visually connected subgoals. Simulation experiments conducted in the Argos simulator show that this method successfully forms paths in the majority of trials. However, inter-collision (traffic) among numerous robots during path formation can negatively impact performance. To address this issue, we propose a task allocation strategy that uses local communication protocols and light signal-based communication to manage robot deployment. This strategy assesses the distance between points and determines the optimal number of robots needed for the path formation task, thereby reducing unnecessary exploration and traffic congestion. The performance of both the subgoal-based path formation method and the task allocation strategy is evaluated by comparing the path length, time, and resource usage against the A * algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance.},

We propose an end-to-end visual navigation model based on deep reinforcement learning, called G2SNet, which consists of two feature maps and a specialized fusion feature network: GloVe Feature Map (GFM), Sbbox Feature Map (SFM), and GloVe fusion Network (GNet). GFM represents the position and the semantic information of the objects contained in the observation image, which addresses the issue of the interference in the target recognition caused by the complex background information in the observed image. SFM provides the object sizes in the field of view to assist the distance judgment. GNet relies entirely on network learning to compute the semantic correlations and spatial positional relationships among objects in the environment, enabling the agent to possess better generalization capabilities. This allows learning of spatial relationships between objects in GFM.

  abstract  = {Edge computing offers a groundbreaking architecture for supplying computing, storage, and networking resources to propel the Internet of Things forward. By situating them at the network&#39;s edge, this model makes computational power more accessible to users. If tasks are executed entirely at the edge, energy and resource constraints of edge nodes may lead to poor performance. Therefore, it is widely recognized that offloading certain tasks to cloud data centers (CDCs), which possess abundant execution resources, is advantageous. However, implementing CDCs is not widespread and lacks flexibility in isolated regions. This presents challenges and high costs for reliably completing tasks quickly. Consequently, employing more adaptable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as CDCs in specific scenarios is crucial. The work presents the idea of mobile edge computing supported by the UAV. By considering the needs of user services, we enhance the energy efficiency of the UAV by optimizing their trajectories, transmission power, and computational load distribution. Furthermore, the work introduces an improved algorithm called GeneticSimulated-annealing-based Particle Swarm Optimizer (GSPSO) to optimize the energy efficiency of the UAV. Experimental simulations show that regarding the energy efficiency of the UAV, GSPSO exhibits superior search efficiency, surpassing genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization by 7.39%, 15.03%, and 27.93%, respectively.},

Secondly, an algorithm for contour extraction is devised to mitigate signal interference caused by multipath effects. This algorithm enhances feature representation while reducing feature dimensionality and improving model robustness in adapting to interference and changes in various environments. By incorporating the spatial attention mechanism into the CNN model, it allows the model to focus on key areas, eliminate distracting information more effectively, better understand gesture features and shapes, and achieve more accurate recognition results.

This paper introduces a new perspective of patrolling for reactive agents using a modified form of shepherding, typically used for large-scale swarm control. Shepherding utilises the emergent attraction-repulsion behaviours of simple agents to generate dynamic interactions between two types of agents. This paper shows that these behaviours can be utilised to model the problem space of adversarial patrolling. The emergent behaviour observed in shepherding provides a basis for more complex patrolling and responses to attackers. This paper will cover the theoretical analysis of adversarial patrolling and shepherding and propose the modified model underpinning shepherding for adversarial patrolling. The defending agent utilises a simple look-ahead strategy to opt for the best behaviour combination required to complete the adversarial patrolling task. The results demonstrate that using appropriate combinations of behaviours enables the defender to keep the attackers away from areas of interest.},

  abstract  = {Defects such as scratches, patches, and cracks frequently occur during sheet metal production. However, the low detection accuracy and slow processing speed of industrial defect detection models significantly impede enterprise production efficiency. The aforementioned issues primarily manifest in three aspects. Firstly, the model complexity and computational overhead are substantial. Secondly, detecting small local defects poses a significant challenge. Thirdly, extracting global features, such as elongated scratches, proves to be difficult. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel network architecture called SATRNet. Firstly, within the model backbone, the STR module is devised. Through incorporation of the sparse self-attention method and the CNNs parallel vision Transformer model in the shallow layers, this module significantly enhances the model&#39;s capability to extract global features. Secondly, the SCATR module is designed in this paper. By substituting self-attention with the designed SCA soft attention as the token mixer, the module aims to enhance detection accuracy while reducing the number of parameters, thereby fundamentally addressing the problem of model complexity. Finally, this paper presents the GCD bottleneck convolution module. This module combines shallow and deep features, enabling the fusion of more information beneficial for detection, thereby achieving improved efficacy in capturing minute targets. Experiments demonstrate that SATRNet surpasses existing advanced models in detection accuracy on public datasets.},

To solve the above two problems, a novel consistency learning and contrastive learning-based kidney ultrasound image segmentation method (CC-Net) has been proposed. Specifically, the student-teacher model was adopted as the semi-supervised learning framework and uncertainty estimation was introduced. The Consensus Uncertainty Map (CUM) strategy was proposed to generate segmentation results for the teacher model when calculating uncertainty. To solve the problems of acoustic shadows and low image quality in kidney ultrasound images, a kidney ultrasound image data augmentation method (KUS-AUG) and a convolutional block (KUS-CONV) tailored to the characteristics of kidney ultrasound images were proposed. In addition, contrastive learning was implemented to enhance the encoder&#39;s ability to learn more semantic information, due to its inherent advantage in learning data distribution.

  abstract  = {When evaluating a learner&#39;s knowledge proficiency, the multiple-choice question is an efficient and widely used format in standardized tests. Nevertheless, generating these questions, particularly plausible distractors (incorrect options), poses a considerable challenge. Generally, the distractor generation can be classified into cloze-style distractor generation (CDG) and natural questions distractor generation (NQDG). In contrast to the CDG, utilizing pre-trained language models (PLMs) for NQDG presents three primary challenges: (1) PLMs are typically trained to generate “correct” content, like answers, while rarely trained to generate “plausible” content, like distractors; (2) PLMs often struggle to produce content that aligns well with specific knowledge and the style of exams; (3) NQDG necessitates the model to produce longer, context-sensitive, and question-relevant distractors. In this study, we introduce a fine-tuning framework named DGRC for NQDG in Chinese multi-choice reading comprehension from authentic examinations. DGRC comprises three major components: hard chain-of-thought, multi-task learning, and generation mask patterns. The experiment results demonstrate that DGRC significantly enhances generation performance, achieving a more than 2.5-fold improvement in BLEU scores.},

  abstract  = {Radar-based Human Pose Estimation (R-HPE) aims to locate the body joints of each individual in a given radar image. This is relevant for various applications such as action recognition, person re-identification, and human-object interaction. Unlike traditional RGB-based human pose estimation, radar-based human pose estimation can effectively preserve human privacy and remain stable under low-light conditions and darkness. However, research on radar-based human pose estimation is limited, and existing methods fail to adequately model radar features, resulting in lower accuracy of corresponding pose estimation algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual-branch structured network, which can extract dimension-independent features and dimension-dependent features separately and then combine them for more precise decision-making. This allows the network to learn richer and more diverse feature representations, thereby improving the quality of feature extraction. Meanwhile, a Multi-Dimensional Feature Fusion Network extracts more detailed feature representations. Furthermore, it is combined with a Transformer module to further enhance the model&#39;s ability to extract local features and global modeling capabilities, thereby improving the accuracy of human pose estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the HuPR[10] dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of human pose estimation performance.},

  abstract  = {High-performance video object tracking is pivotal for video comprehension and analysis. There exists evident temporal correlation information among consecutive video frames. Nevertheless, current methods fail to effectively leverage this temporal information, leading to inaccurate feature representation of visual targets and heightened risks of tracking failure. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel transformer-based tracker, dubbed the Video Temporal-Spatial Features and Long-term Memory (TSFLM) tracker. Firstly, the Encoder sequentially integrates multiple self-attention modules to extract spatial and temporal features, respectively. Secondly, we design a novel continuous template update module capable of preserving the long-term memory of the target template. Thirdly, we employ the long-term memory template to further augment the feature representation of the input image (search frame). Finally, the tracking results are derived through the decoder. Extensive comparative experiments against baselines on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  abstract  = {In certain specific industrial scenarios, smoking and cellphone usage are strictly prohibited behaviors. In these scenarios, it is crucial to rapidly and accurately detect smoking and cell phone usage, and promptly issue warnings, to ensure industrial safety. The detection of prohibited behaviors using computer vision has gained attention from researchers with the development of artificial intelligence. However, detecting small objects like cigarettes and cell phones in complex backgrounds and varying angles poses a challenge due to their changing shapes. In this paper, we propose a detection model called CB-YOLO, which utilizes YOLOv7 as the baseline model, for detecting smoking and mobile phone usage behavior. Firstly, we propose a new channel space pyramid network called CSPPF that pools features at different scales and introduces scale focusing on improving the perceptual ability of the network to better handle targets at various scales and locations. Secondly, we propose an enhanced feature pyramid called AWBFPN. This introduces additional learnable weight parameters to improve the model&#39;s ability to fuse multi-scale features effectively. Finally, we have also proposed a new loss function called Size-IoU. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the baseline model. Specifically, it achieves a 3.9% improvement in Precision, a 2.1% improvement in Recall, a 6.4% improvement in mAP@0.5, and a 2% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95 on the Phone_check dataset. Similarly, on the Smoking dataset, our algorithm achieves a 3.3% improvement in Precision, a 1.9% improvement in Recall, a 1.7% improvement in mAP@0.5, and a 0.3% improvement in mAP@0.5:0.95.},

Nevertheless, the system dynamics of the battery may shift to a different system when utilizing the recently suggested reconfigurable circuit, suggesting that the straightforward use of current SOC estimate techniques is not possible. In order to assess the battery&#39;s state of charge (SOC), we use a switching systems technique in this paper. We establish the supercapacitor&#39;s RC model with a reconfigurable circuit and carefully investigate the continuity of the state and observability of the switched system. Afterwards, we propose a switching observer and compare the performance of various observers, analyzing its convergence qualities. We compare the proposed observer with other observers through a hardware platform, and the experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed observer in SOC estimation.},

We analyzed 16 real-world applications built on top of two widely adopted frameworks, GTK+ and Qt. The target applications were selected due to their similarities in terms of look and feel and functionalities. We found that most of their memory allocation patterns were compatible with prevalent patterns observed in non-GUI applications. Surprisingly, on average, Qt-based applications showed allocation sizes twice larger than applications using GTK+, which underscores the significant impact of framework selection on memory allocation sizes. Two distinct patterns of allocation paths were observed in GTK+ applications and Qt applications, which indicate how these applications and the related frameworks behave in terms of memory allocations.},

In addition, reinforcement learning (RL) is used to solve optimal problems and overcome the difficult issues of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. In the controller design, dynamic surfaces are employed to avoid complex derivation issues in the virtual controller and improve operating efficiency.

Such multi-population models with competition terms result in coupled partial differential equations with integral terms and non-local boundary conditions. They represent the population density of each species at a specific time and age. In this work, a model to represent two intra-and interspecific competing populations in a bioreactor is introduced. It has two system inputs, namely the dilution rate with nutrient solution and a recycling rate which introduces biomass in a steady-state from a second bioreactor. Adding a recycling rate to the multi-population models allows for influencing not only the entire biomass in the bioreactor but also the age distribution of the bacteria. In order to use population models to develop improved control concepts for such a cascaded bioreactor experiment, an extensive steady-state analysis is carried out. There exists an infinite number of steady-states of the system in dependence of the initial condition. Each choice of that initial condition lead to uniquely determined steady-state profiles, inputs and outputs. In a next step, a stabilization around these steady-states is necessary.},

We analyzed contingent negative variation (CNV) amplitude in EEG during gait initiation and the behaviorally relevant onset time of sEMG initiation, primarily from a time-domain analysis perspective. Additionally, we employed a two-tailed t-test to compare the CNV amplitude and sEMG onset time between the two conditions (with RAS vs. without RAS). The results revealed that CNV was induced in the middle pre-frontal, frontal, central, and temporal regions under both rhythmic and non-rhythmic auditory stimulation (Non_ RAS) conditions. Significant differences in CNV amplitude were observed in the temporal region between conditions with and without RAS, with higher CNV amplitudes observed under RAS conditions.

To address this, we applied Virtual Reality technology (VR) and introduced event-oriented social anxiety dataset (EOSAD) to serve for fine-grained social anxiety level detected model. A case study (N = 44) was conducted where participants wore a Vive Pro Eye HMD to experience two types of scenes and labeled their social anxiety level accordingly. During the experiment, relevant signals and social anxiety scores were collected, including (1) behavioral signals (head and eye movements) (2) physiological signals (heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), etc.) (3) discrete social anxiety self-reported labels (4) evaluation questionnaires. We first verified the labels, and furthermore ran baseline classification experiments, where GRU model showed best accuracy: 92.84 %for binary classification.

We apply five well-known and widely used metaheuristic algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), Harris Hawk Optimisation (HHO), Driving Training Based Optimisation (DTBO), Squirrel Search Optimisation (SSO) and Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA). These algorithms are used to tune the hyperparameters of an ANN to improve sensor accuracy via calibration. In this study, data collection was conducted alongside corresponding ground truth, resulting in a comprehensive dataset suitable for various applications such as environmental monitoring and sensor calibration. A comparative analysis among the algorithms revealed that WOA consistently outperformed the other metaheuristic optimisation techniques with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. This study provides valuable insights into combining metaheuristic optimisation techniques with ANNs for sensor calibration, potentially enhancing the development of more resilient and precise sensor technologies in the future.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we learned more about quantum properties from quantum and metaheuristic algorithms after conducting many experiments. We then propose an improved version of Quantum-inspired Tabu Search (QTS), which en-hances the utilization of population information. The new version is called “Amplitude-Ensemble” QTS (AE-QTS). This makes AE-QTS more similar to the real quantum search algorithm, Grover Search Algorithm, in abstract concept, while keeping the simplicity of the algorithm. Later, we demonstrate the AE-QTS on the classical combinatorial optimization 0/1 knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the AE-QTS outperforms other algorithms, including the QTS, by at least an average increase of nearly 20% in all cases and even by 30% in some cases. Even as the problem complexity increases, the quality of the solutions found by our method remains superior to that of the QTS. These results confirm that our method has better search performance.},

Previous studies still experience performance degradation caused by anomaly concentration. To address this challenge, we propose a framework combining Transformer and score-based generative models for time series anomaly detection, named AnoGrad. The model employs an innovative Trans-former model embedded with a variational AutoEncoder to capture temporal dependencies and distribution information. For anomaly concentration issues, we design a novel conditional stochastic differential equation based on score matching and use a new Variance Hybrid process to perturb the probability density space uniformly and controllably, improving adaptation to concentrated anomalies in diverse scenarios. Besides, we design a score estimation network that takes temporal and distributional features as conditional inputs to reduce uncertainty in the time series data generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that AnoGrad achieves competitive performance, often rivaling state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by interruptions in breathing during sleep, is among the diseases with a high incidence and long-term harm. With the development of wearable devices and advancements in deep learning techniques, methods utilizing deep learning to process photoplethysmography (PPG) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals have shown significant potential in OSA detection. However, recent work fails to explicitly capture the intricate relationships within and between single modalities, the long-range dependencies of signals from different modalities, and the lack of model interpretability. Recently, graph attention neural networks have progressed in tasks related to time series, enabling better extraction of spatial features and in-terpretability. This paper proposes a time-frequency graph attention network for OSA detection to address this challenge and research gap. The proposed method uses a time-frequency feature extraction module to extract contextual dependencies between signals. It introduces a graph attention neural network to explore spatio-temporal dependencies among multi-channel signals. Experimental results on the MESA benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing deep learning-based methods in OSA detection tasks.},

  abstract  = {Choosing an appropriate representation of the environment for the underlying decision-making process of the reinforcement learning agent is not always straightforward. The state representation should be inclusive enough to allow the agent to informatively decide on its actions and disentangled enough to simplify policy training and the corresponding sim2real transfer. Given this outlook, this work examines the effect of various representations in incentivizing the agent to solve a specific robotic task: antipodal and planar object grasping. A continuum of state representations is defined, starting from hand-crafted numerical states to encoded image-based representations, with decreasing levels of induced task-specific knowledge. The effects of each representation on the ability of the agent to solve the task in simulation and the transferability of the learned policy to the real robot are examined and compared against a model-based approach with complete system knowledge. The results show that reinforcement learning agents using numerical states can perform on par with non-learning baselines. Furthermore, we find that agents using image-based representations from pre-trained environment embedding vectors perform better than end-to-end trained agents, and hypothesize that separation of representation learning from reinforcement learning can benefit sim2real transfer. Finally, we conclude that incentivizing the state representation with task-specific knowledge facilitates faster convergence for agent training and increases success rates in sim2real robot control.22Supplementary materials can be found on the project webpage: https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/igae},

Non-invasive electroencephalography was employed to record brain activity of human participants during a task, which was perturbed by disruptions from the human and machine sides. The cognitive processes were measured by using an engagement ratio (ER) and an attention ratio (AR) as physiological metrics, besides behavioral metrics.

This work proposes integrating the prediction by partial matching (PPM) technique into a tree-based virtual keyboard. We developed the Flex-Tree on-screen keyboard using a two-stage tree-based character selection system with ten commands, testing it with three degree of PPM (PPM1, PPM2, PPM3). Flex-Tree provides access to 72 English characters, including upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, and offers functionalities like the delete command for corrections. The system was evaluated with sixteen healthy volunteers using two specially designed typing tasks, including the hand-picked and random-picked sentences. The spelling task was performed using two input modalities: (i) a mouse and (ii) a portable eye-tracker. Two experiments were conducted, encompassing 24 different conditions. The typing performance of Flex-Tree was compared with that of a tree-based virtual keyboard with an alphabetic arrangement (NoPPM) and the Dasher on-screen keyboard for new users. Flex-Tree with PPM3 outperformed the other keyboards, achieving average text entry speeds of 27.7 letters/min with a mouse and 16.3 letters/min with an eye-tracker. Using the eye-tracker, the information transfer rates at the command and letter levels were 108.4 bits/min and 100.7 bits/min, respectively. Flex-Tree, across all three degree of PPM, received high ratings on the system usability scale and low-weighted ratings on the NASA Task Load Index for both input modalities, highlighting its user-centred design.},

For the analysis, there is a frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR) method to capture contact surfaces on a transparent flat plate by a camera. However, this conventional flat plate is far from the actual surfaces of care receivers because the surfaces of humans consist of curved shapes. In this paper, we propose an FTIR sensing system using a transparent curved plate to capture more ideal contact states with a surface shape more similar to the human body. We collect the contact surface data of the beginning of touching motions by Humanitude experts and novices using the FTIR sensing system with the curved and flat plates. Then, we compare the data by the experts and novices in terms of time-series contact areas and the quantitative indices and subjective evaluation and discuss the analysis results.

A camera and Aruco marker were used to capture images of the cloth and finger movements, respectively. The human strategies for flattening the cloth were modeled using a supervised regression neural network, where the cloth images served as input and the human actions as output. Before training the neural network, a series of image processing techniques were applied, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract relevant features from each image and reduce the input dimensionality. This reduction decreased the model&#39;s complexity and computational cost. The actions predicted by the neural network closely matched the actual human actions on an independent data set, demonstrating the effectiveness of neural networks in modeling human actions for flattening wrinkled cloth.},

  abstract  = {Ant selection for updating the pheromone is one most crucial operation in ant colony optimization (ACO). In this direction, this paper designs an adaptive ant selection strategy (AAS) to adaptively and dynamically select ants to update the pheromone for ACO. Therefore, a new ACO, called AAS-ACO is developed. Specifically, AAS-ACO first assigns a non-linear selection probability to each ant based on its path ranking. As a result, better ants preserve exponentially higher selection probabilities. Then, based on the selection probabilities, ants are adaptively selected for the pheromone update. By this means, on the one hand, the number of ants involved in the pheromone update is uncertain; on the other hand, relatively better ants instead of absolutely better ones are adaptively selected to update the pheromone, leading to the promotion of search diversity. Subsequently, a dynamic weighting strategy is designed to adjust the amount of the pheromone deposited by the best ant in the current iteration to enhance the search convergence. With the two schemes, AAS-ACO is expected to maintain a suitable compromise between search diversity and search convergence to seek the optimal solutions to TSP. Experiments on 10 classical TSP instances varying from 100 to 1000 cities have proven the significant superiority of AAS-ACO to 5 classic ACOs, especially on high-dimensional TSP problems.},

Along this road, this paper designs an ant selection mechanism along with a non-linear weight method for ACO to update the pheromone effectively, leading to a novel ACO, called NLW-ACO. Particularly, NLW-ACO leverages the fitness values of ants to assign each ant a selection probability. Then, it adaptively chooses ants for pheromone update. Subsequently, a nonlinear weight is assigned to each selected ant based on its fitness value to update the pheromone matrix. Resultantly, better ants have higher selection probabilities and larger weights to take part in the pheromone update. This leads to that NLW-ACO compromises search convergence and search diversity appropriately to seek for the optimum. Experiments have been carried out on 10 TSP instances of diverse scales.

Mobile edge computing offloads tasks from MDs to edge servers, saving energy and reducing network pressure. Edge servers provide closer services yet have fewer resources than cloud servers. A new heterogeneous edge and cloud computing paradigm combines the benefits of both. Edge servers provide close proximity services to MDs, while the cloud owns enough resources. The existence of mobile IoT devices makes it more practical to consider mobility when allocating resources of edge servers to decrease the energy consumption of the heterogeneous edge and cloud while meeting the latency needs of tasks. This work formulate a constrained energy consumption optimization problem and design a hybrid algorithm named Genetic Simulated-annealing-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) to yield a near-optimal solution.

  abstract  = {Dynamic Quality-of-Service (QoS) data capturing temporal variations in user-service interactions are essential source for service selection and user behavior understanding. Approaches based on Latent Feature Analysis (LFA) have shown to be beneficial for discovering effective temporal patterns in QoS data. However, existing methods cannot well model the spatiality and temporality implied in dynamic interactions in a unified form, causing abundant accuracy loss for missing QoS estimation. To address the problem, this paper presents a novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based dynamic QoS estimator namely Spatiotemporal Coupling GCN (SCG) model with the three-fold ideas as below. First, SCG builds its dynamic graph convolutional rules by incorporating generalized tensor product framework, for unified modeling of spatial and temporal patterns. Second, SCG combines the heterogeneous GCN layer with tensor factorization, for effective representation learning on time-varying bipartite user-service graphs. Third, it further simplifies the dynamic GCN structure to lower the training difficulties. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two large-scale widely-adopted QoS datasets describing throughput and response time. The results demonstrate that SCG realizes higher QoS estimation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-arts, illustrating it can learn powerful representations to users and cloud services.},

While Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) approaches share similarities with conventional NLP approaches in which language understanding is involved, the current works on CSLR usually focus on feature extraction and fusion, neglecting the language semantics, causing false positives and overfitting in gloss detection. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency-Driven Cross-Modality Transferring (CDCM) mechanism to transfer the language modality to visual modality under a consistency-driven optimization. By progressively reducing the gap between text and visual modality, we are able to stably train CSLR networks. The experiments show the efficacy of our approach, with a notable relative reduction in Word Error Rate of 6.91% on average across multiple datasets. We also demonstrate that our approach contributes corrections to suppress the false peaks on highly related and visually similar glosses while training, making glosses in semantic space distinct, thereby achieving improved overall performance.},

  abstract  = {As data volume increases and data parallelism strengthens, cloud service providers must reduce energy consumption by using effective cloud scheduling methods. This paper investigates scheduling multiple servers in cloud data centers to achieve more balanced energy consumption over the long term while ensuring task completion. We propose a method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and the African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA), combining prediction and scheduling. The proposed method is divided into two main modules: the prediction phase and the scheduling phase. The purpose of the prediction is to reserve partial resources on servers for large tasks, thereby reducing energy consumption by minimizing the number of active servers. Therefore, we use a prediction method based on LSTM to predict upcoming resource demands and anticipate server requirements. In the scheduling phase, we adjust the priority of tasks to ensure task completion while maximizing the processing of tasks with larger demands. Experiments are performed to validate the application and effectiveness of the proposed method, which outperforms the benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, distributed computing has wit-nessed widespread applications across numerous organizations. Predicting workload and computing resource data can facilitate proactive service operation management, leading to substantial improvements in quality of service and cost efficiency. However, these data often exhibit non-linearity, high volatility, and inter-dependencies across different categories, presenting challenges for accurate forecasting. Consequently, there is a critical need to develop a method that thoroughly and comprehensively analyzes all available data to forecast future trends effectively. This work proposes a novel integrated data-enhanced prediction model named SVI for achieving high-accuracy workload prediction in distributed computing systems. SVI employs the Savitzky-Golay filter and variational mode decomposition for feature processing, whose features are subsequently utilized by Informer for multivariate joint analysis of the enhanced data, achieving high-precision prediction. Ablation and comparative experiments with advanced prediction models are conducted on the Google cluster trace and other typical datasets. Realistic data-driven results indicate that SVI improves the prediction accuracy by 35.4% compared to the original Informer, with each module contributing to the performance enhancement. Furthermore, compared with Autoformer, SVI enhances the prediction accuracy of workload, CPU, and memory by 62.5%, 65.6%, and 69.1 %, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a new paradigm that improves the quality of service compared with traditional cloud computing. In MEC, computational tasks are submitted by numerous end users and are partially offloaded to edge servers or a central cloud. However, the characteristics of tasks are different from each other, and the limited resources of computational nodes are also heterogeneous, which brings great challenges to computation offloading and resource allocation for MEC. This work establishes an end-edge-cloud collaborative computing network, which consists of end devices, edge servers, and a central cloud. Task execution location and CPU running frequency determine the execution time and energy consumption to finish the tasks. Considering the aforementioned factors, a multi-objective constrained optimization problem is formulated. To solve the problem, an improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with self-adaptive crossover and mutation rates is proposed, which is called Improved NSGA-II with _Self-adaptive Crossover and Mutation (INSCM). The total execution time and energy consumption can be jointly minimized with our proposed INSCM. Numerous experiments are carried out to test the performance of INSCM. Simulation results show that INSCM effectively improves the performance of NSGA-II and surpasses random offloading and NSGA-III, which shows practical use in real-life scenarios.},

While most research concentrates on MEC facilitated by terrestrial base stations (BSs), its applicability in scenarios such as disaster rescue and field operations is limited. Efforts have been made to explore MEC assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with efficient scheduling algorithms. However, relying solely on UAVs for MEC has limitations, particularly for computation-intensive applications. This work proposes a hybrid MEC system lever-aging UAVs and BS. Multiple UAVs and a BS are deployed to provide MEC services directly from UAVs or indirectly from the BS.

To solve it, this work designs a hybrid algorithm named _S_uccess History-based parameter Adaptation for Differential volution with a Niching-based population size reduction strategy and an efficient nsemble sinusoidal scheme (SHADE-NE).

  abstract  = {Automated fault localization methods can expedite the process for developers to locate faulty code in complex software systems. Existing fault localization methods improve performance by combining the suspicious scores from different kinds of fault localization methods. Among these, the suspicious scores of mutation-based fault localization methods, commonly referred as mutation features, have been proven to effectively enhance fault localization performance. However, collecting mutation features requires generating a large number of mutants and executing test cases for each mutant, which demands sub-stantial computational resources and time. Additionally, certain code statements lack mutation features because no mutant can be generated for them, which affect the performance of fault localization. To address this, this paper proposes a Teacher and Student network-based Fault Lecalization (TS-FL) method. Firstly, a BiLSTM-based classifier is used to extract the deep semantic features of code statements, and the suspicious scores calculated by spectrum-based and mutation-based fault localization methods are used as the spectrum features and mutation features of the code statements, respectively. Then, a teacher-student network is constructed, and a mutual learning strategy is used to collaboratively train the teacher and student network, enabling the student network to learn the mutation feature information from the teacher network and thereby enhance its fault localization performance. The experimental results on Defects4J show that, without using mutation features, TS-FL can locate 36, 36, and 35 more faulty statements than spectrum-based fault localization methods Ochiai, Tarantula, and DStar, and can locate 8 more faulty statements than deep learning-based fault localization method TRANSFER-FL, in terms of Top-1.},

Current solutions primarily rely on experienced human or employ machine scheduling models. Human-machine collaboration can leverage their respective strengths, thereby enhancing decision-making efficiency and safety. Based on this, a framework for human-machine collaborative emergency management is proposed in this paper. The emergency management process is divided into two stages: task selection and task scheduling. In the task selection phase, the Human-Machine Collaborative Decision-Making Algorithm for Dynamic Tasks (HMC-DMADT) is introduced to identify key nodes and generate task lists, and humans can correct and confirm lists they do not endorse. In the task scheduling phase, the Dynamic Task Scheduling Algorithm with Human Experience-Based Constraints (HEC-ETSA) is proposed, which integrates the Action-Mask mechanism with the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm to optimize action selection, ensuring decision safety and feasibility. Finally, a simulation platform is established to conduct numerous experiments within an unmanned warehousing scenario. The results demonstrate that the proposed human-machine collaborative emergency management framework effectively addresses emergencies in unmanned warehousing operations.},

Existing methods for generating image captions do so by integrating visual encoders with language models, and by training the model using large volumes of image-text pairs. However, this approach leads to a significant increase in the model&#39;s parameter size due to the need to store extensive visual concepts and detailed textual descriptions. With substantial investments in datasets and computational resources, the quality of image caption generation has notably improved, though these advancements come at a high cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, termed ROP, that combines retrieval and detection to address this challenge. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the accuracy of the descriptions. Through the retrieval module, the model can find the k most similar sentences to the input image, utilizing this rich contextual information to enhance the overall understanding of the image content. Simultaneously, the detection module enhances the model&#39;s interpretation of fine details by identifying prominent regions within the image.

However, traditional methods based on convolutional neural networks often ignore the inherent properties of the speech spectrum, such as long-term temporal dependence, cross-frequency correlation and spatial position information, when processing speech signals. These properties are crucial to helping the model distinguish speech from noise and improve speech quality. In this paper, we propose a new speech enhancement model called CCAUNet. The core of the model is an innovative complex coordinate attention structure that can simultaneously capture and emphasize temporal dependence, frequency dependence and spatial position information in the speech spectrum. In addition, Furthermore, we employ multi-resolution STFT loss and SI -SNR loss for joint optimization of the model, thereby assisting the complex coordinate attention in accurately processing spectral features. The multi-resolution STFT loss can capture detailed information at different frequency scales, while the SI -SNR loss focuses on the quality of the speech signal. Experimental results conducted on the Deep Noise Suppression Challenge dataset show that the proposed CCAUNet outperforms all compared models on WB-PESQ, NB-PESQ, STOI and SI-SNR metrics.},

However, these approaches typically focus on aggregating neighboring feature information and overlook mining hidden structural information. Furthermore, they often append textual descriptions to entities independently without considering the semantics within specific relations. Hence, we propose the SRE-KGC model to address these challenges. First, while aggregating neighbors, we analyze and mine the hidden structure in the neighborhood from the perspective of entities and relations; then we introduced a dual-layer attention mechanism to extract the most pertinent textual information towards relations from both the relational semantic level and the neighbor semantic level respectively; finally, the two learned features are fused and sent to the decoder for scoring.

Recently, the integration of contrastive learning with GNNs has demonstrated remarkable performance in recommender systems to handle the issue of highly sparse user-item interaction data. Yet, some available graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques employ stochastic augmentation, i.e., nodes or edges are randomly perturbed on the user-item bipartite graph to construct contrastive views. Such a stochastic augmentation strategy not only brings noise perturbation but also cannot utilize global collaborative signals effectively. To address it, this study proposes a latent factor analysis (LFA) enhanced GCL approach, named LFA-GCL. Our model exclusively incorporates LFA to implement the unconstrained structural refinement, thereby obtaining an augmented global collaborative graph accurately without introducing noise signals.

The comparative studies analyze the time complexity and control performance of the proposed approach over existing methods in the aspects of setpoint tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness. The paper also quantifies the computational effort per sampling instance by considering real-time constraints and highlighting suitability for embedded systems. Simulation results demonstrate the RP-FBLS-based PID controller&#39;s efficacy in handling nonlinear dynamics while offering favorable computational performance characteristics. Experimental validations using the heating oven are provided for illustration of the practicability of the proposed method requiring computational efficiency and memory optimization.},

  abstract  = {This study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist productivity index to investigate the influence of infrastructure development on the efficiency and productivity of the agricultural sector in Bangladesh from 2021 to 2023. Focusing specifically on the sectors of irrigation, transportation, and electrical infrastructure, the research highlights how these critical elements underpin the operational and scale efficiencies across Bangladesh&#39;s seven main agricultural divisions. Through a detailed examination of efficiency change (Effch), technological change (Techch), and total factor productivity change (Tfpch), significant findings emerge regarding the differential impact of infrastructural advancements on agricultural outputs. The analysis reveals that despite some regions showing marked improvements due to infrastructure enhancements, there remains a notable disparity across divisions, underscoring the need for regionally tailored infrastructure strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the role that sophisticated infrastructure plays in augmenting agricultural efficiency, offering valuable insights for policymakers, engineers, and stakeholders engaged in infrastructure planning and development.},

In this method, the air combat features are described via the spatial trajectory curve based on the Frenet frame; the target trajectory prediction model is established by combining the GRU network with the improved multi-head self-attention mechanism by adding wavelet transform. Finally, the one-to-one within-visual-range air combat dataset obtained via the high-fidelity air combat simulator is applied to train and test the trajectory prediction model.},

However, the development of a knowledge extraction framework for human activities is fundamental. Currently, there is a lack of a unified and practical framework for modeling heterogeneous sensor data within buildings. In this paper, we propose a practical inference framework for extracting status-to-event knowledge within smart building. Our proposal includes IoT-based API integration, ontology model design, and time probability dependent knowledge extraction methods. We leveraged the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) to construct spatial relations among sensors and spaces within the building. Additionally, we utilized Apache Jena Fuseki&#39;s SPARQL server for storing and querying RDF triple data. Two types of knowledge could be extracted: timestamp-based probability for abnormal event detection and time interval-based probability for conjunction of multiple events. We conducted experiments over a 78-day period in a real smart building environment, collecting data on light and elevator states for evaluation. The evaluation revealed several inferred events, such as room occupancy, elevator trajectory tracking, and the conjunction of both events. The numerical values of detected event counts and probability demonstrate the potential for automatic control in the smart building.},

  abstract  = {Modern marine navigation places significant physical and mental demands on officers stationed on ship bridges, primarily due to the continuous observation and evaluation of real-time navigational information displayed on scattered electronic equipment. To alleviate the high cognitive load experienced by marine officers and allow them to focus on essential tasks during complex situations, the integration of head-up displays (HUDs) in marine applications has emerged as a promising solution. HUDs offer the potential to provide crucial information, enhancing the accessibility and organization of previously disordered data. However, there is limited information on the impact of HUDs on marine officers, which has been explored in the presented work. In this work, a novel immersive navigation experiment with three conditions: traditional display (NonAR), augmented reality (AR) based information presentation, and a variant of AR with essential information only (AR-Indicator) has been conducted. The objective is to explore the effects of these three conditions on navigation performance and mental workload. Our findings indicate that the AR-based information presentation, specifically the variant that includes only essential information, is preferred by participants and showed performance improvements measured by time to complete tasks, gaze duration, and pupil dilation compared to the traditional display and full AR condition. These results have an impact on the design and development of HUDs in marine-related tasks. This pilot research sheds light on the potential benefits of HUDs in improving maritime navigation and paves the way for further advancements in this field.},

Anxiety, if left untreated, can lead to various detrimental effects, such as sleep disturbances, excessive fear, and even suicidal tendencies. Traditional face-to-face therapies have been employed to address this issue; however, their effectiveness is limited by time and space constraints, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, computer-based systems have emerged as a potential solution. However, most existing relaxation systems rely on a single method and have unnatural interactions, leading to a lack of variety and engagement. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a virtual reality (VR) relaxation system that combines various relaxation techniques, a captivating storyline and natural interactions to enhance the user experience. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed system, a pilot study was conducted with 36 participants. The study utilized a between-subjects design, dividing the participants into three groups: a control group, a progressive muscular relaxation group, and a virtual reality relaxation group. The findings revealed that the virtual reality relaxation system significantly reduced anxiety levels among the participants. Importantly, this effect was observed to persist even after a period of time and was found to be more effective than using only one relaxation method in the long term. Moreover, the performance of our system is close to that of commercial systems.},

This study introduces a new approach that triggers vibratory feedback in real-time, guided by the viewer&#39;s physiological responses, aiming to amplify emotional experiences. We executed a user study involving ten participants who engaged in a treasure-hunting game. Vibratory feedback was administered to their upper bodies in instances deemed emotionally arousing, as indicated by their skin conductance responses (SCR) during gameplay. Compar-ative analysis of sessions with and without vibratory feedback revealed that vibrations significantly enhanced subjective feelings of anger and excitement. Moreover, vibrations led to a notable increase in the number of peaks and standard deviation of SCR signals, substantiating the efficacy of vibratory feedback in enriching emotional experiences. The findings affirm the potential of leveraging users&#39; physiological signals to enhance emotional responses in interactive content. This advancement holds promise for a wide range of applications, particularly in personalizing emotional experiences in dynamic scenarios shaped by user interactions.},

Most SER researches focus on ex-ploiting emotional information from global temporal or spectral features, but it may neglect detailed emotion-related information such as phonemes and syllables. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-granularity temporal-spectral representation learning (MG-TSRL) network for speech emotion recognition tasks. Specifically, MG-TSRL extracts different temporal features in phonetic, syllabic, and sentential granular-ity from spectrograms to retain more detailed emotional-related information. It then designs multilayer emotion-aware units to capture emotion-related frequency patterns and obtain deep spectrum features at each temporal granularity feature. MG-TSRL further introduces a fast broad learning system and feeds deep temporal-spectral features to it to obtain more accurate emotions. MG-TSRL gradually achieves effective temporal-spectral representation learning through multi-granularity temporal features and multilayer frequency pattern learning. The state-of-the-art results on the CASIA, RAVDESS, and SAVEE datasets are respectively 95.17%, 92.78%, and 87.50% in unweighted accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of MG-TSRL in speech emotion recognition.},

The gold -standard for neonatal seizure detection currently relies on continuous video-EEG monitoring; which involves recording multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) alongside real-time video monitoring within a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, video-EEG monitoring technology requires clinical expertise and is often limited to technologically advanced and resourceful settings. Cost-effective new techniques could help the medical fraternity make an accurate diagnosis and advocate treatment without delay. In this work, a novel explainable deep learning model to automate the neonatal seizure detection process with a reduced EEG montage is proposed, which employs convolutional nets, graph attention layers, and fully connected layers. Beyond its ability to detect seizures in real time with a reduced montage, this model offers the unique advantage of real-time interpretability.

  abstract  = {Since tokenization serves a fundamental preprocessing step in numerous language models, tokens naturally constitute the basic embedding units for generative linguistic steganography. However, tokenization-based methods face challenges including limited embedding capacity and possible segmentation ambiguity. Despite existing character-level (one tokenization-free type) linguistic steganographic approaches, they face the problem of generating unknown or out-of-vocabulary words, potentially compromising steganographic imperceptibility. In this paper, we focus on both embedding capacity and imperceptibility of tokenization-free linguistic steganography. First, we suggest that unknown words mainly result from low-entropy distributions and rigid coding rules used in candidate pools, thus we propose an entropy-based selection approach to flexibly construct candidate pools. Further, we present a lexical emphasis approach, prioritizing characters within candidate pools capable of forming in-vocabulary words. Experiments show that, across a range of high embedding rates, our approaches achieve considerably higher imperceptibility and text fluency, increase anti-steganalysis capacity averagely by 14.4%, and particularly reduce out-of-vocabulary rate averagely by 88.7%, compared to the existing state-of-the-art character-level steganographic methods.},

Existing methods, such as heuristic searches and learning-based searches, have significant limitations. Heuristic searches are complex, labor-intensive, and often lack generalizability across different network architectures. On the other hand, learning-based methods demand extensive training and pro-longed search time. To address these challenges, we introduce the Edge Classification-Based Fusion Optimizer (ECFO), a novel approach that reconceptualizes operation fusion as an edge classification problem. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for efficient graph feature encoding, ECFO streamline the optimization process and significantly reduces computational overhead. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse neural networks demonstrate that ECFO decrease search time by up to 23x and improves inference performance by 3.2%, representing a substantial advancement over existing strategies.},

In this paper, a foundation model: Lag-Llama is used to predict capacity and RUL of battery with auto-correlation analysis. Firstly, the tokenization scheme of Lag-Llama is improved by auto-correlation analysis, which calculate the most probable periods in history capacity sequence. It is helpful for model to comprehend the capacity fluctuation pattern. Then, Lag-Llama is pre-trained to learn battery capacity degradation, and thus calculate the RUL. Additionally, the model is fine-tuned with a small amount of data to update the top-level module for application to the target cell. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed model exhibits accurate RUL prediction and strong transfer capability, within the average mean square error and absolute error less than 0.035 and 9 respectively.},

  abstract  = {In the Xinjiang region of China, water is scarce and unevenly distributed, and due to factors such as global warming, extreme rainfall events occur frequently, posing serious threats to people&#39;s lives and property safety. To accurately predict short-term precipitation, we propose a Mixformer model. Specifically, we first use a combination of min-max normalization and reversible instance normalization to reduce the impact of feature numerical ranges on modeling while preserving the distribution of the original data. Next, to enhance the representation of multivariate time series data, we propose a feature mixing module. This module enhances the representation of inter-feature correlation information by calculating the correlation between different sequences, thus improving prediction effectiveness. Finally, to enhance its non-linear characteristics, we introduce a residual prediction method. This method models seasonal and trend components separately and also pays special attention to the residual component. We have validated the proposed method extensively, proving that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in this field.},

Both of their responses to automation failures are important. This paper describes the concept of adjusting the stiffness of the control stick based on the reliability of sensor systems. This helps human pilots perceive when to intervene and when to follow (just put their hand lightly on the stick) by changing the stiffness of the control stick. First, the haptic feedback design for changing the stiffness of a joystick is explained. Then, in the experiment, participants perform the task of keeping a remotely operated underwater vehicle stationary in front of a target in water stream using a joystick with three different haptic feedbacks: ours, constant high stiffness, and constant low stiffness. The experimental results indicate that our strategy increases control accuracy without increasing the human pilot&#39;s workload while allowing the human pilot to understand whether the human pilot or the automation should be currently in control of the task or action being performed. As the unexpected underwater environment adversely affects the sensor systems, our findings can be expected to play an important role in improving the control performance in the sea. Furthermore, it may inform the design of haptic feedback systems for low sensor visibility scenes.},

This research investigated the efficacy of 1mA anodal tDCS administered longitudinally on multitasking performance. 42 participants were randomly and equally divided into the experimental and placebo control conditions in this study conducted for 10 days. All participants executed two multitasking tasks on day 1 and received 1mA anodal/placebo tDCS during task training from day 2 to day 8. Various behavioral and neurophysiological measures have been measured. The findings revealed that tDCS had the propensity to augment multitasking capabilities in the trained task but had limited transfer capabilities. EEG-based brain connectivity analysis also revealed the formation of network hubs in the prefrontal and frontal regions, indicating enhanced cortical activation in the beta band. We intend to use these findings to design interventional frameworks to enhance multitasking performance using tDCS.},

However, some real-world industrial optimization problems involve numerous decision variables, known as high-dimensional problems. Current algorithms often require considerable computational resources to evaluate objective function values because of high-dimensional decision spaces. Moreover, they are also prone to be trapped in local optima. To solve the above problems, this work proposes an improved algorithm named Surrogate-assisted Multi-class Collaborative Teaching and learning optimizer (SMCT). A multi-class collaborative teaching and learning optimizer is proposed as a base optimizer to improve exploration and exploitation abilities. Furthermore, an autoencoder-assisted radial basis function is proposed as the surrogate model to replace true function evaluations, thereby saving computational resources and balancing the complexity and accuracy in fitting true models. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that SMCT surpasses its existing peers in both search accuracy and convergence speed across eight high-dimensional benchmark functions.},

  abstract  = {Breast ultrasound (BUS) image lesion segmentation is an important step in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for breast cancer screening. Due to acquiring pixel-level labels for fully supervised BUS lesion segmentation being extremely expensive and time-consuming, many studies have adopted weakly supervised methods to mitigate the reliance of models on pixel-level labels. However, in weakly supervised methods, the class activation map (CAM) often excessively focuses on the most distinctive regions of the target while overlooking other lesion parts. This limitation often leads to insufficient CAM activation and compromises the accuracy of lesion segmentation. To address this problem, we propose a weakly supervised framework for lesion segmentation on BUS images using image-level labels. Specifically, the method consists of two stages: classification and segmentation. During the classification stage, the network based on the progressive soft erase (PSE) module reduces the contribution of the most discriminative feature region in CAM, making the network focus on the features of non-dominant regions and generating more high-quality pseudo-masks. In the segmentation stage, we propose a dual-branch feature fusion (DBFF) network, which can not only capture more contextual information by fusing from different scales but also generate a more accurate segmentation mask. Extensive experiments on the publicly available dataset BUS I show the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, this model significantly supports medical education management by providing a more efficient and cost-effective approach to breast lesion segmentation.},

Thus, this paper proposes a tube model predictive control (MPC) approach to solve this problem. The nonlinear model is formulated to capture the movement of VCTS with RBD. In the prediction horizon, we linearize the model at each instant, such that the controller is calculated by solving a computationally efficient quadratic programming problem. Tubes are constructed to confine the tracking errors from linearization. Finally, experiments are carried out and relevant results show that the proposed tube MPC can operate VCTS as well as nonlinear MPC, but save by over 70% computation time.},

Our study proposes a decentralized method based on Deep Q-Networks (DQN), enhanced by Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), and applies Federated Learning (FL) for a better training process. PER, apart from being informational, aims mainly to provide an effective way to learn while on the other hand, Federated Learning relies on a centralized server to train the model using the replay memory but not at the expense of the privacy of the data during the learning process. After the trained model weights are successfully transferred to client devices, prediction can be performed locally and real-time decisions can be made as positions change. The model incorporates implicit cues presented by app context, frequency of use, and separation factors among others to estimate users&#39; privacy attitude toward location data sharing. The test resourcefulness upholds a claim to the advantages of the augmented DQN model, as shown in the results in which PER and Federated Learning contribute to accelerated convergence and the enhanced ability to absorb information. As a result, there is the utilization of numerous tools that put this power into the hands of individual users in the ongoing development of LBS, hence, a detribalization of the digital space by empowerment.},

Finally, we apply the proposal to the Zachary?s karate club network, providing a comparison analysis between the extended CIS model and the HK model.

However, most algorithms developed for adaptive optics systems predominately rely on conventional control methodologies, which often take an unexpectedly prolonged period to converge and severely hinder the feasibility of practical applications, especially in scenarios where rapid environmental fluctuations necessitate real-time control capabilities. Therefore, we propose an efficient closed-loop wavefront reconstruction method based on a novel forward prediction paradigm. The method leverages information from the current control objective, the wavefront phase, and the previous control signals (typically the voltages applied to deformable mirrors) to predict wavefront distortions and implement anticipatory control actions accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to most conventional techniques, our method can reduce the post-control RMS wavefront aberration by nearly one-third while exhibiting robustness to different types of turbulence and showing promising potential for complex multi-layer turbulence scenarios.},

However, existing TTS models face issues such as inconsistent training data quality and reliance on autoregressive models, which makes controlling the quality of audio generation challenging. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel TTS framework known as TTS-Vrefine, which is a new type of TTS architecture based on a self-feedback mechanism, aimed at enhancing the inference capabilities of the model and the quality of generated audio. The Vrefine framework iteratively refines the output, allowing the TTS system to self-train using its own generated data, significantly improving the clarity and quality of the audio. It expands the training dataset and enhances the self-optimization potential of the audio generation model, reducing the Word Error Rate (WER) of the base model by 2.4%, increasing the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) by 2.22%, and improving the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) by 4.55%. Additionally, the architecture optimizes the use of low-quality resources through a self-refinement mechanism, effectively expanding the training dataset.},

  abstract  = {Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification from remote sensing images plays a crucial role in quantifying the urban heat island effect. However, the performance of LCZ classification has not been satisfactory so far, especially for built-up area categories. To alleviate this issue, we introduce a novel network architecture, DS-LCZNET, which incorporates a Dynamic Spatial Feature Enhancement (DSFE) module for capturing complex spatial information and a SAR-MS Fusion (SMF) module to improve feature integration from SAR and MS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS-LCZNET significantly enhances classification performance, achieving a 3.55% increase in overall accuracy, a 1.18% improvement in average accuracy (AA), and a 3.88% rise in the kappa (x100) coefficient compared to the current leading baseline, MsF- LCZ-Net.

  abstract  = {Neuroscience research has demonstrated the sig-nificance of modulating stiffness during human task performance. Similarly, endowing robots with such capability is expected. However, existing methods for robot teleoperation require operators to simultaneously control position and stiffness, resulting in high workload and task inefficiency. On the other hand, learning from demonstration (LfD) offers a feasible approach for autonomously generating stiffness. Therefore, this paper proposes a robot teleoperation system that combines the advantages of teleoperation and LfD. Teleoperation enables precise positioning guided by human operators, while LfD can transfer human stiffness skills to robots. A teleoperation-oriented stiffness-adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model/Gaussian Mixture Regression method is proposed to learn human multi-dimensional stiffness and reproduce robot stiffness on a Riemannian manifold. To enhance generalization and cooperate with teleoperation, reference points and position-driven output are introduced. Furthermore, a teleoperation strategy for both the single-leader-single-follower configuration and the single-leader-dual-follower configuration are designed, which allows operators to control either one or two robot arms with a single leader device. Finally, the effectiveness of our method is verified through a plugging-in task and a continuous flipping task, demonstrating that the proposed system is capable of performing tasks that demand high positioning accuracy and stiffness adjustment.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method for report generation based on multi-feature fusion, comprising Anatomy-Aware Fusion Enhancement (AAFE) and Cross-modal Disease Representation Fusion (CDRF). This method first localizes specific anatomical structures and then models the interdependencies among anatomy-aware tokens through AAFE, achieving deep integration of global and anatomical tokens. Simultaneously, CDRF dynamically fuses cross-modal clinical indications, visual features, and disease states to obtain a high-order representation rich in visual and disease information, enabling the generator to generate fine-grained medical reports based on rich multi-feature embedding. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-modal cosine similarity loss mechanism to further promote the extraction of disease text features with anatomy-aware information. Experimental results on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing advanced models in the medical report generation task and exhibits outstanding performance.},

By utilizing the NSGA-II genetic algorithm, a chromosome path encoding scheme is constructed, treating the multi-QoS constraints of paths as a minimization multi-objective optimization within the NSGA-II algorithm. Moreover, elite solution preservation strategies are fine-tuned to procure a broader and more efficacious optimal Pareto front solution ensemble. This ensures the derivation of optimal pathways that meet multiple Quality of Service (QoS) constraints effectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively achieves load balancing in satellite network communication. Furthermore, significant improvements are observed in meeting various QoS requirements such as end-to-end latency, latency jitter, packet loss rate, and remaining bandwidth.},

The nonlinear self-optimizing CVs are simply kept constant online so that the satisfactory control performance can be achieved.

As a countermeasure, one may consider energy depots, although not in the form of bulky industrial installations that impose substantial costs themselves. This work proposes to involve a system of connected prosumer hydro plants with ponds acting as energy reservoirs to create the desirable buffer. For that purpose, a dynamic model of a hydro multi-cascade is constructed, and a cost-optimal control law is established via a formal analytical procedure. In addition to economic benefits, the proposed control policy counteracts droughts in periods of high vaporization, e.g., during sunny summer days or in arid climates. The prosumers are estimated to increase their revenue by as much as 5%, whereas the operators gain from reduced load variation on the grid.},

However, these approaches do not inherently limit the learning ability of the backbone model, which could acquire inference capabilities similar to the lightweight model, inevitably weakening the security. To counter this, we propose FakeNN, an innovative mechanism with a dual-network architecture, that intentionally guides the backbone model towards low predictive performance, thereby reducing its ability to infer sensitive information. We further improve the accuracy of the entire model by integrating a channel attention mechanism which reduces the transmission of redundant information. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that FakeNN substantially expands the performance gap between the non-secure and secure TEE models, with improvements ranging from 3.16% to 66.42% compared to MirrorNet.

  abstract  = {High-resolution and clear fundus images are essential to help physicians diagnose lesions. However, the imaging quality of acquired fundus images often has errors due to differences in operator experience and equipment limitations. To address this problem, this paper proposes a super-resolution network for retinal fundus images based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The network aims to improve the resolution of fundus images and restore fine retinal structure and lesion details. First, based on the analysis of the ophthalmic mirror system, we designed a new degradation model to simulate the effects of various unfavorable factors on fundus images, and thus constructed a batch of fundus image datasets for fundus image super-resolution work. In order to enhance the network&#39;s ability to extract local information, we introduced a texture reply block based on coordinate attention. Meanwhile, in order to capture the fundus image features at different scales, we also add a multi-scale feature extraction block to realize the fusion of multi-scale features. Experimental results show that our network is able to reconstruct high-quality fundus images, and the proposed method outperforms other super-resolution deblurring methods in both PSNR and SSIM metrics. This result provides strong support for accurate diagnosis of fundus images.},

  abstract  = {Probability calibration is a method to improve the reliability of models by linking the predicted probability to accuracy. Most research follow a static strategy of full fine-tuning. These studies do not consider dynamic data and sparse parameters in Language Models as a Service(LMaaS), leading to limited effectiveness of probability calibration. To address above issues, we propose a dynamic probability calibration algorithm (DPCA) to consider both data flow and parameter freezing. DPCA consists of streaming annotation (SA) task and dynamic calibration (DC) task. The SA task takes a specified number of samples from the training data stream. The sampled data is automatically annotated according to the deviation between predicted probability and true label. The DC task injects the probability deviation of the SA task into next training epoch through adapter-tuning. DPCA achieves data augmentation in LMaaS through joint learning of sample labels and their predicted probability deviation. This work validates DPCA through the implementation on BERT architecutre. The proposed model achieves overall performance improvement on both Chinese and English NLP tasks. Experimental results demonstrate a 2.17% decrease in average ECE without de-creasing in accuracy. Experimental analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DPCA in LMaaS.},

  abstract  = {One of the major tasks of assistive robots for future domestic applications is to bring objects requested by the user, which is called a “Bring-me Task.” Many of those previous studies including the Bring-me Task focus on the technologies to perform the task autonomously. However, object recognition, grasping, and navigation on autonomous robots are still difficult and not yet practical in a real-world unstructured environment. As an alternative approach, Bring-me Tasks by teleoperated robots have also been studied, but such systems require remote operators to perform the task for the user. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the Teleoperated Bring-me Task in which a user teleoperates a robot by him/herself and receives an object from the robot. The user wears an HMD showing a mirror-reversal image from the viewpoint of the robot. The results from the experiments on the Teleoperated Bring-me Task suggest that the proposed interface with the mirror-reversal image improved the performance of receiving the object by hand compared with the original image. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that our interface improved the operability of the robot.

As humans become more and more integrated into human-to-anything interactions, the understanding of the human as a whole becomes critical. In this paper, we conduct a structured review of the human digital twin to indicate where modern paradigms fail to model the human agent. Particularly, the mechanistic viewpoint limits the usability of human and general digital twins. Instead, we propose a novel way of thinking about models, states, and their relations: Perspectives-Observer-Transparency. The modelling paradigm indicates how transparency - or whiteness - relates to the abilities of an observer, which again allows to model the penetration depth of a system model into the human psyche. The split in between the human&#39;s outer and inner states is described with a perspectives model, featuring the introperspective and the exteroperspective. We explore this novel paradigm by employing two recent scenarios from ongoing research and give examples to emphasize specific characteristics of the modelling paradigm.},

However, resource allocation and task offloading present big challenges due to the competition among mobile devices (MDs) for communication and computing resources of edge servers. Therefore, it is significant to properly offload MDs&#39; tasks to edge servers or the cloud. This work proposes a collaborative edge-cloud architecture, including a centralized cloud, edge servers, and MDs. Then, this work jointly considers computing power, task sizes, computing resources, transmission power of MDs, transmission rates, computing power, transmission power, computing resource of edge servers, and computing resource of the cloud. Considering the abovementioned factors, this work designs a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. To solve it, a Genetic Simulated annealing-based Particle Swarm Optimization (GSPSO) algorithm is proposed to obtain the best solution. Building upon it, this work proposes an energy-minimized task offloading and resource allocation strategy, thereby minimizing the system&#39;s energy consumption while ensuring strict task response time limits. Experimental results show that GSPSO reduces the system&#39;s energy by 66.34%, 34.65%, and 4.95% more than particle swarm optimization (PSO), self-adaptive PSO, and Tyrannosaurus optimization.},

Most existing approaches explore the intricate temporal patterns hidden in a DWDG from the purely data-driven perspective, which suffers from accuracy loss when a DWDG exhibits strong fluctuations over time. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel Extended-Kalman-Filter-Incorporated Latent, Feature (EKLF) model to represent a DWDG from the model-driven perspective. Its main idea is divided into the following two-fold ideas: a) adopting a control model, i.e., the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), to track the complex temporal patterns precisely with its nonlinear state-transition and observation functions; and b) introducing an alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to train the latent features (LFs) alternatively for precisely representing a DWDG. Empirical studies on DWDG datasets demonstrate that the proposed EKLF model outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for missing edge weights of a DWDG. It unveils the potential for precisely representing a DWDG by incorporating a control model.},

Additionally, advancements in robotics technology have enabled widespread collaborative operations among multiple autonomous mobile robots. Since the 1980s, there has been active research on improving the efficiency of coordinated actions by multiple autonomous mobile robots using Multi-Agent Robot Systems (MARS) (Cao et al.; 1997, Yan et al.; 2013, Ismail and Sariff; 2019). This study focuses on robots that transport cargo within a warehouse and aims to develop learning methods for effective division of labor among multiple robots. In large and complex environments, agents need to undergo extensive repetitive learning to make appropriate action choices solely through machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning. Traditional multi-agent methods like QMIX (Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning) (Rashid et al.; 2020) and MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) (Lowe et al.; 2017) require substantial computational time for environmental exploration, presenting a significant challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-tiered learning model that separates overall optimization, such as establishing a general procedure for task performance, from individual optimization based on local situational judgments. Additionally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a simulation system tailored to the target environment is constructed, and simulation analysis based on this system is conducted.},

Some methods have been proposed to enhance text prompt by incorporating image prompts. While they have shown effective improvements, they either require substantial fine-tuning costs or struggle to effectively integrate text and image information. In our study, we delve into the issue of the difficulty in integrating text and image information in decoupled cross-attention and conduct visual analysis. We identify the presence of background-related tokens in image features as a key factor affecting text fidelity. To address this issue, we develop an algorithm to filter out these tokens. Additionally, we observe differences in the attention of Unet layers to text prompts and image prompts. Based on this finding, we optimize the flow of image information to reduce interference with text information. In summary, we introduce a new topic-customized method that requires no repeated training. It trains a plug-and-play image prompt adapter with only 417M parameters, lightweight yet powerful, surpassing existing models in both text and image consistency.

  abstract  = {In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Language Models (LMs) are widely applied in tasks such as text classification, machine translation, and knowledge reasoning. However, the defects of LMs make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks, resulting in substantial economic losses. Adversarial examples can effectively expose vulnerabilities of LMs and be used for adversarial training to improve the robustness of the models. Existing methods mostly generate adversarial examples by first selecting important tokens and then adding perturbations to them. Such methods require a large number of queries to the victim model, which is not applicable in scenarios where the query budget is limited. To address the imperative demands for more query-efficient adversarial example generation, this paper presents CBAPB, a Classification Boundary Adjacent Perturbation and Back-track based textual adversarial attack method, which initially introduces coarse-grained perturbations at random positions while preserving the original semantics of input examples until they reach the similarity threshold. Subsequently, fine-grained perturbation backtracking is conducted on all successfully misclassified examples to minimize perturbation magnitudes. We conduct multiple experiments on the Yelp Reviews, AG News, and DBpedia datasets by employing BERT as the victim model. Comparative analysis against baselines reveals that CBAPB requires merely 3.2% of the average query times of these baselines, while increasing the attack success rate by 7.6%, with only a slight decrease of 1.5% in textual similarity.

  abstract  = {To enhance the flexibility of port horizontal transportation systems and improve the smoothness, accuracy, and efficiency of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) motion in high-frequency disturbance environments, a longitudinal and lateral hierarchical formation control strategy for AGVs based on angle and velocity tracking is proposed. Based on the leader-follower formation control model, an AGV control system is designed, comprising a lateral controller for Sliding Mode Control (SMC) based on angle tracking and longitudinal controllers for SMC and Proportion Integration (PI) based on velocity tracking. To address the impact of high-frequency disturbance signals in the port environment, a first-order Low Pass Filter (LPF) is designed to enhance the robustness of the AGVs formation control system. Finally, tests were conducted in a combined simulation environment using Simulink and Trucksim, focusing on typical operational conditions for empty AGV formations. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the robustness of the port AGV control system.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection is a demanding and costly endeavor within the realms of machine learning and data mining, targeting the elimination of irrelevant and redundant features. This endeavor significantly bolsters classification accuracy or other post processing components, such as search or clustering. In this context, the feature selection can be as a single-objective optimization task, with the primary objective of maximizing classification accuracy or multi-objective one while minimizing the number of selected features as well which can be tackled using population-based metaheuristic algorithms. Considering that feature selection (FS) inherently poses a binary problem, given that most metaheuristic algorithms operate in continuous domains (such as Real-coded GA, DE, PSO, and CMA-ES), transitioning them to binary search spaces necessitates substantial operator modifications. One of the crucial steps of the population-based algorithms is initialization of the population which significantly impacts both the convergence speed and the quality of the final solution. However, in most cases, especially with continuous algorithms, random initialization emerges as the predominant method for generating candidate solutions (initial population) which lacks diversity in the large-scale feature selection search spaces. In this paper, two novel population initialization methods within the continuous search space are introduced, followed by a comparative analysis against the traditional random initialization method. Experimental results conducted on ten datasets with 300 to 11,000 features demonstrate the effectiveness of population-level uniform initialization, surpassing the widely recognized individual-level uniform initialization method. The experiments are conducted using Differential Evolution as the single-objective algorithm and Generalized Differential Evolution3 as a multi-objective algorithm as our case studies. This study demonstrates the crucial role of initialization in the population-based optimization algorithms when they tackle binary problems.},

  abstract  = {Recently, significant progress has been made in image-based virtual try on systems, but their recent advances have mainly focused on upper-body cloths at the expense of lower-body cloth try on. Problems such as the complexity of leg poses and inappropriate regularization parameters lead to the remaining challenges in virtual try on of lower-body cloths. Here, we propose a novel lower-body virtual try on network called LB-VTON, which synthesizes realistic images given images of the wearer and the target cloth. To better preserve cloth and body features, LB-VTON employs a four-stage design strategy. First, it preprocesses the image to delineate body parts and cloth regions using methods such as human parsing. Secondly it uses a regression network approach to improve the resolution and fidelity of the try on images by estimating the parameter L of the thin-sheet spline transform using second-order differential constraints derived from actual mesh data. In the third step, to overcome the problem of fabric blurring and texture loss, it employs a generative adversarial training strategy that seamlessly merges the deformed cloths with the target model by utilizing the U-Net architecture as the generator and the enhanced DC-GAN as the discriminator. Finally, all images are zoomed to higher resolution $(768\times 1024)$ using Real-ESRGAN super-resolution technique. In addition, we present a novel lower body cloth try on dataset - the first of its kind specifically designed to improve the accuracy of lower body cloth try on. Experiments with this method on CP-VTON and its dataset show that the results produced by LB-VTON are significantly better than existing methods.},

However, currently prevalent Shapelet classification methods primarily focus on numerical data, neglecting the common occurrence of categorical feature variables in practical applications. Additionally, existing multivariate time series classification algorithms exhibit short-comings in executing classification tasks following the Shapelet discovery process. Inspired by association rule mining, this paper proposes an innovative Shapelet classification algorithm aimed at addressing both numerical and categorical data in multivariate time series. This algorithm employs a unified representation method to effectively integrate categorical and continuous features, while enhancing existing time series Shapelet discovery methods by independently calculating Shapelets for each variable, making them more suitable for association rule mining. Leveraging the discovered Shapelets and Allen&#39;s interval relations, the algorithm constructs temporal relationships among multivariate time series Shapelets, enabling the discovery of frequent patterns and the completion of classification tasks. This study aims to fully leverage the interpretability of time series Shapelets, revealing hidden temporal patterns within time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms existing benchmark algorithms for multivariate time series classification in terms of accuracy, while exhibiting significant interpretability advantages.},

Different from the existing F-C control research, the formation problem is solved by the individual IT-2 fuzzy tracking controller of each leader. As a result, the information communication between leaders, who are farthest from each other, is needless. Moreover, other valuable functions such as the avoidance of known obstacles and time-varying formation can also be accomplished by designing the proper target trajectories for the tracking of leaders. By virtue of the IT-2 T-SFM, the analysis methods for linear Multi-Agent Control Systems (MACSs) can be utilized to solve the containment analysis problem, which is caused by the leaders&#39; control input. Finally, the simulation results of multiple ASs are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the IT-2 fuzzy controller design approach in the F-C problem.},

This paper proposes an optimal modeling method for open circuit voltage hysteresis based on the Prandtl-Ishlinskii model and an associated parameterization method. First, an asymmetric operator with cubic envelope functions is designed to enhance the classical Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, which originally features a symmetric and linear operator. This modification enables the proposed model to accurately capture intricate hysteresis. Second, a hierarchical parameterization method is proposed to identify optimal parameters. Specifically, an improved grey wolf optimizer is employed to determine the operator-related parameters. Then, the remaining parameters are calculated using the least squares algorithm, enhancing computational efficiency. Finally, the proposed model is validated on the experimental hysteresis data from three distinct scenarios. The modeling error of the proposed model decreased by 66.57 % and 32.51 % compared with two other benchmark models.},

Another key idea is to utilize the similarity of representations between models to correct for local training, which reinforces intra-class compactness and inter-class distinction and reduces model variability through knowledge distillation from the global to local models, combined with contrastive strategies.

Specifically, all users&#39; historical interaction sequences are utilized to simulate the potential evolution trend of user interests. In this process, we set neighbor window size and use the position interval size between pairs of co-occurring items to adjust the weight between them, and design an adaptive strategy to fuse high- and low-order global information, enriching with highly relevant items while expanding high-order correlations. In addition, relative position interval information is used as the key factor to capture users&#39; multiple interests, so as to highlight the content that users are more concerned about recently.

  abstract  = {From search engines like Google to advanced applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation integrating Large Language Model (LLM), Information Retrieval (IR) serves a crucial role. To facilitate the development of increasingly large and complex code program projects, researchers introduce IR systems into the code domain. Unfortunately, although IR systems achieve significant success in retrieving natural language corpus and query, they face challenges when tasked with retrieving corpus consisting of code sequences. Primarily, in practical applications, most code sequences lack corresponding natural language annotations, which are known as low-resource scenarios, hindering the training of neural network-based retriever in IR systems. Furthermore, modern IR systems often overlook the structural features of code sequences, which may be beneficial for understanding these sequences. Additionally, the length of most code sequences exceeds that of equivalent natural language expressions, complicating the processing of relationships between code and natural language sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel IR system CSFIR, which leverages Code-Speclflc Features to augment IR. For the prevalent issue of unlabeled code sequences in low-resource scenarios, we employ a supervised fine-tuned LLM as a generator to generate natural language queries for unlabeled code sequence. Subsequently, we extract structural features from the abstract syntax tree of code sequence using graph convolution networks and integrate these features to enhance the original retriever. Finally, given the adverse effects of lengthy code sequences on generators, we propose a subtree segmentation algorithm, which reduces the length of code sequences without compromising their original meaning, thereby enhancing the quality of queries generated by the generator. We conduct comparative experiments to ascertain the efficacy of our method. Regarding Recall@100, our CSFIR system improves from 90.12 in a traditional IR system to 96.18.

  abstract  = {In this study, we address the secure model predictive control (MPC) problem for a system comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Our objective is to cooperatively regulate the UAV -UGV system to maintain all states at equilibrium in spite of physical constraints, external disturbances, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on communication channels. We propose a dynamic event-triggered distributed MPC (DET-DMPC) approach. Initially, a robustness constraint is integrated into the MPC to incrementally confine system states within a progressively narrowing tube, thereby bolstering disturbance resilience. Additionally, we introduce a neighbor output sequence prediction mechanism (NOSPM) to mitigate packet loss due to DoS attacks. In response to the varying durations of DoS attacks, we have developed a DET mechanism equipped with adaptive triggering thresholds. Moreover, we have formulated sufficient conditions that ensure the recursive feasibility of the DMPC algorithm and the stability of the UAV-UGV system. Comparative tests demonstrate the proposed DET-DMPC&#39;s superiority in robustness and security.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel and cost-effective approach for structural health monitoring using smartphones. By using built-in accelerometers, smartphones can collect data on building motion, facilitating the detection of potential damage. Traditional methods often rely on classification techniques, requiring extensive training data encompassing both damaged and undamaged scenarios. However, this proves impractical for smartphones due to their limited computational resources for complex classification tasks. We propose a paradigm shift, transforming the classification problem into a regression problem. This enables robust structural health assessment using a neural network specifically designed for this purpose: the echo state network (ESN). ESNs offer inherent robustness to noise and perturbations, making them ideal for real-world applications with sensor data. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed smartphone-based system offers significant advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness, and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through several experiments, demonstrating its capability in identifying structural damage.},

  abstract  = {Steel is an indispensable raw material in the industrial field, steel surface defects seriously affect the quality of steel, in recent years a lot of research has been carried out on the detection of steel surface defects. Existing steel defect detection methods are unable to fully mine the underlying feature information of the target image and do not achieve a dynamic balance between accuracy and speed. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an optimised target detection algorithm based on YOLOv8. First, we proposed the DMCA module, which combines the ideas of deformable convolution and multi-channel self-attention mechanism. We developed a strengthen self-attention module to enhance the process of deformable convolutional generation of offsets, so that the model can better adapt to the complex shapes of different defective targets and extract features at a deeper level. Secondly, using the idea of LKA (Large Kernel Attention), we propose the LF-MSPP lightweight module with long-range dependence and adaptive capability to capture the tele-relationships with small computational cost and parameters, improved the problem of missing defective feature information. Finally, we replaced the head of the original YOLOv8 with a Dynamic Head and used the split attention mechanism to improve the head detection capabilities while ensuring lightweight. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used Northeastern University steel defect dataset NEU-DET. Experimental results show that the improved model improves mAP@50, mAP@50-95, AP and AR indicators by 2.4%, 2.0%, 6.1%, and 3.4% respectively compared with the original YOLOv8 model, and the number of model parameters is reduced by 11.2%. The improved model is also better than mainstream defect target detection models such as SSD, Retinanet, FasterRCNN, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, etc, and can better meet the accuracy and speed requirements of actual industrial production for steel surface defect detection models.},

  abstract  = {Within the context of intelligent manufacturing, industrial robots have a pivotal function. Nonetheless, extended operational periods cause a decline in their absolute positioning accuracy, preventing them from meeting high precision. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel robot algorithm that combines an adaptive and momental bound algorithm with decoupled weight decay (AdaModW), which has three-fold ideas: a) adopting an adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm to achieve a high convergence rate, b) introducing a hyperparameter into the Adam algorithm to define the length of memory, effectively addressing the issue of the abnormal learning rate, and c) interpolating a weight decay coefficient to improve its generalization. Numerous experiments on an HRS-JR680 industrial robot show that the presented algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in robot calibration performance. Thus, in light of its reliability, this algorithm provides an efficient way to address robot calibration concerns.},

  abstract  = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term referring to several heart or blood vessels abnormality. Heart failure (HF), directly associated to (CVD), is a significant global health problem as well as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. The early detection of this condition is crucial for patient health. Traditional diagnostic methods for HF, such as history taking and physical examination, are often insufficient and require the use of advanced techniques such as Electrocardiogram (ECG). This study aims to extract temporal and morphological features from (ECG) signals and compare different Machine Learning (ML) classification models to enable rapid diagnosis and provide interpretable predictions. Specifically, we propose a Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM) model that can discriminate Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) and Arrhythmia (ARR) with a high accuracy of 0.99, achieving a Precision of 1.00, Recall of 0.99, and f1-score of 0.99 in the (NSR) class, and Precision of 0.99, Recall of 1.00, and f1-score of 0.99 in the (ARR) class, respectively. In addition, eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analysis is performed to explain the model predictions.},
