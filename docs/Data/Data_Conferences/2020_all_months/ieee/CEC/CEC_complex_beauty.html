  abstract  = {Antibiotic resistance is one of the major challenges that we are facing today. The frequent overuse of antibiotics is one of the main reasons for the development of resistance. A mathematical model of bacterial population dynamics is used, where drug administration and absorption mechanics are implemented to evaluate the fitness of automatically designed treatments. To maximise the probability of curing the host while minimising the total drug used we have explored treatments with different daily dosages and lengths. Two multi-objective population-based methods, a well-known evolutionary algorithm and a particle swarm optimisation algorithm are tuned and contrasted when solving the posed treatment design problem. The best solutions found by our approach suggest treatments ranging from five to seven days with a high initial dose, followed by lower doses, use lower amounts of the drug than the standard common practice of fixed daily dosages over ten days.},

  abstract  = {The Internet has resulted in cyber-threats and cyber-crimes, which can occur anywhere at any time. Among various cyber threats, modern malware with applied metamorphosis and polymorphic technology is a concern as it can proliferate to advanced variants from its original shape. The typical malware analysis methods, including signature-based approach, remain vulnerable to such advanced variants. This paper proposes a visualization-based approach for malware analysis using the state-of-the-art Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model such as ResNeXt, which had achieved outstanding performance in image classifications with competitive computational complexity. The proposed method transforms the attributes of raw malware binary executable files to greyscale images for further analysis by well-established deep learning models. The greyscale images, which result of data transformation for visualization, are classified using ResNeXt. The experiment results show that the proposed solution achieves 98.32\% and 98.86\% of accuracy in malware classification on Malimg dataset and modified Malimg dataset, respectively. The proposed method outperforms other comparable methods in terms of classification accuracy and requires similar level of computational power.},

  abstract  = {Virtual network embedding (VNE) is the key technology in network virtualization and has been proven NPhard. The purpose of VNE is to find the optimal mapping of virtual nodes and links, and minimize the utilization of resources. However, many particle swarm optimization approaches to VNE separate VNE into two independent subproblems (i.e., node mapping and link mapping) and ignore the coordination between node mapping and link mapping. In this paper, a one-stage and dual-heuristic particle swarm optimization (DH-PSO) is devised to solve VNE. To coordinate node mapping and link mapping, firstly, DH-PSO updates positions of particles step by step, and nodes and links are mapped in one stage. Secondly, DH-PSO devises the dual-heuristic strategy to further improve the optimizing capability. The first heuristic strategy is to construct a candidate set and the second strategy is to find the best solution from the candidate set. Hence, not only the network resources but the network paths are taken into account to construct solutions. DH-PSO can be combined with different two-stage approaches to become one-stage. DH-PSO is experimentally studied on different instances. The experimental results verify that the proposed DH-PSO is promising.},

  abstract  = {Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph embedding. They map the nodes of the graph into the low dimensional vectors by aggregating the neighbor nodes&#39; features information. However, most existing GCNs only focus on the homogeneous information networks instead of the heterogeneous information networks (HINs) with multiple types of nodes which are more common in the real world. Because the different types of neighbor nodes could have different impacts on the target nodes, it is difficult to manually design a proper neighbor nodes&#39; features information aggregating weights. To address this problem, we propose a novel HINs embedding algorithm based on the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm and the graph convolutional network (GCN), called BSOGCN, which utilizes BSO to optimize the neighbor nodes&#39; features information aggregating weights. It can be applied to the various HINs under various scenarios without any prior knowledge. The proposed method has been evaluated on both inductive and transductive node multi-class classification tasks on three real-world HINs datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that BSOGCN is competitive against other state-of-the-art methods.},

The starting assumption is that the differential equations governing the motion of an observable object are incomplete and do not allow a correct prediction of the future state of that object. Symbolic regression, making use of Genetic Programming (GP), coupled with a sensitivity analysis-based parameter estimation, is proposed to reconstruct the missing parts of the dynamic equations from sparse measurements of position and velocity. Furthermore, the paper explores the effect of uncertainty in tracking measurements on the ability of GP to recover the correct structure of the dynamic equations. The paper presents a simple, yet representative, example of incomplete orbital dynamics to test the use of symbolic regression.},

  abstract  = {When dynamic multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (DMOEA) are used to solve real world problems, these are not only required to be able to find the Pareto-Optimal Set (POS) quickly, but also the results obtained can be easily used by decision makers. The classic DMOEAs have much room for improvement in both aspects. Recently, the transfer learning based DMOEAs have been proved that these methods can significantly improve the quality of the solution, but there are still too many individuals in the POS obtained by these algorithms. The resulting problems are twofold: this not only consumes a lot of computing resources to those solutions that will not be used, but also makes it more difficult for decision makers to choose. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm which combines knee solutions with transfer learning method, and the feature of the proposed method is that it only outputs a very small number of solutions, which can greatly improve the efficiency of decisionmaking. The proposed algorithm divides the whole decision space into different subspaces, and find a local knee solutions in each subspace, then a transfer learning framework, Tr-DMOEA, is used to predict the knee solutions of the optimization problem at the next moment by using the local knee solutions and a global knee solution. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our design.},

The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel model of neural network based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and utilizing one of the most powerful evolutionary algorithms, namely the Differential Evolution (DE), to forecast the next day&#39;s stock price of a company. This study focuses on optimizing the ten network hyperparameters related to the detection of temporal patterns of a given dataset, namely, the size of the time window, batch size, the number of LSTM units in hidden layers, the number of hidden layers (LSTM and dense), dropout coefficient for each layer, and the network training optimization algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that all this set of parameters have been optimized simultaneously. Then, the LSTM has been optimized by DE to gain the lower root mean squared error (RMSE) for prediction. The proposed model achieved 8.092 RMSE as its objective value, which is better in comparison with the best statistical forecasting models such as NAIVE, ETS, and SARIMA, which are the-state-of-the-art methods in this filed. Moreover, for shortening the training time as the main source of computational expensiveness, the proposed method works with a lower number of epochs. By this way, DE tries to find a shallower and faster network even with higher accuracy, which is a remarkable approach.},

This paper introduces the orthogonal array-based initialization of population and neighborhood search strategy in LSHADE (linear population reduction technique in success history based adaptive differential evolution) algorithm to solve the CEC2020 competition problems. In the novel algorithm, named as O-LSHADE, a large number of population members have been initialized in the search space using the orthogonal design. Thereafter, a small Euclidean neighborhood is defined for each member in the population. The adaptive mutation and crossover are performed within the neighborhood during first phase, i.e., predominantly exploration phase of the algorithm. The process ensures that the search space is adequately explored by the algorithm as the neighborhoods are not mixed and each neighborhood performs the mutation and crossover operations independently. At a later stage of the algorithm, a step reduction in population is done to perform the operations like an adaptive differential evolution. The proposed algorithm is found efficient, effective and robust when applied to the CEC2020 benchmark problems for single objective bound constrained optimization. In most cases, the algorithm could achieve the best error value of less than 100. This implies that the method could guide the search process towards the global basin.},

The expected value contains not only objective values of searched solutions but also objective values of new probe solutions and computation costs invested in each subspace. This makes it possible for the proposed algorithm to dynamically adjust the computing resources invested in each subspace during the convergence process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with four state-of-the-art search algorithms; namely, jSO, EBOwithCMAR, ELSHADE-SPACMA, and L-SHADE-RSP, for solving 30 CEC 2017 benchmark functions.

Modules are only considered if they are prevalent in the population and they are seen to have a positive effect on an individual&#39;s fitness. This is achieved by finding the covariance of an individual&#39;s fitness with the presence of a particular subtree in the overall expression.While there are many successful systems that dynamically add modules during Genetic Programming (GP) runs, doing so is not trivial for Grammatical Evolution (GE), due to the fact that it employs a mapping process to produce individuals from binary strings, which makes it difficult to dynamically change the mapping process during a run.We adopt a multi-run approach which only has a single stage of module addition to mitigate the problems associated with continuously adding newly found functionality to a grammar. Based on the well-known Price Equation, our system explores the covariance between traits to identify useful modules, which are added to the grammar, before the system is restarted. Grammar Augmentation through Module Encapsulation (GAME) was tested on seven problems from three different domains and was observed to significantly improve the performance on 3 problems and never showing harmful effects on any problem. GAME found the best individual in 6 of the 7 experiments.},

Experimental results for data on 434 polymers and 1,441 glasses show that both gradient and evolutionary learning approaches have their advantages.

  abstract  = {This paper presents an application of Evolutionary Computation (EC) to the benchmark of the safety isolating transformer problem. The benchmark adopts multidisciplinary optimization strategies, namely the multidisciplinary feasible (MDF) and the individual discipline feasible (IDF) formulations. The benchmark meets the requirements of engineers and scientists working with machine design problem, such as in the first part of the design process that is the choice of structure and materials. The EC methods employed in this paper are based on Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), namely two variants of Differential Evolution (DE), two variants of Hybrid Adaptive DE (HyDE) and the Vortex Search (VS). The results showed in this paper suggest that EA methods are competitive with the classical optimization method, the sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Among the developed EAs, HyDE-DF is able to obtain better values than SQP on a significant battery of trials.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) need intensive tuning of their configurations such as network structures and learning conditions. The tuning is a type of black-box optimization problem where evolutionary algorithms are applicable. A distinctive property in evolutionary optimization of DNN configurations is that there is a double structure in the optimization; the evolutionary algorithm optimizes a chromosome representing the DNN configuration while an individual DNN with the configuration learns from training data typically by back-propagation. With an aim to obtain better-optimized DNNs by evolutionary algorithms, we propose a dual inheritance evolution strategy based on an analogy to human brain evolution where gene and culture co-evolves. The proposed method is an extension of a conventional evolution strategy by introducing an additional pass to directly propagate culture or knowledge from ancestor DNNs to descendant DNNs by integrating teacher-student learning. We apply the proposed method to the automatic tuning of an end-to-end neural network-based speech recognition system. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces a smaller model with higher recognition performance than a baseline optimization based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES).},

Three aspects including the average distance from passengers to city air terminals, the maximum tolerable path length, and the maximum terminal volume are considered. Then, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed. In the method, the ripple-spreading algorithm is applied for solving the many-to-many path optimization problem and a genetic algorithm is used for locating city air terminals. In order to improve the performance and increase the convergence speed, a self-adaptive genetic algorithm is further developed, varying the genetic operations and the number of generations according to the current convergence status.

Researchers are building detection algorithms with an aim for high accuracy as this will have a massive impact on the prevailing social and political issues. A shortcoming of existing strategies for identifying fake news is their inability to learn a feature representation of multimodal (textual+visual) information. In this paper, we present a novel approach using a Cultural Algorithm with situational and normative knowledge to detect fake news using both text and images. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out on real-world multimedia datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter.

The regular expressions are autogenerated by a constructive heuristic method and optimized using a Pool-based Simulated Annealing (PSA) approach. Although existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) methods present high-quality performance in most Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, the solutions are regarded as uninterpretable “black boxes” to humans. Therefore, rule-based methods are often introduced when interpretable solutions are needed, especially in the medical field. However, the construction of regular expressions can be extremely labor-intensive for large data sets. This research aims to reduce the manual efforts while maintaining high-quality solutions. The Pool-based Simulated Annealing method is proposed to automatically optimize the performance of machine-generated regular expressions without human interference. The proposed method is tested on real-life data provided by one of China&#39;s largest online medical platforms. Experimental results show that the proposed PSA method further improves the performance of initial machine-generated regular expressions compared with other meta-heuristics such as Genetic Programming. We also believe that the proposed method can serve as a vital complementary tool for the existing machine learning approaches in text classification applications when high levels of interpretability of the solutions are required.},

To address this, we explore whether machine-learning models can be improved by augmenting training data-sets with samples of potential variants. These variants are generated using an evolutionary algorithm that evolves a behaviourally diverse set of mutants, optimised to avoid detection by a large set of existing detection-engines. Using features calculated from the behavioural trace of a sample as input, we evaluate the ability of five machine-learning methods to detect the new variants, show that the detection rate is considerably improved by including the new samples as training data, and that the classifiers still generalise over a range of malware. We then repeat this experiment using a sequence-based deep-learning method as the classifier, which is shown to out-perform the feature-based classifiers.},

The paradigm of multitask optimization has been investigated over two decades, which aim to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a novel multitasking framework based on multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Specifically, we use a single population to simultaneously perform multiple subset selection tasks and apply it to a specific scene-the endmember selection of hyperspectral images. It is natural to consider that pixels in a homogeneous region of hyperspectral image as a task. Then, a within-task and between-task genetic transfer operator is constructed to reinforce the exchange of genetic material belonging to the same or different tasks for better and quicker search of the decision space. After that, this algorithm obtains a set of nondominated solutions for better decision of the active endmembers. Experiments on hyperspectral datasets show the effectiveness of our method in finding the real active endmembers.},

  abstract  = {Image thresholding is a crucial image processing task. Most of the time, it plays a pivotal role in an image processing chain, therefore, any error in image thresholding can propagate to other steps such as edge detection, area/volume estimation, or object recognition. Multi-level image thresholding is a popular method for image segmentation, dividing an image into homogeneous regions. Conventional algorithms are timeconsuming due to utilising an exhaustive search, especially when the number of threshold levels increases. On the other hand, population-based metaheuristic algorithms have been successfully applied to this problem. In this paper, we propose a center-based differential evolution (DE) algorithm for high-dimensional multilevel image thresholding (many-level image thresholding). While DE has been shown to yield satisfactory performance for various real-world optimisation problems, in our algorithm, DE is further boosted with a center-based sampling strategy. We evaluate our algorithm on a set of benchmark images on high-dimensional search spaces and with regards to an entropy-based objective function and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve upon the performance of other metaheuristic image thresholding techniques.},

The proposed algorithm has been named as CSsin and it employs four major modifications, i) new techniques for global and local search are devised, ii) dual search strategy is followed to enhance exploration and exploitation properties of CS algorithm, iii) a linearly decreasing switch probability has been used to add a balance between local and global search, and iv) linearly decreasing population size is used to reduce the computational burden. Apart from these modifications, the division of iterations has been employed as a further modification. The CSsin algorithm has been tested on IEEE CEC 2017 and CEC 2020 benchmark test problems having various dimension sizes and a comparative study has been performed with respect to state-of-the-art optimization algorithms for single objective bound constraint optimization problems.

Specifically, they rely on stochastic variation and selection processes to sequentially find optimal solutions of a function of interest. We attempt in this work to extract preferences in these stochastic evolutionary operators in form of empirical and improved distributions as basis for model-based mutation operators. The latter can be considered as representing problem-tailored search operators which exist independently from the optimisation run and thus can be transferred to similar problem instances. This offline approach is different to existing model-based optimisation techniques, e.g. EDA&#39;s, CMA-ES and Bayesian approaches, where adaption happens rather in an online manner without the influence of prior experience. Our approach can be rather considered to follow the recent line of research on knowledge transfer in optimisation, which until now heavily relies upon the transfer of candidate solutions across different optimisation tasks. We investigate in this paper the interplay between algorithm and optimisation task, its influence on the retrieved distributions and explore whether or not these can lead to performance improvements on a selected range of problems, as well as when transferring them across problems. At last, we make a comparison of built distributions in the hope of relating similarity in statistical distances between distributions to possible performance gains.},

To achieve this task, we consider both the single-objective and the multi-objective optimisation variants of the problem. NSGA II is then used to solve each of these variants.

Using a distributed evolutionary process, each particle&#39;s ANN is able to learn about the solution landscape over the course of an optimisation run, potentially allowing the particle to avoid unfavourable regions. An initial evaluation of this approach using a suite of 5 continuous optimisation functions suggests that it improves performance, managing to get consistently closer to the global optima than conventional PSO on all of these problems. An analysis of the trajectories indicates that the behaviour of the algorithm is quite different to conventional PSO, with a much higher degree of exploration than the baseline PSO algorithm.},

Moreover, a relatively small variance in decision variables may lead to a large difference in the objective space. The optimized Pareto front (PF) may be far from the desired output. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a new co-operative prediction method, which predicts not only the Pareto solution (PS), but also a hyper-plane as an approximation of the prediction of the PF in the objective space. The hyper-plane is used to guide the search process and accelerate the convergence. We compare the proposed algorithm with three existing dynamic optimization algorithms.

  abstract  = {Lethal Wilt (Marchitez Letal) is a disease which affects Etaeis Guineensis, a plant used in the production of palm oil. The disease is increasingly common but the spatial-dynamics of the infection spread remain poorly understood. It is particularly dangerous due to the speed at which it spreads and the speed at which infected plants show symptoms and die. Early identification, or even better, accurate prediction of areas at high risk of infection can slow the spread of the disease and limit crop waste. This study is based on data collected over a five-year period from an affected plantation in Colombia. The aim of the study is to analyse the collected data to better understand how the disease spreads and then to model the behaviour. Based on insights from the initial analysis a multi-agent-based system is proposed to model the pattern of infection. The model is comprised of two steps; first Kernel Density Estimation is used to create an estimation of the distribution from which newly infected plants are drawn and this density estimation is then used to direct agents on a biased-walk of the surrounding areas. Results show that the model can approximate the behaviour of the disease and can predict areas which are at high risk of future infection.},

A selective neighbour search is employed at particles with poor performance to keep solutions qualified.

However, using artificial evolution to evolve physical shapes has been challenging because both the mapping from the genotype to phenotype and the means of measuring the resulting shape to estimate fitness are not straightforward. This contribution brings together recent advances in generative design with novelty search, an evolutionary method that replaces the fitness function with reward based purely on novelty. Bringing these techniques together yields a new methodology for exploring the power of shape descriptors. Novelty search with and without an archive is used to explore the range of shapes that are reachable from a hand-designed genotype, and compared with random walk mutations. Results indicate that the novelty search technique without an archive evolves a wider range of shapes than when an archive is used, but both are better than random walk.},

With the traffic network getting more and more complex, there have been increasing research interests in employing intelligent algorithms to find proper settings for traffic signals. As a special type of evolutionary algorithms, estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) possess strong optimization ability but have seldom been used in traffic signal optimization. In this paper, two efficient variants of continuous EDAs, namely EDA with variance enlargement strategy (EDAve) and EDA with variable width histogram model (EDA-VWH), are modified and adopted as optimizers to find proper traffic signal cycles in an actual urban area with multiple intersections. The performances of the two resultant algorithms, i.e. modified EDAve (mEDAve) and modified EDA-VWH (mEDA-VWH), are comprehensively studied through a VISSIM-MATLAB integrated simulation platform, which could provide a convenient and close-to-reality simulation environment. The simulation results showed that mEDAve and mEDA-VWH could effectively reduce the mean delay time of all vehicles under different traffic conditions. In comparison with four other algorithms, including genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution and random search method, the two modified EDAs also achieved competitive results.},

In this paper, the characteristics of the targeted problem are summarized; the gap between off-the-shelf methods and the practical need is then analyzed. A simple yet effective framework, called two-stage multi-fidelity surrogate model-assisted optimization (TMSO), is proposed to improve efficiency. TSMO is implemented by two state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and two real-world design cases demonstrate its effectiveness in practice. The research topics in multiobjective optimization and surrogate model-assisted optimization inspired by the TSMO framework is finally discussed.},

  abstract  = {Software systems being developed in today’s era are inherently large and complex. Maintaining these software is a big challenge before the software industry. Since software maintenance demands a high cost, this activity becomes even more challenging. In order to reduce the maintenance cost, it becomes crucial to know the maintainability of software modules/ classes in the initial stages of software development. Many efforts have been made to identify the maintainability of modules in the initial development stages in which prediction models have a lot of roles. Prediction models are trained from past historical data and should consist of an adequate number of instances of low maintainability and high maintainability class/modules. But this is not usually the case, and because of this, we are not able to train the prediction models properly. This situation shows data imbalance. In this direction, in this paper, we will handle the imbalanced data problem so that prediction models can be properly trained. We apply four oversampling techniques in this paper and train the prediction models for maintainability by hybridized techniques. The results of the paper advocate the effectiveness of examined oversampling techniques along with the hybridized classification techniques to develop competent maintainability prediction models.},

Based on MeMAS, the particular interest of MeMAO-R is placed on assisting original complex optimization task with new tasks generated by coordinate rotation.

Besides, MeMAO-R employs one or more classical EAs as the fundamental population based evolutionary solvers for multiple agents to optimize multiple tasks in a multi-agent scenario.

  abstract  = {Air traffic is playing a leading role in the global economical growth. Air traffic is indispensable from airport networks which accommodate the traffic demands. Note that airport networks are confronted with intractable uncertainties such as severe meteorological conditions, random mechanical failures of aircraft instruments, terrorist attacks, etc., which give rise to the failures of the components of airport networks. It is of great significance to improve the robustness of airport networks to component failures as the failures can cause staggering economical losses. Existing works either employ network rewire mechanism or add more links to an airport network to enhance the robustness of the given network. In this paper, we provide a counter-intuitive way to enhance the robustness of airport networks. Specifically, we propose to remove links from a given airport network to improve its robustness in face of perturbations. To do so, we develop a single-objective genetic algorithm to locate the links of an airport network whose removal will increase its robustness. Experimental studies on six realworld airport networks validate the feasibility of the proposed research idea. This work provides a new perspective for aviation decision makers to manage airports and air routes, and therefore sheds new light towards robust airspace design.},

This paper introduces a global intelligent method to find optimal cooperation charging/discharging strategies for EVs to minimize the operation cost. EVs aggregates co-ordinate the energy information and needs of all EVs and use real-time pricing based on micro-grid loads to influence EV charge-discharge behavior. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to solve the EV scheduling problem. This study also discusses the negative impact on the energy system of different strategies for charging EVs. Simulation shows that this smart charging strategy and improved PSO can effectively decrease the operation cost of EVs and reduce the load for each micro-grid.},

  abstract  = {In the greedy selection operator of differential evolution (DE), the trial solution will be selected into the new population only if it is better than the original target solution. Otherwise, the generated solution is simply eliminated. However, in most cases, these eliminated solutions may still be promising, and it will waste the computing resources to directly ignore them. Especially for the large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems, it is important to make full use of all generated solutions and to enhance the population diversity in the limited fitness evaluation budget. To address this issue, an adaptive population DE, termed as APDE, is proposed with dual control strategy. Firstly, a population increasing (pop-inc) strategy is proposed for giving the opportunity to the generated trial solutions to survive in the population even though they are not good enough. Secondly, to avoid the gradual expansion of the population due to the pop-inc strategy, a population decreasing (pop-dec) strategy is proposed based on the “degradation value” designed for solutions. In the end of every iteration, if the degradation value of a solution is large, it represents the solution has a worse fitness value or has no improvement for a long time, and this solution will be deleted. In this way, the population size can be kept within a certain range. The test functions in CEC&#39;2013 on LSGO are used to verify the performance of APDE. The experiment shows that APDE generally outperforms the original DE and two state-of-the-art LSGO algorithms.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a Low Frequency Oscillation (LFO) parameters estimation scheme based on Bacterial Swarm Algorithm (BSA). LFO is caused by a wide variety of events, including system faults and load switching. Thus, it is an important task to accurately estimate the parameters of LFO, and further perform fault diagnosis. Although the techniques such as Prony&#39;s method could reconstruct the form of the signal, the estimated parameters are not accurate enough. In order to improve the estimation accuracy, this research improves the regression objective function, which aims to minimize the probability likelihood between a segment of the signal filtered by a Mathematica Morphology (MM) filter and its regression. In the experimental studies, BSA is used to optimize the proposed objective function. Comprehensive comparisons are taken among the proposed method, other Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), and conventional signal processing techniques, which show BSA with Local Probability likelihood (BSA-LP) has the best performance on the estimation.},

However, their effectiveness for MaOPs with irregular fronts are yet to be improved. In this paper, a cone decomposition evolutionary algorithm with dominance-based archive (CDEA-DA) is presented to extend decomposition-based MOEAs for MaOPs with irregular fronts. In CDEA-DA, an improved cone decomposition strategy is adopted to decompose one MaOP into several scalar subproblems. Then, a dominance-based archive is designed to collect the non-dominated solutions eliminated during evolution, so as to improve the quality of the obtained front. The proposed algorithm is compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms on unconstrained benchmark MaOPs. Empirical results demonstrate that CDEA-DA achieves the superior quality of fronts.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have witnessed increasingly more uses of drone networks for providing wireless coverage to ground users. Each drone is constrained in its energy storage and wireless coverage, and it consumes most energy when flying to the top of the target area, leaving limited leftover energy for hovering at its deployed position and providing wireless coverage. The literature largely overlooks this sustainability issue of drones’ energy consumption during deployment, and we aim to minimize the maximum energy consumption among all drones after their deployment. This min-max drone deployment problem solving requires drones to cooperate with each other in deployment distance and altitude to evenly use up their energy, which is shown to be NP-hard. Thus, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the min-max drone deployment problem. In our proposal, the integer code scheme is used to encode the sequence of drones’ deployment. The energy consumption determined by the horizontal and vertical flying distance is adopted as the fitness value. With the determined order of the drones sequence by coding process, we introduce a feasibility checking operator with binary search to archive the optimum. Experimental study shows that the algorithm has capability and superiority to find good solutions under different drones’ characteristics distribution and outperforms solutions from existing competitors by extensive simulations.},

  abstract  = {With the unprecedented growth of Cloud Computing, data centers around the world have increased exponentially. The energy utilization in these data centers is becoming a concern, so the need for energy-efficient algorithms in the cloud has been on the top agenda for quite a while. Cloud providers use different energy management strategies to minimize energy utilization and to maximize ROI (Return On Investment) such as energy-efficient virtual machine (VM) placement. We have taken the problem for VM consolidation and worked on it for an energy-efficient algorithm. VM Consolidation uses live migrations of VMs during the execution of cloudlets so that underloaded physical servers can be switched off by transferring those VMs to other physical machines. VM consolidation in the cloud environment is a proven NP-hard problem. We have used Water Wave optimization (WWO) which is a meta-heuristic algorithm. Original WWO proposed for continuous space and so we have modified the parameters of the algorithm to apply for our problem of VM consolidation. Our approach produces a near-optimal solution using an objective function that minimizes energy consumption and increases the number of switched off servers.},

To prevent these problems, it is highly suggested to investigate and simulate the risks of overcrowding in a large-scale gathering by using a multi-agent system. Such simulation enables the improvement of safe and efficient pedestrian route guidance, depending on multiple scenarios with complicated environmental and traffic conditions. In this paper, for practical safety pedestrian route guidance, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary optimization method to handle multiple scenarios in a large-scale firework event. The pedestrian dataset is obtained with a multi-agent traffic simulator, CrowdWalk. As the optimization of route guidance is a multi-objective optimization problem, we modify a natural evolution strategy based multi-objective optimization algorithm by replacing the Pareto dominance relation with the scenario dominance relation. This aims for the flexibility of pedestrian route guidance in response to traffic demands. The computational results demonstrate that the method can find a well-balanced set of solution to multiple scenarios and maintain a trade-off among multiple objectives in real world applications.},

In this paper, on account of the well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), we propose a Decomposition-based Multi-objective Self-adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm (MOSDE/D), in which all these objective functions are optimized simultaneously in a single run by decomposition, and the improved cyclic crowding distance sorting strategy is introduced to ensure the diversity of solutions. Our approach is tested on standard static RFID networks and compared with other algorithms.

Within the MFEA some selective individuals that contain useful knowledge are transferred among independent tasks to enhance the convergence. In this work, we investigate what information, except to the selective individuals, should be transferred under the framework of the MFEA. In particular, the difference between the individuals and the estimated optimal solution of the corresponding task is used to calculate individual_gradient (IG), which is introduced into the MFEA as additional knowledge for transferring. Empirical studies on nine benchmarks validate the effectiveness of IG based MFEA (MFEA-IG). Moreover, we apply the MFEA-IG to MAPP problems.

  abstract  = {Robust optimization Over Time (ROOT) is a new method of solving Dynamic optimization Problems in respect to choosing a robust solution, that would last over a number of environment changes, rather than the approach that chooses the optimal solution at every change. ROOT methods currently show that ROOT can be solved by predicting an individual fitness for a number of future environment changes. In this work, a benchmark problem based on the Modified Moving Peaks Benchmark (MMPB) is proposed that includes an attractor heuristic, that guides optima to a determined location in the environment, resulting in a more predictable optimum. We study a number of time series forecasting methods to test different prediction methods of future fitness values in a ROOT method. Four time series regression techniques are considered as the prediction method: Linear and Quadratic Regression, an Autoregressive model, and Support Vector Regression. We find that there is not much difference in choosing a simple Linear Regression to more advanced prediction methods. We also suggest that current benchmark problems that cannot be predicted will deceive the optimizer and ROOT framework as the peaks may move using a random walk. Results show an improvement in comparison with MMPB used in most ROOT studies.},

We comparatively evaluate fitness-function (objective) versus behavior-based (novelty search) versus hybridized objective-novelty evolutionary search for synthesizing autonomous vehicle coordinated driving behavior. The goal of such evolved coordinated driving behavior is to maximize effective (safe) and efficient (expedient) autonomous vehicle traffic throughput for given roads.

  abstract  = {Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) can provide abundant information for different organic functional groups and chemical bonds, and is therefore widely used in molecular structure analysis, qualitative analysis of mixtures, and quantitative analysis. However, it is difficult to decompose and extract the highly correlated component spectra from complex mixed spectrum, and existing methods for FTIR qualitative analysis has poor recognition effect. For this reason, a spectroscopic analysis model based on zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) whitening and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed in this paper. The model uses wavelet threshold filter to de-noise the mixed spectrum, and uses ZCA whitening to remove the correlation of the component spectra. Finally, PSO is used to solve the component concentration. In order to verify the superiority of the ZCA whitening-based spectral analysis model, simulation studies are carried out on signals made up by twenty kinds of component spectra. The simulation results show that the model not only achieves effective qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis of the main components of the mixed spectrum, but also has better performance than the current mainstream spectrum analysis model.},

  abstract  = {Facia1 expression classification is an important but challenging task in artificial intelligence and computer vision. To effectively solve facial expression classification, it is necessary to detect/locate the face and extract features from the face. However, these two tasks are often conducted separately and manually in a traditional facial expression classification system. Genetic programming (GP) can automatically evolve solutions for a task without rich human intervention. However, very few GP-based methods have been specifically developed for facial expression classification. Therefore, this paper proposes a GP-based feature learning approach to facial expression classification. The proposed approach can automatically select small regions of a face and extract appearance features from the small regions. The experimental results on four different facial expression classification data sets show that the proposed approach achieves significantly better results in almost all the comparisons. To further show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, different numbers of training images are used in the experiments. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves significantly better performance than any of the baseline methods using a small number of training images. Further analysis shows that the proposed approach not only selects informative regions of the face but also finds a good combination of various features to obtain a high classification accuracy.},

In detail, our proposal runs multiple optimizers with different algorithmic configurations, e.g. mutation variants. Then, the configurations of inferior optimizers are adaptively tuned so that they can derive good solutions that superior ones have derived. This intends to boost the performance even with a limited number of fitness evaluations, by the following technical advantage. The CAT preliminarily validates a search capacity of tuned algorithmic configurations and then constructs an ensemble optimizer by utilizing multiple optimizers. As a case study, this paper applies the CAT to tune the differential evolution algorithms (DEs). Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms the standard DE and an alternative approach i.e. jDE, which adapts hyper-parameters of genetic operators.},

When tested against simulated data, The P-Craw is able to reliably identify the optimal subsets in scenarios ranging from 40\% to 100\% of predictable samples in the data. To access if the framework brings any improvement when used in a real world scenario, it is tested in a dataset containing intraday data from the Brazilian stocks exchange (BOVESPA). When benchmarked against training with all the samples for the series in the BOVESPA dataset the use of the framework is able to significantly raise the Correct Directional Changes (CDC) of the trained models while reducing the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in up to 19\%.},

  abstract  = {Dendritic cell algorithm (DCA) is a class of artificial immune systems that was originally developed for anomaly detection in networked systems and later as a general binary classifier. Conventionally, in its life cycle, the DCA goes through four phases including feature categorisation into artificial signals, context detection of data items, context assignment, and finally labeling of data items as either abnormal or normal class. During the context detection phase, the DCA requires users to manually pre-define the parameters used by its weighted function to process the signals and data items. Notice that the manual derivation of the parameters of the DCA cannot guarantee the optimal set of weights being used, research attention has thus been attracted to the optimisation of the parameters. This paper reports a systematic comparative study between Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm optimisation (PSO) on parameter optimisation for DCA. In order to evaluate the performance of GADCA and PSO-DCA, twelve publicly available datasets from UCI machine learning repository were employed. The performance results based on the computational time, classification accuracy, sensitivity, F-measure, and precision show that, the GA-DCA overall outperforms PSO-DCA for most of the datasets.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection (FS) is a challenging data mining problem that incorporates a complex search process to find the most informative feature subset. In the brute force methods generating the entire feature space and applying an exhaustive search makes the FS NP-hard problem. Meta-heuristic algorithms are good alternative solutions that provide (near) optimal solutions through a random search process instead of a complete search. In this paper, an FS approach based on the Moth Flame optimization algorithm (MFO) and k-NN classifier are proposed. MFO is a recent meta-heuristic algorithm that has proved its effectiveness in solving different complex problems in a reasonable time. Nevertheless, the performance of MFO highly depends on achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation during the search process. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive method to update the position of a moth toward the best global solution based on the search status. The proposed MFO has been evaluated using sixteen benchmark medical data sets and the results show promising performance of the modified MFO algorithm in terms of the applied evaluation measures.},

Common solution approaches for solving MIRPs use matheuristics combining heuristic elements and mathematical programming for obtaining high-quality solutions in relatively short processing time. The performance of such approaches can be compromised if the problem size grows considerably. To provide an alternative approach for solving larger MIRPs, we propose a multi-start metaheuristic capable of producing several solutions for the problem in short processing time. Additionally, we developed a large neighborhood search for improving a subset of the generated solutions, which are then used to build a reduced mixed-integer problem which is solved by a mathematical solver. Computational results demonstrated that our algorithm can obtain solutions in short processing time, compared to the current solutions methods, and it can solve larger problem instances, in which no solutions were known.},

Despite the popularity of learning-based text classification techniques, it is hard for human to understand or manually fine-tune the classification for better precision and recall, due to the black box nature of learning. This study proposes a novel regular expression-based text classification method making use of genetic programming (GP) approaches to evolve regular expressions that can classify a given medical text inquiry with satisfaction. Given a seed population of regular expressions (randomly initialized or manually constructed by experts), our method evolves a population of regular expressions, using a novel regular expression syntax and a series of carefully chosen reproduction operators. Our method is evaluated with real-life medical text inquiries from an online healthcare provider and shows promising performance. More importantly, our method generates classifiers that can be fully understood, checked and updated by medical doctors, which are fundamentally crucial for medical related practices.},

How the issue of class imbalance is addressed becomes more challenging if a classification task further encounters the high dimensionality issue. This paper proposes a new genetic programming (GP) approach to high-dimensional unbalanced classification. A new classification mechanism is proposed for GP to improve its classification performance. This new classification mechanism is independent of a classification threshold to separate the majority class and the minority class. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined on seven high-dimensional unbalanced datasets. Experimental results indicate that the proposed GP method often performs better than other GP methods that use a fitness function to solve the issue of class imbalance, in terms of classification performance and training time.},

  abstract  = {As a frequently-used dimensionality reduction technique in machine learning, feature selection has attracted interests in the last decade. Since feature selection is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem, how to search the valuable feature subset is a challenging optimization task. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and its variations have shown their competitiveness in solving feature selection problem. However, they have been proven to be easily trapped into the local optimal in high-dimensional space due to their intrinsic characteristic of quick convergence. To this end, an effective binary particle swarm optimization algorithm, named CBPSOFS, is proposed for feature selection, where a community-grouping based adaptive updating strategy is designed to avoid trapping into the local optimum and enhance the performance of PSO algorithm in feature selection. To be specific, the correlationship among features is used to construct the feature network, where multiple feature groups are obtained by dividing the achieved feature network. Considering that a community usually contains multiple similar features, the proposed adaptive updating strategy utilizes these feature groups to make the similar features not be included in the same particle so as to maintain the diversity of the population in the evolution. In addition, an information gain based initialization strategy and a history information based resetting strategy are also developed to improve the quality of obtained feature subset. Experimental results on several real world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBPSOFS in feature selection when compared with the several state-of-the-art baselines.},

An enhanced version, the temperature-based RBM (T-RBM), considers a new temperature parameter during the learning process that influences the neurons&#39; activation. Nevertheless, the major vulnerability of such models concerns selecting an adequate system&#39;s temperature, which might lead them to inadequate training or even overfitting when wrongly set, thus limiting the network from predicting or working effectively over unseen data. This paper addresses the problem of selecting a suitable system&#39;s temperature through a meta-heuristic optimization process. Meta-heuristic-driven techniques, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Bat Algorithm, and Artificial Bee Colony are employed to find proper values for the temperature parameter. Additionally, for comparison purposes, three standard temperature values and a random search are used as baselines. The results revealed that optimizing T-RBM is suitable for training purposes, primarily due to their complex fitness landscape, which makes fine-tuning temperatures a nontrivial task.},

  abstract  = {We propose a novel approach to extract audio features based on evolutionary approximation of instrumental texture in polyphonic audio recordings. A population of mixtures of samples from 51 instruments with 165 individual instrument bodies or playing styles is evolved with the help of musically meaningful genetic operators to produce chords which are as similar as possible to unknown signals. Our algorithm allows for a simultaneous approximation of all onsets/chords from a given audio track. The fitness function is designed to retain mixtures which are not directly comparable because they approximate different segments of a track like intro or verse. Another advantage is that no labelled signals are required to learn supervised models for instrument prediction, and the sample database can be easily extended with further instruments. Although the multilabel classification performance of instrument recognition still has room to be improved, the derived instrumental and pitch statistics are comparable to the best selected semantic features from a large set of 566 descriptors including not only instrument and pitch statistics, but also chord, harmony, structure, temporal, dynamics, emotional, vocal, and further characteristics, even outperforming them for a half of tested music categories.},

In the case of natural disasters, a significant amount of relevant information (giving crucial information) are present amongst the tweets. Therefore, there is a need to develop a system that summarizes relevant tweets by extracting informative tweets. In the current paper, we have proposed an unsupervised approach for summarizing the relevant tweets namely, MOOTweetSumm+, which automatically selects the informative tweets. Several tweet-scoring measures: (a) anti-redundancy measuring the dissimilarity between tweets; (b) similarity with outputs provided by LexRank (a graph-based method measuring tweet importance based on the concept of eigen-vector centrality in a graph); (c) BM25 based ranking function; (d) tf-idf based ranking function; (e) length of the tweet; (f) re-tweet count, are simultaneously optimized utilizing a binary differential evolution algorithm. Further, two different versions of the LexRank, utilizing syntactic and semantic similarity, have also been explored. For evaluation, four different disaster-event related datasets are used, and performance is measured in terms of ROUGE scores. An ablation study is also performed to determine which set of measures is best suited for different datasets. From the results obtained, it is clearly evident that our approach improves by 13.2\% and 5.8\% in terms of ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores, over the existing approaches, respectively.},

The objective function included penalties for network complexity and generalization error, among which a newly introduced penalty that makes use of the effective number of parameters provided by Bayesian Regularization. The developed framework was tested on data collected from a power plant consisting of twelve diesel engine-powered generators.

The proposed PANNs using PMP-MBSO and Correntropy can realize the automatic adjustment. Using actual operation data of showcases, detection accuracy of the proposed method is verified to be higher than those of the ANNs using least square error (LSE) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and the ANNs using Correntropy and MBSO.

There is a deep literature on learning an opponent model, but much less on how accurate such models must be to be useful. We investigate the sensitivity of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) to the accuracy of their modelling of the opponent in a simple Real-Time Strategy game. We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA&#39;s performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent&#39;s actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Path planning is a key technology to realize the automatic navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which has great significance both in theory and practical application. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a type of nature-inspired computational methodologies for addressing complex real-world problems that cannot be solved well by mathematical or traditional modeling. However, the huge calculation of each iteration in the EAs greatly reduces the efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper, to accelerate the search speed of EAs and consider the dynamics of the environment, we propose a hierarchical recursive multi-agent genetic algorithm that can perform path planning in real time, termed as HR-MAGA. We used a strategy of layer-by-layer optimization on 3D maps with different resolution in the optimization process. The local search ability of the algorithm is improved by competition and self-learning process. In addition, the hierarchical recursive optimization process can greatly reduce the amount of computation and effectively deal with the dynamic characteristics of the environment. The experimental results show that HR-MAGA not only has strong global optimization ability, but more importantly, is able to generate collision free paths in real time after considering the physical limitations of the UAV and the dynamics of the environment.},

  abstract  = {Cross-docking is considered as a method to manage and control the inventory flow, which is essential in the context of supply chain management. This paper studies the integration of the vehicle routing problem with cross-docking, namely VRPCD which has been extensively studied due to its ability to reduce the overall costs occurring in a supply chain network. Given a fleet of homogeneous vehicles for delivering a single type of product from suppliers to customers through a cross-dock facility, the objective of VRPCD is to determine the number of vehicles used and the corresponding vehicle routes, such that the vehicle operational and transportation costs are minimized. An adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm is proposed to solve the available benchmark VRPCD instances. The experimental results show that ALNS is able to improve 80 (out of 90) best known solutions and obtain the same solution for the remaining 10 instances within short computational time. We also explicitly analyze the added value of using an adaptive scheme and the implementation of the acceptance criteria of Simulated Annealing (SA) into the ALNS, and also present the contribution of each ALNS operator towards the solution quality.},

  abstract  = {Cancer is a disease characterized by the continuous acquisition of random mutations by cells, which are subsequently subjected to selection forces that favour the survival of some cells over others. The result of this evolutionary process called clonal evolution is a genetically heterogeneous mass known as a tumor, and identifying its composition is crucial not only for gaining further understanding of the disease, but also for designing effective therapies tailored to the particularities of the whole tumor. Thus, the clonal deconvolution problem tries to identify the different cell subpopulations that form the tumor and the phylogenetic tree that describes the evolutionary process that led to it from a series of biopsies that are an admixture of those subpopulations. This problem has been tackled from different perspectives, but as far as we know, metaheuristics have not been explored. In this article, we propose an Iterated Local Search (ILS) approach as a first metaheuristic approximation to solve this problem. Preliminary results on simulated data show that our method outperforms two well-established heuristic algorithms when running time is constrained. Moreover, the algorithm has the advantage that it is a flexible approach in which assumptions on the tumor development mode are not directly implemented, and it can therefore be easily adapted to accommodate new discoveries made on the evolution mechanisms in cancer.},

The first operator, Gaussian-based propagation operation, is designed to strengthen the exploration ability of the algorithm by encouraging each individual to learn from different exemplars. While, the second operator, refraction learning, aims to improve the exploitation capability of WWO. Further, rather than using a fixed breaking coefficient, an adaptive mechanism has been employed to dynamically adjust its values during evolution. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with related methods. The results have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.},

We performed an empirical analysis of the impact of ACO parameters have in the learning process and the obtained profits of agents. After that, we analyze and compare ACO performance against an evolutionary algorithm under a realistic case study with nine agents trading energy in the day-ahead LM. Results suggest that ACO can be efficient for strategic learning of agents, providing solutions in which all agents can improve their profits. Overall, it is shown the advantages that an LM can bring to market participants, thereby increasing the tolerable penetration of renewable resources and facilitating the energy transition.},

  abstract  = {The balance between approximation error and model complexity is an important trade-off for Symbolic Regression algorithms. This trade-off is achieved by means of specific operators for bloat control, modified operators, limits to the size of the generated expressions and multi-objective optimization. Recently, the representation Interaction-Transformation was introduced with the goal of limiting the search space to simpler expressions, thus avoiding bloating. This representation was used in the context of an Evolutionary Algorithm in order to find concise expressions resulting in small approximation errors competitive with the literature. Particular to this algorithm, two parameters control the complexity of the generated expression. This paper investigates the influence of those parameters w.r.t. the goodness-of-fit. Through some extensive experiments, we find that the maximum number of terms is more important to control goodness-of-fit but also that there is a limit to the extent that increasing its value renders any benefits. Second, the limit to the minimum and maximum value of the exponent has a smaller influence to the results and it can be set to a default value without impacting the final results.},

Comparing to its static counterpart, which has been studied for more than half a century, the involvement of dynamic and uncertain features, including but not limited to the changing Pareto-optimal set, Pareto-optimal front and problem formulation, pose significant more challenges to evolutionary algorithms. This will become even more complicated when the underlying problem involves computationally expensive objective functions which are not rare in many realworld application scenarios. In this paper, we pave an initial step towards the study of dynamic multi-objective optimisation with computationally expensive objective functions. More specifically, we use a surrogate assisted evolutionary algorithm, MOEA/DEGO in particular, as the baseline in order to carry out evolutionary optimisation with a limited amount of function evaluations. Furthermore, instead of restart the MOEA/D-EGO from scratch after each change, we use transfer learning to map the previously archived training data to the current landscape in order to jump start the surrogate model building process. By doing so, we can expect a better adaptation to the new environment. Proof-of-concept experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Population-based metaheuristic algorithms are problem-independent approaches to solve global optimisation problems. The human mental search (HMS) algorithm is a powerful population-based metaheuristic algorithm that has been shown to yield competitive performance for a variety of optimisation problems. HMS comprises three main operators, mental search, grouping, and movement. Mental search explores the neighbourhood of candidate solutions based on a Levy flight distribution to allow for simultaneous exploration and exploitation. Grouping is used to cluster the current population in order to find a promising area in search space, while during movement, candidate solutions move towards the identified promising area. In this paper, we propose an improved HMS algorithm-HMS-IS-OSK - that introduces an adaptive selection of the number of mental processes to improve the exploitation ability of HMS, and a one-step k-means algorithm for grouping to decrease the computational complexity. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we perform a set of experiments on the CEC 2017 bench-mark functions with dimensionalities of 30, 50, and 100. The obtained results show that HMS-IS-OSK outperforms standard HMS as well as other population-based metaheuristic algorithms including covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMAES), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), whale optimisation algorithm (WOA), grey wolf optimiser (GWO), and moth-flame optimisation (MFO).},

The single-wise importance is based on the sensitivity of the learning performance with respect to adding noise to the predictive features. Genetic programming is used as a context-based selection mechanism, where the selection of features is determined by the change in the performance of the evolved genetic programming models when the feature is injected with noise. Imputation is a key strategy to mitigate the data incompleteness problem. However, it has been rarely investigated for symbolic regression on incomplete data. In this work, an attempt to contribute to filling this gap is presented. The proposed method is applied to selecting imputation predictors (features/variables) in symbolic regression with missing values. The evaluation is performed on real-world data sets considering three performance measures: imputation accuracy, symbolic regression performance, and features&#39; reduction ability. Compared with the benchmark methods, the experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method can achieve an enhanced imputation, improve the symbolic regression performance, and use smaller sets of selected predictors.},

In this work, we investigate a new, more straightforward partial update strategy, in which a random subset of solutions is selected at every iteration. The performance of the MOEA/D-DE using this new resource allocation approach is compared experimentally against that of the standard MOEA/D-DE and the MOEA/D-DE with relative improvement-based resource allocation.

Different from single-tasking optimization, MTO can solve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously to improve the performance of solving each optimization task by inter-task knowledge transfer. Multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is one of the most widely used MTO algorithm based on assortative mating and vertical cultural transmission. This work extends MFEA by integrating bone route and large neighborhood local search to solve multi-objective vehicle routing problem with time window (VRPTW). The VRPTW is modeled as two related tasks, i.e., one is a multi-objective version of VRPTW (the main task), and the other is a single-objective version of VRPTW (the auxiliary task). The resultant new algorithm namely multi-objective multi-factorial memetic algorithm (MOMFMA) solve the two tasks simultaneously where the information between the tasks is exchanged in the evolutionary process. In addition to the implicit information transfer of MFEA, the bone route is introduced to enable explicit information transfer between tasks. Particularly, bone routes are constructed as semi-finished product solutions and used in large neighborhood local search. The bone route and the large neighborhood local search work together to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. MOMFMA is tested on Solomon&#39;s 56 datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that the efficiency of MOMFMA.},

This paper presents a Multi-Population Exploration only Exploitation-only Hybrid in which exploitation occurs in one population while a global search strategy performs exploration in another population. Unlike a sequential hybrid, this hybridization allows the exploratory technique (in this case Unbiased Exploratory Search) to delay convergence (up to indefinitely) which allows the hybrid system to benefit from a large budget of function evaluations.

  abstract  = {The ever increasing demand for computing resources has led to the creation of hyperscale datacentres with tens of thousands of servers. As demand continues to rise, new technologies must be incorporated to ensure high quality services can be provided without the damaging environmental impact of high energy consumption. Virtualisation technology such as network function virtualisation (NFV) allows for the creation of services by connecting component parts known as virtual network functions (VNFs). By optimising the placement and routing of VNFs this technique can be used to maximally utilise available datacentre resources, to maintain a high quality of service whilst minimising energy consumption. Current research on this problem has focussed on placing VNFs and considered routing as a secondary concern. In this work we argue that the opposite approach, a routing-led approach is preferable. We propose a novel routing-led algorithm and analyse each of the component parts over a range of different topologies on problems with up to 16000 variables and compare its performance against a traditional placement based algorithm. Empirical results show that our routing-led algorithm can produce significantly better solutions to large problem instances on a range of datacentre topologies.},

However, traditional PSO uses its personal best experience and its historical best experience to determine its search direction, but this learning strategy may limit its performance for feature selection due to the premature convergence. Therefore, the potential of PSO needs to be further explored. In this paper, a new evolutionary learning algorithm termed hybridising PSO with differential evolution (HPSO-DE) is proposed to develop new feature selection methods. In HPSO-DE, differential evolution is applied to breed promising and efficient exemplars for PSO to guide its search, which is expected to not only preserve the diversity of the population but also guide particles to fly to promising areas. HPSO-DE is compared with three classic PSO variants and five traditional feature selection methods on 15 classification problems. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively achieve a higher classification accuracy with a smaller feature subset than the compared methods.},

  abstract  = {Canis lupus (grey) wolves hunt for their prey in a pack. There exist evolutionary algorithms based on the hunting pattern of Canis lupus wolves known as Grey wolf optimizer (GWO). It is a powerful optimizer and had produced competitive results for many difficult problems. There already exist several variants of GWO because of its simplicity and exploitative qualities. GWO has been proved to be a very good exploiter. However, the modeling of grey wolves concentrates more on exploitation rather than exploration and thus results in the problem of local stagnation. To enhance the exploration capabilities, dynamic behavior is added to prey. It was assumed that the prey was static in the original GWO wherein the prey always tries to run away from the predator. The proposed algorithm enhances diversity by varying the position of prey with the help of Levy distribution rather than considering it to be static. This paper aims at introducing a novel, realistic version of GWO wherein the new population is generated with the help of Levy flight distribution of prey as well as with the different class of wolves by a suitable modification in the hierarchy of wolves. Also, the three primary strides of chasing, looking, circling, and assaulting of prey, are executed. However, the new population which is created has a better exploration because of levy flight distribution of prey position. The algorithm is tested on a well-known suite of 23 benchmark problems. The outcomes show that the proposed algorithm, GWOLF can give either better or competitive results as contrasted with the original GWO and PSO metaheuristics.},

  abstract  = {Resource constrained job scheduling is a challenging combinatorial optimisation with many real-world applications. A number of exact methods and meta-heuristics have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem, but often encounter scalability issues. This paper investigates an automated heuristic design approach to deal with this problem. The aim of this approach is to generate heuristics that can quickly construct good solutions, which can be applied directly or used to initialise other meta-heuristics. A new adaptive genetic programming algorithm is proposed to coevolve a large set of reusable heuristics to solve the resource constrained job scheduling problem. There are three different aspects to the novelty behind our proposed algorithm: (a) a new phenotypic representation of heuristics, (b) an efficient mapping technique to monitor the evolutionary process, and (c) an adaptive fitness function to guide the search towards a diverse and competitive population. The experimental results show that evolved heuristics show promise and are able to outperform some existing meta-heuristics for large-scale instances. Analyses also show that the algorithm can be further improved if appropriate parameters are selected.},

We apply evolutionary multi-objective feature selection to measure individual contributions of different structural complexity features for each genre to feature sets with the smallest classification errors.

  abstract  = {Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used in image classification tasks, but the process of designing CNN architectures is very complex, so Neural Architecture Search (NAS), automatically searching for optimal CNN architectures, has attracted more and more research interests. However, the computational cost of NAS is often too high to be applied to real-life applications. In this paper, an efficient particle swarm optimisation method named EPSOCNN is proposed to evolve CNN architectures inspired by the idea of transfer learning. EPSOCNN successfully reduces the computation cost by minimising the search space to a single block and utilising a small subset of the training set to evaluate CNNs during the evolutionary process. Meanwhile, EPSOCNN also keeps very competitive classification accuracy by stacking the evolved block multiple times to fit the whole training dataset. The proposed EPSOCNN algorithm is evaluated on CIFAR-10 dataset and compared with 13 peer competitors including deep CNNs crafted by hand, learned by reinforcement learning methods and evolved by evolutionary computation approaches. It shows very promising results with regard to the classification accuracy, the number of parameters and the computational cost. Besides, the evolved transferable block from CIFAR-10 is transferred and evaluated on two other datasets - CIFAR-100 and SVHN. It shows promising results on both of the datasets, which demonstrate the transferability of the evolved block. All of the experiments have been performed multiple times and Student&#39;s t-test is used to compare the proposed method with peer competitors from the statistical point of view.},

  abstract  = {One of the main issues in the control system is the online tuning of its gains. The use of bio-inspired algorithms (BA) is gaining more attention in the control tuning task because they are less sensible to system uncertainties. Nevertheless, the computational time of BA must be reduced to be used in practice. In this work, an event condition is stated to reduce the computational cost of the optimization process in the online bio-inspired tuning approach. This condition activates the tuning approach only when it is required, i.e., when the regulation error tends to increase. Also, in this approach, an identification process and a predictive strategy are simultaneously optimized to find the more suitable control parameters that handle more efficient the parametric uncertainties. The proposed online Asynchronous Bio-inspired Tuning Approach with Simultaneous Identification and Prediction (ABioTASIP) is validated in the study case of the velocity regulation of a DC motor considering dynamic parametric uncertainties. The comparative analysis with an approach where the control parameters are periodically tuned indicates that the proposal decreases the tuning process without considerably increase the regulation error.},

The characterization of such databases can be done by means of descriptors on the learning object at hand, e.g., complexity measures, which extract statistical and geometric characteristics from the data sets, for a given classification problem, in order to estimate their complexity. Such complexity measures can be used to guide the production of synthetic datasets, so it reinforces one or more dataset features.

However, most performance metrics assume that the knowledge of the exact Pareto-optimal set is available. Also, most metrics evaluate an algorithm&#39;s performance based on the final solution set, which fails to capture their performance during intermediate generations. In this paper, we investigate a running performance metric which can be applied to measure the performance at any time during the algorithm execution and no true optimum needs to be known for computing the metric. In general, multi-objective algorithms either improve the convergence based on the dominance relation or the diversity in the solution set. Our proposed running metric makes use of this fact by keeping track of the indicators regarding the extreme points and the ND solution set each generation and derives measures of convergence and diversity. Moreover, by introducing a threshold and comparing the values of indicators a set of termination criteria is also suggested. Finally, we demonstrate how our running performance metric can be used to compare multiple evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with each other.

The proposed Analysis of Epistasis performs a sampling of points within the basin of attraction and builds a data set containing those candidate solutions whose objective function value falls below a threshold. The covariance matrix associated with this data set is then calculated. The eigenvectors of this covariance matrix are then computed and used as the reference system for the local search: a change of variables is performed and then the local search is performed on the new variables. The Analysis of Epistasis has been implemented on the three local search algorithms composing a popular MA called Multiple Trajectory Search (MTS).

In detail, the candidate point of objective is obtained through the penalized lower confidence bounding (PLCB) infill criterion. Additionally, an infill criterion of the constraints (called MLCB) which can accurately characterize the boundaries of the constraints is developed to determine the candidate point of constraints. Then, a selection algorithm is developed to select one or two candidate point(s) as the new training point(s) adaptively according to the current optimal value and the accuracy of the constraint boundaries. The selection algorithm is composed of three phases. In the first phase, the candidate point of constraints is selected to find a feasible solution. Two candidate points of objective and constraints are added to speed up the convergence in the second phase. In the third phase, the candidate point of objective is chosen to improve the quality of the feasible optimal solution.

  abstract  = {No-wait flowshop scheduling problem (NWFSP) is a well-known strongly NP-hard problem, where in-process waiting is not allowed between any two consecutive machines in such a way that once a job is started, subsequent processing must be carried out on all machines until completion. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient NWFSP in order to investigate the trade-off between makespan and total energy consumption. The energy-efficient NWFSP aims to seek to obtain Pareto solution sets to minimize the makespan and the total energy consumption conflicting with each other. Unlike the classical NWFSP, there are different speed levels for each job on machines and the processing times of jobs can differ according to the assigned speed levels. Therefore, we modify the formulation of NWFSP by introducing a speed scaling strategy in order to approximate Pareto solution sets, i.e., non-dominated solution sets. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP), an energy-efficient variable block insertion heuristic (EE-VBIH), an energy-efficient iterated greedy algorithm (IG) and an energy-efficient &amp; IG-ALL) to solve the energy-efficient NWFSP.

  abstract  = {Predicting weather-related outages in electricity networks is an important issue for distribution system operators. In this study, we apply a data-driven approach and train artificial neural networks to predict faults in the electricity network. In our experiments, we utilize the meteorological data and fault records collected for the period of1.1.2011-31.12.2013 in central Finland. Assuming that there might be long-term dependencies between weather conditions and faults in the network, we investigate simple recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and traditional multilayer perceptrons. Taking into account the meteorological observations preceding faults and varying this period from several hours to several days, we found that 6 hours prior to faults included the sufficient information to make accurate predictions. Also, there was no need in more complicated recurrent neural networks as multilayer perceptron was able to predict events with the large number of faults more accurately. Besides, while forecasting all types of faults and wind-related faults only, oversampling allowed the model to predict rare high peaks.},

In the outer loop of the GVNS-QL, insertion, and exchange operators are used to shaking the permutation. On the other hand, in the inner loop of variable neighborhood descent procedure, variable iterated greedy and variable block insertion heuristic algorithms are employed with two effective insertion local search procedures. The proposed GVNS-QL defines the parameters of the algorithm using a Q-learning mechanism. The developed GVNS-QL algorithm is compared with the traditional iterated greedy (IG) algorithm using the well-known benchmark set. The comprehensive computational experiments show that the GVNS-QL outperforms the traditional IG algorithm. The results of the IG and GVNS-QL algorithms are also compared with the current best-known solutions reported in the literature. The computational results show that the proposed GVNS-QL algorithm improves the current best-known solutions for 104 out of 250 instances.},

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) in recent years has been widely applied to solve various real world problems. However, for ill conditioned problems with largely different sensitivity to the objective function, classical PSO cannot search for optimal solution efficiently due to the best position-guided strategy that wastes lots of source searching undesirable areas. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel velocity reinforced mechanism (VR) for solving m-conditional problems. Two implementations of the mechanism, velocity reinforced particle swarm optimization and velocity reinforced search, are introduced in this paper. VR updates its velocity by learning and correcting best velocity directly, instead of using classical best position-guided updating rules. In this way, it increases the possibility that finds better directions for m-conditional problems. Experiments indicate that the novel approaches improve the final results and efficiency.},

To avoid this problem, we propose a method of defining a virtual overlapping zone between partitions and selecting individuals for mating and migration by evaluating individual populations in this area using weight vectors of adjacent partitions. Using a two-objective constrained knapsack problem for evaluation, we compare the proposed method with standard single-core execution, no-migration parallel MOEA/D, and parallel MOEA/D with standard migration, and show that the proposed method is effective in improving diversity in solution searching while shortening execution time and increasing the accuracy of solution searching.},

Therefore, in this paper, we take the packaging production line of a typical carbon black production enterprise as the research background to study the carbon black production line static and dynamic multiobjective scheduling problem. Firstly, multiobjective optimization models of both order static scheduling and rush order dynamic rescheduling are established. Then the improved MOEA/D algorithm combined the heuristic algorithm based on heuristic rules and discrete dynamic local search is developed to solve these two models. Based on the actual production data, eight instances of order static scheduling problems of different scales and four instances of rush order dynamic rescheduling problems of different scales are constructed respectively. Experimental results illustrate that the improved MOEA/D is effective and superior in solving these two problems.},

Since the collaboration of search scales is accomplished by restarting or adjusting fireworks whose local search are not making meaningful progress, fireworks in MSCFWA are able to exploit different local areas independently or cooperate in the same local area with different search scales. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy stably improved the overall optimization performance of fireworks algorithm on the benchmark functions of the CEC&#39;13 competition significantly.

We used 352 datasets collected by Schaffer, which originated from real experiments in the physical sciences at the turn of the 20 th century for which measurements were tabulated, and a governing functional relationship was postulated. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, in training our method ranks first in 350 out of the 352 datasets. Only six machine learning algorithms ranked first in at least one of the 352 datasets on testing; our approach ranked first 192 times, i.e. more all of the other algorithms combined. The results favourably speak about the robustness of our methodology. We conclude that the use of analytic continued fractions in regression deserves further study and we also advocate that Schaffer&#39;s data collection should also be included in the repertoire of datasets to test the performance of machine learning and regression algorithms.},

In this paper, existing techniques are further developed to include parsimony pressure-a method to encourage evolution towards simpler solutions. With simpler solutions, the constructed features become easier to understand and interpret. The results of experiments using the proposed method show that parsimony pressure is an effective method for producing significantly simpler constructed features without any reduction on the performance of k-means++clustering.

For this, we defined a new way to represent the architecture of DNN (layer sequence) as a solution in the optimization process. The proposed method attempts to find the best composition and sequence of layers for the DNN architecture satisfying two criteria: accuracy and F 1 score.

Generally, their performance is better than other algorithms that based on a single operator and/or algorithm.

In this paper, we propose an improved optimization algorithm that uses the benefits of multiple differential evolution operators, with more emphasis placed on the best-performing operator. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested by solving 10 problems with 5, 10, 15 and 20 dimensions taken from CEC2020 competition on single objective bound constrained optimization, with its results outperforming both single operator-based and different state-of-the-art algorithms.},

In this study, the target value and hit probability values will be assigned according to the position of the target and the weapon. The WTA problem will be analyzed in different cases and solved using optimization algorithms. Howitzer will be chosen as weapon and four different types of targets will be offered to get solutions through different scenarios. Three different WTA problems will be examined.

Aiming to these two goals and to efficiently deal with MMOPs, an adaptive guidance-based differential evolution (AGDE) with archive strategy is proposed in this paper, including three novel components. Firstly, an adaptive mutation strategy (AMS) is introduced, which guides the current individual to move towards the peak that is closest to itself. Secondly, an iterative feedback archive (IFA) strategy is used to store the global optima of the population in every iteration. Thirdly, a Gaussian disturbance-based elite learning (GDEL) strategy is performed on the archive to refine the accuracy of the solutions. The AMS strategy helps to locate more peaks, while the IFA and GDEL strategies help to maintain the found solutions and refine their accuracy. The performance of AGDE is tested on 20 widely used multimodal benchmark functions of CEC&#39;2013. The experimental results of AGDE are competitive with the results obtained by the state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms.},

Lévy flights mainly perform the exploration phase in algorithms such as the Firefly algorithm and Cuckoo search; in COLSHADE, however, the goal of the Lévy flights is to administer the selection pressure exerted over the population as to find the feasible region and keeping diversity. Thus, a new adaptive Lévy flight mutation operator is introduced here and called the levy/1/bin. In many problems the levy/1/bin excels during the exploration phase whilst the exploitation phase is performed by current-to-pbest mutation. However, the adaptive strategy propitiates the emergence of these two mutation approaches at different rates and times.

Existing approaches are shown to successfully deal with MAPF, where either the makespan or flow-time is used as a single objective. In this article, we treat the MAPF as a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOMAPF). In this paper, we consider three different objective functions, called makespan, flow-time and path-overlaps which are to be optimised at the same time. The MOMAPF problem in this paper is designed to be a scalable test problem for multi-objective optimisation algorithms, where we can scale up the variable space to reflect different real-world scenarios.

Firstly, the two-impulsive lunar transfer problem is described, and a trajectory design method is proposed to optimize the transfer based on Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm. Then the geocentric relationship of the parking Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and the Moon is analyzed and the Earth-Centered Moon-to-Earth Plane Coordinate is introduced to transfer the inertial orbital elements into the pseudo ones. In this coordinate frame, domain knowledge suggests that the pseudo orbital elements can also serve as good learning features for the machine learning model. After generating the dataset, two machine learning models are established to estimate the orbital transfer window and orbital transfer velocity impulse respectively. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the machine learning models are efficient to estimate hundreds of transfer trajectories within 0.1 second, which shows much better performance than traditional orbit optimization method. The performance of two different machine learning algorithms is also assessed, where the neural network outperforms the gradient boosting model with the velocity impulse error less than 1m/s. It is also verified that the feature selection of pseudo orbital elements is appropriate which has smaller learning errors than that using the inertial orbital elements.},

Application of fractional order pheromone updation technique in the proposed algorithm produces more accurate results. Moreover, the quantum inspired version of the algorithm produces results faster than its classical counterpart. A new band fusion technique, applying principal component analysis and adaptive subspace decomposition, is successfully proposed for the pre-processing of hyperspectral images. Score Function is used as the fitness function and K-Harmonic Means is used to determine the clusters. The proposed algorithm is implemented on the Xuzhou HYSPEX dataset and compared with classical Ant Colony Optimization and fractional order Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. Furthermore, the performance of each method is validated by peak signal-to-noise ratio which clearly indicates better segmentation in the proposed algorithm.

Unfortunately, the two objectives are usually in conflict, which makes feature selection a multi-objective problem. MOEA/D (multi-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition) has shown to be effective in solving multi-objective feature selection, which evolves more diverse fronts than other multi-objective algorithms such as SPEA2 or NSGAII. However, sometimes the feature subsets around the middle of the evolved fronts do not have high classification performance. The goal of this work is to propose a local search for MOEA/D with an expectation of maintaining the front diversity while improving the classification performance of the feature subsets in the evolved fronts. The local search is based on three operators: insert, remove, and swap. The insert/remove operators either add/remove a single feature from the current feature subset, while the swap operator exchanges a selected feature with an unselected feature. The selection of added/removed/swapped features is based on Relief, a well-known measure which considers feature interactions. The experimental results show that the proposed local search can maintain or improve the fronts evolved by MOEA/D-DYN, a state-of-the-art MOEA/D algorithm for feature selection.},

The only mode of knowledge transfer among populations in MaODE is the modified version of mutation policy of DE, where every member of the population during mutation is influenced by the best members of all the populations under consideration. The present work aims at further increasing the communication between the members of the population by communicating between a superior and an inferior population, using a novel migration strategy. The proposed migration policy enables poor members of an inferior population to evolve with a superior population. Simultaneously, members from the superior population are also transferred to the inferior one to help it improving its performance.

This work presents an assignment formulation to calculate DoM in problems with three objectives or more. Some initial experiments, in the bi-objective space, were done to show that DoM has a similar interpretation as ϵ-indicators, and to show that our model formulation is correct. Next, other experiments, using three dimensions, were also done to show how DoM could be compared with other indicators: inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV).

  abstract  = {We propose an algorithm and a new method to tackle the classification problems. We propose a multi-output neural tree (MONT) algorithm, which is an evolutionary learning algorithm trained by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA)-III. Since evolutionary learning is stochastic, a hypothesis found in the form of MONT is unique for each run of evolutionary learning, i.e., each hypothesis (tree) generated bears distinct properties compared to any other hypothesis both in topological space and parameter-space. This leads to a challenging optimisation problem where the aim is to minimise the tree-size and maximise the classification accuracy. Therefore, the Pareto-optimality concerns were met by hypervolume indicator analysis. We used nine benchmark classification learning problems to evaluate the performance of the MONT. As a result of our experiments, we obtained MONTs which are able to tackle the classification problems with high accuracy. The performance of MONT emerged better over a set of problems tackled in this study compared with a set of well-known classifiers: multilayer perceptron, reduced-error pruning tree, naïve Bayes classifier, decision tree, and support vector machine. Moreover, the performances of three versions of MONT&#39;s training using genetic programming, NSGA-II, and NSGA-III suggests that the NSGA-III gives the best Pareto-optimal solution.},

Narrative graphs, a connected graph of all potential and existing relations within a game, can enable an ability to find a Nonplayer Character (NPC) who is likely to live nearby, under the assumption that those who interact most frequently are also close in distance. We examine the use of an evolutionary graph compression method and a method using simulated diffusion to cluster features based on relational information about players to generate relationally intimate groups. This clustering can be used to generate information about the game world and cities to inform PCG as to how the connectivity of these areas is, and should be, arranged.

  abstract  = {The design of well-performing heuristic-based algorithms is a tedious and time-consuming task. For this purpose, several approaches to automate the algorithm design have been investigated over the last years. Among them, Genetic Programming-based Hyper-Heuristics (GPHH) are able to design algorithms of varying lengths and permutations of algorithm&#39;s operators. Although the parametrization of generated algorithms is crucial for further adaptation of its behavior to the underlying problems, it has been neglected or only considered to a limited extent in many applications of GPHHs. This work proposes a way to integrate GPHH with parameter configuration. In particular, a Cartesian Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (CGPHH) is developed. The proposed method is applied to the multi-level capacitated production lot-sizing problem, a complex and relevant problem in production planning. Conducted experiments evaluate both its efficacy and the quality of the generated algorithms. Finally, results are compared to the CGPHH without parameter configuration and a human-designed algorithm, indicating the ability of CGPHH-PC to generate algorithms that have the best overall-performance for different cutoff times.},

The result of using the new types of sets of parameters as information resources is studied and compared to evolution that uses the previous type of information resource. The new technique of selecting information resources presented here yields higher fitness values. The new results are on the high end of the fitness distribution, and so the new information resources tested give similar improvements in fitness.

  abstract  = {Intelligent optimization algorithms based on swarm principles have been widely researched in recent times. The Firefly Algorithm (FA) is an intelligent swarm algorithm for global optimization problems. In literature, FA has been seen as one of the efficient and robust optimization algorithm. However, the solution search space used in FA is insufficient, and the strategy for generating candidate solutions results in good exploration ability but poor exploitation performance. Although, there are a lot of modifications and hybridizations of FA with other optimizing algorithms, there is still a room for improvement. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose modification of FA by introducing a stepping ahead parameter. Second, we design a hybrid of modified FA with Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) to improve the exploitation while containing good exploration. Traditionally, hybridization meant to combine two algorithms together in terms of structure only, and preference was not taken into account. To solve this issue, preference in terms of user and problem (time complexity) is taken where CMAES is used within FA&#39;s loop to avoid extra computation time. This way, the structure of algorithm together with the strength of the individual solution are used. In this paper, FA is modified first and later combined with CMAES to solve selected global optimization benchmark problems. The effectiveness of the new hybridization is shown with the performance analysis.},

  abstract  = {Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithms (QiEAs) have demonstrated to be very effective in several applications. In particular, employing this algorithm for feature selection as a wrapper technique in Brain-Computer Interfaces applications was recently proposed with great results. Moreover, the training time of the model was decreased while maintaining a high classification accuracy, both essential conditions for a successful BCI. The drawback of this model was the sensitiveness to changes in the direction and magnitude of the rotation angle, which can produce adverse effects in both performance and convergence time. Chaotic systems and Evolutionary algorithms, when combined, can enhance the convergence rate and speed of the evolutionary process, incrementing the capacity of reaching the global optima. In this paper we explore the effects of adding ergodicity to a QiEA by the employment of chaotic maps in two operators: chaotic uniform crossover and chaotic quantum update gate. To validate the proposed approach, six commonly used chaotic maps are tested with data of Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) of right and left hand movement. The results of these experiments are compared with the ones of a QiEA and a classical Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the proposed model, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is employed as the time-frequency analysis to characterize the signal, whereas a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network is used as a classifier. The results demonstrated that Chaotic QiEAs can significantly improve the convergence time of the model with only a small loss in the final accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Solving real-world complex optimization problems using simple metaheuristic algorithms is a challenging but attractive task. Making matrix multiplication efficient is one of the interesting problems. This time-consuming algebric operation is required in many applications in science and engineering, thus reducing its complexity targets more efficient computation. In fact, many of practical and theatrical complicated calculations can be modeled efficiently as matrix-based operations, therefore matrix multiplication is computationally expansive operator among all others. In this paper, a simple metaheuristic method based on Micro Genetic Algorithm is proposed to find Strassen&#39;s equivalent solutions which is an algebraic method to compute the product of two matrices with minimal number of multiplications. Since there are numerous optimal solutions, the modeled problem is a large-scale and highly multi-modal optimization problem. The proposed method could find more than 160, 000 valid solutions with same complexity as Strassen&#39;s in a large-scale search space. Among all discovered solutions found using the proposed method, there are 701 distinct solutions which is the maximum number of discovered Strassen&#39;s equivalent solutions to the best of our knowledge. The proposed algorithm is simple but very efficient to find more and more solutions, in fact, that is a great demonstration of “evolution in action” to tackle real-world complex problems like the current one, which just one set of its equations has been discovered by the Germen mathematicians and has remained mysterious for more than 50 years.},

By doing this, the estimated individual which has the maximum difference will be evaluated by real functions to strengthen the RBF models. In addition, for each objective, a more suitable RBF is selected for the purpose of making a more accurate approximation of the real functions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only performs well on many-objective problems with 10 decision variables, but also shows high efficiency.

  abstract  = {Stereo vision cameras are flexible sensors due to providing heterogeneous information such as color, luminance, disparity map (depth), and shape of the objects. Today, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) present the highest accuracy for the disparity map estimation [1]. However, CNNs require considerable computing capacity to process billions of floating-point operations in a real-time fashion. Besides, commercial stereo cameras produce huge size images (e.g., 10 Megapixels [2]), which impose a new computational cost to the system. The problem will be pronounced if we target resource-limited hardware for the implementation. In this paper, we propose DenseDisp, an automatic framework that designs a Siamese neural architecture for disparity map estimation in a reasonable time. DenseDisp leverages a meta-heuristic multi-objective exploration to discover hardware-friendly architectures by considering accuracy and network FLOPS as the optimization objectives. We explore the design space with four different fitness functions to improve the accuracy-FLOPS trade-off and convergency time of the DenseDisp. According to the experimental results, DenseDisp provides up to 39. 1x compression rate while losing around 5\% accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art results.},

In this work we extend existing benchmarking studies by addressing anytime behaviour of inexact TSP solvers based on empirical runtime distributions leading to an increased understanding of solver behaviour and the respective relation to problem hardness. It turns out that performance ranking of solvers is highly dependent on the focused approximation quality. Insights on intersection points of performances offer huge potential for the construction of hybridized solvers depending on instance features. Moreover, instance features tailored to anytime performance and corresponding performance indicators will highly improve automated algorithm selection models by including comprehensive information on solver quality.},

A particular challenge in using CC lies in the decomposition of variables and resource allocation. In this work, the decomposition phase of the framework is performed in two stages to address both variable interaction and efficient resource allocation. The algorithm starts with differential analysis followed by differential grouping. The differential analysis allows efficient resource allocation while the differential grouping will detect variable interactions. The differential grouping will act on a small number of variables and will not consume as much computational budget as a single-stage grouping. While not all variable interactions will be detected, separable variables will be recognized hence specialized solvers for separable problems can be employed on these subproblems. In this work, the twostage grouping CC (TSCC) is paired with a hybrid algorithm where sep-CMA-ES is used to solve the separable subproblem and CMA-ES is used to solve the non-separable subproblems, the algorithm is referred as TSCC-CMAES. A comparison between TSCC and CC with groups based on either differential analysis or differential grouping is carried out. In general, TSCC could outperform the two single-stage grouping methods. Additionally, the TSCC-CMAES shows a competitive advantage on a number of more complex problems against state-of-the-art algorithms and it is shown that the effect of the population size and group size is crucial in achieving these results.},

  abstract  = {Mutation testing is a well-known fault-based technique that has been applied to different domains as new technologies have appeared. Evolutionary Mutation Testing (EMT) finds mutants that are useful to produce new test cases. It uses evolutionary algorithms to reduce the number of mutants that are generated, keeping as many difficult to kill and stubborn mutants (strong mutants) as possible in the reduced set. Given the popularity of real-time systems, the MuEPL mutation system was developed for the Esper Event Processing Language (EPL), a query language aimed at the Internet of Things (IoT). In past work, EMT was integrated into MuEPL, and it reduced the cost of finding strong mutants in some EPL queries but not in others. This study takes a step forward by proposing and evaluating two metaheuristics for EMT that combine EMT and random selection: one which bootstraps the hall of fame with a random subset (Bootstrapped EMT), and one which falls back to random selection after a certain point (Inverse EMT). While BEMT is shown to outperform IEMT in most cases, BEMT has not managed to outperform EMT. An additional experiment studies the impact of low-quality mutation operators in the relative performance of BEMT, IEMT and plain EMT. Results suggest that the MuEPL RRO operator was the reason for the poor performance of EMT in some scenarios.},

The method generates a noise set located in the neighborhood of the point of interest, whose prediction should be explained, and fits a local explanation model for the analyzed sample. The tree structure generated by GPX provides a comprehensible analytical, possibly non-linear, expression which reflects the local behavior of the complex model. We considered three machine learning techniques that can be recognized as complex black-box models: Random Forest, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine in twenty data sets for regression and classifications problems. Our results indicate that the GPX is able to produce more accurate understanding of complex models than the state of the art.

  abstract  = {Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm has been shown notable performance in solving complex optimization problems. In recent years, some variants of the DE algorithm have been proposed based on the concept of center-based sampling strategy. To the best of our knowledge, the related papers employed center-based sampling for population initialization or as the base vector in mutation operator. In fact, they were operation-level approaches applied during the optimization process, and none of them was about proposing a population-level approach to utilize center-based sampling to accelerate convergence rate of algorithms. This paper proposes a novel center-based sampling scheme for the DE algorithm that utilizes center-based sampling as a member of the population. In our scheme, one candidate solution is the center of the best candidate solutions, while other individuals in the population behave similarly to the standard DE algorithm. The center-based candidate solution is not updated using standard operators and is set to the center in each iteration. To validate our scheme, we benchmark our algorithm on CEC-2017 benchmark functions with three dimensions of 30, 50, and 100. Also, we design some experiments to analyze the behavior of the proposed center-based scheme. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement of the proposed algorithm on the majority of benchmark functions.},

  abstract  = {Fitness landscape analysis is an approach used to mathematically characterize optimization problems. Random walk algorithms are used to sample fitness landscapes in order to perform fitness landscape analysis. Random walk algorithms have an advantage over random samples, in that random walk algorithms keep note of successive points in the walk, along with the relationships between them. It is important that the sample generated by a random walk algorithm is representative of the entire fitness landscape. A representative sample can be said to have good coverage of the decision space of the optimization problem. A new measure of the coverage of random walk algorithms, i.e. the Hausdorff distance, is proposed. The coverage of random walk algorithms found in the literature is investigated using the Hausdorff distance. This study shows that it is not sufficient to consider only the robustness of a random walk algorithm when performing fitness landscape analysis, but that the coverage of decision space should also be considered. This study shows that there is no significant difference in the coverage provided by the random walk algorithms investigated. However, the differences between the coverage of the random walk algorithms is more prominent when the length of the random walks is short, or the dimensionality of the optimization problem is increased.},

  abstract  = {Cooperative tasks such as herding and hunting are common among higher animals in nature. A particularly complex example is that of mobbing by spotted hyenas. Through careful coordination, a large number of spotted hyenas can attack a group of lions and successfully steal a kill from them, even though lions are much bigger and stronger. This behavior is more complex than others that hyenas exhibit, and it appears to be heritable. How such behavioral advance can emerge in evolution is a fascinating question; it is difficult to study in nature, but computational simulations can provide insight. In simulation, hyenas initially evolved different levels of boldness, corresponding to simple behaviors such as solo attack, delayed attack, and delayed approach. These behaviors can be seen as stepping stones in constructing the more complex mobbing behavior in later generations. These results suggest a general stepping-stone-based mechanism through which complex coordinated behaviors can arise in humans and animals. This insight should prove useful in building cognitive architectures and team strategies for artificial agents in the future.},

In X-Bar charts, samples are taken from the production process at regular intervals for measurements of a quality characteristic and the sample means are plotted on this chart. When designing a control chart, three parameters should be selected, namely, the sample size (n), the sampling interval (h), and the width of control limits (k). On the other hand, when designing an economical and statistical design, these three control chart parameters should be selected in such a way that the total cost of controlling the process should be minimized by finding optimal values of these three parameters. In this paper, we develop a DE_QL algorithm for the global minimization of a loss cost function expressed as a function of three variables n, h, and k in an economic model of the X-bar chart. A problem instance that is commonly used in the literature has been solved and better results are found than the earlier published results.},

  abstract  = {The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) is a general and challenging arc routing problem. As the problem size increasing, exact methods are not applicable, and heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms are promising approaches to solve it. To obtain good performance, parameter values of heuristics or meta-heuristics should be properly set. In recent years, automatic parameter tuning, which includes off-line and online parameter tuning, has attracted considerable attention in the evolutionary computation community. At present, parameters are usually determined through simple off-line parameter tuning, such as empirical analysis or grid search, when designing algorithms for CARP. However, using off-line parameter tuning on CARP has some disadvantages, among which the computational cost is the serious one. This work proposed an online parameter tuning approach using exponential recency-weighted kernel density estimation (ERW-KDE), and combines it with the SAHiD algorithm, which is an hierarchical decomposition based algorithm for CARP, to constitute the online parameter tuned SAHiD (OPT-SAHiD) algorithm. The experimental results show that OPT-SAHiD significantly outperforms the compared algorithms on two CARP benchmark sets owing to the proposed online automatic parameter tuning approach. The proposed online automatic parameter tuning approach based on ERW-KDE not only improves the performance of SAHiD algorithm, but also removes the additional computational overhead required for offline parameter tuning.},

The first is to understand the relationship between feature spaces and the predictive ability of the models, allowing us to explain the differences between learning and generalization when training and testing in different datasets. We find that training on datasets built from more than one image provides models that generalize better. These results are explained by visualizing the dispersion of values on the feature space. The second objective is to evolve hyper-features that improve the performance of different classifiers on a variety of test sets. We find the hyper-features to be beneficial, and obtain the best models with XGBoost, even if the hyper-features are optimized for a different method.},

GANs also have trouble encoding semantic requirements that make levels interesting and playable. This paper combines a GAN approach to generating individual rooms with a graph grammar approach to combining rooms into a dungeon. The GAN captures design principles of individual rooms, but the graph grammar organizes rooms into a global layout with a sequence of obstacles determined by a designer. Room data from The Legend of Zelda is used to train the GAN. This approach is validated by a user study, showing that GAN dungeons are as enjoyable to play as a level from the original game, and levels generated with a graph grammar alone. However, GAN dungeons have rooms considered more complex, and plain graph grammar&#39;s dungeons are considered least complex and challenging. Only the GAN approach creates an extensive supply of both layouts and rooms, where rooms span across the spectrum of those seen in the training set to new creations merging design principles from multiple rooms.},

Each of the constituent constraint handling techniques votes for the solutions at each generation based on its own rules. Solutions getting more votes are regarded as promising individuals and survive to the next generation. This ensemble framework based on voting-mechanism reflects the collective wisdom in decision-making of human beings. In addition, a differential evolution (DE) variant is designed as the search engine, in which four search strategies are combined to generate new individuals and maintain the balance between diversity and convergence of the population. The proposed algorithm has been tested on 57 real world single-objective constraint optimization problems and 7 problems are selected using variable reduction strategy (VRS). The experiment shows that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, indicating that the voting-mechanism ensemble constraint handling technique combine DE algorithm together can effectively deal with constrained optimization problems.},

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has a bright future in feature selection (FS). However, with the increase of data set dimension, the search space becomes larger, PSO is easy to fall into local optima and brings a lot of time and space overhead. It is still a big challenge to apply PSO to thousands of feature data sets. In this paper, the features are reordered to ensure that the shorter particles can get better classification performance. We propose a subset length constraint mechanism to reduce the number of selected features of particles gradually, so as to introduce particles into smaller and more effective space and jump out of local optima. Although the short running time of filter FS is more suitable for high-dimensional feature selection, the classification accuracy of filter FS is generally lower than that of wrapper FS. In order to achieve better classification performance in a short time, we propose a dual global optimal (Gbest) updating model. PSO has been modified. Compared with six algorithms on six high-dimensional data sets. The results show that the new dual Gbest update mechanism based on length restriction mechanism has higher efficiency and accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming is already outperforming humans at creating efficient transmission schedulers for large heterogeneous communications networks. We have previously proposed a multi-level grammar approach which achieved significantly better results than the canonical Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming approach. Initially, a restricted `small&#39; grammar is utilised in order to discover suitable structures. A full grammar is then adopted after this initial phase. Hence, evolution can focus on maximising performance, by fine-tuning the well-structured models. In this work, we propose to use a hierarchical approach by employing multiple small grammars instead of a unique small grammar at the lower level, in conjunction with the full grammar at the upper level. To use multiple small grammars while maintaining the same computational budget, we have to use either (i) reduce the number of generations, or (ii) reduce the size of the population for the evolution with each of the small grammars. In this work, we confirm that the hierarchical grammar approach using the division of number of generations strategy achieves significantly better results than the multi-level approach, but requires defining an ideal number of small grammars to achieve the best performance. We also show that the hierarchical grammar approach using the division of population size strategy achieves significantly better results than the multi-level approach. However the division of population size strategy is less sensitive to the number of small grammars.},

A genetic algorithm tunes potential field parameters to reposition UAVs to create and maintain a mesh network that maximizes user bandwidth coverage and network lifetime. Results show that our evolutionary adaptive network deployment algorithm outperforms the current state of the art by better repositioning the unmanned aerial vehicles to provide longer coverage lifetimes while serving bandwidth requirements. The parameters found by the genetic algorithm on four training scenarios with different user distributions lead to better performance than achieved by the state of the art.

  abstract  = {Text classification is one of the most important tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing. There are many approaches that focus on two main aspects: generating an effective representation; and selecting and refining algorithms to build the classification model. Traditional machine learning methods represent documents in vector space using features such as term frequencies, which have limitations in handling the order and semantics of words. Meanwhile, although achieving many successes, deep learning classifiers require substantial resources in terms of labelled data and computational complexity. In this work, a weighted ensemble of classifiers (WEC) is introduced to address the text classification problem. Instead of using majority vote as the combining method, we propose to associate each classifier&#39;s prediction with a different weight when combining classifiers. The optimal weights are obtained by minimising a loss function on the training data with the Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm. We conducted experiments on 5 popular datasets and report classification performance of algorithms with classification accuracy and macro F1 score. WEC was run with several different combinations of traditional machine learning and deep learning classifiers to show its flexibility and robustness. Experimental results confirm the advantage of WEC, especially on smaller datasets.},

However, the progress in automating the ship design process which is still very human dependent, is slow. This paper introduces an automated ship design and optimisation concept by Hybridising Evolutionary Algorithm and Morphing (HEAM) to enable a more intelligent and efficient ship design process. It maps the entire ship hull form into a genotype using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and flexible modification through morphing to create efficient designs for the hull form. This new method achieves predictive designs with a performance improvement of 11.67\%, while achieving increased efficiency and minimum user dependency.},

  abstract  = {The efficiency of tensor operators is key to implement fast deep learning models. However, identifying the fastest implementation of a tensor operator for a target hardware is challenging. A wide range of different configurations have to be considered, and the evaluation of a configuration is time consuming as it requires compilation and execution of the operator. A common approach to address these issues is to boost traditional optimization algorithms with a surrogate modet, i.e., a machine learning model that approximates the objective function and is cheap to query compared to the target hardware. However, as the surrogate model grows in complexity, so does the time needed to train and maintain it. In this work, we propose to use an evolutionary optimizer and augment it with a non-parametric surrogate model (a weighted k-Nearest-Neighbor regression). We evaluate our approach on the convolution layers of a ResNetl8, and show a convergence speedup of up to 1.4×; when compared to baseline operator tuners.},

  abstract  = {Multi-Point Dynamic Aggregation (MPDA) is a novel task model to determine task allocation for a multi-robot system. In an MPDA scenario, several robots with different abilities aim to complete a set of tasks cooperatively. The demand of each task is time varying. It increases over time at a certain rate (e.g. the bush fire in Australia). When a robot executes a task, the demand of the task decreases at another certain rate, depending on the robot&#39;s ability. In this paper, the objective is to design a task plan for minimising the maximal completed time of all tasks. But coupling cooperative and time-varying characteristics of MPDA brings great challenges to modelling, decoding, and optimisation. In this paper, a multi-permutation encoding is used to represent every robot&#39;s visiting sequence of tasks, and an implicit decoding strategy with heuristic rules is designed to simplify the problem from a hybrid variable optimisation to a multi-permutation optimisation. Memetic algorithms for the task allocation of MPDA with two local search methods are designed: equality one-step local search with a better exploration ability and elite multi-step local search with a better exploitation ability. Computational experiments show that the proposed decoding method leads to a better performance given the same computational time budget. Experimental results also show that the proposed memetic algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art method in solving the task planning problems of MPDA.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates optimal power flow management problem in an electric vehicle charging station. The charging station is powered by solar PV and is tied to the grid and a battery storage system through necessary power conversion interfaces for DC fast charging. The optimal power management problem for EV charging is solved via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike classical optimization methods such as dynamic programming, linear programming (LP) and mixed-integer linear programming which are limited in handling stochastic problems adequately and are slow due to the curse of dimensionality when used for large dynamic problems, RL does not have to iterate for every time step as learning can be done completely offline and optimal solutions saved in a lookup table, from which optimal control actions can be retrieved almost instantaneously. The optimization problem in this paper is defined as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a modified Q-learning algorithm that indexes both states and control actions in a hash-table (dictionary) fashion is used to solve it. The algorithm is tested with a typical load curve over a 24-hour horizon. The simulations results demonstrate that the modified Q-learning algorithm achieves higher total rewards and returns a 14\% lower global cost than the conventional Q-learning formulation.},

In this paper, a multi-objective FJSP model is formulated with the objectives of minimizing the makespan and energy consumption considering strong transportation constraints. Two popular multi-objective optimization solver including Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and A Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) are employed and compared in a real-world instance of the FJSP, associated with novel coding schemes.

The process of controlling the type of images located by applying necrosis is found to be a simple and efficient technique, in comparison to writing more complex fitness functions for the original evolutionary computation system. Two kinds of necrosis are tested, a soft shape based system and a crisp entropy based system. Both sorts of necrosis are found to be able to steer evolution effectively, with the shape based necrosis working well, and the entropy based necrosis having some problems when more extreme forms of necrosis driven filtration are employed. Possible generalizations to steering other evolutionary optimization tasks are outlined.},

In the literature, many research studies have been proposed to improve the search performance of EAs, such as cooperative co-evolution, embedding, and new search operator design. Among those, memetic multi-agent optimization (MeMAO) is a recently proposed paradigm for high-dimensional problems by using random embeddings. It demonstrated high efficacy with the assumption of “effective dimension However, as prior knowledge is always unknown for a given problem, this method may fail on the large-scale problems that do not have low effective dimensions. Taking this cue, we propose an evolutionary multitasking (EMT) assisted random embedding method (EMT-RE) for solving large-scale optimization problems. Instead of conducting a search on the randomly embedded space directly, we treat the embedded task as the auxiliary task for the given problem. By performing EMT with both the given problem and the randomly embedded task, not only the useful solutions found along the search can be transferred across tasks toward efficient problem solving, but the effectiveness of the search on problems Without a low effective dimensionality is also guaranteed. To evaluate the performance of newly proposed EMT-RE, comprehensive empirical studies are carried out on 8 synthetic continuous optimization functions with up to 2,000 dimensions.},

Several ensemble methods were proposed to solve the multilabel classification problem. However, most of them simply create diversity in the ensemble by following a random procedure and give the same importance to all members. In this paper, we propose a Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming algorithm to build ensembles of multi-label classifiers. Given a pool of multilabel classifiers, each of them modeling dependencies among a subset of k labels, they are combined into a tree-shaped ensemble. At each node of the tree, predictions of its children nodes are combined, while each leaf represents a classifier from the pool. We propose two configurations for the method: using a fixed value of k for all classifiers in the pool, or using a variable value of k for each classifier, thus being able to capture relationships among groups of labels of different size in the ensemble. The experiments performed over sixteen multi-label dataset and using five evaluation metrics demonstrated that our method performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art ensembles of multilabel classifiers.},

The structure of a personal contact network has great impact upon both epidemic duration and the total number of infected individuals. A vaccine, with varying degrees of success, can reduce both the length and spread of an epidemic, but in the case of a limited supply of vaccine a vaccination strategy must be chosen, and this has a significant effect on epidemic behaviour.In this study we consider four different vaccination strategies and compare their effects upon epidemic duration and spread. These are random vaccination, high degree vaccination, ring vaccination, and the base case of no vaccination. All vaccinations are applied as the epidemic progresses, as opposed to in advance. The strategies are initially applied to static personal contact networks that are known ahead of time. They are then applied to personal contact networks that are evolved as the vaccination strategy is applied. When any form of vaccination is applied, all strategies reduce both duration and spread of the epidemic. When applied to a static network, random vaccination performs poorly in terms of reducing epidemic duration in comparison to strategies that take into account connectivity of the network. However, it performs surprisingly well when applied on the evolved networks, possibly because the evolutionary algorithm is unable to take advantage of a fixed strategy.},

  abstract  = {Pressure drop prediction is critical to the design and performance of cyclone separators as industrial gas cleaning devices. The complex non-linear relationship between cyclone Pressure Drop Coefficient (PDC) and geometrical dimensions suffice the need for state-of-the-art predictive modelling methods. Existing solutions have applied theoretical/semi-empirical techniques which fail to generalise well, and the suitability of intelligent techniques has not been widely explored for the task of pressure drop prediction in cyclone separators. To this end, this paper firstly introduces a fuzzy modelling methodology, then presents an alternative version of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to train a Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN). The Lagrange dual formulation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model is also deployed for comparison purposes. For optimal design of these models, manual and grid search techniques are used in a cross-validation setting subsequent to training. Based on the prediction accuracy of PDC, results show that the Fuzzy System (FS) is highly performing with testing mean squared error (MSE) of 3.97e-04 and correlation coefficient (R) of 99.70\%. Furthermore, a significant improvement of EKF-trained network (MSE = 1.62e-04, R = 99.82\%) over the traditional Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) (MSE = 4.87e-04, R = 99.53\%) is observed. SVM gives better prediction with radial basis kernel (MSE = 2.22e-04, R = 99.75\%) and provides comparable performance to universal approximators. Of the conventional models considered, the model of Shepherd and Lapple (MSE = 7.3e-03, R = 97.88\%) gives the best result which is still inferior to the intelligent models.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new sequential estimation method for simultaneously estimating states and parameters of a state space model. Particle filter (PF) is known as a method that can estimate states in difficult sequential state estimation problems with nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity. PF updates an ensemble consisting of multiple particles representing states of a state space model in order to estimate the true state, based on observation, at each time step. However, when PF estimates not only states but also parameters of the state space model at the same time, it is observed that the estimation accuracy deteriorates. When estimating both states and parameters, PF utilizes particles representing states and particles. In order to overcome the problem of PF, we propose a new method that sequentially estimates states by PF and parameters by the separable natural evolution strategy (SNES). SNES is one of the most powerful black-box function optimization methods. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare the performance of the proposed method and that of PF using two nonlinear state space models, the Van der Pol model and the Lorenz model. In the Van der Pol model, the median MSE values of the state and the parameter of the proposed method were 0.003610 and 0.01468 and those of PF were 4.228 and 6.520, respectively. In the Lorenz model, the median MSE values of the state and the parameter of the proposed method were 0.002639 and 0.003479 and those of PF were 309.5 and 1.470, respectively. The smaller MSE is, the better the performance is.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, Multifactorial optimization (MFO) has gained a notable momentum in the research community. MFO is known for its inherent capability to efficiently address multiple optimization tasks at the same time, while transferring information among such tasks to improve their convergence speed. On the other hand, the quantum leap made by Deep Q Learning (DQL) in the Machine Learning field has allowed facing Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems of unprecedented complexity. Unfortunately, complex DQL models usually find it difficult to converge to optimal policies due to the lack of exploration or sparse rewards. In order to overcome these drawbacks, pre-trained models are widely harnessed via Transfer Learning, extrapolating knowledge acquired in a source task to the target task. Besides, meta-heuristic optimization has been shown to reduce the lack of exploration of DQL models. This work proposes a MFO framework capable of simultaneously evolving several DQL models towards solving interrelated RL tasks. Specifically, our proposed framework blends together the benefits of meta-heuristic optimization, Transfer Learning and DQL to automate the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning of distributed RL agents. A thorough experimentation is presented and discussed so as to assess the performance of the framework, its comparison to the traditional methodology for Transfer Learning in terms of convergence, speed and policy quality, and the intertask relationships found and exploited over the search process.},

We propose Local Covering, a niche-based rule generation method for XCS, to reduce the sensitivity of a hyperparameter that determines the generalization probability of initial rules. In Local Covering, the system looks up classifiers in the population and finds the closest match from the input. After that, the selected classifier is copied as the covering classifier and its condition is generalized to cover the input. To integrate the Local Covering method with XCS, XCS-LCPCI (XCS with Local Covering for Previously Covered Inputs) is proposed, which executes Local Covering only if the input has been previously covered by the covering processes. The experimental results with three different problems show that XCS-LCPCI successfully acquires the general classifiers with any of six different parameter settings, while the performance of the conventional XCS varies depending on the parameter settings.},

  abstract  = {Transfer learning has been considered a key solution for the problem of learning when there is a lack of knowledge in some target domains. Its idea is to benefit from the learning on different (but related in some way) domains that have adequate knowledge and transfer what can improve the learning in the target domains. Although incompleteness is one of the main causes of knowledge shortage in many machine learning real-world tasks, it has received a little effort to be addressed by transfer learning. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, there is no single study to utilize transfer learning for the symbolic regression task when the underlying data are incomplete. The current work addresses this point by presenting a transfer learning method for symbolic regression on data with high ratios of missing values. A multi-tree genetic programming algorithm based feature-based transformation is proposed for transferring data from a complete source domain to a different, incomplete target domain. The experimental work has been conducted on real-world data sets considering different transfer learning scenarios each is determined based on three factors: missingness ratio, domain difference, and task similarity. In most cases, the proposed method achieved positive transductive transfer learning in both homogeneous and heterogeneous domains. Moreover, even with less significant success, the obtained results show the applicability of the proposed approach for inductive transfer learning.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have witnessed an escalating interest for methods that automatically adapt to different types of problems. In this regard, the term hyper-heuristics-heuristics that either select or generate new heuristics-is a relevant concept. Experimental evidence supports the idea that hyperheuristics can outperform single, isolated heuristics. However, commonly used hyper-heuristic models require several inputs. One of them is a set of features that accurately characterize the instances, which limits their applicability. Thus, in this work, we analyze how to implement a simple evolutionary algorithm to produce feature-independent hyper-heuristics. We compare its performance against that of simple heuristics, for the domain of the knapsack problem. Our research focuses on two elements: performance and frequency. In the former, we analyze how the performance of the learning stage varies across different scenarios. In the latter, we examine how frequently heuristics interact within the hyper-heuristic. We show that the proposed hyper-heuristic model solves most of the instances considered in this work. Moreover, it does so more efficiently than isolated heuristics. At the same time, the model offers a straightforward parameter setting and requires little or no problem characterization, which simplifies its use on new problem domains.},

Based on standard genetic algorithm, the generating strategy of the initial population is improved to prevent the emergence of non-feasible solutions, and an improved adaptive operator is introduced to improve the population ability for escaping local optimal solutions and avoid premature phenomena. Moreover, to speed up the convergence of the proposed algorithm, the simulated annealing strategy is utilized in mutation operations.

  abstract  = {Many real-world problems can be formulated as the optimization of a continuous function. Furthermore, these problems are becoming increasingly more complex every year, reaching, or even exceeding, the thousand of variables. Evolutionary Algorithms have been traditionally successful at solving this kind of problems, due to their good balance in terms of solution quality and computation time. However, the aforementioned growth in the size of the problems requires of novel approaches to deal with the increased complexity of larger solutions spaces. Hybrid evolutionary algorithms are a powerful alternative in these scenarios as they are able to combine the strengths of multiple search methods to solve more complex problems. These hybrid approaches normally do not pay attention to the execution order of their components, being the most frequent strategy to always run them in a predefined sequence. In this contribution we study the role of execution order in hybrid evolutionary algorithms within the context of the multiple offspring sampling framework, one of the best algorithms in large-scale global optimization. As shown in the experimentation, a proper execution order policy can boost the performance of MOS to improve the results of other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, despite recent developments, in the case of permutation-based combinatorial optimization problems, there are still many aspects that deserve further research. One of them is the influence of the codification employed to represent the solutions on the overall performance of the algorithm. When considering classical EDAs, optimizing permutation problems is challenging, and specific mechanisms are needed to hold the restrictions associated with the permutation nature of solutions.In this paper, in addition to the permutation-vector codification, we investigate alternative representations to describe solutions of permutation problems in the context of EDAs. In order to evaluate their influence, we adopted a classical EDA and conducted an experimental study on two different permutation problems and representations for codifying solutions. The results revealed a narrow relationship between the type of combinatorial problem optimized and the selected representation used to codify its solutions. Moreover, the results point out that choosing the appropriate representation to codify solutions of the given permutation problem is critical for the performance of the algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has become a remarkable tool in solving many real-world problems of computer vision in recent years. However, the designing of most of CNN architectures is manual, which requires a significant trial and error methodology as CNN&#39;s performance highly relies on their architectures. Thus, it gets arduous to design a promising CNN architecture without having sufficient domain knowledge and human expertise. In this paper, we attempt to explore the possibility of using Genetic Algorithm to design CNN architectures automatically. The CNN architecture proposed by the Genetic Algorithm is trained from scratch using Gradient- Descent Algorithm and evaluated on a validation set at each evolutionary step. The algorithm does not require any preprocessing of the data before its execution, nor any post-processing on the evolved CNN architecture. We propose an encoding scheme for determining the layer connectivity. This scheme allows the formation of skip connections within the CNN architecture. Along with the encoding scheme, the filter dimensions, and the number of nodes in the fully-connected layer are also genetically evolved during the subsequent evolution using standard genetic operators, namely selection, mutation, and crossover. We have specified algorithms for the formation of the CNN model by combining the information about the encoding scheme, filter dimensions, and the number of nodes of the fully-connected layer in addition to the genetic operations.The proposed algorithm is tested on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition and Fashion-MNIST dataset. Our experiments have shown that the algorithm is capable of successfully generating high-quality CNN architectures, which are less studied before.},

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are global optimization meta-heuristics known for their capabilities to find optimal solutions even when dealing with hard and complex problems. Although many EAs are based on competitive behavior among individuals, its is known that cooperation may lead to better solutions then sheer competition. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis among four state-of-the-art EAs (Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization and Group Search Optimization), implemented in both competitive and cooperative frameworks, in the context of data clustering problem. Experiments are executed using eleven real world benchmark datasets as the testing bed, so we could access whether competitive or cooperative behaviors would prevail.

The genetic programming (GP) community has systematically pointed out as one of the major advantages of GP the fact that it produces models that can be interpreted by humans. However, as other interpretable supervised models, the more complex the model becomes, the less interpretable it is. This work focuses on post-hoc interpretability of GP for symbolic regression. This approach does not explain the process followed by a model to reach a decision. Instead, it justifies the predictions it makes. The proposed approach, named Explanation by Local Approximation (ELA), is simple and model agnostic: it finds the nearest neighbors of the point we want to explain and performs a linear regression using this subset of points. The coefficients of this linear regression are then used to generate a local explanation to the model. Results show that the errors of ELA are similar to those of the regression performed with all points. It also shows that simple visualizations can provide insights to the users about the most relevant attributes.},

Additionally, a general explanation of the data set is provided, presenting the samples gathered by a cooperative multi-agent system developed for detecting improvised explosive devices. The results show that input samples affect the performance of the output decisions, and a decision-making system can be less sensitive to sensor noise with intelligent systems obtained from a diverse and suitably organised training set.},

  abstract  = {One of the widely used models for studying economics of climate change is the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy (DICE), which has been developed by Professor William Nordhaus, one of the laureates of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Originally a single-objective optimal control problem has been defined on DICE dynamics, which is aimed to maximize the social welfare. In this paper, a bi-objective optimal control problem defined on DICE model, objectives of which are maximizing social welfare and minimizing the temperature deviation of atmosphere. This multi-objective optimal control problem solved using NonDominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) also it is compared to previous works on single-objective version of the problem. The resulting Pareto front rediscovers the previous results and generalizes to a wide range of non-dominant solutions to minimize the global temperature deviation while optimizing the economic welfare. The previously used single-objective approach is unable to create such a variety of possibilities, hence, its offered solution is limited in vision and reachable performance. Beside this, resulting Pareto-optimal set reveals the fact that temperature deviation cannot go below a certain lower limit, unless we have significant technology advancement or positive change in global conditions.},

We first construct a surrogate model for each objective function. After that, some candidate solutions from the surrogate models are used to produce promising offspring for the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In addition, a prescreening criterion based on reference vectors and the nondominated rank is used to select the surviving offspring and exactly evaluated individuals. The pre-screening criterion can ensure the diversity and convergence of the offspring, and reduce function evaluations. Benchmark problems with their dimensions varying from 8 to 30 are used to test the effects of the surrogate-assisted offspring generation method under the framework of using the pre-screening criterion. Experimental results show that using the candidate solutions from surrogate models can enhance the performance of its basic algorithm on most of the problems.},

  abstract  = {Differential evolution was mainly proposed for solving optimization problems with continuous decision variables because of its Euclidean distance-based learning concept. This made it unsuitable for many binary and discrete problems. However, several studies approved the applicability of differential evolution algorithm for effectively solving such problems. In this paper, a new design of differential evolution, which incorporates mapping and repairing methods, modified mutation operator and local searches, is proposed to solve the complex multicomponents traveling thief problems that are characterized by both binary and discrete parameters. Also, a novel initialization and repairing method, which enables differential evolution&#39;s operators to only evolve solutions of one component and optimally distribute/update the solutions of the other one with considering the inter-dependency between both components, is introduced. To judge the performance of the proposed algorithm, 13 strongly correlated instances of traveling thief problems have been solved and the results have been compared with those from 24 selfdesigned and state-of-the-art algorithms. Results demonstrated the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the quality of obtained solutions and computational time.},

The definition of the proposed problem involves the combination of two important concepts that are currently being widely used in the field of transportation: car rental and ride-sharing. This paper defines the CaRSP and presents four evolutionary algorithms to solve it: a genetic algorithm, a memetic algorithm and hybridizations of both using transgenetic vectors (transposons and recombinant plasmids). The metaheuristics are tested in a set of 30 Euclidean, non-Euclidean, symmetric and asymmetric instances. We use a framework to define the best parameter settings for each algorithm. Computational experiments are performed in two stages to ensure the algorithms are compared properly. The obtained results are submitted to statistical analysis.

In particular, this algorithm is first tested on three space trajectory bi-objective test problems: an Earth-Mars transfer, an Earth-Venus transfer and a bi-objective version of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission (the first large-class mission of the European Space Agency&#39;s Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme). Finally, the algorithm is applied to a four-objectives low-thrust problem that describes the journey of a solar sail towards a polar orbit around the Sun. The results on both the test cases and the more complex problem are reported by comparing the novel algorithm performances with those of two popular multi-objective optimizers (i.e., a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition) in terms of hypervolume metric. The numerical results of this study show that the multi-objective hypervolume-based ant colony optimization algorithm is not only competitive with the standard multi-objective algorithms when applied to the space trajectory test cases, but it can also provide better Pareto fronts in terms of hypervolume values when applied to the complex solar sailing mission.},

  abstract  = {Surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have attracted much research attention in solving computationally expensive optimization problems. They show excellent performance on low-dimensional optimization problems by saving a large number of real fitness evaluations, but generally fail on high-dimensional problems due to the contradiction between the huge solution space and the limited computational resources. To alleviate this issue, this study attempts to scale up radial basis function (RBF), which is a kind of widely used surrogate model, by taking advantage of the random projection (RP) technique, and thus develops a RP-based RBF (RP-RBF). Different from existing methods that directly train RBF in the original solution space, RP-RBF first randomly projects the original high-dimensional solution space onto many low-dimensional subspaces, and then trains an RBF in each subspace. The resulting low-dimensional RBFs are finally used together to approximate the fitness values of new candidate solutions. The introduction of RP greatly reduces the number of training samples required by RBF on the one hand, and helps RBF still capture the main characteristics of the original problems on the other hand. To verify the effectiveness of RP-RBF, this study integrates it with a differential evolution (DE) and develops a novel SAEA named RP-RBF-DE. Experimental results on a set of 12 benchmark functions demonstrate that RP-RBF significantly improves the accuracy of the traditional RBF and RP-RBF-DE outperforms the traditional DE and a general RBF-assisted DE.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, connectivity among communication devices in networks has been playing a significant role, especially when the number of devices is increasing dramatically that requires network service providers to have a better architecture of management system. One of the popular approach is to divide those devices inside a network into different domains, in which the problem of minimizing path computation in general or Inter-Domain Path Computation under Domain Uniqueness constraint (IDPC-DU) problem in specific has received much attention from the research community. Since the IDPC-DU is NP-complete, an approximate approach is usually taken to tackle this problem when the dimensionality is high. Although Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has emerged as an effective approximation algorithm to deal with various fields of problems, there are still some difficulties to apply directly MFEA to solve the IDPC-DU problem, i.e. different chromosomes may have different numbers of genes or to construct a feasible solution not violating the problem&#39;s constraint. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, MFEA algorithm with a new solution representation based on Priority-based Encoding is introduced. With the new representation of the solution, a chromosome consists of two parts: the first part encodes the priority of the vertex while the second part encodes information of edges in the solution. Besides, the paper also proposed a corresponding decoding method as well as novel crossover and mutation operators. Those evolutionary operators always produce valid solutions. For examining the efficiency of the proposed MFEA, experiments on a wide range of test sets of instances were implemented and the results pointed out the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the characteristics of the proposed algorithm are also indicated and carefully analyzed.},

However, such methods only use a single simulated annealing cooling schedule even though literature covers many schedules with varied convergence and performances guarantees. Since existing RNA Design cooling schedule surveys only cover at most four RNA design problems over two simulated annealing variants, we investigate the performance of four major simulated annealing schedules with ten variants on twenty-nine RNA design sequences. Relevant findings include a) the insensitivity of geometric schedule parameters, b) that logarithmic cooling schedules can solve RNA Design problems not solved by other schedules, c) suggestions for adjusting geometric schedule stopping conditions, and d) identifying common issues in popular adaptive and non-adaptive schedules for RNA Design.},

When a dynamic is detected in the changing environment, most of existing prediction-based strategies predict the trajectory of changing Pareto-optimal solutions (POS), based on the historical solutions obtained in the solution space. In this paper, we present a new prediction method to track the moving optima for solving DMOP. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose to build the prediction model in the objective space. As the evaluation for solving a DMOP is based on the Pareto-optimal front (POF), to predict directly in the objective space could provide more useful information than the prediction in the solution space. In particular, to efficiently capture the complex relationships among POFs found along the evolutionary search, here we build a prediction model in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, which holds a closed-form solution. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, empirical studies have been conducted by comparing against three state-of-the-art prediction-based strategies on fourteen commonly used DMOP benchmarks. The results obtained by using different optimization solvers confirmed the superiority of the proposed method for solving DMOP in terms of both solution quality and time efficiency.},

Impressive results have been achieved, including substantial speedups, using simple operations that replace, swap and delete lines or statements within the code. Often this is achieved by specialising code, removing parts that are unnecessary for particular use-cases. Previous work has shown that there is a great deal of potential in targeting more specialised operations that modify the code to achieve the same functionality in a different way. We propose six new edit types for Genetic Improvement of Java software, based on the insertion of break, continue and return statements. The idea is to add shortcuts that allow parts of the program to be skipped in order to speed it up. 10000 randomlygenerated instances of each edit were applied to three opensource applications taken from GitHub. The key findings are: (1) compilation rates for inserted statements without surrounding “if” statements are 1.3-18.3\%; (2) edits where the inserted statement is embedded within an “if” have compilation rates of 3.2-55.8\%; (3) of those that compiled, all 6 edits have a high rate of passing tests (Neutral Variant Rate), &gt;60\% in all but one case, and so have the potential to be performance improving edits.

  abstract  = {This study presents an offline learning Simulated Annealing approach to generate a constructive hyper-heuristic evaluated through training and testing on a set of instances for solving the Job-Shop Scheduling problem. The generated hyperheuristic uses a range of state features to control a set of low-level constructive heuristics. A hyper-heuristic is represented in terms of a set of rules, where each rule contains a fixed set of values for the features in consideration and the low level heuristic to be invoked. At each constructive step, the `closest&#39; rule is selected and then the corresponding constructive low level heuristic is applied. Our distance metric is the Euclidean distance between the values within the rule and the state features characterising the partial schedule along with the remaining jobs to be scheduled for the partial solution. In this paper, we study a set of features computed with various well-known metrics and different feature transformation methods for improving the characterization of the problem instances and solutions to Job-Shop Scheduling as a part of our approach. Eight different scenarios are evaluated on a set of randomly generated problem instances. Each scenario represents a distinct approach combining a different feature transformation applied during the training and testing phases. The empirical results show that transformations can improve the spread of feature values and the choice of the transformation methods is influential on the performance of the overall approach. A particular choice generates a slightly better performance when compared to the standard approach, which uses the original features at all times, indicating the potential of the proposed approach for the future studies.},

  abstract  = {Hyper-heuristics are potent techniques that represent the synergy of low-level heuristics when solving optimization problems. This synergy usually leads to better solutions. Similarly, fuzzy logic has been successfully applied to several domains, thanks to the expert knowledge it encompasses. Thus, combining the benefits of both approaches should lead to a more reliable and effective method. Hence, in this work, we propose a fuzzy-based selection hyper-heuristic model. We considered seven features and four low-level heuristics, which represent the inputs and output of the fuzzy inference system, respectively. Each input was defined with two membership functions. Since there is no expert knowledge available, we lay out all the rules (128) and use a genetic algorithm to find optimum values for the consequents of these rules. In other words, the genetic algorithm will evolve the rules of the fuzzy inference system until it become an expert, and will then save such knowledge as the set of fuzzy rules. The main concern of this paper is to find out if a fuzzy inference system can help to get better results in the inner working of a hyperheuristic. To prove this, we make a comparison between a fuzzy hyper-heuristic model optimized by a genetic algorithm against three traditional selection hyper-heuristic models (with a different number of rules) optimized by a particle swarm optimization method. We applied all these methods using the same set of low-level heuristics to solve an 800 instance set of the 0-1 Knapsack problem as a testbed.},

However, the process of the structural determination of these molecules is expensive and time-consuming. In order to reduce these factors, computational methods might be a provocative approach, despite the complexity associated with it. Over the decades, different computational approaches were proposed as well as different energy force fields. As the force fields consider conflicting terms in its composition, multi-objective optimization approaches showed to be suitable to the Protein Structure Prediction problem. In this way, the objective of the current work is to evaluate and compare three multi-objective algorithms, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm in its second version, the Generalized Differential Evolution in its third version, and the Differential Evolution Multi-Objective. We split the score3 energy function provided by Rosetta into a bi-objective problem. The first objective considers only the non-bonded van der Waals, while the second one is composed of bonded-terms and a secondary structure reinforcement score. Moreover, structural information provided by the Angle Probability List is considered, since this kind of information proved to be reliable in single-objective approaches. Results obtained are analyzed using GDT and RMSD metrics, showing the better capability of Differential Evolution based methods for the problem.},

  abstract  = {Over the last few decades, many solution approaches have been developed for solving different variants of resourceconstrained project scheduling problems (RCPSPs). In most of them, it is assumed that a project consists of some homogeneous activities that require all types of resources over the entire project horizon. On the contrary, many real-world projects consist of heterogeneous activities that use different types of resources at different time instants during the project execution. The application of existing approaches, developed for RCPSPs with homogeneous activities, in solving RCPSPs with heterogeneous activities is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a heuristic embedded genetic algorithm to address RCPSPs with heterogeneous activities. Two heuristics are proposed to obtain high-quality feasible solutions. The first heuristic is based on priority rules while the second one based on a new neighbourhood swapping matrix. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we solve a number of real-world and modified test problems, and the obtained results are compared with an existing algorithm. It is found that the proposed approach obtains highquality solutions with a significantly lower computational time compared to other algorithms.},

  abstract  = {The Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is an important combinatorial optimisation problem with extensive real-world applications. Genetic Programming (GP) has shown effectiveness in automatically evolving routing policies to handle the uncertain environment in UCARP. However, whenever a UCARP scenario changes, e.g. when a new vehicle is bought, the previously trained routing policy may no longer work effectively, and one has to retrain a new policy. Retraining a new policy from scratch can be time-consuming but the transfer of knowledge gained from solving the previous similar scenarios may help improve the efficiency of the retraining process. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method by learning the probability distribution of good solutions from source domains and modelling it as a probabilistic prototype tree. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of capturing more information about the source domain compared to transfer learning based on (sub-)tree transfers and even create good trees that are not seen in source domains. Our experimental results showed that our method made the retraining process more efficient and one can obtain an initial state for solving difficult problems that is significantly better than existing methods. The final performance of all algorithms, were comparable, implying that there was no negative transfer.},

At each iteration, MOEA/D generates an offspring solution from a parent&#39;s neighborhood. The new solution is evaluated, and, according to the decomposition approach, it can replace one or more solutions from the neighborhood, maintaining the population updated. In this sense, MOEA/D can be considered as a steady-state algorithm that maintains updated its population once a new solution is generated. In this work, we investigate the performance of MOEA/D in the multi-objective 0/1 knapsack problem considering a steady-state version and a proposed generational version. We explore the benefits of the generational version proposed in this paper. According to results, we show that the proposed approach can obtain a suitable performance in the multi-objective 0/1 knapsack problem employing between two and eight objective functions. Additionally, we propose a two-stage hybrid algorithm that employs the two different approaches of MOEA/D (i.e., the steady-state and generational versions). Our results reveal that the proposed hybrid approach can outperform the original MOEA/D in the many-objective settings of the 0/1 knapsack problem.},

By conducting two-sample statistical tests (T-Test, F-Test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, and Rank-Sum Test) for all combinations of FLA metrics, we demonstrate that our proposed metrics result in significantly different distributions.

Therefore, this paper proposes an s-shape constraint-handling method in push and pull search (SLSHADE-PPS), which divides the whole evolutionary process into two phases, called push search phase and pull search phase respectively. The push search phase mainly focuses on the value of the objective function and uses LSHADE to push the population into the optimal region of the objective function. In the pull search phase, the s-shape constraint handling technique is combined with LSHADE to pull the infeasible individuals back to feasible region. The s-shape function makes the violation tolerance maintain high level at the start stage and strictly limits the solutions to reside in the feasible region at the end stage of pull phase. SLSHADE-PPS shows significant advantages over the state-of-the-art constraint algorithms on the 28 benchmark test functions from IEEE CEC2017.},

Now, more and more researchers have paid attentions to the representation of CFA since its crucial role in the process of reconstructing the full color image. The representation of CFA in frequency domain records all the frequency information of image mosaicked with the CFA, thus provides a theoretical approach to design the CFA. However, almost all the existing CFA design methods in frequency domain have limitations. In this paper, we propose a new automatic CFA design method in frequency domain. We choose the optimal frequency structures which satisfy all the design principles through a novel coded multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) at first. Then we convert the parameters optimization of the given frequency structures into a constraint single optimization problem, and we solve it by converting it into a multi-objective optimization problem without constraints which is hard to handle. So a MOEA with novel selection and crossover-mutate strategies is proposed to solve the model. The experimental results show that the proposed CFA design method has more advantage when compared with the other existing method.},

  abstract  = {False data injection attacks (FDIA) have drawn significant interests recently after the discovery of vulnerabilities of bad data detectors (BDD) deployed in the smart grid. While most FDIA analyses focused separately on the aspects of stealthiness, knowledge, resources, or expected consequences of the attack, few have evaluated the relationship and tradeoffs among these factors to identify the worst-case scenario in realistic operations. To fill the gap, this paper investigates a strictly stealthy FDIA scheme with multi-objective evolutionary optimization, which could compromise a small set of meters to inflict large impacts on the smart grid in realistic scenarios. Compared with existing attack schemes that relax the problem with the ℓ 1 -norm, the paper introduced the Improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) as the solver to directly obtain the ℓ 0 -sparse attack vector. Meanwhile, the unobservability is ensured by not only bypassing the BDD but also satisfying the physical and operational constraints. A three-step constraint handling technique is also proposed for the SPEA2 to ensure the stealthiness and improve the efficiency of attack vector identification in the worst-case scenario. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems demonstrate that the new multi-objective formulation discovers highly sparse attack vectors with significant impacts on the system without triggering immediate emergency responses. The influence of alternative objectives and constraints has also been evaluated to reveal the trade-offs among the attack&#39;s stealthiness, sparsity, and impact. The results are expected to facilitate better-informed risk assessment and mitigation with refined worst-case understandings.},

Pyramid takes its name from the architectural phenomenon of the Mayan pyramid in Chichen-Itza, which, although constructed from the bottom up, operates in a top down manner through interactions with the sun. This gives a two stage approach: initially we create our pyramid of experiments, with the most complex fitness functions at the bottom, and with increasingly more simplified/decomposed version as we move up through the pyramid. Runs start at the top of the pyramid and populations descend through it, decreasing in size, being exposed to increasingly complex fitness functions, until, at the bottom layer, we have small populations with the original full fitness function. We conduct experiments comparing the performance of Pyramid for a suite of difficult unimodal and multimodal functions.

  abstract  = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely used and effective deep learning methods for image classification tasks. But the architecture of CNN such as LetNet and AlexNet were designed elaborately by experts because designing the neural networks is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This paper proposed a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm to search the neural architectures. First, we encode CNNs into quantum chromosomes and distinguish these chromosomes from the Convolutional Layer, Pooling Layer, Fully-connected Layer and Disabled Layer with its range. Second, quantum chromosomes are updated by applying quantum gates and find the best individual with quantum genetic algorithm. Third, we can predict the network performance after a few steps of stochastic gradient descent by means of evaluation estimate strategy so that we can stop training the bad networks early, which can speed up evolutionary process. The proposed algorithm is examined and compared with some state-of-art methods for image classification in three benchmark datasets. The experimental results prove the proposed algorithm can search a strong classifier robustly. In addition, it performs better than the general evolutionary algorithm. More importantly, with the help of evaluation estimate strategy, it is substantially faster than the algorithms without evaluation estimate strategy which means we can take less time to search a good network for the given task.},

This has direct application to cryptanalysis of RSA, as one means of breaking such a cryptosystem requires factorization of a large number that is the product of two prime numbers. This paper applies three different genetic algorithms to solve this issue, utilizing mathematical knowledge concerning distribution of primes to improve the algorithms. The best of the three genetic algorithms has a chromosome that represents m in the equation prime = 6 m ± 1, and is able to factor a number of up to 22 decimal digits. This is a significantly larger number than the largest factored by comparable methods in earlier work. This leads to the conclusion that approaches such as genetic algorithms are a promising avenue of research into the problem of integer factorization.},

An artificial neural network is employed to classify the new instances based on the up-to-date obtained set of relevant features efficiently. Our algorithm exploits a detection mechanism for the severity of changes to estimate the severity level of occurred changes and adaptively replies to these changes by introducing diversity to algorithm solutions. Furthermore, a fixed-size memory is used to store the good solutions and reuse them after each change to accelerate the convergence and searching process of the algorithm.

  abstract  = {Surrogate-assisted memetic algorithm (SAMA) has been recognized to be an effective tool for computationally expensive optimization. The termination criterion of the local search in SAMA determines the allocation of limited computational resources between global and local search, and has a tremendous impact on the optimization performance. The commonly used termination criterion based on setting a limit to the local search depth can lead to premature termination or excessive stagnation iterations of the local search. This paper proposes a SAMA with adaptive patience criterion (SAMA/APC) to improve the efficiency of traditional SAMA. The SAMA/APC consists of three main subprocedures, which are carried out iteratively. First, the operators of differential evolution (DE) are employed for global exploration. Then, the proposed Kriging-based patience allocation strategy (KPAS) is performed, which adaptively allocates a patience value to each individual of the population according to two basic principles. Third, the trust-region search (TRS) is carried out on each individual for local exploitation. The TRS is a process of consuming the patience, and it terminates when the patience value is reduced to zero. The local optimum obtained by the TRS is returned back to the population of DE in the spirit of Lamarckian learning. Experimental studies on the CEC&#39; 14 expensive optimization test suite demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SAMA/APC.},

The key to obtaining gains with parallel island models is the manipulation of migration parameters, since depending on how these parameters are handled the gains vary. Based on this assumption, this work uses three meta-heuristics: genetic algorithm, self-adjusting particle swarm optimization and social spider algorithm. From each metaheuristic, parallel island models were proposed, diversifying the number of natives on the islands, and the behavior of these models were studied. The assessment confirmed the impact of variations migration parameters on accuracy and performance as well as the importance on the number of natives located on the islands. The best solutions were obtained with island models from genetic algorithm and self-adjusting particle swarm optimization, and the best speedups were achieved with island models from social spider algorithm.},

Usually, the final population of an evolutionary algorithm is used as the output of multi-objective optimization. However, a current new trend is to select a pre-specified number of solutions from an unbounded external archive (UEA) as the final output of multi-objective optimization. Some subset selection methods have been proposed in the literature such as hypervolume-based and IGD-based selection. Recently, a distance-based subset selection (DSS) method was proposed for efficient subset selection from a large external archive. Whereas DSS efficiently finds a set of uniformly distributed solutions, it has some difficulties in the handling of solutions in the UEA as we demonstrate in this paper. To improve the performance of the DSS method, we propose a modified DSS method based on the IGD + distance instead of the Euclidean distance. Experimental results on various benchmark problems show that the modified DSS method performs better than or equal to the original DSS method on most test problems.},

To improve the convergence performance, an adaptive attenuation mechanism of scaling is proposed to dynamically adjust the exploration and exploitation properties. Evolutionary strategies such as selection, crossover and DE/rand/1 mutation are implemented in the proposed algorithm to enhance the exploration and exploitation abilities. Experimental results evaluated on several unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions indicate the significant improvement of the proposed algorithm to the original MQHOA.

A key difficulty with AMR diagnosis is that symptoms typically manifest when the graft is already damaged beyond repair. Diagnosis is also complicated by differing interpretations of histological data by pathologists, highlighting the urgent need for more quantitative approaches. In this paper we propose an ensemble classifier approach to predicting AMR status from gene expression data. We employ two random oversampling techniques - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic Oversampling (ADASYN) - to address the class imbalance in the original data set, and use particle swarm optimisation (PSO) for the selection of the ensemble hyperparameters. Our results demonstrate that applying the PSO-optimised ensemble to the balanced data set provides better predictive performance than the ensemble alone, and represents an important step towards more accurate sub-clinical prediction of AMR status and improved patient risk stratification.},

In this work, we propose a practical tuning method that uses a local search procedure that allows obtaining good calibrations in a reduced amount of time, compared to other well-known calibrators. Our tuner has an opposite-inspired learning component used to focus on the most promising areas of the parameter values search space and gathers useful parameter information that is provided to the user. We compare our proposal with two well-known tuners to calibrate two classical optimization problems. We also evaluate the relevance of the opposite-inspired learning component during the search process.

Uncertainties in the decision variables are often handled using explicit or implicit averaging methods, in which the fitness of a solution isjudged based on the objective values of neighbouring solutions. Explicit averaging methods are highly reliable but require additional objective function evaluation, which can significantly increases the overall computational cost of an optimization process. On the other hand, implicit averaging techniques are computationally cheap, yet they suffer from low reliability since they use the history of search in a population-based optimization algorithm. This work proposes a conditional Pareto optimal dominance to improve the reliability of robust optimization methods that use implicit averaging methods. The proposed method is applied to Multi-Objective Particle Swarm optimisation. Empirical study with a benchmark suite shows the benefit of the proposed conditional Pareto optimal dominance in locating robust solutions in multi-objective problems.},

Signalling retribution hearkens back to medieval sovereignty, insofar as the very word for gallows in French stems from the Latin word for power and serves as a grim symbol of the ruthlessness of high justice. Here, we introduce the mechanism of signalling an act of punishment and a special type of defector emerges, one who can recognise this signal and avoid punishment by way of fear. We describe the analytical conditions under which threat signalling can maintain high levels of cooperation. Moreover, we perform extensive agent-based simulations so as to confirm and expand our understanding of the external factors that influence the success of social punishment. We show that our suggested mechanism catalyses cooperation, even when signalling is costly or when punishment would be impractical. We observe the preventive nature of advertising retributive acts and we contend that the resulting social prosperity is a desirable outcome in the contexts of AI and multi-agent systems. To conclude, we argue that fear acts as an effective stimulus to pro-social behaviour.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks, which exploit wireless energy transfer technologies to address the energy constraint problem in traditional Wireless Sensor Networks, has emerged as a promising solution. There are two important factors that affect the performance of a charging process: charging path and charging time. In the literature, many studies have been done to propose efficient charging algorithms. However, most of the existing works focus only on optimizing the charging path. In this paper, we are the first one to jointly take into account both the charging path and charging time. Specifically, we aim at determining the optimal charging path and the charging time at each charging location to minimize the number of dead nodes. We first mathematically formulate the problem under mixed integer and linear programming. Then, we propose a periodic charging scheme, which is based on the Greedy and Genetic algorithm approaches. The experiment results show that our proposed the algorithm reduces significantly the number of dead nodes compared to a relevant benchmark.},

  abstract  = {Among the characteristics of traditional evolutionary algorithms governed by models, memory volatility is one of the most frequent. This is commonly due to the limitations of the models used to guide this kind of algorithms, which are generally very efficient when sampling, but tend to struggle when facing large amounts of data to represent. Neural networks are one type of model which conveniently thrives when facing vast amounts of data, and does not see its performance particularly worsened by large dimensionality. Several successful neural generative models, which could perfectly fit as a model for driving an evolutionary process are available in the literature. Whereas the behavior of these generative models in evolutionary algorithms has already been widely tested, other neural models -those intended for supervised learning-have not enjoyed that much attention from the research community. In this paper, we take one step forward in this direction, exploring the capacities and particularities of back-drive, a method that enables a neural model intended for regression to be used as a solution sampling model. In this context, by performing extensive research into the most influential aspects of the algorithm, we study the conditions which favor the performance of the back-drive algorithm as the sole guiding factor in an evolutionary approach.},

  abstract  = {In the last century, Albert Einstein&#39;s perceptions of the world afforded a revolution in the understanding of the universe. In his theory of general relativity, he describes the space-time continuum, a concept capable of explaining several phenomena, ranging from gravity to black holes and supernovas. Further, it also provides a set of formulations to generalize classical physics concepts to accommodate the relativistic notions. Meanwhile, several mathematicians have been working on optimization tools aiming to solve complex problems associated with a large number of variables. Nowadays, despite the computational power, many daily tasks still pose a challenge and are becoming more prohibitives, mostly due to the massive amount of data to be processed. Therefore, efficient optimization techniques are more desirable than ever. In this context, metaheuristic optimization has arisen, i.e., stochastic nature-inspired methods capable of finding sub-optimal solutions for complex problems with a reasonable computational effort. However, such approaches still suffer from some drawbacks related to low convergence and getting stuck on local optima, among others. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce relativistic concepts into the well-known meta-heuristic optimization technique Particle Swarm optimization (PSO). The experimental results evince the robustness of the proposed approach compared to the standard PSO as well as three other variations for five benchmarking functions.},

However, the limited driving range of EVs may require visits to recharging stations during their operation. These potential visits have to be addressed, avoiding unnecessary long detours. We formulate the electric capacitated vehicle routing problem (E-CVRP), which incorporates the possibility of EVs visiting a recharging station while satisfying the delivery demands of customers. The energy consumption of the EVs is proportional to their cargo load which is an important constraint in real-world logistics applications. A new set of benchmark instances is proposed for the E-CVRP. As solution methods to these new benchmarks, we apply the ant colony optimization metaheuristic method and an exact method. Experimental results on the ECVRP demonstrate the high complexity of the problem and the efficiency of the applied metaheuristic solution method.},

In the arena game mode, before each match, a player has to construct his deck choosing cards one by one from the previously unknown options. Such a scenario is difficult from the optimization point of view, as not only the fitness function is non-deterministic, but its value, even for a given problem instance, is impossible to be calculated directly and can only be estimated with simulation-based approaches. We propose a variant of the evolutionary algorithm that uses a concept of an active gene to reduce the range of the operators only to generation-specific subsequences of the genotype. Thus, we batched learning process and constrained evolutionary updates only to the cards relevant for the particular draft, without forgetting the knowledge from the previous tests. We developed and tested various implementations of this idea, investigating their performance by taking into account the computational cost of each variant. Performed experiments show that some of the introduced active-genes algorithms tend to learn faster and produce statistically better draft policies than the compared methods.},

  abstract  = {Feature selection and construction are important pre-processing techniques in data mining. They allow not only dimensionality reduction but also classification accuracy and efficiency improvement. While feature selection consists in selecting a subset of relevant features from the original feature set, feature construction corresponds to the generation of new high-level features, called constructed features, where each one of them is a combination of a subset of original features. However, different features can have different abilities to distinguish different classes. Therefore, it may be more difficult to construct a better discriminating feature when combining features that are relevant to different classes. Based on these definitions, feature construction could be seen as a BLOP (Bi-Level optimization Problem) where the feature subset should be defined in the upper level and the feature construction is applied in the lower level by performing mutliple followers, each of which generates a set class dependent constructed features. In this paper, we propose a new bi-level evolutionary approach for feature construction called BCDFC that constructs multiple features which focuses on distinguishing one class from other classes using Genetic Programming (GP). A detailed experimental study has been conducted on six high-dimensional datasets. The statistical analysis of the obtained results shows the competitiveness and the outperformance of our bi-level feature construction approach with respect to many state-of-art algorithms.},

In particular, in response to highly competitive market conditions, manufacturers face the problem of producing several models of a base product on the same assembly line, which leads to a mixed-model assembly line balancing problem. This problem is proven to be NP-hard and is computationally challenging. In addition to the usual problem constraints (e.g. precedences between operations and satisfying cycle times), we consider setup times between operations, which further complicates the problem. In this work, we present a novel ant colony optimisation approach, which is based on learning permutations of the operations. The permutations are then mapped to an assignment of operations to workstations in a greedy fashion. The numerical experiments demonstrate improvements both in the quality of solutions and significant improvements in computational time in comparison to the exact state of the art solution methods currently available in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Graph embedding methods aim to represent nodes in the network into a low-dimensional and continuous vector space while preserving the topological structure and varieties of relational information maximally. Nowadays the structural connections of networks and the attribute information about each node are more easily available than before. As a result, many community detection algorithms for attributed networks have been proposed. However, the majority of these methods cannot deal with the overlapping community detection problem, which is one of the most significant issues in the real-world complex network study. In addition, it is quite challenging to make full use of both structural and attribute information instead of only focusing on one part. To this end, in this paper we innovatively combine the graph embedding with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) for overlapping community detection problems in attributed networks. As far as I am concerned, MOEA is first used to integrate with graph embedding methods for overlapping community detection. We term our method as MOEA-GE OV , which can automatically determine the number of communities without any prior knowledge and consider topological structure and vertex properties synchronously. In MOEA-GE OV , two objective functions concerning community structure and attribute similarity are carefully designed. Moreover, a heuristic initialization method is proposed to get a relatively good initial population. Then a novel encoding and decoding strategy is designed to efficiently represent the overlapping communities and corresponding embedded representation. In the experiments, the performance of MOEA-GE OV is validated on both single and multiple attribute real-world networks. The experimental results of community detection tasks demonstrate our method can effectively obtain overlapping community structures with practical significance.},

Carbohydrates are an essential and diverse family of biomolecules that exerts many functions. The structure of carbohydrates, especially those of smaller sizes such as the disaccharides, are difficult to be studied by experimental methods. One alternative is the use of computational methods such as Molecular Dynamics to infer the conformation of disaccharides. However, Molecular Dynamics simulations are computationally expensive due to the many force field evaluations and atom motions required to simulate the studied molecular system. In this work, we represent the disaccharide structure prediction problem as an optimization problem. We propose a metaheuristic based on the Success-History Adaptive Differential Evolution algorithm to find the best conformation, using the GROMOS force field energy function with 53A6 GLYC parameters as the objective function. We tested the proposed method against different disaccharide structures. A comparative analysis between the results achieved by our method and those obtained by Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed. The results show that the proposed method achieved satisfactory results in terms of accuracy and with a reduced computational time when compared to the usual approach of Molecular Dynamics.},

Genetic Programming approaches have become increasingly popular for designing neural networks due to studies where the generated models were able to achieve results comparable to humans. These approaches can evolve the structure at different levels of abstraction, reducing the need for a specialist. In this paper, we propose the use of Grammatical Evolution for evolving U-net architectures. We propose a mirror grammar, which is capable of generating a variety of flexible U-nets that better explores the search space. We show that the proposed grammar can capture the complex constraints that define the U-nets and achieve comparable results in terms of accuracy, on a benchmark of segmentation problems of varying difficulty.},

The dynamic strategy consists of auto-adapting the number of optimization agents according to the needs and current status of the optimization process. The system is able to scale in/out itself depending on some diversity criteria. The algorithms also take advantage of structural knowledge from the Protein Data Bank to better guide the search and constraint the state space.

However, given the non-linearity of the traffic dynamics in urban environments, choosing a route based only on current traffic load or current average vehicle speed is not a guaranty of a lower overall travel time. In this work, we design an evolutionary system to search for better surrogate travel cost that drivers could optimise in their rerouting to achieve better overall travel times. Our system uses the Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming algorithm to evolve surrogate travel cost expressions and evaluate their performances on a micro traffic simulator. Our system is able to evolve different expressions that meet characteristics of specific urban environments instead of a one size fits all expression. We have seen in our experimental study on a traffic scenario representing Dublin city centre that our system is able to evolve surrogate travel cost expressions with ~34\% and ~10\% improvements in average travel time over the no rerouting and the average travel speed based rerouting algorithms.},

However, a majority of applications are dynamic optimization problems in the real-world. In this paper, therefore, a surrogate-assisted clustering particle swarm optimizer is proposed for expensive dynamic optimization. In the proposed method, several clusters are first created by affinity propagation clustering, and then local radial basis function (RBF) surrogates are built based on the neighbor evaluated points for each cluster. Finally, in each cluster, the local RBF assists particle swarm optimizer to search the most promising point, which is evaluated by real objective function. To track dynamic environment, the points with best exact fitness in each cluster are added into new cradle swarm, if environmental change has occurred. A variety of experiments have been conducted on the moving peaks benchmark (MPB) with 500 change frequency in each environment. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach has a good performance.},

  abstract  = {We present an evolutionary method for the design of image filters using two-dimensional uniform cellular automata. Specifically, a technique called Conditionally Matching Rules is applied to represent transition functions for cellular automata working with 256 cell states. This approach allows reducing the length of chromosomes for the evolution substantially which was a need for such high number of states since the traditional table based encoding would require enormous memory space. The problem of removing Salt-and-Pepper noise from 8-bit grayscale images is considered as a case study. A cellular automaton will be initialised by the values of pixels of a corrupted image and a variant of Evolution Strategy will be applied for the design of a suitable transition function that is able to eliminate the noise from the image during ordinary development of the cellular automaton. We show that using only 5-cell neighbourhood of the cellular automaton in combination with conditionally matching rules the resulting filters are able to provide a very good output quality and are comparable with several existing solutions that require more resources. Moreover, the proposed evolutionary method exhibits a high performance which allows us to design filters in very short time even on a common PC.},

  abstract  = {We propose a fast air-conditioning temperature optimization system using a surrogate solution evaluator. Simulation-based evolutionary optimization does not require the formulation of a mathematical model of the optimization problem and allows the treatment of the problem by considering a black box. However, the simulation-based solution evaluation is often time-consuming. Because evolutionary algorithms need to generate many candidate solutions for optimization, the time-consuming solution evaluation will be a bottleneck, which is encountered in air-conditioning temperature optimization. The building simulator provides the thermal comfort level and the power usage by inputting a candidate air-conditioning temperature setting through a complicated simulation. Although the results are useful compared with those obtained by a simple mathematical model, it is time-consuming. To accelerate the optimization process, we propose a surrogate evaluator based on the time-series predictive long short-term memory, which is a recurrent neural network architecture. Instead of the time-consuming building simulator, the surrogate evaluator outputs the two time-series data of the thermal comfort and power consumption, and schedules are optimized with the multi-objective particle swam-based optimizer OMOPSO. Experimental results show that the proposed system could obtain practical schedule sets, and the optimization was accelerated by using the surrogate evaluator.},

Evolutionary algorithms have traditionally excelled in this task when dealing with data of a moderate size. However, their application to large datasets typically involves very high computational costs. In this work, we propose a hybrid surrogate model for evolutionary undersampling in imbalanced classification problems. These are characterised by having a highly skewed distribution of classes in which evolutionary algorithms aim to balance the training data by selecting only the most relevant data. The proposed technique combines a two-stage clustering-based surrogate method with a windowing approach to quickly approximate fitness values of the chromosomes and accelerate the search. The experiments carried out in 44 standard imbalanced datasets show that the proposed hybrid surrogate model highly reduces the computational cost of the evolutionary algorithm without a considerable loss of performance.},

They can be developed on different platforms and communicate via lightweight protocols, what makes them highly interoperable. The interoperability between microservices, as well as their reuse and customization needs make this kind of systems adequate to constitute a Software Product Line. However, there is no automatic approach to support the designing of Microservices-Based Product Lines (MBPLs). To move towards the development of MBPLs, this work presents an approach, named MOEA4MBPL, to extract Feature Models (FMs) from a set of microservices-based systems. These FMs intent to leverage interoperability, enabling the practitioners to reason about reuse and/or customization of functionalities. The proposed approach is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, optimizing three objectives, namely precision and recall of products denoted by an FM, and conformance with existing dependencies between microservices. MOEA4MBPL was evaluated with six microservices-based systems, using the algorithms NSGA-II and SPEA2. Our approach was capable of finding FMs with good trade-off values of precision and recall, satisfying all dependencies among the microservices. SPEA2 found better fronts of solutions than NSGA-II, but the latter always executed faster and could find single solutions closer to an ideal solution than the former.},

  abstract  = {As the complexity of neural network models has grown, it has become increasingly important to optimize their design automatically through metalearning. Methods for discovering hyperparameters, topologies, and learning rate schedules have lead to significant increases in performance. This paper shows that loss functions can be optimized with metalearning as well, and result in similar improvements. The method, Genetic Lossfunction Optimization (GLO), discovers loss functions de novo, and optimizes them for a target task. Leveraging techniques from genetic programming, GLO builds loss functions hierarchically from a set of operators and leaf nodes. These functions are repeatedly recombined and mutated to find an optimal structure, and then a covariance-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) is used to find optimal coefficients. Networks trained with GLO loss functions are found to outperform the standard cross-entropy loss on standard image classification tasks. Training with these new loss functions requires fewer steps, results in lower test error, and allows for smaller datasets to be used. Loss function optimization thus provides a new dimension of metalearning, and constitutes an important step towards AutoML.},

Therein, the distance traveled by a single vehicle and the number of unserved dynamic requests is minimized by a dynamic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (DEMOA), which operates on discrete time windows (eras). A decision is made at each era by a decision-maker, thus any decision depends on irreversible decisions made in foregoing eras. To understand effects of sequences of decision-making and interactions/dependencies between decisions made, we conduct a series of experiments. More precisely, we fix a set of decision-maker preferences D and the number of eras n t and analyze all |D| nt combinations of decision-maker options. We find that for random uniform instances (a) the final selected solutions mainly depend on the final decision and not on the decision history, (b) solutions are quite robust with respect to the number of unvisited dynamic customers, and (c) solutions of the dynamic approach can even dominate solutions obtained by a clairvoyant EMOA. In contrast, for instances with clustered customers, we observe a strong dependency on decision-making history as well as more variance in solution diversity.},

Evolutionary algorithms are a suitable approach for the global optimization of such black-box models, but they require the evaluation of many individuals. Applications to industrial-size case-studies suffer from high computational times where the numerical simulations consume the majority of the time. This contribution proposes the use of neural networks as surrogate models to guide the evolutionary search. These models are trained multiple times during the evolutionary search and are used to exclude nonpromising individuals and to generate candidate solutions. We demonstrate the performance improvement due to the use of the surrogate models for a medium-size case-study of a chemical plant consisting of a reactor, a liquid-liquid separation and a distillation column.

However, so far they have never been used to study the performance of machine learning algorithms on unseen data, and they have never been applied to neuroevolution. This paper aims at filling both these gaps, applying for the first time fitness landscapes to neuroevolution and using them to infer useful information about the predictive ability of the method. More specifically, we use a grammar-based approach to generate convolutional neural networks, and we study the dynamics of three different mutations to evolve them. To characterize fitness landscapes, we study autocorrelation and entropic measure of ruggedness. The results show that these measures are appropriate for estimating both the optimization power and the generalization ability of the considered neuroevolution configurations.},

  abstract  = {Multitasking optimization is an incipient research area which is lately gaining a notable research momentum. Unlike traditional optimization paradigm that focuses on solving a single task at a time, multitasking addresses how multiple optimization problems can be tackled simultaneously by performing a single search process. The main objective to achieve this goal efficiently is to exploit synergies between the problems (tasks) to be optimized, helping each other via knowledge transfer (thereby being referred to as Transfer Optimization). Furthermore, the equally recent concept of Evolutionary Multitasking (EM) refers to multitasking environments adopting concepts from Evolutionary Computation as their inspiration for the simultaneous solving of the problems under consideration. As such, EM approaches such as the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has shown a remarkable success when dealing with multiple discrete, continuous, single-, and/or multi-objective optimization problems. In this work we propose a novel algorithmic scheme for Multifactorial Optimization scenarios - the Multifactorial Cellular Genetic Algorithm (MFCGA) - that hinges on concepts from Cellular Automata to implement mechanisms for exchanging knowledge among problems. We conduct an extensive performance analysis of the proposed MFCGA and compare it to the canonical MFEA under the same algorithmic conditions and over 15 different multitasking setups (encompassing different reference instances of the discrete Traveling Salesman Problem). A further contribution of this analysis beyond performance benchmarking is a quantitative examination of the genetic transferability among the problem instances, eliciting an empirical demonstration of the synergies emerged between the different optimization tasks along the MFCGA search process.},

MOCA-I is a multi-objective local search designed to solve these problems, particularly when the data are imbalanced.

This methodology is based on a multi-objective approach of automatic algorithm configuration and requires a clear definition of the experimental protocol. Therefore, we present a k-fold cross-validation protocol to train and test the configuration model. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that multi-objective automatic algorithm configuration is performed on optimization algorithms to solve classification problems. Experimental results on real imbalanced datasets show that our approach can find efficient configurations of MOCA-I with less effort in comparison with the ones found exhaustively by hand.},

  abstract  = {The term moving target defense or MTD describes a series of techniques that change the configuration of an Internet-facing system; in general, the technique consists of changing the visible configuration to avoid offering a fixed target to service profiling techniques. Additionally, configurations need to be as secure as possible and, since change needs to be frequent, to generate also as many as possible. We previously introduced a proof of concept where we used a simplified evolutionary algorithm for generating these configurations. In this paper we improve this algorithm, trying to adapt it to the specific characteristics of the fitness landscape, and also looking at finding as many solutions as possible.},

  abstract  = {Designing the collaborative mechanism is a fundamental problem for the multi-robot systems. It aims to determine the perception, communication, and motion strategies for a single robot to obtain the desired behavior at the system level. Generally, we can use manual design and automatic design, or the combination of the above two approaches for particular system behavior. With the increasing of task complexity and the uncertainty of surroundings, the adaptability and autonomy are hard to achieve with manual design approaches. By using the mechanism of learning or evolution, automatic design can generate sensor configurations, communication parameters, as well as control strategies automatically, which has been widely concerned in recent years. In this paper, the brainstorming method of collaborative problem-solving in human society is introduced into the design of multi-robot systems. This paper proposes an automatic design framework: Brain Storm Robotics(BSR), in which the system architecture, the representation of ideas, and the generation of new ideas are discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed BSR framework is verified by an example of designing an aggregation behavior for a swarm of robots. The results show that the control strategy designed by this framework is more efficient than that designed manually, which has outstanding development prospects. The future researches for the development of this potential framework are also discussed.},

The process that go from first identifying and labelling the various assets to be monitored, to their abstraction and integration for a given industrial scenario, forms the major crux of the work presented in this paper. We deployed several sensor nodes in the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult site, located in Blyth, UK. Each sensor node monitored a specific asset and communicated via LoRaWAN to our local Data Hub. A simple query interface and visualisation dashboard allowed real-time data assessment and rapid asset monitoring. To make the proposed approach easy to comprehend and applicable to other scenarios, we extracted a minimal translational bottom-up flowchart.

Under the scenario of a realistic OFO platform, this paper addresses an online meal delivery problem (OMDP). To reduce the search space, the OMDP is decomposed into two sub-problems, i.e., the pickup and delivery problem and the order dispatching problem. To solve each sub-problem effectively, a hybrid differential evolution algorithm is proposed, which is fused by the DE-based phase to plan routes and the heuristic-based phase to determine order dispatching schemes. In the DE-based routing phase, a heuristic considering the urgency of orders is designed to generate the initial population with certain quality. Besides, a mutation operator is developed to enhance the exploration and a crossover operator embedded with local search is designed to enhance the exploitation. In the heuristic-based dispatching phase, a regret heuristic is presented to produce good dispatching solutions by introducing the influences between delivery persons. Numerical tests have been carried out and computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The method is thus named as B-norm based PF tracking method (Bn-PFt). To ease the work of algorithmic development, an indexing system of reference points is also proposed. Systematic numerical studies performed on B-norm surfaces of various B values show that reference points created by the proposed Bn-PFt method are more evenly distributed on the surfaces than those of the projected onto the same surfaces generated using Dan and Dennis method. Simulation results using NSGA III on benchmark problems MaF3 and MaF5 with 3, 5, and 7 objective functions, show that the candidate solution sets obtained, via adopting reference points with the proposed method, have better diversity.},

From this context, the present paper proposes an analysis of the effect of different crossover operators on the quality of obtained solutions in a genetic algorithm applied to the switch allocation problem in power distribution systems. The comparisons were conducted based on a hypothetical system from the literature with 135 buses and 1 feeder.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a new methodology for complex system design by means of optimisation techniques. Within the Model-based Engineering approach, optimisation algorithms are used to explore optimal solutions of highly coupled and nonlinear systems. In such scenario, the optimal technology has to be identified and its settings have to be optimised. Relying on optimisation strategies for both the challenges brings to complex mixed-variable problem formulations involving continuous, integer and categorical parameters. Furthermore, part of the parameters are required only if certain technologies are adopted, bringing to variable-size formulations that standard optimisers cannot manage. Therefore, the proposed methodology relies on the use of variable-size mixed-variable global optimiser Structured-Chromosome Genetic Algorithm (SCGA). The advantages of this new method are shown by applying it for solving a space system preliminary design. In particular, two variants have been implemented distinguished by two different levels of complexity. To better appreciate the proposed approach, the same problems have been reformulated to be treated by a well known and appreciated optimiser in the field of spacecraft design, Multi- Population Adaptive Inflationary Differential Evolution Algorithm (MP-AIDEA). The final results of the two approaches are compared and commented.},

  abstract  = {It has been widely recognized that evolutionary computation is one of the most effective techniques for solving complex optimization problems. As a group of meta-heuristics inspired by nature, the superiority of evolutionary algorithms is mainly attributed to the evolution of multiple candidate solutions, which can strike a balance between exploration and exploitation. However, the effectiveness of evolutionary algorithms is generally at the expense of efficiency, which reduces the prevalence of evolutionary algorithms in solving real-world optimization problems. In 2017, we proposed the evolutionary multi-objective optimization platform PlatEMO to facilitate the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), where some delicate techniques were developed to improve the computational efficiency of MOEAs. These techniques have not been introduced before, since users need not care about them when using existing MOEAs or developing new MOEAs. To deepen the understanding of the core mechanisms of PlatEMO, this paper gives a comprehensive introduction to these techniques, including new non-dominated sorting approaches, matrix calculation, and parallel computing. Several comparative experiments are conducted for a quantitative understanding of the efficiency improvement brought by these techniques.},

Since the swarm is in a good region of the search space with the potential to make more progress, a (random) restart could be counter productive.

However, in the basic ABC, the solution search equation performs well in exploration but poorly in exploitation, which may cause the problem of slow convergence rate. To tackle this issue, we propose a dynamic best neighbor-guided search strategy to enhance the performance of ABC. In the proposed strategy, a dynamic neighborhood with variable size is first constructed with respect to different evolution stage of the algorithm. After that, the best food source of the neighborhood is selected to guide search instead of only using the global best food source or some elite food sources, which aims to achieve a better balance between the exploration and exploitation. In addition, we design an improved global neighborhood search operator with better robustness to further enhance the performance of ABC. In the experiments, 50 different benchmark functions are used to verify our approach, including the CEC2013 benchmark test suite. The experimental results compared with other four recently well-established ABC variants show that our approach can significantly enhance the performance of ABC.},

  abstract  = {In the context of optimization problems, the performance of an algorithm depends on the problem. It is difficult to know a priori what algorithm (and what parameters) will perform best on a new problem. For this reason, we previously proposed a framework that uses grammatical evolution to automatically generate swarm intelligence algorithms given a training problem. However, we observed two issues that affected the results of the framework. The first issue was that sometimes the training problems are too easy, and any candidate algorithm could solve it or too difficult that no candidate algorithm could solve them. The second issue was the presence of parameters in the grammar, which causes a significant increase in the search space. In this work, we addressed those issues by investigating three training schedules in which the problems start easy and get harder over time. We also investigated whether numerical parameters should be part of the grammar. We compared these training schedules to the previous one and compared the performance of the generated algorithms against the traditional algorithms, which are DE, PSO, and CS. We found that gradually increasing the difficulty of the training problem produced algorithms that could solve more testing instances than training only in 10-D. The results suggest that a step-by-step increase in difficulty is a better approach overall. We also found that including parameters in the grammar resulted in algorithms on par with the traditional meta-heuristics. Besides, as expected, our results show that removing parameters from the grammar exhibit the worst overall performance. However, interestingly it could solve most of the testing instances within the given testing budget.},

Due to the lack of relevant results existing in the literature, two baseline methods, random sample and random walk are included in the experiments for comparison with the proposed genetic algorithm. The obtained results indicate that the proposal is effective since the program mistake can be identified with ease by examining the shrunk counterexamples and also that the adopted genetic algorithm statistically significantly outperforms random sample and random walk in both counterexample sizes and running time.},

Even though this approach has proven effective against dynamic changes, such as encrypting, obfuscating and packing techniques, it is vulnerable to specific evasion attacks where that small changes in the input data cause misclassification at test time. This paper proposes a new approach: MDEA, an Adversarial Malware Detection model uses evolutionary optimization to create attack samples to make the network robust against evasion attacks.

  abstract  = {In practical multi/many-objective optimization problems, a decision maker is often only interested in a handful of solutions of interest (SOI) instead of the entire Pareto Front (PF). It is therefore of significant research interest to design algorithms that can automatically detect SOIs and search around them instead of attempting to find the entire PF. However, this is challenging for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the interpretation of the underlying measures in terms of quantifying trade-off information for SOIs is not straightforward. Scalability is also an issue for most of such existing measures. Additionally, for many-objective algorithms that rely on decomposition, adaptation of reference directions and appropriate means to scale the objectives to maintain solution density around SOIs is not trivial. Lastly, constraints and decision-space are often overlooked in the existing studies but are important for practical applications. In this work, we present a simple approach to identify SOIs, using normalized net gain over nadir point and angle of influence. We illustrate the utility of the measure for offline and online identification of SOIs using a range of unconstrained and constrained benchmarks and practical design problems spanning up to 5 objectives. We also show further analysis in decision-space for an application problem to aid decision-making in practical scenarios.},

Their complexity and structure make many of them almost impracticable for solving via classical deterministic methods. Thus, population-based metaheuristics have been used to handle this class of problems. However, while the meta-models-based implementations are not indicated to tackle the inter-dependent followers BLPs, their nested structure can greatly increment the already high computational cost of the metaheuristics. Thus, we offer and study the three first parallel models for solving Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium BLPs via metaheuristics. All our parallel approaches are scalable and can be efficiently executed in individual multi-cores computing nodes and in high-distributed computational clusters. We reported relevant speedups for different computing architectures, which endorsed the potential of the proposals of this work as relevant tools to enable the study of increasingly larger and complex inter-dependent followers BLPs.},

Unsupervised methods are used for finding the intrinsic dimensionality of the space of the original features and nonlinear mappings are used to obtain lower dimensional representations. The classification results for the original and the reduced dimension data are similar, thus, indicating the redundancy of the eliminated features. The white-box models obtained through genetic programming is then compared with the conventional black-box models obtained through supervised classification using random trees, extreme learning machines and multilayer perceptron. For this problem, the explicit white-box models obtained with genetic programming produced equal or better classification accuracies than those obtained with black-box approaches.

  abstract  = {Global optimization problems can be effectively solved by means of Computational Intelligence methods. However, there are several areas in which the effectiveness of these algorithms can be hampered by the computational costs of the fitness evaluations, or by specific features of the fitness landscape that can be characterized by noise and by the presence of several (even infinite) local optima. These issues bring about the necessity of defining specific techniques to replace the original problem with a surrogate representation. Fourier surrogate modeling represents a novel and effective approach to generate smoother, and possibly easier to explore, fitness landscapes, and to reduce the computational effort. Fourier surrogates require an initial sampling of the search space that must be performed to calculate the Fourier transforms. In this paper we investigate the impact on the quality of the surrogate models of the hyper-parameters of the methodology, and of several methods that can be employed for the initial sampling of the fitness landscape (i.e., pseudorandom numbers, low discrepancy sequences, a logistic map in chaotic regime, true random positions generated by a quantum computer, and point packing). Our results show that semistructured approaches like quasi-random sequences and point packing can outperform the other sampling methods.},

In this paper, we proposed a dynamic self-organising swarm algorithm to learn an effective set of prototypes for big high-dimensional datasets in an unsupervised manner. The novelties of this new algorithm are the energy-based fitness function, the adaptive topological neighbourhood, the growing/shrinking capability, and the efficient learning scheme. Experiments with well-known datasets show that the proposed algorithm can maintain a very compact set of prototypes and achieve competitive predictive performance as compared to other algorithms in the literature. The analyses also show that prototypes generated by the proposed algorithms have a stronger separatability compared to those from other prototype generation algorithms.},

Multiobjective evolution of network weights and topologies (NEAT-MODS) is extended with Lamarckian-inherited neuromodulated learning. NEAT-MODS is an NSGA-II augmented multiobjective neurocontroller that uses two conflicting objectives. By evolving pursuit agents optimized with the separate and conflicting objectives of `capturing evaders&#39; and `minimizing energy consumption&#39;, efficient neurocontrollers can be evolved. NEAT-MODS uses a selection process that aims to ensure Pareto-optimal genotypic diversity and elitism. Neuromodulation is a biologically-inspired technique that can adapt the per-connection learning rates of synaptic plasticity. Lamarckian inheritance allows behaviours learned during parent generations to be passed on to their offspring. The capability of the design is demonstrated in a series of experiments with a simulated evolved vehicle pursuing a basic evader vehicle. It is shown that compact and efficient neurocontrollers for pursuer agents with nonzero mass and drag, capable of capturing an optimal evader while simultaneously minimizing energy consumption, are evolved.},

The methods of machine learning have been applied to detect electricity consumption anomalies. However, the characteristic of unbalanced classes in this kind of data opens a possibility to explore unbalanced data handling techniques, that are not explored in most of the literature studies. In this paper, the authors conduce a comparative study between several strategies to balance data sets and applied several machine learning techniques in order to select which machine learning + data handling techniques obtain the better results for the simulations related to the electricity theft detection problem. In this paper, the authors utilized the machine learning methods Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the strategies for data balancing Cost-Sensitive Learning (Weighting), Random Undersampling (RUS), Random Oversampling (ROS), K-medoids based undersampling (K-medoids), Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Cluster-based Oversampling (CBOS). The metrics utilized for the comparison were Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) and F1-score, more suitable for this kind of problem. The results show some combinations can reach significantly better values than others, comparing both the balancing techniques for a same machine learning method itself as well as comparing these combinations between themselves.},

A sparse evolutionary algorithm has also been raised and verified effective on benchmark problems. However, in practical applications, it needs a large number of expensive function evaluations. Although surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms are common solutions to deal with expensive optimization problems within limited computation resources and especially Kriging-assisted evolutionary algorithms are widely used, they cannot cope with large-scale expensive sparse multi-objective optimization problems due to the inaccurate surrogate models on high-dimensional problems. Therefore, we first propose a feature selection operator based on non-dominated sorting to choose the non-zero decision variables in the Pareto set. Then, the dimension of the original problem is reduced and a Kriging-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is employed to solve the reformulated problem. Finally, the selected zero decision variables are added to the obtained optimal solutions as the result of the original problem.

Hyper-heuristics(HHs) appear as a counterpoint to the manually designed complex methods. This paper presents a preliminary study on adaptive search space based on clustering, utilizing a HH Selection framework with Genetic Algorithm (GA). The initial results show promise in having an adaptive search scope when compared to a fixed clustering approach. A comparison of the effects of having a route-first vs cluster-first initial solution is also presented, favouring the latter one, as well as a comparison between two types of chromosome decoding. Finally, the proposed method is compared to a manually designed algorithm, producing results with better quality.

For both MOEAs and QIs, an important question is how to construct the reference set regardless of the dimensionality of the objective space, preserving well-diversified solutions. The Simplex-Lattice-Design method (SLD) that constructs a set of convex weights in a simplex, has been usually used to define reference sets. However, it is not a good option since Pareto fronts with irregular geometries cannot be completely intersected by the weight vectors. In this paper, we propose a tool based on the Riesz s-energy to generate reference sets exhibiting good diversity properties. Our experimental results support the Riesz s-energy-based reference sets as a better option due to their invariance to the Pareto front shape and the objective space dimensionality.},

  abstract  = {Preserving diversity in decision space plays an important role in Multimodal Multi-objective Optimization problems (MMOPs). Due to the lack of mechanisms to keep different solutions with the same fitness value, most of the available Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) perform poorly when applied to MMOPs. To deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel method for diversity preserving in the decision space. To this end, the concept of grid-based crowding distance for decision space is introduced. Furthermore, to keep a good diversity of solutions in both decision and objective spaces, we propose different frameworks by combining this method with crowding distance in decision space, crowding distance in objective space, and the weighted sum of both crowding distances. In order to evaluate the performance of these frameworks, we integrate them into the diversity preserving part of the NSGA-II algorithm, and compare them with the NSGA-II (as the baseline algorithm) and the state-of-the-art multimodal multi-objective optimization algorithms on ten different MMOPs with different levels of complexity.},

  abstract  = {This paper proposes dependable parallel multi-population global-best brain storm optimization with differential evolution strategies (DPMP-GBSODE) for distribution system state estimation (DSSE) using just-in-time (JIT) modeling and correntropy. In electric power distribution systems, DSSE is utilized by power utility operators to grasp whole distribution system conditions such as voltages and currents. By applying JIT modeling and correntropy to DSSE problems, voltages and currents can be correctly estimated even if false measurement values (outliers) are measured. Considering equipment of the distribution systems and penetration of renewable energies (REs), it is necessary that an evolutionary computation technique with parallel and distributed processing (PDP) is applied to the DSSE problems. When some computational processes are distributed by PDP in server systems of distribution automation systems, some calculation results from the distributed computational processes may not be returned because of various congestions of the processes. Therefore, appropriate estimation results should be obtained even if the congestions occur (dependability). The proposed DPMP-GBSODE is verified to improve dependability and computation time for the DSSE problem in comparison with conventional method even if faults of the processes occur and the outliers are measured.},

Although being tailored to the palm detection problem, the latter has general validity and can be used for any classification application. Second, we designed and evaluated a state-of-the-art detection system, which uses a convolutional neural network to extract meaningful features, and a classifier trained with the images from the proposed dataset. Results show outstanding effectiveness with an accuracy peak of 99.5\% and a precision of 99.8\%. Using different images for validation taken from different altitudes the model reached an accuracy of 97.5\% and a precision of 98.3\%.

  abstract  = {An optimized supply chain is essential for the success of large-scale industries. In order to meet the high availability level requirements, an efficient inventory system is crucial to reduce downtime when a failure event occurs. In a multi-echelon spare parts inventory system, each warehouse within the system may operate as a hub or a spoke. A hub is a warehouse that fulfills the demands of other warehouses, while a spoke is a warehouse that fulfills the demands of final customers. When the inventory system deals with multiple items, a fixed role (hub or spoke) is commonly assigned to each warehouse. However, this limitation may lead to sub-optimal solutions. If the optimization model allows each warehouse to have a different role for different items, a new degree of freedom is included and more efficient solutions can be found. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based optimization model to define the configuration of a multiechelon spare parts inventory system of multiple items. The goal is to minimize total inventory costs, subject to a fill rate constraint. We relax the assumption that warehouses have a fixed role for all the items. Two algorithms are used to evaluate the model: the Teaching-Learning Based optimization (TLBO) and the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms. A case study based on a spare parts inventory system of an aircraft manufacturer is used to compare the performance of the proposed model with the performance obtained considered fixed warehouse roles. The results showed that the proposed model provided a reduction of 6.8\% in total cost, without violating the fill rate constraint.},

  abstract  = {Memetic Algorithms are traditionally composed of an evolutionary framework and one or more local search elements. However, modern generation Memetic Algorithms do not necessarily follow a pre-established scheme and are hybrid structures of various types. By following these modern trends, the present paper proposes an original and unconventional adaptive memetic structure generated by the hybridisation of a set of theoretical computational models, namely P Systems, and an evolutionary algorithm employing adaptation rules and moving operators inspired by Evolution Strategies. The resulting memetic algorithm, namely Adaptive Optimisation Spiking Neural P System (AOSNPS), is a tailored algorithm to solve optimisation problems with binary encoding. More specifically AOSNPS is composed of a family of parallel spiking neural P systems, each of them generating a binary vector representing a candidate solution on the basis of internal probability parameters and an adaptive Evolutionary Guider Algorithm that evolves the probabilities encoded in each P system. Numerical result shows that the proposed approach is effective to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem and outperforms various algorithms proposed in the literature to solve the same class of problems.},

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is recently employed as an MCA, which is called MPC-based MCA due to the consideration of the plant&#39;s boundaries in finding the optimal input signal. The computational load of the MPC directly relates to the control horizon and prediction horizon of the MPC. In this paper, a new optimisation method using butterfly optimisation algorithm is developed to find the optimal control horizon and prediction horizon of MPC-based MCA. The proposed method reduces the time of the tuning process of the MPC-based MCA, which is usually carried out via trial-and-error and genetic algorithm methods. Also, the trial-and-error method increases the motion sensation error and insufficient usage of the SBMP. The model is validated using MATLAB simulation environment, and the outcomes show that the developed butterfly optimisation algorithm will lead better motion sensation with less wrong motion signals and low computational burden compared with the trial-and-error and genetic algorithm method.},

Explainable (i.e. human-interpretable) methods can provide insights into disease mechanisms but can equally importantly promote clinician-patient trust, in turn helping wider social acceptance of ML methods. Here, we empirically test a method to engineer complex, yet interpretable, representations of base features via evolution of context-free grammar (CFG). We show that together with a simple ML algorithm evolved features provide higher accuracy on several benchmark datasets and then apply it to a real word problem of diagnosing Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. We further demonstrate high performance on a hold-out dataset for the prognosis of AD.},

  abstract  = {The paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive selection of sample size for a trial solution of an evolutionary algorithm when noise of unknown distribution contaminates the objective surface. The sample size of a solution here is adapted based on the noisy fitness profile in the local surrounding of the given solution. The fitness estimate and the fitness variance of a sub-population surrounding the given solution are jointly used to signify the degree of noise contamination in its local neighborhood (LN). The adaptation of sample size based on the characteristics of the fitness landscape in the LN of a solution is realized here with the temporal difference Q-learning (TDQL). The merit of the present work lies in utilizing the reward-penalty based reinforcement learning mechanism of TDQL for sample size adaptation. This sidesteps the prerequisite setting of any specific functional form of relationship between the sample size requirement of a solution and the noisy fitness profile in its LN. Experiments undertaken reveal that the proposed algorithms, realized with artificial bee colony, significantly outperform the existing counterparts and the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) of the state of the art are created with the only purpose of dealing with the number of objective functions in a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) and treat the decision variables of a MOP as a whole. However, when dealing with MOPs with a large number of decision variables (more than 100) their efficacy decreases as the number of decision variables of the MOP increases. On the other hand, problem decomposition, in terms of decision variables, has been found to be extremely efficient and effective for solving large scale optimization problems. Nevertheless, most of the currently available approaches for large scale optimization rely on models based on cooperative coevolution or linkage learning methods that use multiple subpopulations or preliminary analysis, respectively, which is computationally expensive (in terms of function evaluations) when used within MOEAs. In this work, we study the effect of what we call operational decomposition, which is a novel framework based on coevolutionary concepts to apply MOEAs&#39;s crossover operator without adding any extra cost. We investigate the improvements that NSGA-III can achieve when combined with our proposed coevolutionary operators. This new scheme is capable of improving efficiency of a MOEA when dealing with large scale MOPs having from 200 up to 1200 decision variables.},

The thief begins his journey with an empty knapsack and travels with speed inversely proportional to the weight of the knapsack. As long as he has time, the thief can go through the points collecting the objects. The objective of the problem is to define which route and which objects the thief must collect to maximize the profit of the knapsack.

Manually designing the architecture of a DRNN for any specific task requires expert knowledge and the optimal DRNN architecture can vary substantially for different tasks. This paper focuses on developing an algorithm to automatically evolve task-specific DRNN architectures by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A variable-length encoding strategy is developed to represent DRNNs of different depths because it is not possible to determine the required depth of a DRNN in advance. Activation functions play an important role in the performance of DRNNs and must be carefully used in these networks. Driven by this understanding, knowledge-driven crossover and mutation operators will be proposed to carefully control the use of activation functions in GA in order for the algorithm to evolve best performing DRNNs. Our algorithm focuses particularly on evolving DRNN architectures that use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units. As a leading type of DRNN, LSTM-based DRNN can effectively handle long-term dependencies, achieving cutting-edge performance while processing various sequential data. Three different types of publicly available benchmark datasets for both classification and regression tasks have been considered in our experiments. The obtained results show that the proposed variable-length GA can evolve DRNN architectures that significantly outperform many state-of-the-art systems on most of the datasets.},

Although its outstanding potential, development of efficient architectures and modules requires expert knowledge and amount of resource time available. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary-based neural architecture search approach for efficient discovery of convolutional models in a dynamic search space, within only 24 GPU hours. With its efficient search environment and phenotype representation, Gene Expression Programming is adapted for network&#39;s cell generation. Despite having limited GPU resource time and broad search space, our proposal achieved similar state-of-the-art to manually-designed convolutional networks and also NAS-generated ones, even beating similar constrained evolutionary-based NAS works. The best cells in different runs achieved stable results, with a mean error of 2.82\% in CIFAR-10 dataset (which the best model achieved an error of 2.67\%) and 18.83\% for CIFAR-100 (best model with 18.16\%). For ImageNet in the mobile setting, our best model achieved top-l and top-5 errors of 29.51\% and 10.37\%, respectively. Although evolutionary-based NAS works were reported to require a considerable amount of GPU time for architecture search, our approach obtained promising results in little time, encouraging further experiments in evolutionary-based NAS, for search and network representation improvements.},

According to the characteristics of the problem, the FOODP is decomposed into two sub-problems, an order assignment problem and a fuzzy traveling salesman problem with pickup and delivery. To deal with the two sub-problems efficiently, a two-stage algorithm is proposed by reasonably fusing a modified greedy search (mGS) and the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA). In the mGS phase, agreement index is employed in the multi-stage decision to search for robust optimal solutions. In the FOA-based search phase, a modified heuristic is used to generate the initial route. To enhance the exploration of the algorithm, an olfactory search is designed by the cooperation of several problem-specific search operators. Moreover, a specific local intensification is employed to further improve the performance of solutions. Numerical tests and statistical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Comparative radiography is the forensic anthropology technique in which ante-mortem (AM) and post-mortem (PM) radiographic materials (e.g., X-ray images or CTs) are compared in order to determine the identity of a deceased human being. One of the most commonly used anatomical structures in comparative radiography are the frontal sinuses. The frontal sinuses are osseous cavities located in the skull, which are used in forensic identification tasks due to their singularity and high identification power. In order to automate the comparison of frontal sinuses in AM and PM materials, it is necessary to perform the registration of these materials (i.e., it is necessary to carry out the alignment of these anatomical regions). However, the manual alignment of these structures is a time-consuming and subjective process. In order to tackle this problem, this paper presents an automatic frontal sinuses registration method in comparative radiography using real-coded evolutionary algorithms (RCEAs). The task is formulated as a 2D-3D image registration problem using a 9 Degrees of Freedom perspective transformation model; two RCEAs (DE and MVMOSH) are compared in the minimization of the registration cost function, and the best of them (MVMO-SH) is applied to an identification scenario including 50X-ray images and 50 CTs. The results obtained show that the proposed automatic identification system is able to filter more than 80\% of the sample.},

  abstract  = {Many design optimization problems from practice involve a large number of variables. In handling such problems, optimization algorithms, in general, suffer from the well-known ”curse of dimensionality” issue. One of the ways to alleviate the issue somewhat is to use problem information to update the optimization algorithm so that more meaningful solutions are evolved quickly. In this paper, we consider a solid rocket motor design problem involving hundreds of integer variables and two conflicting objectives - minimize the error in matching developed thrust with a desired time-dependent thrust profile and simultaneously minimize the unburnt residue of propellant at the end of the burning process. The evaluation of both objectives involve a detailed burn simulation from the core to the shell of the rocket. After finding a set of trade-off solutions using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm, we use two learning-based optimization methods (akin to the concept of innovization) to find similar set of solutions using a fraction of the overall solution evaluations. The proposed methods are applied to seven different thrust profiles. Besides solving the large-scale problem quicker, a by-product of our approach is that learnt innovized principles stay as new and innovative knowledge for solving the solid rocket design problem, a matter which is extremely useful to the practitioners.},

Here, recurrent neural networks and half-systems have been hybridised to capture the underlying dynamics present in the temporal gene expression profiles. The motivation behind this work is to integrate the advantages of both the techniques in the proposed model such that the problem of reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks can be resolved more efficiently. Artificial bee colony optimisation has been used for the estimation of the model parameters. We have implemented the proposed hybrid methodology on the real-world experimental datasets (in vivo) of the SOS DNA Repair network of Escherichia coli.

  abstract  = {Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming (GSGP) is a method that exploits the geometric properties describing the spatial relationship between possible solutions to a problem in an n-dimensional semantic space. In symbolic regression problems, n is equal to the number of training instances. Although very effective, the GSGP semantic space can become excessively big in most real applications, where the value of n is high, having a negative impact on the effectiveness of the GSGP search process. This paper tackles this problem by reducing the dimensionality of GSGP semantic space in symbolic regression problems using instance selection methods. Our approach relies on weighting functions-to estimate the relative importance of each instance based on its position with respect to its nearest neighbours-and on dimensionality reduction techniques-to improve the notion of closeness between instances, generating datasets with simplified input spaces. Experiments were performed on a set of 15 datasets and our experimental analysis shows that using instance selection by instance weighting and dimensionality reduction does improve the effectiveness of the search with almost no impact on root mean square error results.},

To better simulate the real-world scenarios, this paper studies the VRPTW on road networks.

Finding the Pareto-optimal set of paths ideal for all requiring features is time-consuming and unclear to obtain the subset of optimal paths efficiently for multiple origin states in the planning space. Meanwhile, due to the rise of deep learning, hybrid systems of computational intelligence thrive in recent years. When facing non-monotonic data or heuristics derived from pretrained neural networks, most of the existing methods for the oneto-all path problem fail to find an ideal solution. We employ Gaussian mixture model to propose a target-prioritized searching algorithm called Multi-Source Bidirectional Gaussian-Prioritized Spanning Tree (BiasSpan) in solving this non-monotonic multicriteria route planning problem given constraints including range, must-visit vertices, and the number of recommended vertices. Experimental results on mass transportation system in Tainan and Chicago cities show that BiasSpan outperforms comparative methods from 7\% to 24\% and runs in a reasonable time compared to state-of-art route-planning algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Recently, Evolutionary Multiobjective Multitask optimization (EMMO) was proposed as a new research topic in the field of Evolutionary Multiobjective optimization (EMO). In contrast to conventional EMO algorithms, EMMO algorithms solve multiple multiobjective optimization problems (multiple tasks) in their single run. Most EMMO algorithms have the same number of populations as the number of tasks to be solved simultaneously, and each population corresponds to a different task. The main feature of EMMO algorithms is that offspring solutions are generated by not only intra-task crossover but also inter-task crossover. Local mating in intra-task crossover improves the search performance of EMO algorithms that use uniformly distributed weight vectors during a search, such as MOEA/D. Therefore, local mating in inter-task crossover is a promising idea for EMMO algorithms. In this paper, we propose a simple extension of MOEA/D for EMMO algorithms and a local mating method in inter-task crossover based on uniformly distributed weight vectors. Through computational experiments, we examine the effects of local mating in inter-task crossover on the search performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the local mating improves the search performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Generating both accurate and diverse recommendations is required for modern recommender systems. Accurate recommendations can well meet the needs of users, while diverse recommendations can bring users novelty, discover the unknown preferences of users, and can also alleviate the long tail problem. However, these two metrics are conflicting and it is very hard to improve both at the same time. Thus, a compromise needs to be made. The easiest way is using hyperparameters to combine different objective functions or the recommendations of different recommendation algorithms, but it is difficult to determine parameters. Another common strategy is applying multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to provide multiple recommendations for each user, but how to choose the final recommendation becomes a new problem. To this end, we propose a two-phase evolutionary algorithm-based recommendation framework, named EARF. In EARF, a novel fitness function is designed, which converts the evaluation of accuracy and diversity into a single objective and automatically trades off these two goals. Based on the property of recommendation problem and fitness function, the genetic representation and operators are redefined. The experiments on real-world rating datasets indicate that the EARF is effective and the proposed evolutionary algorithm can achieve a good balance between accuracy and diversity.},

However, one of the main impediments to the insertion of DR in the residential context is the need of programming the use of various electrical appliances and the scheduling of renewable resources and storage system in the same time interval, that requires a range of specific knowledge and time availability of the consumer to handle the various home appliances. This article presents a preference-based multi-objective optimization model based on real-time electricity price to solve the problem of optimal residential load management. The proposal&#39;s purpose is to minimize both the electricity consumption associated cost and the inconvenience caused to consumers. The proposed model was formalized as a nonlinear programming problem subject to a set of constraints associated with the consumption of electrical energy and operational aspects related to the residential appliance categories. The proposed multi-objective model was solved computationally by the Constrained Many-Objective Non-Dominated Sorted Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III) to determine the new scheduling of residential appliances, renewable energy resources, and energy storage system utilization for the entire time horizon, considering consumer preferences. The results show that the multi-objective DR model proposed using the NSGA-III technique can minimize the total cost associated with energy consumption as well as reduce the inconvenience of consumers, besides helping consumers to take advantage of DR&#39;s benefits without requiring manual intervention.},

In human-based EC systems, when participants whojoin problem solving are fixed, the upper limit of search performance of the human group should be unpredictable but roughly implicitly decided. Therefore, unlike standard EC using computers, human-based EC systems need to enhance or maintain motivations of participants for contributions to derive better search performance of the group. In the paper, we propose two methods for motivating participants in human-based EC systems. The first method is meant to enhance motivations by differentiating participants. More precisely, it feedbacks rankings on the number of times of producing and evaluating solution candidates to participants in a realtime manner. The second method is meant to maintain motivations by equalizing participants. More precisely, it sets the maximum allowed number of times of producing and evaluating solution candidates equally to all participants. It can also theoretically shorten a time period for problem solving. The two methods are strategically contrary to each other. We reveal though experiments that the first method enhances motivations of participants and also that systems using the second method and not using it produce same quality of solutions. These results suggest that we should feedback another rankings which are not based on the number of times to participants while using the second method to obtain high quality of solutions in a short period of time.},

Greedy hypervolume subset selection algorithms can achieve good approximations to the optimal subset. However, when the candidate set is large (e.g., an unbounded external archive with a large number of solutions), the algorithm is very time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new lazy greedy algorithm exploiting the submodular property of the hypervolume indicator. The core idea is to avoid unnecessary hypervolume contribution calculation when finding the solution with the largest contribution.

  abstract  = {Automated Innovization procedure aims to extract hidden, non-intuitive, closed-form relationships from a design task without human intervention. Existing procedures involve the application of an Evolutionary Multi-objective optimization (EMO) Algorithm in two phases. The first phase of EMO algorithm leads to a set of Pareto-optimal (PO) solutions, while the second phase helps identify the implicit relationships. The latter involves clustering which in turn enables the evaluation of innovization-driven objective function. The existing procedures for Automated Innovization differ in their clustering technique and objective formulation. Unlike any existing study, this paper proposes a Unified Automated Innovization (UAI) framework which can deal with both continuous and discrete variable problems, and identify the inherent single- or multiple-cluster rules, as the case may be. The scope and efficacy of the proposed UAI, demonstrated through some benchmark design problems, is rooted in the novel contributions made in the clustering technique, and innovization-driven objective function formulation(s).},

Its practical realisation has been attempted by various technological means (ranging from machine learning to evolutionary approaches), all aimed at informing urban decision making (e.g., road layout design), in environmentally and financially sustainable ways. In this paper, we focus on traffic modelling and prediction, both central to intelligent transportation. We formulate this challenge as a symbolic regression problem and solve it using Genetic Programming, which we enhance with a lag operator and transfer learning. The resulting algorithm utilises knowledge collected from other road segments in order to predict vehicle flow through a junction where traffic data are not available. The experimental results obtained on the Darmstadt case study show that our approach is successful at producing accurate models without increasing training time.},

  abstract  = {Genetic programming (GP) is considered the most popular method for automatically discovering and constructing dispatching rules for scheduling problems. Pareto Local Search (PLS) is a simple and effective local search method for tackling multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems. Researchers have studied the application of PLS to multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) with some success. In fact, by hybridizing global search with local search, the performance of many MOEAs can be noticeably improved. Despite its preliminary success, the practical use of PLS in GP is relatively limited. In this study, our aim is to enhance the quality of evolved dispatching rules for many-objective Job Shop Scheduling (JSS) through hybridizing GP with PLS techniques and designing an effective selection mechanism of initial solutions for PLS. In this paper, we propose a new GP-PLS algorithm that investigates whether the fitness-based selection mechanism for selecting initial solutions for PLS can increase the chance of discovering highly effective dispatching rules for many-objective JSS. To evaluate the effectiveness of our new algorithm, GPPLS is compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms for many-objective JSS. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can outperform the four recently proposed algorithms because of the proper use of local search techniques.},

  abstract  = {Influence maximization refers to selecting a group of nodes from a social network, which obtains the largest influence spread under a cascade model. However, most of the existing works only focused on the influence and ignored the diversity of influenced crowd. Thus, scholars have raised the issue of diversified social influence maximization recently, using the category information of nodes to design diversity indicator and introducing a trade-off parameter to balance the two objectives influence and diversity as one single objective for optimization. In fact, the category information of nodes in the network is usually difficult to be collected, thus the definition of diversity based on nodes&#39; categories is not very general and accurate. In addition, it is very difficult to set the trade-off parameter, especially when there is no prior knowledge in real applications. To this end, we employ overlapping community structure information to design the diversity of nodes without any node&#39;s additional (e.g. category) information. Due to the two objectives of influence and diversity may be conflicting, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm named MOEA-DIM is proposed to optimize the two objectives simultaneously, which does not need to set the tradeoff parameter between the two objectives. In MOEA-DIM, a network reduction strategy based on overlapping community structure is suggested to greatly reduce the search space. In addition, a population initialization strategy based on random walk is designed to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm MOEA-DIM has promising performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian networks (BNs) are probabilistic graphical models, which are regarded as one of the most effective theoretical models in the field of representing and reasoning under uncertainty. Learning BNs structure is an NP-hard problem since the search space of structure grows super-exponentially as the increasing of the number of variables. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used to learn BNs structure while single-solution searching methods may trap into local optima. This work aims to propose an efficient knowledge-driven Genetic algorithm (EKGA-BN) to solve the BN structure learning problem. The proposed EKGA-BN uses a novel selection operator to keep population diversity in order to learn a BN structure with higher accuracy. The idea of Hill climbing algorithm (HC) is combined in the selection operator so as to accelerate the convergence rate. A novel knowledge-driven mutation procedure is proposed to enhance the local search ability of EKGA-BN. Experimental results on four well-known benchmark networks show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both convergence rate and the accuracy of BNs structure.},

To solve this problem, we propose an iterated local search approach. This approach works with unfeasible solutions that are penalized in the evaluation function. Moreover, it uses two movements that allow a strong intensification of the search space during the search process. We test our approach using two sets of problem instances. The first set considers well-known vehicle routing instances in the literature. The second one considers a real case in southern Chile with 500 nodes. From the results, we can demonstrate the abilities of our local search approach to solve small problem instances in reduced times and to find high-quality solutions for real-world problem instances.},

  abstract  = {The Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is a very important problem which has many real world applications. Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic (GPHH), which can automatically evolve effective routing policies, is considered as a promising technique that can handle UCARP effectively. However, GP-evolved routing policies are often very complex and hard to be understood and trusted by human users. In this paper, we aim to improve the interpretability of the GP-evolved routing policies by reducing the size of the GP-evolved routing policies since smaller routing policies tend to be easier to understand. We propose a new Multi-Objective GP (MOGP) to optimise the performance (total cost) and size simultaneously. One main challenge is that the size is much easier to be optimised than the performance. Thus, the population tends to be biased to the small but poor routing policies and quickly lose the ability of exploration. To address this issue, we propose a MOGP approach with α dominance strategy (α-MOGP) which can balance the tradeoff between performance and individual size. The experimental results showed that α-MOGP could obtain much smaller routing policies than the state-of-the-art single-objective GPHH, without deteriorating the performance. Compared with traditional MOGP, α-MOGP can obtain a much better and more widespread Pareto front.},

The original trend mining approach relies on a set of predefined reference directions along which an interestingness score is measured for each variable. In this paper, we relax this requirement by automating the approach to find optimal reference directions that maximize the interestingness for each variable. Additional extensions include the use of an Achievement Scalarizing Function (ASF) for ranking solutions along a given reference direction, and an updated interestingness score formulation for more appropriately handling discrete variables. We demonstrate the working of the extended approach on DTLZ2 and WFG2 benchmarks for up to five objectives and on a biobjective engineering design problem. The results show that the ability of the proposed approach to detect variable trends in high dimensional objective spaces is heavily dependent on the quality of the solutions used.},

A chaotic sequence is used to update the inertia weight used in each iteration of TLBO. Numerical experiments using three troubleshooting models and nine chaotic maps are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

  abstract  = {Association mining is a famous data mining technology because its form is explainable by human beings. Innovating fuzzy set theory to associations mining provides a solution to quantitative database, where membership function plays an important role in mining fuzzy associations. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been successfully applied to the optimization of membership functions. Based on the spirit of divide-and-conquer, GA optimizes the membership functions for each item separately. Nevertheless, the cooperation among different items in the course of evolution was never considered. Evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMO) is an emerging searching paradigm which dedicates to solving multiple tasks simultaneously for improving the search efficiency. This study introduces the EMO into genetic fuzzy data mining to address the above issue. Specifically, this study incorporates a state-of the-art genetic fuzzy data mining method, the structure-based representation genetic algorithm, with the well-known multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA). A series of experiments is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the structure-based representation genetic algorithm in terms of convergence speed and solution quality on all sizes of datasets. The results also show that the proposed method is about 20 times faster than the structure-based representation genetic algorithm with respect to the exploited number of evaluations.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces an enhancement of the recent developed Gaining Sharing Knowledge based algorithm, dubbed as GSK. This algorithm is an excellent example of a contemporary nature-based algorithm which is inspired from the human life behavior of gaining and sharing knowledge to solve the optimization task. GSK algorithm simulates the natural phenomena of human gaining and sharing knowledge using two main phases: junior and senior. A set of initial solutions are generated at the beginning of the search which are consideredjuniors. Later, the individuals are moving to senior stage by interacting with the environment and cooperating with other solutions during the search. The key idea in this work is to extend and improve the original GSK algorithm by proposing adaptive settings to the two important control parameters: knowledge factor and knowledge ratio. These two parameters are responsible to control junior and senior gaining and sharing phases between the solutions during the optimization loop. The algorithm is named AGSK and tested on the recent benchmark suite on bound constrained numerical optimization which consists of different challenging optimization problems with different dimensions. This benchmark is presented in IEEE-CEC2020 competition. When compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms including original GSK, AGSK shows superior performance.},

They tend to have at least quadratic complexity with respect to the number of points, yielding prohibitive run times or low quality solutions. The most common approach to tackle this problem is to use weaker, more randomized algorithms with lower complexities to solve the clustering problem. This work proposes a novel approach for performing this task, allowing traditional, stronger algorithms to work on a sample of the data, chosen in such a way that the overall clustering is considered good. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is competitive to classical algorithms in large datasets with the advantage of automatically adapting to many different datasets.},

In this research, we present the analysis of the application of a recently proposed hyper-heuristic for many-objective optimization to the wind turbine design problem. This application is a representative problem for renewable energy, with 32 variables, 22 constraints, and five objectives. In this study, we solved this problem using the cooperative hyper-heuristic (HH-CO), which uses eight MOEAs on its pool, and switches among them during the search. These MOEAs are representative strategies to deal with multi and many-objective optimization; within HH-CO, every MOEA has its internal population. This behavior is particularly suitable for many-objective optimization, where each MOEA has its criteria to select the solutions that will be preserved for the next generation. Besides, the MOEAs exchange information after being applied, with this migration step, all MOEAs update their private information even if they were not employed. We also evaluate the set of eight state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), adapted to handle constraints. The empirical analysis uses the hypervolume (HV) quality indicator to evaluate the results and, the HH-CO achieved results competitive to the best MOEAs.},

  abstract  = {Transfer learning has been used for solving multiple optimization and dynamic multi-objective optimization problems, since transfer learning is believed to be able to transfer useful information from one problem instance to help solving another related problem instance. This paper aims to study how effective transfer learning is in dynamic multi-objective optimization (DMO). Through computation time analysis of transfer learning, we show that the `inner&#39; optimization problem introduced by transfer learning is very time-consuming. In order to enhance the efficiency, two alternatives are computationally investigated on a number of dynamic bi- and tri-objective test problems. Experimental results have shown that the greatly enhanced efficiency does not result in much degeneration on the performance of transfer learning. Considering the high computational cost of transfer learning, it is likely that the original purpose of using transfer learning in DMO might be negated. In other words, the computation time saved in optimization is eaten up by computationally expensive transfer learning. As a result, there is less gain than expected in the overall computational efficiency. To verify this, experiments have been conducted, regarding using computational cost of transfer learning to optimize randomly generated solutions. The results have demonstrated that the convergence and diversity of final solutions generated from the random solutions are significantly better than those generated from transferred solutions under the same total computational budget.},

  abstract  = {Feature extraction, as one essential step of image classification, can potentially reduce image data dimensionality and capture effective information for improving performance. However, most existing image descriptors are designed to conduct specific tasks and might not be sufficient for different types of images. Genetic programming (GP) can automatically extract multiple important and discriminative features by incorporating diverse image descriptors into a GP program. Furthermore, different regions in an image have different structural characteristics. In this paper, we propose a region adaptive image classification approach based on GP, which can automatically extract informative image features by automatically applying different image descriptors in different regions of an image. A new flexible GP program structure with a new function set and a new terminal set is developed in this approach. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on four various data sets and compared with other state-of-the-art classification methods. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach is capable of achieving better or competitive performance than these baseline methods. Further analysis of some good programs shows the high interpretability of the proposed method.},

Due to the nature of randomness such as real-time delays, the traditional optimisation approaches are not effective in solving the stochastic problem variant. In this case, genetic programming hyper-heuristics (GPHH) are promising techniques for automatically learning heuristics to make real-time decisions to effectively handle the stochastic environment, however, they still have limitations as the decision making policies use short-sighted information. In this paper, we propose to incorporate global information into the GPHH solution, with a constructed terminal feature based on cluster information to be used by the GPHH, as well as a clustering-aware solution generation process. The experimental studies showed that the newly designed cluster-based feature gave an improvement over the standard GPHH solution. This suggests that incorporating cluster information can be beneficial. Although the clustering-aware solution generation process did not achieve satisfactory performance, the further analysis showed that it could lead to improved performance under certain condition. Overall we demonstrate the effectiveness of using clustering as a global information to enhance the performance of GPHH.},

  abstract  = {The adjustment of the hyperparameters and network structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) composes an important step towards building effective, but still efficient learning models. The selection of the best configuration is a problem-dependent task that involves to explore an enormous and complex search space. Due to this reason, the use of heuristic-based search fits perfectly within this task, seeking to obtain a near to optimal solution in a complex and large exploratory space. This paper presents SCRODeep, a self-adapting algorithm based on a statistically-driven Coral Reef Optimisation algorithm (SCRO), for the selection of the most adequate CNNs architecture in a particular domain. This metaheuristic has been designed to navigate through a search space where the architecture (defining the particular set of layers, including convolutional or pooling layers), and the hyperparameters of the network (i.e. activation functions, number of units or the kernel initializer, among others) are represented, but where the connections weights and bias are inferred using typical CNNs optimisation algorithms. In contrast to other approaches, where the use of a metaheuristic implies in turn to fix a series of hyperparameters (i.e. the mutation probability in a genetic algorithm), our approach follows a self-parametrisation perspective, thus removing the necessity of fixing these values. The method has been tested in the design of CNNs for image classification, showing that SCRODeep is able to find competitive solutions, while the complexity of the architectures found is constrained.},

DC-LA is based on the idea of changes in customer distribution over a defined period, and these changes have to be taken into account when establishing facilities to service changing customers distributions. This necessitated a dynamic stochastic evaluation function Which came with a high computational cost due to a large number of simulations required in the evaluation process.In this paper, we investigate the use of racing, an approach used in model selection, to reduce the high computational cost by employing the minimum number of simulations for solution selection. Our adaptation of racing uses the Friedman test to compare solutions statistically. Racing allows simulations to be performed iteratively, ensuring that the minimum number of simulations is performed to detect a statistical difference.We present experiments using Population-Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) to explore the savings achievable from using racing in this way. Our results show that racing achieves improved cost savings over the dynamic stochastic evaluation function. We also observed that on average, the computational cost of racing was about 4.5 times loWer than the computational cost of the full dynamic stochastic evaluation.},

To address these challenges, we propose a novel dynamic multiobjective particle swarm optimization approach with cooperative agents. In this strategy, the ability of tracking based on particle memory and multiple populations with sharing knowledge are combined to deal with environmental changing. If a change is detected, solutions with no improvement are re-evaluated and the worst solutions are replaced with the newly generated one. In addition, a movement strategy based on the sharing of the best knowledge is introduced to promote the population diversity. Experiments on several optimization problems are carried out to prove the performance of the proposed algorithm and the statistical results show that the proposed algorithm performs well with DMOPs.},

  abstract  = {Cultural Algorithms have led to the development of many ways to distribute information within social networks. These mechanisms act by helping the system make decisions about how information is distributed through a population network, and thus are called distribution or decision mechanisms. Many distribution mechanisms have been developed using techniques from auction theory, game theory and various forms of voting construct. Here we discuss several methods of Knowledge distribution collectively called the auction distributions mechanisms and their performance is compared using dynamic complex real-valued functional landscapes. We perform this comparison with regards to robustness, how well the system finds solutions, and resilience, how well the system reacts to changes in the dynamics of the system. In this paper an additional Subcultured Distribution Mechanism is described that works to factor the knowledge distribution mechanism into subnetworks in order to support a “deep social learning” approach. The Subcultured Distribution Mechanism is compared with the results of each individual distribution mechanism without a subculture enhancement, when applied to a series of dynamic complex optimization problems of varying complexities. The results suggest that relatively simple mechanism such as Weighted Majority Wins and First Price Auction are sufficient for environments that exhibit low entropic levels of change such as in linear changing environments. For nonlinearly changing environments, First Price Multi-round and English Auctions are most of effective on their own. The Subcultured Distribution Mechanism extension of these mechanisms was found to be best suited for complexities where the two distribution mechanisms had similar performances, and in the most chaotic environments where having multiple distribution mechanisms to choose from was advantageous.},

Evolutionary multi- and many-objective optimization generally provides a large set of non-dominated solutions. They are useful for precisely approximating the Pareto front but harm decision making when selecting one solution among them. Sampling and presenting a representative set of solutions is a promising method for addressing this issue. The selection of a subset of solutions from a large set of solutions is a type of combinatorial optimization problem. Its difficulty is increased by increasing the size of the non-dominated solution set, because the number of selection combinations of the solutions increases exponentially. This work focuses on environmental selection as a reasonable method to sample a solution subset from a large set. We compare 17 environmental selection methods incorporated in EMO algorithms and show that the one-by-one selection or deletion approach is suitable for sampling a representative nondominated set.},

  abstract  = {Data replication is the core of distributed systems to enhance their fault tolerance and make services highly available to the end-users. Data replication masks run-time failures and hence, makes the system more reliable. There are many contemporary data replication strategies for this purpose, but the decision to choose an appropriate strategy for a certain environment and a specific scenario is a challenge and full of compromises. There exists a potentially indefinite number of scenarios that cannot be covered entirely by contemporary strategies. It demands designing new data replication strategies optimized for the given scenarios. The constraints of such scenarios are often conflicting in a sense that an increase in one objective could be sacrificial to the others, which implies there is no best solution to the problem but what serves the purpose. In this regard, this research provides a genetic programming-based multi-objective optimization approach that endeavors to not only identify, but also design new data replication strategies and optimize their conflicting objectives as a single-valued metric. The research provides an intelligent, automatic mechanism to generate new replication strategies as well as easing up the decision making so that relevant strategies with satisfactory trade-offs of constraints can easily be picked and used from the generated solutions at run-time. Moreover, it makes the notion of hybrid strategies easier to accomplish which otherwise would have been very cumbersome to achieve, therefore, to optimize.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the problem of including the choice of the High-Lift Devices (HLDs) configuration as a decision variable of an automatic optimisation tool. This task requires the coupling of an estimation routine and an optimisation algorithm. For the former, SU2 flow solver has been used. The Structured-Chromosome Genetic Algorithm (SCGA) optimiser has been employed to search for the optimal HLD. SCGA can overcome the limitations dictated by standard fixed-size continuous optimisation algorithms. Indeed, using hierarchical formulations, it can manage configurational decisions that are conventionally the responsibility of expert designers. The search algorithm bases its strategy on revised genetic operators conceived for handling hierarchical search spaces. The presented research not only shows the practicability of delegating to a specialised optimisation algorithm the complete HLD design but is intended to be a proof of concept for the whole field of multidisciplinary design optimisation. Indeed, the aerospace sector as a whole would benefit by reducing human intervention from the decision process.},

Hyper-heuristics conduct a search in the space of heuristics, or heuristic space, for the most suitable heuristic to apply to candidate solutions in problem space. Traditionally, hyper-heuristics manage relatively simple low-level heuristics, which are often based on human domain intuition. Increasingly, hyper-heuristics are being used in conjunction with population-based meta-heuristics as the low-level heuristics. A heuristic space diversity measure helps practitioners understand the behavior of hyper-heuristics that manage population-based heuristics. This paper discusses existing measures to quantity heuristic space diversity, highlights shortcomings of these existing measures, and proposes a new heuristic space diversity entropy-based measure. Spatial and temporal volatility measures that characterize entity-to-heuristic assignments are also proposed.},

In this paper, a class of MPMOPs, that is, MPMOPs having common Pareto optimal solutions, is addressed.

  abstract  = {Metagenomic shotgun sequencing enables us to explore diverse DNA sequences from viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic microbes in complex samples. As the continuous advancement of sequencing technology generates a massive amount of sequencing data, its overall computational complexity has become a major challenge for traditional database sequence comparison methods. Studies have shown that deep learningoriented methods have been widely adopted to solve many classification problems, including those in the bioinformatics field, and have demonstrated this method&#39;s accuracy and efficiency for analyzing large-scale datasets. The aim of this study attempts to investigate how deep learning (LSTM model) can be used to learn sequential genome patterns through virus detection from metagenomic data. This study provides three major contributions. First, we provide the background and steps for the task of DNA sequencing classification from data collection, preprocessing, and normalization. Second, we analyze the effect of sequence length on LSTM classification accuracy and split the raw sequencing data to proper subsequences to improve the outcome of virus detection. Third, to enhance both the classification accuracy and processing speed, we introduce the concept of discrimination function that enables prediction results for multiple subsequences results and accelerated these processes through GPU parallel computing. Two case studies of HCV and influenza detection were conducted to elaborate upon the accuracy and computational efficiency of our proposed approach. Our test result showed that the proposed LSTM model obtained similar pathogen detection accuracy to the conventional BLAST method with a speed that was about 36 times faster.},

Such problems arise when clients in a commercial district need to be attended daily and the time to visit them is limited, for example by working hours of retail businesses. Routing costs are modeled by traveling salesman tours starting from predetermined depot locations. Besides having low routing costs, districts must also satisfy balancing (e.g. of total demand or workload) and contiguity constraints, and may also be required to be geographically compact. We propose a general heuristic for solving such problems. It iteratively builds new solutions by a greedy constructive heuristic, and then improves them by a hybrid alternating tabu search strategy. We further propose an efficient scheme for maintaining high-quality routes under small modifications to districts, for example incurred by neighborhood search operators. In extensive computational experiments we study the different components of our method, and show that it is effective in treating a number of problem variants with different constraints.},

  abstract  = {Population-based algorithms are a well-established category of metaheuristic optimization algorithms in which individuals collaborate with each other to find the optimal solution in a search space. During the search process, each individual provides a partial intelligence which can assist the population movement toward promising regions. In this paper, a dimension-wise strategy is proposed to collect the intelligence of whole population to generate a new trial candidate solution. For new individual, the value of each variable is calculated using the votes of a more-crowded cluster of individuals obtained on each dimension (one-dimensional clustering). Accordingly, a group of candidate solutions in the population collaborate to determine a variable value of new individual. Utilizing this strategy, collective intelligence (CI) aims the algorithm to find better candidate solutions. Since the proposed method keeps untouched all other parts of the algorithm, it can be used with any population-based algorithm. This paper presents the modification of two well-known population-based algorithms based on the proposed strategy in utilizing Collective Intelligence (CI), Differential Evolution (CIDE) and Particle Swarm optimization (CIPSO). In conducted experiments, two proposed algorithms are compared with classical version of DE and PSO on 30 functions of CEC2017 benchmark. The results indicate that the proposed method generates an individual with better objective function value than many of the individuals in the population which leads totally better results in overall.},

Generally, layers selection is performed manually; however, as the number of layers increases, the layers selection process becomes increasingly difficult. Thus, we propose a method to select an effective layers in transfer learning automatically using a genetic algorithm. In the proposed method, a genotype representing which layers&#39; weights are updated or fixed in transfer learning is considered, and we achieve efficient layers selection in the way that a genotype with high validation accuracy is survived during genotype selection. Experiments are performed using the InceptionV3 network that pre-trained ImageNet as source images with transfer learning to CIFAR-100 as target images. Experimental results demonstrate that the test data accuracy in an ensemble of models whose layers are selected by the genetic algorithm is 15\% and 12\% greater than that of models trained by from-scratch and fine-tuning, respectively. In general transfer learning approach, layers on the output side are selected as adjustable layers; however, it is found that the distribution of the selected layers as an effective adjustable layers obtained by the genetic algorithm extends to the entire network. Transfer learning using a genetic algorithm may successfully capture the characteristics of a convolutional neural network&#39;s structure.},

When bacterial individuals tumble or swim to worthless areas (i.e., poor fitness), the proposed strategy reverses and expands the current search directions in hopes of finding other effective directions to escape the current dilemma. We then use random noise generated by a Gaussian distribution to perturb these reversed directions to prevent bacterial individuals from oscillating in original directions. Besides, we also propose a structural simplification strategy to greatly simplify the optimization framework of the standard bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) by integrating the elimination-dispersal operation into the reproduction operation. In other words, there are two ways to replace unhealthy bacterial individuals in our proposed strategy, one is copied by healthy bacterial individuals and the other is generated by the elimination-dispersal operation. We also use Gaussian mutations to perturb these offspring individuals that exactly replicate their parents to increase the diversity of the population. Finally, the three-level nested BFO optimization framework can be reduced to a single-level loop. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we run (the standard BFO + two proposed strategies) and the standard BFO on 28 benchmark functions from CEC 2013 test suite, and each function is run 30 times independently on three different dimensions. The experimental results confirmed that our proposed strategies can speed up the BFO search and jump out of local areas effectively.},

In this method (KLSH+iForest), the kernel function is used to map the data from the linearly indivisible data space to the linearly separable feature space, and local anomalies are converted into global anomalies. Based on above, iForest is constructed to perform anomaly detection on the Kernelized data sets. To solve the problem of how to select the optimal segmentation attributes and values for iForest, this paper proposes a mean optimization strategy. While maintaining the ability of iForest to detect global anomalies, KLSH+iForest also improves the accuracy of local anomaly detection. We compare KLSH+iForest with the LOF algorithm and the improved algorithms based on LSH on public data sets. Experimental results show that KLSH+iForest has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection in highdimensional and massive data sets.},

  abstract  = {Motion planning of an autonomous mobile robot is involved in generating safe, optimal, short, and/or reasonable trajectories in its workspace and finally reaching its final target while avoiding collision with obstacles and escaping traps. This paper presents a new hybrid model to optimize trajectory of the global path of a mobile robot using a graph-based search algorithm associated with an ant colony optimization (ACO) method. Once a graph representing the robot workspace populated with obstacles is modelled by MAKLINK graph theory, Dijkstra algorithm is utilized to seek the sub-optimal collision-free robot trajectory. On the basis of the initial global sub-optimal trajectory generated by Dijkstra algorithm, the motion trajectory of the mobile robot is optimized in Cartesian space through the ACO method. Most importantly, a Bspline curve based smoothing scheme is, in a greater degree, applied to generate safer and smother trajectories with reasonable distance from obstacles. Results of simulation and comparison studies in various sorts of environments are addressed in order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid graph-based model.},

  abstract  = {Background: Direct detection of polyps from colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) videos is an ultimate goal not only for physicians but also for biomedical engineers who are working on automatic internal lesions like polyps. There is also a great enthusiasm among biomedical professionals to make advanced systems for aiding doctors to have a faster and accurate diagnosis by the means of polyp detection from CCE acquired video streams. Such systems must be able to localize polyps correctly and extract the whole lesions from the video frames completely.Material and Methods: In this paper, a new approach toward object-wise polyp detection from CCE frames in a video stream is proposed. The proposed method employs modified region proposal CNNs to localize the existing polyps from CCE acquired video frames and after that a level-set method known as Distance Regularized Level Set Evolution (DRLSE) is employed for automatic model-based segmentation of localized polyps. The pixel-wise detection of polyps is necessary for polyp classification and will help gastroenterologists to determine appropriate prognosis and treatment for the patients.Results and conclusion: The proposed method is trained by the means of an CCE still image dataset which includes manually annotated polyps. The trained network is then applied to CCE video images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to localize and detect polyps both region-wise and pixel-wise with a good rate of accuracy.},

In a second step, the energy-optimal solution will be determined within the remaining parameter space reduced by the first step.

In TRSALS, the tray efficiencies are estimated by solving a constrained optimization problem, which is based on the combination of Kriging surrogate based global search and RBF surrogate-based trust-region local search. The estimated key tray temperature profile is compared with that of the actual one of the industrial column to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

Since the breeding patterns of real plants can be roughly divided into sexual reproduction and asexual one, the proposed strategy additionally introduces two different methods to simulate these two patterns. As our preliminary attempt of the simulation, a mature individual is splattered randomly in the neighbor local area of its parent individual with Gaussian distribution probability to simulate asexual reproduction, while a mature individual is generated by crossing randomly selected two different parent individuals to simulate sexual reproduction. Our proposed strategy consists of these two new reproduction methods and that of our original VEGE, and each mature individual in every generation randomly selects one of these three methods to generate seed individuals, which is analogous to different plant species using different mechanisms to breed. To evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy, we compare VEGE and (VEGE + the proposed generation strategy) on 28 benchmark functions of three different dimensions from the CEC 2013 test suit with 30 independent trial runs. The experimental results have confirmed that the proposed strategy can increase the diversity of seed individuals, accelerate the convergence of VEGE significantly, and become effective according to the increase of dimensions.},

This paper evaluates an alternative method: population-based search, i.e. evolutionary optimization. Its performance is compared to that of the Taguchi method in several simulated conditions, including an orthogonal one designed to favor the Taguchi method, and two realistic conditions with dependences between variables. Evolutionary optimization is found to perform significantly better especially in the realistic conditions, suggesting that it forms a good approach for web interface design and other related applications in the future.},

  abstract  = {Modern radiation therapy treatment planning has traditionally relied upon computed tomography (CT) in modeling the interaction of megavoltage (MV) photons with the various tissues and organs of the body. CT image data provide both detailed information about individual patient anatomy, as well as a voxel-by-voxel three-dimensional grid of Hounsfield units (HU), which specifies, at all points within the patient, essentially the difference between the attenuation coefficient of the tissue within that voxel from the attenuation coefficient of water, normalized to that of water. From the HU value, the relative electron density can be inferred, and as the relative electron density is the major determinant of the interaction of the tissue with MV photons, the radiation dose distribution can then be calculated. Recently, there has been interest in using magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in lieu of CT, as MR provides superior soft-tissue contrast; however, MR does not provide any electron density information. Various approaches have been essayed to create a synthetic CT (synCT) from the MR data. In the present study, genetic programming was used to construct mappings of MR data to HU data for seven tissue types: bladder, cancellous bone, cortical bone, fat, muscle, prostate, and rectum. These maps were then applied to randomly chosen points in five patient data sets to calculate the synCT HU values, which were then compared with the actual HU values from CT images of those same patients. The method produced mean absolute errors (MAE) of 9.28 HU, 33.24 HU, 75.32 HU, 18.64 HU, 17.12 HU, 11.76 HU, and 18.40 HU for the respective tissue types, and these MAE values are less than those of previous approaches, indicating superior performance. Although the method of the present study does require more manual input, the superior performance is compensatory. Further study is necessary to confirm accuracy on entire MR data sets, and to ensure there is no sample variance effect on the current results.},

Then, a solution is proposed from the perspective of evolutionary computation. In particularly, the coordinates and the slope of the desired line formation, together with the pairings between initial positions and target positions, are obtained based on particle swarm optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of this method by comparing the simulation results with the results of theoretical analysis.

Here, the pruning power of a solution represents the number of points dominated by the solution in the local partition, which is used to identify knees. Then, an efficient pruning-power indicator is developed and then is proven mathematically to be able to characterize the solutions and further reduce the complexity of the hypervolume measurement. Based on this indicator, the algorithm uses angle-based partitioning and the nondominating sorting to accelerate convergence and maintain diversity of solutions. Finally, the algorithm is validated experimentally by using several DTLZ and WFG test problems and common performance measure. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The proposed algorithm is built on the idea of investing in different sectors of the market based on the potential of each sector; in other words, it is built on the idea of searching different regions in the solution space based on the so-called potential of each region. By using such a search strategy, the proposed algorithm is less likely to fall into local optimum at early iterations while at the same time retaining the search diversity during the convergence process.

We focus on the TST for tumor with unknown size by considering the tumor growth process in this paper. The weak priority evolution strategy (WP-ES) based in vivo computational algorithm proposed in our previous work is utilized for the TST at three tumor growth stages for two representative landscapes by considering the nanorobots&#39; lifespans and other realistic constraints. Furthermore, we propose the “tension and relaxation (T-R)” principle, which is used for the actuating of nanorobots in the TST process for the tumor with unknown size.

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a new tabu technique to enhance the search performance of edge assembly crossover (EAX). EAX is known as the most promising recombination operator for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) among population-based evolutional approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA). It succeeds in generating a sophisticated combination of parents&#39; traits and makes GA comparable to state-of-the-art heuristics for the TSP. EAX can find the optimal in very large instances, however, it sometimes does not work well on instances involving a lattice pattern. This is because, in the instance including cities that are arranged in a lattice pattern, it is difficult to find the best tour due to the existence of many alternative candidate tours. In instances that include such patterns, the diversity of edges in the population is decreased because the EAX concentrates and repeats exchanging edges in this local pattern, and pays less attention to combinations of edge globally. In this paper, we improve EAX itself by introducing a tabu scheme to inhibit repeating the exchange of the same edges in order to reduce the bias of edge to be exchanged between parents and enhance the diversity in offspring. Numerical experiments show the search performance of our new method in the instances selected from TSPLIB and VLSI TSP.},

  abstract  = {Network intrusion and cyber attacks are the most severe concern for Cloud computing service providers. The vulnerability of attacks is on a hike that manual or simple rule-based detection of cyber-attacks is not robust. In order to tackle cyber attacks in a reliable manner, an automated Intrusion Detection system equipped with a swarm intelligence (SI) based machine learning model (ML) is essential to deploy at entry points of the network. Nowadays, the application of SI with ML is used in various research areas. For an efficient IDS, choosing relevant features from the noisy data is an open question. In this regard, this paper proposes a method that utilizes the Whale Pearson hybrid feature selection wrapper for reducing the irrelevancy in the IDS model. Whale Pearson hybrid wrapper is an improved version of the binary Whale optimization Algorithm (WOA). The WOA is a type of SI algorithm which is inspired by the behavior of humpback whales. The proposed method has chosen 8 out of 42 features from the Hackereath Network attack prediction data-set, which are sufficient for building an efficient Intrusion detection model. The model trained with the eight features produces an accuracy of 80\%, which is 8\% greater than the accuracy produced by the original data-set with the KNN algorithm on ten-fold cross-validation.},

  abstract  = {Population based metaheuristics (e.g. Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, ...) deal with a dichotomy between exploration (discover unexplored areas) and exploitation (dig around a good solution). The consequence is a wide exploration of the search space. A lot of information about the link between the objective function and the input variables is collected during the algorithm. Sensitivity analysis methods allow to transform this information in order to characterize the effect of an input variable on the objective function: linear impact, nonlinear impact, negligible impact. We propose to integrate a sensitivity analysis method in the optimization process in order to increase or decrease the shift length when offsetting a variable according to its behavior. The offset of a variable with a nonlinear impact has to be small in order to catch possible local optima of the objective function. On the contrary, the offset of a variable with a linear impact has to be high in order to move faster the variable toward its best position. A toy example is used to illustrate the interest of the method.},

In this research, we propose to use genetic programming to model and predict the final outcome of NBA playoffs. We use the regular season performance statistics of each team to predict their final ranks in the Playoffs.

The proposed model has been adapted to solve the complex problem of defining the best sequence of offshore maintenance activities and allocated staff to maximize service provider profitability within three months, while respecting all service completion time constraints and specific offshore work constraints. To evaluate the performance of this new model in solving the proposed problem, two CPSO+ variants were evaluated against the original CPSO model, in six proposed simulation cases. The results of the simulations indicate that the proposed CPSO+ model with reduced initialization variation outperforms other evaluated models in execution time and solution quality to the given problem.},

  abstract  = {Applying latent variable evolution to game level design has become more and more popular as little human expert knowledge is required. However, defective levels with illegal patterns may be generated due to the violation of constraints for level design. A traditional way of repairing the defective levels is programming specific rule-based repairers to patch the flaw. However, programming these constraints is sometimes complex and not straightforward. An autonomous level repairer which is capable of learning the constraints is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CNet, to learn the probability distribution of tiles giving its surrounding tiles on a set of real levels, and then detect the illegal tiles in generated new levels. Then, an evolutionary repairer is designed to search for optimal replacement schemes equipped with a novel search space being constructed with the help of CNet and a novel heuristic function. The proposed approaches are proved to be effective in our case study of repairing GAN-generated and artificially destroyed levels of Super Mario Bros. game. Our CNet-assisted evolutionary repairer can also be easily applied to other games of which the levels can be represented by a matrix of objects or tiles.},

The large number of students implies an enormous and not manageable amount of interactions. This fact, along with the different interests of the students, results in low quality interactions. Due to the large amount of students, it also becomes impossible the composition of learning groups manually. Due to these characteristics present in MOOCs, a method for the formation of groups was developed in this work, as an attempt to meet the dichotomy that exists between the collective. For the formation of groups, an adaptation of the Particle Swarm optimization algorithm was proposed on the basis of three criteria, level of knowledge, interests and leadership profiles, forming groups with different levels of knowledge, interests similar and distributed leadership, providing a better interaction and construction of knowledge. On a test basis, the algorithm demonstrated that can meet the criteria for grouping in a computation time and is more efficient than the model of random groups. The tests also showed that the algorithm is robust considering the various data sets and variations of iterations.},

  abstract  = {Computer vision algorithms that make use of optical flow are constantly increasing in complexity, especially in the context of elaborated algorithms that are heavily inspired by biology. To develop upon and utilise these algorithms for realworld tasks, their extensive parameter sets need to be tuned. Due to algorithmic complexity, and non-linearities present throughout their parameter set, this is no small task. Using an adaptive genetic algorithm, which itself is biologically-inspired, we look at the performance and behaviour of the tuning when significant changes have been made to a low speed rotational velocity optical flow estimation algorithm. We validate that previously reported changes to the optical flow estimator yielded a fitness increase of over 30\% when compared to the baseline model the changes were made to, and a 15\% increase once that baseline model was also tuned. This improvement would be extremely unlikely without the aid of evolutionary computation algorithms. This shows that even an extremely complex computer vision algorithm with many parameters, 36 in this case, can be tuned to an operating point, facilitating the continued development work on the vision algorithm by allowing for the validation and quantification of algorithmic changes.},

  abstract  = {NeuroEvolution is one of the most competitive evolutionary learning strategies for designing novel neural networks for use in specific tasks, such as logic circuit design and digital gaming. However, the application of benchmark methods such as the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) remains a challenge, in terms of their computational cost and search time inefficiency. This paper advances a method which incorporates a type of topological edge coding, named Reverse Encoding Tree (RET), for evolving scalable neural networks efficiently. Using RET, two types of approaches - NEAT with Binary search encoding (Bi-NEAT) and NEAT with Golden-Section search encoding (GS-NEAT) - have been designed to solve problems in benchmark continuous learning environments such as logic gates, Cartpole, and Lunar Lander, and tested against classical NEAT and FS-NEAT as baselines. Additionally, we conduct a robustness test to evaluate the resilience of the proposed NEAT approaches. The results show that the two proposed approaches deliver improved performance, characterized by (1) a higher accumulated reward within a finite number of time steps; (2) using fewer episodes to solve problems in targeted environments, and (3) maintaining adaptive robustness under noisy perturbations, which outperform the baselines in all tested cases. Our analysis also demonstrates that RET expends potential future research directions in dynamic environments. Code is available from https://github.com/HaolingZHANG/ReverseEncodingTree.},

  abstract  = {Recently it has been found that the earth&#39;s oceans are warming at a pace that is 40\% faster than predicted by a United Nations panel a few years ago. As a result, 2018 has become the warmest year on record for the earth&#39;s oceans. That is because the oceans have acted as a buffer by absorbing 93\% of the heat produced by the greenhouse gases [1]. The impact of the oceanic warming has already been felt in terms of the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean as an effect of the ENSO process. The ENSO process is a cycle of warming and subsequent cooling of the Pacific Ocean that can last over a period of years. This cycle was first documented by Peruvian fishermen in the early 1600&#39;s. So it has been part of the environmental challenges that have been presented to economic agents throughout the world since then. It has even been suggested that the cycle has increased in frequency over the years, perhaps in response to the overall issues related to global warming. [2] [3] In this paper Cultural Algorithms are used to develop a multiobjective agent-based model of artisanal (traditional offshore) fishing behavior in coastal Peru, Cerro Azul. The data used to produce this model comes from the observation of fishing behavior over a four year period, 1982-1986. During this period over 6000 individual fishing trips were documented. This observation period overlapped with one of the largest ENSO activities ever recorded. As a result, it was possible to observe the changes in fishing behavior that were the result of this process. While the data is several decades old, the ENSO process was first observed in Peru in 1502. Thus, this data can be considered to reflect the adaptations that have been made to the process in the ensuing centuries. The model was used to produce Pareto curves that reflected tradeoffs in terms of fish quality and trip effort during each of three phases on the ENSO process. A version of Cultural Algorithms, CAPSO, was then used to compute whether these curves were significantly different from each other. The results suggested that they each represented a different phased response to the local climate change. During the warming phase fisherman had to exert less effort to secure quality fish than in the subsequent cooling off period. In that period there were more types of catches but they were distributed over a wider area. The final, back to normal phase reflected a compromise between the two, where fewer types of catches of slightly lower quality, but with lesser effort than in the previous phases.},

A well on the Navajo Nation in Arizona, USA was selected as the candidate site and real-world data were used. The capacity of the RO system was 18.93 m 3 /d (5000 gal/d), requiring a constant power consumption of 3.95 kW. The results of the AS optimization showed that the optimal configuration with the smallest annualized cost of the renewable energy system was a hybrid wind/photovoltaic/battery system, although a diesel generator was a candidate. The cost of energy was 0.46 USD/ kWh and cost of water was 3.35 USD/m 3 , which was less than half of the 7.9 USD/m 3 currently paid by residents that live in the area.},
