  abstract  = {Backdoor attacks have become a serious security concern because of the rising popularity of unverified third party machine learning resources such as datasets, pretrained models, and processors. Pre-trained models and shared datasets have become popular due to the high training requirement of deep learning. This raises a serious security concern since the shared models and datasets may be modified intentionally in order to reduce system efficacy. A backdoor attack is difficult to detect since the embedded adversarial decision rule will only be triggered by a pre-chosen pattern, and the contaminated model behaves normally on benign samples. This paper devises a backdoor attack detection method to identify whether a sample is attacked for image-related applications. The information consistence provided by an image without each segment is considered. The absence of the segment containing a trigger strongly affects the consistence since the trigger dominates the decision. Our proposed method is evaluated empirically to confirm the effectiveness in various settings. As there is no restrictive assumption on the trigger of backdoor attacks, we expect our proposed model is generalizable and can defend against a wider range of modern attacks.},

  abstract  = {Most of the existing person re-identification (ReID) methods relies heavily on a person&#39;s clothes since clothing information is the clear and remarkable visual feature when the face of a person is unclear. However, in reality, people does not always wear the same cloth across camera views. Even worse, an adversary may change the clothes aiming to evade the identification. Some studies confirms that clothes changing downgrades the existing ReID methods significantly. The current ReID method considering clothes-changing does not fully utilize the person discriminant features, which may reduce its accuracy. This paper presents a dual-path model to learn the robust features under clothes changing and also the discriminant features for ReID from a RGB image and its contour sketch image respectively. The appearance and shape features of a person extracted by the two branches of our model are then combined to make a decision. The clothing information is eliminated from the appearance features by encouraging the similarity between the learned appearance and shape features. The experimental results on the PRCC dataset demonstrate that our model achieves higher performance under clothes changing compared to state-of-the-art ReID methods.},

Such ensemble strategy is realized through considering the requirement of each decision class. The experimental results on 8 UCI data sets show that the supervised neighborhood based ensemble strategy can generate reduct not only with higher generalization performance but also with higher stability.},

In addition to attribute evaluation, attribute search strategy is also a very important issue for attribute reduction. In this paper, we define the concentration, dispersion, stability degree of samples with respect to the single attribute to measure the significance of attributes, and use the stability of samples to pre-sort attributes. A fast attribute reduction algorithm with attribute pre-sort based on neighborhood rough set (APNRS) is designed to search a reduct, and the reduct is more conducive to classify learning tasks. Compared with the traditional greedy search algorithms, the APNRS algorithm greatly improves the computational efficiency under the condition of ensuring classification accuracy. Finally, a series of numerical experiments are carried out to verily the efficiency of the APNRS.},

It is able to efficiently detect the arrival of novel unseen classes as well as tackle real-time data stream classification. Specifically, the proposed hybrid meta-classifler includes three ensemble models, i.e. class-specific, cluster-specific and complementary boosting ensemble classifiers. Distinctive training strategies are also proposed for the generation of effective and diversified ensemble classifiers. The weights of the above ensemble models and the threshold of the novel class confidence are subsequently optimized using a modified Firefly Algorithm, to enhance performance. The above proposed ensemble and optimization algorithms cooperate with each other to conduct the detection of novel unseen classes. Several UCI databases are employed for evaluation, i.e. The KDD Cup, Image Segmentation, Soybean Large, Glass and Iris databases. In comparison with the baseline meta-algorithms such as Boosting, Bagging and Stacking, our approach shows significantly enhanced performance with the increment of the number of novel classes for all the test data sets, which poses great challenges to the existing baseline ensemble methods.},

This research tackles such challenges by proposing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variants embedded with novel mutation and sampling iteration operations for feature selection in object recognition. Specifically, five PSO variants integrating different mutation and sampling strategies have been proposed to select the most discriminative feature subsets for the classification of different objects. A mutation strategy is firstly proposed by randomly flipping the particle positions in some dimensions to generate new feature interactions. Moreover, instead of embarking the position updating evolution in PSO, the proposed PSO variants generate offspring solutions through a sampling mechanism during the initial search process. Two offspring generation sampling schemes are investigated, i.e. the employment of the personal and global best solutions obtained using the mutation mechanism, respectively, as the starting positions for the subsequent search process. Subsequently, several machine learning algorithms are used in conjunction with the proposed PSO variants to perform object classification. As evidenced by the empirical results, the proposed PSO variants outperform the original PSO algorithm, significantly, for feature optimization.},

The attribute descriptions are first converted from texts to a Boolean vector by a bag of words method. The embedding layer method is applied to deal with the sparsity problem of the Boolean vector. A metric learning model is then trained to construct a metric for the similarity of the descriptions.

Accordingly, it is important to investigate the problem of feature selection for big data and to design feature selection algorithm for big data. Based on MapReduce and voting mechanism, a feature selection method for big data is proposed in this paper. The proposed methods include three steps: Firstly, partition big data set into m subsets, and deploy the subsets to m computing nodes of Hadoop. Secondly, on the m computing nodes, we employ a feature selection algorithm based on genetic algorithm to select important features in parallel using local data subset, and obtain m feature subsets. Finally, for each feature, m feature subsets are used to vote on it, and the final feature subset is selected according to the voting results. Experimental results on four big data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and efficient.},

  abstract  = {In the real world, there are many imbalanced data classification problems, such as extreme weather prediction, software defect prediction, machinery fault diagnosis, spam filtering, etc. It has important theoretical and practical value to study the problem of imbalanced data classification. In the framework of binary imbalanced data classification, a three-stage method for classification of binary imbalanced big data was proposed in this paper. Specifically, in the first stage, the negative class big data was clustered into K clusters by K-means algorithm on Hadoop platform. In the second stage, we use instance selection method to select important samples from each cluster in parallel, and obtain K negative class subsets. In the third stage, we first construct K balanced training sets which consist of negative class subset and positive class subset, and then train K classifiers, and finally we integrate these classifiers to classify the unseen samples. Some experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with two state-of-the-art methods on G-means. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than the compared approaches.},

  abstract  = {Over the centuries, human aimed to achieve the ability to understand the inner functions of the mind and brain. One of the techniques to understand such functions is the application of neurofeedback. Neurofeedback is the procedure which has an influence on physiological brain conditions that takes place by allowing self-regulation of brain activities. Several techniques have been used in the application of neurofeedback to improve different kinds of brain-related conditions including attention capacity and other disabilities. However, literature shows that there are still chances of further improvement in this field, since neurofeedback often causes complications anxiety, discontent and discomfort. Therefore in this paper, we proposed a method to detect modulated motor cortex using anodal and cathodal tDCS based neurofeedback to achieve a better result in the application of neurofeedback. The proposed method showed a higher percentage of accuracy (98.67\%) for both anodal and cathodal using Electroencephalography(EEG) based neurofeedback data for twenty subjects. The accuracy of our proposed method is better than three other existing techniques on neurofeedback application. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is suitable in the application of neurofeedback.},

Consequently, Machine Learning techniques can detect patterns of ECG that are able to screen CAD cases. We developed a machine learning tool that extracts RR interval features from ECG signals, and used different statistical learning algorithms to detect CAD based on these features. Our results indicate that patterns in ECG signals and attributes of patients such as age and gender can predict CAD in diverse clinical scenarios in real life with a performance superior to the available screening and diagnostic tests.},

There have been many methods that represented each chemical by a set of descriptors, which are identified by experts as promising properties for predicting biological activity or toxicity. These chemical descriptors play a critical role in computational methods, that task correlated descriptors are favorable to achieve high prediction performance. However, there are few work compare the effectiveness of chemical descriptors and evaluate their performance in toxicity prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble feature selection method based on random under-sampling to analysis the effectiveness of chemical descriptors adopted in toxicity prediction application. The proposed method is efficient and can relief the imbalanced data problem of toxicity. Experiment results on the tox21 toxicity prediction dataset show that &quot;molecular property&quot;, &quot;connectivity&quot; and &quot;topological&quot; descriptor are the three most important descriptors for toxicity prediction tasks among the 12 popular descriptors adopted in toxicity prediction applications. The results of this study can be used as a guide to propose new descriptors for chemical toxicity prediction.},

We leverage insights from social networking theory to provide an encryption-invariant OS classification technique that is quick to train and widely deployable on various network configurations. In particular, we show how an affiliation graph can be used as an input to a machine learning classifier to predict the OS of a device using only the IP addresses for which the device communicates with.We examine the effectiveness of our approach through an empirical analysis of 498 devices on a university campus&#39; wireless network. In particular, we show our methodology can classify different OS families (i.e., Apple, Windows, and Android OSs) with an accuracy of 99.3\%. Furthermore, we extend this study by: 1) examining distinct OSs (e.g., iOS, OS X, and Windows 10); 2) investigating the interval of time required to make an accurate prediction; and, 3) determining the effectiveness of our approach after six months.},

The physicians normally follow the manual way of delineation for diagnosis of tumors which is time consuming and requires too much knowledge of anatomy. To resolve these limitations, convolutional neural network (CNN) based U-Net autoencoder model is proposed which performs automated segmentation of brain tumors from 3D MRI brain images by extracting the key features of the tumor. Additionally, Image normalization, image augmentation, image binarization etc. are applied for data pre-processing. Later on, the model is applied to the new 3D MRI brain images to test the accuracy of it. Applying the proposed method, the accuracy is obtained upto 96.06\% considering the 18 subjects. Finally, this approach is a well-structured model for segmenting the tumor region from MRI brain images as compare to the other existing models which may assist the physicians for better diagnosis and therefore, opening the door for more precise therapy and better treatment to the patient.},

PD varies from one person to another person depending on the situation and the family history.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), ultrasound of the brain, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans are common imaging tests to figure out this disease but these tests are not particularly effective. In this research, several tests are run on two types of data group - control and PD affected people. The dataset is collected from the Parkinson&#39;s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) repository. Then MRI slices are processed from the selected data group into the CNN models. Three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures are used in this work to extract features from the data group. The CNN models are InceptionV3, VGG16 and VGG19.

One of the most harmful diseases is brain tumor, which results in a very short life expectancy of the affected patient. Detection of brain tumor is a challenging task in the early stages. Still, with the help of modern technology and machine learning algorithms, it has become a matter of great interest for research. While detecting the brain tumor of an affected person, we are considering the fMRI data of the patient. Our aim is to identify whether the tumor is present in the patient&#39;s brain or not. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) that is good enough to generate high accuracy. We have used some deeper architecture design VGG16, VGG19, and Inception v3 for better accuracy. Three classification techniques are used namely binary classification, lobe based classification, and position based classification. The main contribution of our proposed work is that we have identified the specific region of the brain where the tumor is located. The region-based classification distinguishes our work from others that are applied on the same dataset. For binary classification, we found approximately 95\% accuracy from all the three architectures. Furthermore, we found approximately 78\% accuracy for lobe based classification and approximately 97\% accuracy for position based classification. The experimental results indicate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of identifying the brain tumor.},

  abstract  = {Stress refers to body’s physical, emotional and psychological reaction to any environmental change needing adjustment with major impact on human psychology. Stress is specially difficult to manage for visually impaired people (VIP) as they can become easily stressed in unknown situations. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to detect stress as it basically represents the ongoing electrical signal changes in human brain. Literature shows that the stress detection techniques are mostly based on either time or frequency domain analysis. However, using either time or frequency domain analysis may not be sufficient to provide appropriate outcome for stress detection. Hence, in this paper a method is proposed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and short-term Fourier transform (STFT) are used to extract features considering spatio-temporal information from EEG signals. In the EMD, the signal is first decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) representing a finite number of signals while maintaining the time domain and STFT is used to convert time domain to time-frequency domain. Support vector machine (SVM) is applied to classify the stress of VIP in unfamiliar indoor environments. The performance of the proposed method is compared with a state-of-the-art technique for stress detection. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique over the existing technique.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present a decentralised online decision-making strategy for multi-agents carrying out a cooperative mission. Our solution provides the capability for agents to dynamically choose their best targets and arrive at their target locations simultaneously at pre-specified angles. Additionally, the agents are able to cope with any obstacles encountered without compromising the mission goals. The algorithm combines game-theoretic regret minimisation with current best-practice solutions to satisfy complex mission requirements. It is decentralised and readily scalable to a large number of agents for wide area operations. Simulation results show it can be applied to teams of agents in challenging environments and exhibits fast convergence and adaptability.},

  abstract  = {Fine-tuning pre-trained models is arguably one of the most significant approaches in transfer learning. Recent studies focus on methods whose performance is superior to standard fine-tuning methods, such as Adaptive Filter Fine-tuning and Fine-tuning last-k. The SpotTune model outperforms most common fine-tuning methods due to a novel adaptive fine-tuning approach. Since there is a trade-off between the number of parameters and performance, the SpotTune model is not parameter efficient. In this paper, we propose a shapeshift adapter module that can help reduce training parameters in deep learning models while pre-serving the high-performance merit of SpotTune. The shapeshift adapter yields a flexible structure, which allows us to find a balance between the number of parameters and performance. We integrate our proposed module with the residual blocks in ResNet and conduct several experiments on the SpotTune model. On the Visual Decathlon Challenge, our proposed method gets a score close to SpotTune and it outperforms the SpotTune model over half of the datasets. Particularly, our proposed method notably uses only about 20\% of the parameters that are needed when training using a standard fine-tuning approach.},

There are different approaches to small data analytics, including knowledge-based learning, but most of these approaches need experience to use. In this paper we consider another approach, lattice machine. Lattice machine is a conservative generalisation based learning algorithm. It is a learning paradigm that &quot;learns&quot; by generalising data in a consistent, conservative and parsimonious way. A lattice machine model built from a dataset is a set of hyper tuples that tightly &quot;wraps around&quot; clusters of data, each of which is a conservative generalisation of the underlying cluster. A key feature of lattice machine, indeed any conservative generalisation based learning algorithm, is that it has high precision and low recall, limiting its applications as high recall is needed in some applications such as disease (e.g. covid-19) screening. It is thus necessary to improve lattice machine&#39;s recall whilst retaining his high precision. In this paper, we present a study on how to achieve this for lattice machine.},

The premium rate is calculated as a combination of the experience rate and the manual rate for each business category. The traditional actuarial methods are based on many hypotheses to calculate future actual claims and adjust the rate for each business category. Unfortunately, with such adjustments, the risk level of the insured in the business category will be affected. To accurately estimate the size of actual losses for specific industries, we propose a genetic algorithm applied grouping to determine the premium rate for occupational accidents. The proposed approach has been evaluated using the real-world dataset from the Bureau of Labor Insurance in Taiwan that includes occupational accident insurance data from 2009 to 2015. The results demonstrate that the method is practicable at predicting the applicable premium. The proposed method differs from Taiwan&#39;s prevailing occupational accident premium rate calculation method. Moreover, it is efficient at selecting the best group of the Standard Industrial Classification from the genetic algorithm. Lastly, the accuracy of the estimates of the total claim amounts are analyzed.},

In particular, it is almost impossible for blind people to generate precise figures without the assistance of sighted people. Therefore, we are developing a graphic description language available for the blind. In conventional graphic description languages, it was necessary to accurately specify the coordinates of parameters when drawing elementary shapes. By introducing an object-oriented idea, our language enables users not to specify many coordinates. We have produced an experimental drawing assistant system using our language.

In this paper, an uncertainty-observer-based dynamic sliding mode control scheme is proposed to deal with time-varying formation control problems of second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems. An uncertainty observer is first implemented for each agent to estimate the combination of the agent&#39;s external and internal uncertainties and its time derivative. An observer-based dynamic sliding mode formation control law is developed for a cluster of second-order nonlinear agents to achieve time-varying formation.

  abstract  = {Needless to say, traffic sign recognition (TSR) is important for safety driving. A TSR system can make the driver more aware of the road situation and condition, and thus can reduce traffic accidents. A TSR system contains mainly two parts, one for detection and another for classification. Recently, deep learners such as You Only Look One (YOLO) and Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD) have been proposed for implementing these two parts together. However, since there are many different traffic signs, training a good model is usually time consuming. In this study, we investigate the efficiency/efficacy of two different two-stage approaches for TSR. The first approach is a few-to-many approach, in which YOLO-v3 is used to detect traffic signs based on their shapes and VGG-16 is used to classify the signs into detailed classes. The second one is a many-to-many approach, in which traffic signs are detected and classified by YOLO-v3, and VGG-16 is used to correct signs miss-classified by YOLO-v3. Experiment results show that, the average accuracy of the many-to-many approach is 93.98\% and that of the few-to-many approach is 88.29\% for the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark dataset. Compared with the YOLO-v3 alone approach, the many-to-many approach has a 23.08\% gain but the few-to-many approach has only a 6.2\% gain.},

We use data augmentation, transfer learning and fine-tuning in the training stage. Experimental results show that different networks have different characteristics on the same dataset. Therefore, we propose a multiple deep learner approach to improve the prediction performance via combination of different object detection models. As a result, the proposed approach can find more opacity areas of the lungs where the early symptoms are not evident. While maintaining the prediction accuracy, the proposed method can predict the bounding box size more precisely with a higher confidence score.},

This algorithm uses road video surveillance as the source data and extracts valid images from it to detect vehicle flow. Different from the traditional methods that use vehicle recognition method to detect vehicle flow, algorithm VFDV uses a classification algorithm to detect vehicle flow. Compared with traditional algorithms, our algorithm achieves higher accuracy. In the verification phase, the video taken at the real intersection is used as the data source.

In the process of labeling different types of objects based on spectral information and geometric spatial characteristics, noise interference often exists in continuous multi-band spectral information, which brings great troubles to spectral feature extraction. Besides, far from enough spectral samples will restrict the classification performance of the algorithm to some extent. In order to solve the problem of small amount of original spectral sample data and noisy signal, Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) is used to generate samples similar to the original spectrum, and spectral features are extracted from the samples. In the case of small samples, the original materials are provided for the classification of hyperspectral images and a semi-supervised classification model WGAN-CNN for hyperspectral images based on Wasserstein generation antagonistic network is proposed in this paper. This model combines with CNN classifier and completes the classification of terrain objects according to the label for the synthesized samples. The proposed method is compared with several classical hyperspectral image classification methods in classification accuracy. WGAN-CNN can achieve higher classification accuracy in the case of small sample size, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This paper uses the above databases, takes poetry in Tang and Song Dynasties as the main body, combines the related video of the cultural variety show &quot;Chinese Poetry Conference&quot; and the Chinese textbooks for primary school to establish the system of &quot;Knowledge Graph of Tang and Song Dynasties&quot;, and achieves the integration of video and teaching, characters and works across the media. It provides the comprehensive search function of characters, poems and related videos, the online generation function of knowledge graph, and the display function of the chronology of the top 100 figures divided by the emperors of past dynasties. Users can interact with the knowledge graph by clicking, typing, dragging and so on to complete exploratory visual analysis.},

  abstract  = {Decision-making (DM) contains three main tasks: ranking, classification, and choice, which accompanies with the development of human being. Ranking and classification are two fundamental DM tasks that have been well studied in fields of information systems, computer sciences, and business analytics. Decision systems are the typical field for this branch. Another branch is choice that has been formally studied in economics. This paper reconciles the substances of decision systems and economics. As a result, a new field, behavioral decision making (BDM), is put forward and outstanding. We review noteworthy transitions from neoclassical economics to behavioral economics in a historical perspective. We examine the principles of economic and psychology into decision systems researches. Behavioral and experimental economics advocate bounded rationality and fairness, which challenge absolute rationality and self-interest assumed by neoclassical economics. BDM could be the best direction of bridging neoclassical sides and behavioral sides, which bring new insights into the communities of information management and systems. A full picture of transitions from people to systems (machines) is exhibited after incorporating behavioral and psychological principles.},

  abstract  = {Chemical compound toxicity prediction is a challenge learning problem that the number of active chemicals obtained for toxicity assays are far smaller than the inactive chemicals, i.e. imbalanced data. Neural Networks learned from these tasks with imbalanced data tend to misclassify the minority samples into majority samples. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method that combine multi-task deep neural networks learning with over-sampling method to handle imbalanced data and lack of training data problems of toxicity prediction. Over-sampling is a kind of re-sampling method that tackle the class imbalance problem by replicating the minority class samples. For each toxicity prediction task, we apply over-sampling method on training set to generate synthetic samples of the minority class to balance the training data. Then, we train the multi-task deep neural network on the tasks with balanced training set. Multi-task learning can share common information among tasks and the balanced data set have larger number of training data that benefit the multi-task deep neural networks learning.Experiment results on tox21 toxicity prediction data set shows that our method significantly relieve imbalanced data problem of multi-task deep neural networks learning and outperforms multi-task deep neural network method that without over-sampling and many other computational approaches like support vector machine and random forests.},
