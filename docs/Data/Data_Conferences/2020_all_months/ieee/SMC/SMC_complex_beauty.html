  abstract  = {Access to data at large scales expedites the progress of research in medical fields. Nevertheless, accessibility to patients&#39; data faces significant challenges on regulatory, organizational and technical levels. In light of this, we present a novel approach based on the crowdsourcing paradigm to solve this data scarcity problem. Utilizing the infrastructure that blockchain provides, our decentralized platform enables researchers to solicit contributions to their well-defined research study from a large crowd of volunteers. Furthermore, to overcome the challenge of breach of privacy and mutual trust, we employed the cryptographic primitive of Zero-knowledge Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK). This not only allows participants to make contributions without exposing their privacy-sensitive health data, but also provides a means for a distributed network of users to verify the validity of the contributions in an efficient manner. Finally, since without an incentive mechanism in place, the crowdsourcing platform would be rendered ineffective, we incorporated smart contracts to ensure a fair reciprocal exchange of data for reward between patients and researchers.},

  abstract  = {The fruit fly (Drosophila Melanogaster) is well-studied; the organism has served scientists for decades in all manner of biological research - most notably, perhaps, in genetics. However, much of the neuronal &quot;middleware&quot; of the fruit fly is unknown: for instance, how its neural architecture gives rise to functionalities such as odor categorization. Moreover, there is potential for the fruit fly neural network (FFNN) architecture in modelling Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - the former having been &quot;crafted&quot; over time by generations of evolutionary adaptation. In this work we hope to gain some insight with regards to both problem domains: firstly, with regards to understanding the &quot;middleware&quot; of the fruit fly neural network; secondly, with regards to constructing FFNN-derived ANNs. In particular, we recognize that there is a new opportunity to explore these problem domains in light of recent work on the EM (Electron Microscopy) &quot;hemibrain&quot; - the most comprehensive (to date) EM-derived digital reconstruction of the fruit fly brain, comprising 25,000 neurons (with labels for all neurons and synapses) [1]. Using the hemibrain, we look to the fruit fly olfactory system for the purposes of both exploring its neural architecture and creating an odor classifier. Our FFNN-derived ANN is - at present - fully-connected and uses the 800 most prevalent neurons in the fruit fly olfactory circuit (Antenna Lobe, Mushroom Body Calyx, and Lateral Horn [2]); it also has weight values assigned based on the number of synapses between neurons (an assumption made by the hemibrain authors [1]). Our initial dataset for odor classification includes 33 samples; each with 16 input components (individual resistance values from an array of 16 metal oxide sensors) and 4 output classes (air, ethanol, acetone, or mixed). We augment the dataset to size 33,033 with input noise based on a Gaussian normal distribution. Our current prototype yields greater-than-random test accuracy (37.5\%) with 100 epochs of training.},

This proposed model has fast recognition speed and high accuracy, which allows the Unmanned Aerial System to inspect quickly; decreasing both time and cost and increasing safety. To achieve this the Real-Time Powerline Detection System leverages the capability of the YOLACT algorithm, a recently proposed real-time instance segmentation model that achieves 29.8 minimum average precision on the MSCOCO Dataset at 33.5 fps. The results using this approach is promising and perform much better when compared to the Mask R-CNN algorithm.

This demonstrates that failures caused by the interaction of the product and its environment do not only affect its quality but also - in the worst case - can lead to human injuries or even death. Even though there are already several methods for failure analysis in the product development process, e.g., FMEA, FTA, Ishikawa, none of them sufficiently consider the interaction between the product and its environment. It is, therefore, necessary to develop a new methodology that can systematically identify potential failures resulting from these interactions. As support for the methodology, it is also important to develop an enhanced system model relying on the fundamental principles of Systems Engineering.This paper introduces a new methodology for a model-based failure analysis that examines the interaction between a technical product and its environment and identifies its potential failures during the use-phase. The methodology is evaluated using a case study from the electric industry (linear induction motor).},

This paper proposes a dynamic reconfiguration method that aims to improve the SoS agility from the perspectives of responding quickly to failures and recovering some amount of the SoS capability. This paper employs approximate dynamic programming method to compute the dynamic reconfiguration decisions that allow failed or degraded systems to be removed and the function-capability allocation to be changed quickly. A naval warfare SoS example takes a preliminary step towards demonstrating the effectiveness of the dynamic reconfiguration method, along with flexible architecture, in achieving the SoS agility in terms of responsiveness and resilience.},

Thus far, ADS users are expected to contribute to the automated process when requested by the system, during critical situations, and to ensure adequate system performance. Using a driving simulator experiment, this study developed a human-machine interface (HMI) in which the drivers can share decisions and control with the ADS to avoid slow traffic on highways. Following within-subjects design, the participants encountered four ADS designs in a randomized order: 1) the driver may regain the vehicle control and avoid the slow traffic manually without ADS support (no sharing); 2) an ADS requests the driver to resume the vehicle control and avoid the slow traffic manually (sharing decisions); 3) an ADS avoids the slow traffic autonomously if the driver approves it (sharing decision and control); and 4) an ADS avoids the slow traffic autonomously without driver&#39;s approval. Results indicated that the drivers preferred the first and second ADS designs more than the third and fourth ADS designs. However, significantly better system usability, drivers&#39; engagement, and driving performance have been achieved by the third ADS design compared to other ADS designs. These results have implications for the safe implementation of partial and conditional driving automation systems.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel cooperative control algorithm for vehicle-manipulators (VMs) with a human operator. VMs usually operate in unstructured environments, which means that a full automation of the overall system, combing a vehicle and a robotic manipulator is currently very challenging. Therefore, human operator controlled VMs are state-of-the-art. With current developments in autonomous driving, the automation of the vehicle platform is within reach. A cooperative shared control between the autonomous platform and the human controlled manipulator can happen through the coupling motion between the vehicle platform and the manipulator. An autonomous vehicle platform can furthermore be used to support the human operator with the control of the manipulator. However, the future trajectory of the manipulator intended by the human operator is in general not known to the autonomous vehicle. The main question is thus how the autonomous vehicle should act in order to support the human controlled manipulator in following its unknown trajectory. To solve this problem, we propose an approach that characterizes the cooperation and the unknown errors with an algebraic equation. The novel approach is compared to cooperative control methods with known errors of the manipulator, based on the theory of differential games. The benefits of the proposed method are that no sensors for the environment perception and for the state measurements of the manipulator are necessary, which are demonstrated in simulations.},

Underwater vehicles such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles are widely used for underwater maintenance and inspection. In general, ROV operators need sophisticated skills as they have to control the position and orientation of an ROV using only limited information. To improve the path tracking performance of an ROV and support its operators, we propose applying HSC by incorporating haptic feedback in a control device. We conducted a pilot experiment in a water tank using an ROV. Subjects were instructed to operate the ROV from a start line to a goal line along a desired path while watching the video image sent from the ROV camera. They were also instructed to answer questions about the colors of objects on the desired path while controlling the ROV. The results suggested that the HSC decreased their mental workload, and increased their subjective feelings of concentration on the monitor and maneuverability of the ROV while no significant difference was found in the control performance.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a methodology for the systematic synthesis of haptic shared control (HSC) of a car. This HSC design is based on a two-part architecture. The first part is a trajectory generator that provides a reference trajectory to the second part, which is a static output feedback. In this paper, the haptic shared control is used as an lane keeping assist system (LKA); hence, the reference trajectory is chosen to fulfill this function. The main contribution of this article is related to the combination of the H 2 /H ∞ feedback synthesis. This, involves an H 2 criterion quantifying the sharing level and quality as an objective function, and H 2 /H ∞ constraints for lane-keeping performance, driver comfort and robustness. The control design relies on a driver cybernetic model, which decreases conflicts between the assistance and the driver. A systematic method to tune criterion and constraints is described, enabling the attainment of desired lane-following and shared-control performance. The proposed methodology facilitates the design of lateral assistance, ensuring stability and guaranteed performance regardless of the prescribed level of sharing between the actions of the driver and the automaton. The shared control between human driver and automation for the lane keeping task over the Satory test track with the sharing level adaptation is then shown for the validation of the proposed architecture. This work introduces perspectives on smooth transitioning between manual and autonomous driving modes.},

  abstract  = {The mutual understanding between driver and vehicle is critically important to the design of intelligent vehicles and customized interaction interface. In this study, a deep learning-based joint driver behavior reasoning system toward multi-scale and multi-tasks behavior recognition is proposed. Specifically, a multi-scale driver behavior recognition system is designed to recognize both the driver&#39;s physical and mental states based on a deep encoder-decoder framework. The system jointly recognizes three driver behaviors, namely, mirror-checking, lane change intention, and emotions based on the shared encoder network. The encoder network is designed based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), and several decoders for different driver states estimation are proposed with fully connected (FC), and long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural networks (RNN), respectively. The proposed framework can be used as a solution to exploit the relationship between different driver states for intelligent vehicles towards an efficient driver-side understanding. The testing results on the Brain4Car dataset show accurate performance and outperform existing methods on driver postures, intention, and emotion recognition.},

In this study, a deep time-series learning-enabled driver steering intention prediction system is developed based on the Electromyography (EMG) signal processing. Specifically, the connection between the upper limb EMG signals from different muscles and the steering torque is established using a deep bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). The deep time-series model is trained to predict the future steering torque with historical EMG signals, and the prediction horizon is selected as 200 ms in this study. Moreover, three different steering postures with different hand positions on the steering wheel are studied. A joint BiLSTM network with shared temporal pattern extraction layers is developed to investigate the impact of the hand positions on the steering intention prediction. It is found that based on the joint BiLSTM network, the most accurate steering intention can be achieved with both hands on 3-clock positions. The experiments are conducted on a driving simulator environment with 21 participants. The proposed system can be used for precise driver steering intention prediction system towards a better mutual-understanding module on the intelligent and automated driving vehicles.},

Rather than using a reference path to guide the driver, the proposed framework constrains the vehicle&#39;s status to guarantee the safety without scarifying the driver&#39;s freedom. The constrained Delaunay triangle method is introduced to identify the vehicle&#39;s position constraints and the constraints of obstacle avoidance, vehicle stability and physical limitations are investigated and unified. A nonlinear predictive control problem, which is constructed accounting nonlinear vehicle dynamics and given driver actions, is designed to optimize the steering and braking actions needed to keep the vehicle safe. The automation is supposed to correct the driver&#39;s steering or braking actions to prevent constraint violation and losing the control of vehicle. The simulation results show that the automation can assist the driver to avoid obstacles and guarantee the vehicle&#39;s stability with minimal control intervention.},

Such effects result in sudden variations in foot dynamics and trajectory between accelerator and brake pedals inducing vagueness in smart active control system. This paper is an extension to the intrusive approach where driver&#39;s foot trajectory and shifting between pedals are monitored using XSENS motion capture system. The main objective is to predict the foot patterns associated with acceleration and braking. The experiments were conducted on 10 young subjects on MATHWORKS driver-in-loop (DIL) simulator, interfaced with Unreal Engine 4 studio. A new modified bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) deep neural network based on a rectified linear unit layer was designed, trained, tested and compared with traditional machine learning algorithms on 3D time-series foot orientation data for the sequence-to-sequence classification. The results show that the proposed classifier performs well and successfully recognizes the driver&#39;s foot behaviour with overall accuracy of 99.8\%. Such identified patterns will help in determining the foot posture and the degree of intention in pressing the particular pedal. Moreover, the patterns will be useful for early intervention by smart systems to cope with the longitudinal mistakes made during driving. The limitations of the current work and directions for future work are explored.},

  abstract  = {Driven by the recent technological advancements within the machine learning field, multi-label classification has been introduced as one of the challenging tasks to assign more than one label to each instance in a dataset. Feature selection is one of the predominant feature engineering methodologies which being extensively used as a vital step in predictive model construction to enhance the multi-label classification performance. Many metaheuristic algorithms have been tailored to choose the optimal subset of features in datasets but as a challenging problem, such algorithms suffer from a slow process during fine-tuning. Objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid mechanism by which an obtained feature subset from a Binary Differential Evolution (BDE) algorithm will be further enhanced to minimize the classification error using a local search methodology. Key motivation behind the proposed model is to address the weakness in exploitation of metaheuristic feature selection algorithms with the help of classical feature selection method such as Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) as a local search strategy. The classical feature selection method eliminates more redundant and irrelevant features of obtained subset using the BDE to decrease the classification error. The empirical results obtained on eight various multi-label datasets show that the proposed hybrid approach, which is a fusion of both evolutionary and classical feature selection methods, can minimize the classification error on the obtained feature subset using the BDE.},

However, evaluating such writing compositions or essays in terms of reliability and time is a very challenging process. The need for reliable and rapid scores has elevated the need for a computer system that can answer essay questions that fit precise prompts automatically. NLP and machine learning strategies use Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems to solve the difficulty of scoring writing tasks. In this paper, we suggest an AES approach that involves not only rule-based grammar and consistency tests, but also the semantic similarity of sentences, thus giving priority to question prompts. Similarity vectors are used obtained after applying semantic algorithms and calculated statistical features. Our system uses 22 features with high predicting power, which is less than current systems, while considering every aspect a human grader may focus on.Predicting scores is achieved using the data provided by Kaggle&#39;s ASAP competition using Random Forest. The resulting agreement between the score of the human grader and the prediction of the system is compared with promising results through experimental evaluation.},

Usually, teachers assume some developmental theory and perform paper-and-pencil based tests.

Some recent studies have also shown that the subjective perception of time is an even more relevant measure of customer satisfaction. However, it remains unclear what factors are most significant in affecting a person&#39;s subjective perception of time. This study investigates the relationship between people&#39;s experience with the on-line configuration process and their subjective perceptions of the time involved. Empirical experiments are designed to answer the relevant research questions. The experiment&#39;s results show that two factors, namely the difficulty of the task and the customers&#39; motivation to process information, both significantly affect customers&#39; perceptions of time. We also find that customers&#39; perceptions of time are significantly correlated with their satisfaction with the configured products, and that perceived time is moderately correlated with satisfaction with the configuration process.},

A novel solution was proposed to examine command space layouts that involved unequal-sized workstations. The solution takes advantage of the unique parameter setup of the fitness function and converts an unequalsized facility layout problem into an equal-sized one by introducing the concept of a standard unit workspace. The effectiveness of this solution was investigated in a simulation experiment where the algorithm was used to analyze design options of a hypothetical operations room layout that involved a 9-person team with unequal workspace requirements. Based on 100 simulation runs, 24 unique layout options were identified by the algorithm and their optimality was confirmed by analytical examination.

This paper presents the design and evaluation of a videogame as a tool to elicit different arousal - valence levels, and discrete emotions, for emotion recognition experiments under human-computer interaction scenarios. We performed a statistical analysis through self-assessed emotional responses from a group of 21 participants, using emotional scales and discrete emotions selection to identify the player experience in a 2D platform game. We found that with the structure proposed it is possible to elicit different emotions with the same tool, however, when we evaluated the performance across time, we found that the engagement is lost and the participants reported more answers related to boredom.},

  abstract  = {Studies point out the importance of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in the process of cognitive reappraisal as well as in the functional brain network. In the current study, we investigated how the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the left VLPFC influences the inter-regional nonlinear interdependence of brain dynamics during cognitive reappraisal. The fifteen participants were required to view or reappraise unpleasant and neutral images while their scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Single-pulse TMS was applied over the left VLPFC at 300ms after each image onset. Our results showed that the nonlinear interdependence between central region and other brain regions under reappraisal was significantly larger than those when negative/neutral images were watched only, which was found when the TMS was applied over the left VLPFC. Nevertheless, no such significant difference was found either when TMS applied over the vertex or without TMS intervention. The results of the current study demonstrate that single-pulse TMS intervention over the left VLPFC promote the brain functional connectivity and facilitate the process of emotion regulation.},

In this study, we aim at designing a light-weight Convolutional Neural Network architecture for the under-resourced end-to-end speech recognition task. We present a carefully designed 1-dimensional Convolutional deep neural network architecture that could achieve reasonable accuracy to be cascaded with spoken content retrieval systems. We explored the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks with Connectionist Temporal Classification under resource-constrained conditions. The possibility of having an end-to-end system with the best decoding result keeping the network parameters and computational time minimum is also shown. The paper presents the results on the Amharic syllable-based end-to-end speech recognition system implementing the designed model. The architecture is trained and evaluated on ≈70 hours of Amharic read-speech, audiobooks, and multi-genre radio programs. On the development set, we report a character error rate of 12.60\% and a syllable error rate of 27.28\% without language-models integrated. Likewise, on the test set 18.38\% character error rate and 27.71\% syllable error rate is reached.},

  abstract  = {Distracted driving is one of the most common causes of traffic accidents around the world. Recognizing the driver&#39;s gaze direction during a maneuver could be an essential step for avoiding the matter mentioned above. Thus, we propose a gaze zone classification system that serves as a base of supporting systems for driver&#39;s situation awareness. However, the challenge is to estimate the driver&#39;s gaze inside not ideal scenarios, specifically in this work, scenarios where may occur self-occlusions or non-aligned head and eyes direction of the driver. Firstly, towards solving miss classifications during self-occlusions scenarios, we designed a novel protocol where a 3D full facial geometry reconstruction of the driver from a single 2D image is made using the state-of-the-art method PRNet. To solve the miss classification when the driver&#39;s head and eyes direction are not aligned, eyes and head information are extracted. After this, based on a mix of different data pre-processing and deep learning methods, we achieved a robust classifier in situations where self-occlusions or non-aligned head and eyes direction of the driver occur. Our results from the experiments explicitly measure and show that the proposed method can make an accurate classification for the two before-mentioned problems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model generalizes new drivers while being a portable and extensible system, making it easy-adaptable for various automobiles.},

Traditionally, adaptive control techniques have been used to provide personalization and synchronization with exoskeleton users, but they require predefined dynamics models of the user and exoskeleton. However, these models can be difficult to accurately define due to the complexity of the human-robot interaction. Most recently deep reinforcement learning techniques have shown potential to effectively learn control schemes without the need for system dynamics models. In this paper, we present for the first time an end-to-end model-free deep reinforcement learning method for an exoskeleton that can learn to follow a desired gait pattern, while considering a user&#39;s existing gait pattern and being robust to their perturbations and interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for user personalization of gait training in simulated experiments.},

  abstract  = {This work aims at improving the workers&#39; wellbeing by providing them with skill-based personalized assistance in the context of physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC). Past researches usually assume that each person will respond equally to assistance and therefore do not update their assistance policy online. However, since the focus of our work is on humans in pHRC, intra- and inter-individual variations are to be considered. Thus, we propose a new hybrid approach that combines reinforcement learning and a symbolic approach based on an ontology to guide humans towards skills improvement using solely internal robot data without any additional sensor. The advantage of this combination is to handle constant adaptation of users needs while reducing the learning process. This reduction is insured by the use of a knowledge base to choose the most suitable assistance, as well as a pre-training of the learning algorithm in simulation. In addition, including human feedback in the learning algorithm speeds up learning and ensures that unwanted assistance is not provided to the operator. Finally, since acquiring a skill involves both theory and practice, we offer two types of assistance, textual advice, along with a change of the robot behavior. We have demonstrated through simulations and a real-world experimentation that our approach leads the learner more quickly to the mastery of skills and thus eases the on-the- job training.},

Self-driving scenarios are of particular relevance when discussing the issue of trust due to the high-risk nature of erroneous decisions being made. The present study aims to investigate decision-making and aspects of trust in a realistic driving scenario in which an autonomous agent provides guidance to humans. To this end, a simulated driving environment based on a college campus was developed and presented. An online and an in-person experiment were conducted to examine the impacts of mistakes made by the self-driving AI agent on participants&#39; decisions and trust. During the experiments, participants were asked to complete a series of driving tasks and make a sequence of decisions in a time-limited situation. Behavior analysis indicated a similar relative trend in the decisions across these two experiments. Survey results revealed that a mistake made by the self-driving AI agent at the beginning had a significant impact on participants&#39; trust. In addition, similar overall experience and feelings across the two experimental conditions were reported. The findings in this study add to our understanding of trust in human-robot interaction scenarios and provide valuable insights for future research work in the field of human-robot trust.},

The long-term goal is for children with disabilities to be able to control a robot to manipulate toys in a play environment, and for a helper to demonstrate the desired trajectories as the play tasks change. A relatively inexpensive 3-DOF haptic device made by Novint is used to perform tasks where trajectories of the end-effector are demonstrated and reproduced. Under the condition where the end-effector carries different loads, conventional control systems possess the potential issue that they cannot compensate for the load variation effect. Adaptive tracking control can handle the above issue. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, a set of update laws are derived to give closed-loop stability with proper tracking performance.},

Getting accustomed to the presence of these drones requires seamless integration into our lives and depends a lot on Human-Drone Interaction (HDI). This paper presents a novel approach to develop a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for control of the quadcopters as an assistive device (AD) for those people suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or impaired mobility and have lost the ability to explore the world around them freely. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals of individuals are captured, and actions corresponding to the wearer&#39;s thoughts were classified and used to control a quadcopter. Our main contribution lies in modeling this problem as a Markovian process thus enabling us to maximize the accuracy of data post-classification especially since the data may still contain outliers due to the inability of the user to maintain a constant thought stream, sensor noise, or classification errors. We propose an algorithm that aims at achieving robust control by breaking the problem into sub-parts, which are- classification, outlier removal, maximum likelihood estimation, and autonomy, where each step is optimized individually. We also present a shared control algorithm incorporating visual feedback by three-dimensional reconstruction of the environment to augment user&#39;s decisions with autonomous obstacle avoidance. The entire algorithm of this BCI is built using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Our results suggest that post-processing classified data improves accuracy and system reaction time with minimal detriment to computational efficiency.},

Then, the experiment of measuring muscle fatigue was conducted. As a result, the correlation coefficient between changes in muscle hardness and subjective fatigue highly correlated with five of the seven experimental participants.

  abstract  = {Hand motion tracking plays a vital role in health-care like Physical therapy (PT) rehabilitation that helps the patients restore their physical movement of the hand. These treatments are taken by patients suffering from stroke, accidents, and any other kind of neurological disorder. We have developed a low-cost system to track hand movements and detect the gestures of hand for unsupervised home training. The system integrated a convolutional neural network-based hand motion system and a gesture detection system to serve a training session sequential for hand movement rehabilitation. We combined part of open datasets and our novel dataset(total: 16605, 4 labels) for the final training, six directions, and four gestures were predicted in real-time based on our proposed model. An adaptive GUI application was developed to respond to individual performance patterns. This system can be deployed easily on a laptop/PC with a web camera, which makes it easier and low-costs for a doctor to track the hand movement of the patients and also support to quantify the improvements index after several training sessions. These tracked data can also be stored and sent to the remote clinic center and used for further studies. This kind of system would be beneficial to the patients and the training center intelligently. It could be deployed at home or the clinic with more optimization of functions such as safety measures.},

  abstract  = {Care recipients use a wheelchair or an electric wheelchair because they have difficulty in moving. To support the independent movement of Care recipients indoors, it is necessary that an electric wheelchair performs autonomous movement in narrow spaces and approaches a target whose position frequently changes, such as a chair and observe the physical condition such as the heart function of the care recipients. The purpose of this research is to develop cybernic intelligent mobility system as an autonomous mobile robot wheelchair that has an object recognition function, an autonomous movement function, and a approaching function to correspond the position change of the target object and a vital sensing function to check(detect and manage) the physiological condition of care recipients and to confirm the effectiveness of this mobility system through the basic experiment. The mobility system has a function to find and approach a target such as a desk or chair in a room based on the calculated relative position, even if the initial position of the target is changed. Moreover, a vital sensor was equipped to constantly perform physiological management. To confirm the basic ability of the developed mobility system, we carried out an experiment conducted in a simple living environment assuming a real environment where electric wheelchairs are used. The developed mobility system found the target that was placed in a different position from the initial position in the environmental map. And the mobility system moved autonomously into the area near the target avoiding objects such as walls or furniture. Furthermore, we confirmed basic function to operate the developed mobility system depending on physiological condition. We developed intelligent mobility system that has an object recognition function, an autonomous movement function based on relative position estimation, and a function to find and approach a target. And through the basic experiment, we confirmed the effectiveness of this mobility system.},

  abstract  = {There has been a tremendous increase in the costs of caring for older adults owing to the fact that societies are aging around around the world. This has led to a decrease in the number of caregivers who are able to assist. Investigative studies indicate that older adults require social as well as physical support for their well-being which prompted researchers to use social and cognitive robots and advanced human machine interaction devices. However, most of these studies have shortcomings when it comes to providing means of a natural interaction with the machine. With speech being the most natural way for human communication and the huge developments in the Internet of Things and smart homes, equipping a robotic system with powerful natural speech interaction capabilities to maintain a conversation with an elderly while being linked to other smart home devices shows a promising direction. This paper describes a scalable and expandable system with main goal of designing a natural speech-enabled system for older adults that is capable of linking to multiple active agents with minimal integration efforts. The system makes use of the power of commercially available digital assistant systems, integrated with an intelligent conversational agent, robotics, and smart wearables. The main advantage of the system is that it could provide a portion of the population, namely older adults and the disabled, the flexibility of interacting naturally with powerful social robots in smart home environments, hence providing them with much needed independence.},

Among a variety of crossover operators, there has been a growing interest in multi-parent crossover operators in evolutionary computation. The main motivation of those schemes is establishing comprehensive collective collaboration of more than two chromosomes in the population to generate a new offspring. In this paper, a novel all-parent crossover operator called collective crossover for genetic algorithm is proposed. In this method, all individuals in the current population are involved in recombination part and one offspring is generated. The contribution of each individuals is defined based on its quality in terms of fitness value. The performance of the collective crossover operator is tested on CEC2017 benchmark functions. The results revealed that the proposed crossover operator performs better when compared to well-known two-parent crossover operators including one-point and two-point crossovers. In addition, the differences between collective crossover and the other crossover operators are statistically significant for the most cases.},

For high-dimensional subproblems, more iterations are needed during the optimization process; while for low-dimensional subproblems, fewer iterations will be assigned. The experimental results reveal that the proposed resource allocation scheme is simple but effective, which can enhance the performance of MLSoft in solving large-scale fully-separable problems. In addition, we conduct a group of experiments to evaluate the results if a higher weight is assigned to more recent performance in MLSoft. The results show that introducing weight to the latest reward affects very little on the performance of MLSoft.},

Hence, to predict the existence of cleavage sites in HIV-1 protease, a variety of computational algorithms have been developed by following the homogeneous information in substrate sequences. However, few of them can fully exploit such information, as they are not capable of identifying variable-length coevolutionary patterns. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm with which variable-length coevolutionary patterns can be identified. Based on these patterns, we compose the feature vector for each of substrates and train the SVM classifier to the purpose of predicting HIV1 protease cleavage sites. Experimental results show that the use of variable-length coevolutionary patterns can improve the prediction performance in terms of AUC and PR-AUC analysis.},

However, after decomposing an original image for feature extraction in a fusion process, its most low-frequency sub-bands are redundant, while its vital high-frequency ones are not adequately extracted. Moreover, in context of multi-image fusion, Pseudo-Gibbs effect is very difficult to eliminate. To address the above issues, this study proposes a compressed sensing and porous 9-7 wavelet transform-based image fusion algorithm (CPIF). Its main ideal is two-fold, a) reducing the fusion time in a sparse feature representation space, and b) releasing the storage space especially in multi-type image fusion. Results on medical diagnostic images and multi-images in practical industry applications indicate that a CPIF algorithm is efficient and robust in addressing the task of image fusion when compared with five state-of-the-art wavelet-transform methods.},

To address these problems, we demonstrate a generally applicable Distributed Privacy-Preserving Prediction (DPPP) framework, in which instead of sharing more sensitive data or model parameters, an untrusted aggregator combines only multiple models&#39; predictions under provable privacy guarantee. Our framework integrates two main techniques to guarantee individual privacy. First, we introduce the improved Binomial Mechanism and Discrete Gaussian Mechanism to achieve distributed differential privacy. Second, we utilize homomorphic encryption to ensure that the aggregator learns nothing but the noisy aggregated prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework has comparable performance to the non-private frameworks and delivers better results than the local differentially private framework and standalone framework.},

And the entropy-regularized method is employed to optimize the weight of each term to handle the images with different noise.

In the literature, ORB has been shown to produce significant profits on several stock markets. In this paper, we present novel ORB algorithms based on deep learning which take into account historical trends and price movement during the early market interval. The proposed scheme uses a multi-label classification framework with multi-layer perceptron neural models and convolutional neural network models to predict the most profitable thresholds. To generate ground truth values for evaluation, we compared two labeling methods (one-hot encoding and distributed encoding). In experiments based on an empirical dataset, the proposed strategy earned profits of 8126, annual returns of 14.003\%, and a Sharpe ratio of 1.376. The proposed scheme outperformed the original ORB strategy by nearly 2 times on metrics mentioned above and decreased maximum drawdown by more than 60\%. Experiment results revealed that the uppermost and lowermost classes of thresholds accounted for the majority of the predicted results. In other words, taking a long position at a lower boundary and a short position at a higher boundary increased the likelihood of generating higher profits, while reducing exposure to risk.},

A novel reward function involving Sharpe ratio is also designed to evaluate the performance of the developed systems. Experimental results indicate that the PMS with Sharpe ratio reward function has the outstanding performance, and increase the return 39.0\% and decrease the drawdown of 13.7\% on average than that with reward function of trading return. In addition, the developed PMS_CNN model is more suitable and profitable to construct RL portfolio, but has a 1.98 times more drawdown risk than the PMS_RNN. Overall, the proposed PMS outperforms the benchmark strategies in the measurements of total return and Sharpe ratio. The PMS is profitable and effective with lower investment risk, and the novel reward function by involving Sharpe ratio really enhances the performance, and well support the resource-allocation in the empirical stock trading.},

Hence, how to retrieve the preferred music from a large amount of music data has been an attractive topic for many years. Traditionally, music retrieval contains two main types, namely text-based music retrieval and content-based music retrieval. However, these traditional music retrieval types ignore a human sense: emotion. That is, the preferred music might be different in different emotions. In fact, the emotion is highly related to the environment and it can be represented by brain actions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a creative approach that performs a ubiquitous music search by content comparisons of brains and music. The major intent of this paper is to provide affective music retrieval in different contexts. Without any query, the context-brain triggers the music search and the context-related music will be retrieved by computing brain similarities and music similarities. The proposed approach was materialized and evaluated by a number of volunteers. The evaluation results reveal that, the proposed affective music retrieval can obtain high satisfactions for the invited testing users.},

Most nature language processing studies consider comments as a composition of statistical texts, which distorts its essence in semantic relation and emotional expression from other disciplines&#39; definition. In order to enlarge its denotation and semantics in cross-discipline perspectives, we firstly define online comments as a complex model that could realize feeling communication, express semantic knowledge, prompt social interaction, and fertilize time character. The social-emotional semantic model (SESM) and its complete construction methods are also introduced to extract comment&#39;s social and emotional semantic meaning. Utilizing three user-based and topic-based emotional algorithms, the presented model makes it possible to generate topic-based and learner-based time series. Also, this study evaluates the possibility to visualize SESM on 67084 Chinese MOOC comments and 278 time series. The time-varying phenomenon in double time-series may help teachers determine the reason of the emotion change and then decide to conduct course adjustment or personalized instruction.

Here we have performed our collected dataset and proposes a new solution to recognize CSL, and further insight on preliminary verification on CSL recognition using 2D image.This paper attempts to reduce the adverse impact of dataset itself on the image recognition network using continuously improved technical method. Present study addresses the following:1) Due to the lack of the CSL image dataset, we made a CSL dataset and used it in the following experiments to verify the usability of the dataset. 2) Using a self-made dataset, we combined the method of hand skeletal gesture recognition to reduce the impact of the gesture overlap and improve recognition accuracy. Finally, a network model was trained and tested on self-made dataset which include some overlapping gestures that are difficult to recognize and achieved the accuracy rate of 0.9324. 3) Put forward the idea of continuing the experiment to improve dataset and using fuzzy semantic recognition for trying to solve the time-domain problem of dynamic sign language recognition which needs linguistic studies.},

  abstract  = {Detection of burn marks due to wildfires in inaccessible rain forests is important for various disaster management and ecological studies. Diverse cropping patterns and the fragmented nature of arable landscapes amidst similar looking land patterns often thwart the precise mapping of burn scars. Recent advances in remote-sensing and availability of multimodal data offer a viable time-sensitive solution to classical methods, which often requires human expert intervention. However, computer vision based segmentation methods have not been used, largely due to lack of labelled datasets.In this work we present AmazonNET – a convolutional based network that allows extracting of burn patters from multimodal remote sensing images. The network consists of UNet- a well-known encoder decoder type of architecture with skip connections commonly used in biomedical segmentation. The proposed framework utilises stacked RGB-NIR channels to segment burn scars from the pastures by training on a new weakly labelled noisy dataset from Amazonia.Our model illustrates superior performance by correctly identifying partially labelled burn scars and rejecting incorrectly labelled samples, demonstrating our approach as one of the first to effectively utilise deep learning based segmentation models in multimodal burn scar identification.},

The features are extracted from both spatial and spatiotemporal domains by using a 2D CNN. These features can capture different aspects of video frames for predicting quality scores, and we take these features as inputs of MLP to obtain a few estimated quality scores on different perspectives. Finally, these estimated scores are combined as a final quality score by an SVR model. The proposed method is evaluated on the well-known LIVE Video database with other state-of-the-art and well-performing VQA metrics. And the experimental result demonstrates that our method is competitive with other full-reference and NR VQA metrics.},

  abstract  = {We present a lightweight post-processing method to refine the semantic segmentation results of point cloud sequences. Most existing methods usually segment frame by frame and encounter the inherent ambiguity of the problem: based on a measurement in a single frame, labels are sometimes difficult to predict even for humans. To remedy this problem, we propose to explicitly train a network to refine these results predicted by an existing segmentation method. The network, which we call the P 2 Net, learns the consistency constraints between &quot;coincident&quot; points from consecutive frames after registration. We evaluate the proposed post-processing method both qualitatively and quantitatively on the SemanticKITTI dataset that consists of real outdoor scenes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing the results predicted by two representative networks with and without the refinement by the post-processing network. Specifically, qualitative visualization validates the key idea that labels of the points that are difficult to predict can be corrected with P 2 Net. Quantitatively, overall mIoU is improved from 10.5\% to 11.7\% for PointNet [1] and from 10.8\% to 15.9\% for PointNet++ [2].},

It is in general a challenging problem due to the input scale variations and perspective distortions. Previous methods make efforts to enhance the representation ability by using multi-scale features of the scene pictures. However, most of these methods directly add or fuse the features, in which the influences of different feature sizes are equally considered. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called adaptive context learning network (ACLNet) to incorporate context of features in multiple levels. In this architecture, the original image features are enhanced by a multi-level feature generating module, and then the multi-level features are up-sampled to the same size and re-weighted for fusing. The ACLNet incorporates the context information existed in sub-regions of various scales adaptively, thus it is able to enhance the representative ability of multi-level features. We perform several experiments on public ShanghaiTech (A and B), UCF_CC_50 and NWPU-crowd datasets. Our proposed ACLNet achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with existing methods.},

In the field of image processing, previous methods can be intuitively understood by humans and can be used to evaluate the reliability of predictions. However, they cannot be applied to complex time series prediction because of the difficulty for humans in evaluating the reliability of predictions. Previous methods focused on either uncertainty or explainability; therefore, the evaluation of the methods and predictions depended only on human knowledge. In this paper, we propose a time series prediction method focusing on both uncertainty and explainability. Our method allows the evaluation of predictions from multiple perspectives by using uncertainty and explainability without relying solely on human knowledge. The explanation obtained from the unimodal distribution prediction model is unreliable because the predictive distribution of time series prediction can be an inherently multi-peaked. The unimodal model does not correspond to the actual phenomenon and does not match with human knowledge. Therefore, we solve the time series prediction as a multi-class classification problem. From the verification of the proposed model with real time series, we confirm the effectiveness of the (1) prediction based on the expected value of the class probability distribution, (2) confidence of the prediction, and (3) series importance based on the confidence. Moreover, we show that our model can improve the robustness of the time series prediction and evaluate its reliability.},

  abstract  = {As a natural extension of the traditional graph model, hypergraph has been extensively exploited and applied in many tasks such as image clustering, classification, etc. The performance of these tasks highly depends on building an informative hypergraph to accurately and robustly formulate the underlying data correlation. Existing hypergraph construction methods can only be suitable for simple Gaussian or outlier noise assumptions, which cannot be applied to more complex noise scenario in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose a robust hypergraph learning model by adopting the Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) noise modeling strategy. In particular, our model adopts low-rank representation and sparse representation simultaneously to construct an informative hypergraph. The Correlation among nodes and the weights of edges can be obtained by seeking a low-rank and sparse representation matrix. The so-obtained hypergraph can capture both the global mixture of subspaces structure (by low-rank) and the locally linear structure (by sparse) of the data. Furthermore, an efficient Expectation-Maximization-like optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model. Finally, the superiority of our model is demonstrated by extensive experiments on image clustering.},

In contrast to the conventional Baum Welch algorithm, commonly used for learning HMMs, the proposed algorithm places priors for the learning of the desired parameters; hence, regularizing the estimation process.

  abstract  = {Robots are nowadays increasingly required to deal with (partially) unknown tasks and situations. The robot has, therefore, to adapt its behavior to the specific working conditions. Classical control methods in robotics require manually programming all actions of a robot. While very effective in fixed conditions, such model-based approaches cannot handle variations, demanding tedious tuning of parameters for every new task. Reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of autonomously learning new control policies through trial-and-error. However, RL approaches are prone to learning with high samples, particularly for continuous control problems. In this paper, a learning-based method is presented that leverages simulation data to learn an object manipulation task through RL. The control policy is parameterized by a neural network and learned using modern Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. A dense reward function has been designed for the task to enable efficient learning of an agent. The proposed approach is trained entirely in simulation (exploiting the MuJoCo environment) from scratch without any demonstrations of the task. A grasping task involving a Franka Emika Panda manipulator has been considered as the reference task to be learned. The task requires the robot to reach the part, grasp it, and lift it off the contact surface. The proposed approach has been demonstrated to be generalizable across multiple object geometries and initial robot/parts configurations, having the robot able to learn and re-execute the target task.},

A large number of experiments have shown that different ordering of the phases has varying degrees of influence on the program. Currently, most research focuses on the traditional optimization goals, such as execution speedup and code size optimization. In this paper, we focus on the impact of the phase-ordering on program reliability. We propose a new model with reinforcement learning algorithm A3C for finding the phase order that can improve the reliability of the program. We performed our experiments with LLVM compiler framework, considering 130 LLVM optimization options. The experimental results show that when compared with LLVM standard options and the existing phase-ordering method with genetic algorithm, the phase order found by our model can bring higher reliability gain to the program.},

A portfolio selected by the trend ratio based on simple linear regression is more in accordance with investors&#39; psychology. This paper proposes a new investment strategy with fund allocation to solve a portfolio optimization problem, as fund allocation can make the portfolio more flexible and also can reduce risk effectively. This paper uses the Global-best Guided Quantum-inspired Tabu Search with Quantum-NOT Gate (GNQTS) to find how many funds are allocated to each stock and then uses the trend ratio to evaluate the portfolio. Because overfitting is a common problem in the stock market, this paper uses thirteen types of sliding windows to avoid overfitting. The results show that fund allocation is more flexible than allocating equal funds, thus allowing the proposed method to find a portfolio with a higher return and lower risk.},

Along with detecting the level of mental workload, it has been suggested that being able to automatically detect the type of mental workload (e.g., auditory, visual, motor, cognitive) would also be useful. In this study, we developed a novel experimental protocol in which subjects performed a task involving one of two different types of mental workload (specifically, Auditory and Visual), each under two different levels of task demand (Easy and Difficult). The tasks were designed to be nearly identical in terms of visual and auditory stimuli, and differed only in the type of stimuli the subject was monitoring/attending to. EEG power spectral features were extracted and used to train linear discriminant classifiers. Preliminary results on three subjects suggested that the Auditory and Visual tasks could be distinguished from one another, and individually from a Baseline condition (which also contained nearly identical stimuli that the subject did not need to attend to), with accuracy significantly exceeding chance. This was true when classification was done within a workload level, and when data from the two workload levels was combined. Though further investigation is required, these preliminary results are promising, and suggest the feasibility of a passive BCI for detecting both type and level of mental workload.},

  abstract  = {New research and development efforts are highlighting the ways in which electroencephalogram-based (EEG) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology can be used to improve the quality of life for healthy individuals. One such application incorporates cognitive state monitoring into passive BCI (pBCI) systems. Among the challenges facing this development, a significant barrier to adoption is the time-intensive calibration typically needed to tune the system to account for variations in neural activity patterns. An open research question is understanding the relationship between underlying user state and user performance in real-world situations and environments. However, user states are often derived and defined as a function of observed user performance for a particular analysis. Understanding the relationship between user state and user performance ideally requires the definition of user state be independent of observed user performance. This work represents our initial steps towards this goal by using cross-dataset learning, where we define user state from a dataset recorded in a highly-controlled experiment, building a subject-independent pBCI model to predict user state using deep learning approaches, and applying this pBCI model to analyze user performance in a new, unobserved dataset. We show that user performance varies smoothly across a continuum of pBCI model outputs. Our results highlight a promising approach for dealing with one of the major hurdles in the development of BCI systems for healthy users.},

  abstract  = {There is increasing interest in understanding the cognitive and physiological state of operators in safety critical situations (e.g. pilots), specifically as it relates to task difficulty and mental workload. Herein, we evaluate the potential of electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) for detecting in-flight changes in helicopter pilot workload. Two National Research Council Canada test pilots performed a series of flight maneuvers in an NRC Bell 205 helicopter which involved a target tracking task with three levels of difficulty. Subjective ratings of pilot workload were collected using the Cooper-Harper handling quality ratings scale and pilot control activity was quantified based on cyclic control movements. ECG derived measures of heart rate and heart rate variability, as well as EEG derived measures of power in three frequency bands (theta 4-8Hz; alpha 8-13Hz; beta 13-22Hz), were computed and compared across task difficulty levels. A set of support vector machine (SVM) regressors were trained and tested to differentiate the three difficulty levels from ECG and EEG features. Differences in subjective ratings and control activity metrics confirmed the task difficulty manipulations (pECG = 0.17) performing better than the EEG-based regressor (minimum cross-validation MSE EEG = 0.29). This study provides an initial application demonstration of physiological and cognitive metrics and machine learning approaches for detecting differences in task difficulty during helicopter flight. This is the necessary first step for further development of passive brain computer interfaces for real-time in-flight monitoring of helicopter pilot workload.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying curiosity and therefore being able to identify the curiosity level of a person, would provide useful information for researchers and designers in numerous fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. A first step to uncovering the neural correlates of curiosity is to collect neurophysiological signals during states of curiosity, in order to develop signal processing and machine learning (ML) tools to recognize the curious states from the non-curious ones. Thus, we ran an experiment in which we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the brain activity of participants as they were induced into states of curiosity, using trivia question and answer chains. We used two ML algorithms, i.e. Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) coupled with a Linear Discriminant Algorithm (LDA), as well as a Filter Bank Tangent Space Classifier (FBTSC), to classify the curious EEG signals from the non-curious ones. Global results indicate that both algorithms obtained better performances in the 3-to-5s time windows, suggesting an optimal time window length of 4 seconds (63.09\% classification accuracy for the FBTSC, 60.93\% classification accuracy for the FBCSP+LDA) to go towards curiosity states estimation based on EEG signals.},

It is a fundamental research of information dissemination across social networks. Based on the observation that users prefer to use similar or identical display names in different social network, some researchers utilized the similarity between display names to build models. However, due to Chinese social network setting and pronunciation and font characteristics of Chinese display names, these methods do not perform well in Chinese social network datasets. To address this problem, we analyze the display name pairs of Chinese anchor users which are obtained by a crawler build in this paper. Then we define 4 special features to extract the pronunciation and font similarities. Finally, we use Gradient Boosting to establish the identification model. The experiments based on the ground-truth datasets we obtained show that these features can improve the performance of display name-based anchor user identification between Chinese social networks.},

In this pilot study we introduce the prerequisites and conditions that facilitate a novel closed-loop, adaptive neurostimulation system to alleviate vigilance decrements during prolonged time-on-task efforts. Here, we investigate the use of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with preset stimulation parameters - intensity (I), duration (t), and, probe location to augment the operators&#39; vigilance state during an under-arousing task. To this end, we employ an app-based psychomotor-vigilance test (PVT), where performance metrics are analyzed along with physiological and cognitive bio-markers to explore opportunities toward a predictive framework. Initial observations (N = 19) suggest that - (1) a prolonged version of the PVT (40 min.) can function both as a diagnostic and an inductive mechanism for vigilance loss, (2) tDCS can serve to restore/ improve operator vigilance states relative to baseline performance levels, and (3) short-term heart rate variability (HR/V) features (3 min.) and the fNIRS signal are sensitive to state changes during the PVT, and to the effects of stimulation.},

In structured traffic scenarios, the behaviour and motion of vehicles are heavily dependent on the social interaction constraints, such as road geometry and surrounding vehicles, and the kinematics model constraints, such as continuous heading and maximum acceleration. To take these factors into account, we analyse the particular characteristics of driving vehicles and propose a model that predicts the possible and feasible trajectory for host vehicle in 3 seconds. In this model, the trajectory of host vehicle takes the center-line as reference, imitates the leader vehicle and focuses on the social vehicles through attention concentration mechanism (ACM) with spatial and temporal information encoded in a fusion hidden state. Furthermore, in order to make the trajectory feasible for vehicle dynamics and kinematics, we introduce a prediction diagnosis method to check the continuous heading and maximum acceleration condition, pruning and adjusting the prediction candidates. Experiments on released public datasets show that this framework can well evaluate the traffic interactions and forecast the trajectory more accurately than common networks.},

This is particularly challenging if cooperative tasks, i.e. tasks that require two or more robots to work directly together, are considered. In this paper, we present an easy-to-implement criterion to validate the feasibility, i.e. executability, of solutions to time-extended multi-robot task allocation problems with cross schedule dependencies arising from the consideration of cooperative tasks and precedence constraints. Using the introduced feasibility criterion, we propose a local improvement heuristic based on a neighborhood operator for the problem class under consideration. The initial solution is obtained by a greedy constructive heuristic. Both methods use a generalized cost structure and are therefore able to handle various objective function instances. We evaluate the proposed approach using test scenarios of different problem sizes, all comprising the complexity aspects of the regarded problem. The simulation results illustrate the improvement potential arising from the application of the local improvement heuristic.},

The current localization approaches mostly rely on the intrinsic parameters of camera which are needed to calibrate in advance. But if the calibration is inaccurate, the localization based on the focal length of camera will result in inaccuracy. Moreover, due to the autonomous flight of quadcopter, the pose changes of the quadcopter will lead to the erroneous locating results. In this paper, we propose an accurate ground-based target localization method by means of monocular vision on a quadcopter. Based on the field of view (FOV) angle of camera, we present a localization algorithm requiring no calibration. Meanwhile, we introduce the quadcopter pose superposition strategy and the IMU quaternion denoising method to eliminate the impact of quadcopter pose changes in flight.

  abstract  = {Decision making for autonomous driving is a safety-critical control problem. Prior works of safe reinforcement learning either tackle the problem with reward shaping or with modifying the reinforcement learning exploration process. However, the former cannot guarantee the safety during the learning process, while the latter relies heavily on expertise to design exquisite exploration policy. Currently, only short-term decision makings for low-speed driving were achieved in road scenes with basic geometries. In this paper, we propose a two-stage safe reinforcement learning algorithm to automatically learn a long-term policy for high-speed driving that guarantees safety during the entire training. In the first learning stage, model-free reinforcement learning is followed by a rule-based safeguard module to avoid danger at low speed without expert ne-tuning. In the second learning stage, the rule-based module is replaced with a data-driven counterpart to develop a closed-form analytical safety solution for high-speed driving. Moreover, an adaptive reward function is designed to match the different objectives of the two learning stages for faster convergence to an optimal policy. Experiments are conducted on a racing simulator TORCS which has complex racing tracks (e.g. sharp turns, hills). Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, the results show that our method achieves zero safety violation and quickly converges to a more efficient and stable policy with an average speed of 127 km/h (3.3\% higher than the best result of baselines) and an average swing of 3.96 degrees.},

In this paper, we propose SPriorSeg, a fast and accurate point-level object segmentation for point clouds by integrating the strengths of deep convolutional auto-encoder and region growing algorithm. Semantic segmentation using the light-weighted convolutional auto-encoder generates semantic prior by labeling a spherical projection image of point clouds pixel-by-pixel with classes of road-objects. The region growing algorithm achieves pixel-wise instance segmentation by taking into account semantic prior and geometric features between neighboring pixels. We build a well-balanced, pixel-level labeled dataset for all classes using 3D bounding boxes and point clouds from the KITTI object dataset. The dataset is employed to train our light-weighted neural network for semantic segmentation and demonstrate the performance of both semantic and instance segmentation of SPriorSeg.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we aim to develop a measurement system for evaluating walking ability in daily life. Health promotion is one of the most important tasks to improve quality of life and quality of community for elderly people. Disabilities related to loss of independence in performing activities of daily living can lead to their social isolation and loneliness that can induce immobility and depression, producing the vicious cycle. Various methods have been proposed to measure lower limb joint angles and positions by using wearable systems and motion capture systems. However, such systems are too expensive and big for elderly&#39;s daily self-monitoring. This paper presents a method of lower limb joint angle estimation using a Kinect sensor. The sensor has a built-in processor to detect joint positions. However, inverse kinematics problem is required to be addressed in order to derive the joint angles. We therefore propose a hybrid approach for lower limb joint angle estimation using genetic algorithm and feed forward neural network.},

  abstract  = {Several studies on microsaccades have been performed; however, those studies measured microsaccades under the fixation state. For practical applications, such as cognitive science, psychology, brain science, and user interface, it is ideal to measure microsaccades from the eye-tracking data that includes saccades. In this study, we propose the visual attention level based on the eye-tracking data including microsaccades after saccades. Based on the research on the visual attention level of humans, the microsaccades and pupil diameter were simultaneously measured in three experimental tasks that required different visual attention levels. Through statistical analysis, the results of the experiment indicated that the behaviors of the microsaccades and the pupil were different between the three experimental tasks, and suggested that the visual attention level can be classified by microsaccades after saccades.},

  abstract  = {Multi-modal sensory fusion is believed to obtain higher accuracy in gesture recognition. Its difficulty lies in mining discriminative features and fusing features from different modalities. Surface electromyography(sEMG) and ultrasound signals are typical signal modalities in gesture recognition. It is expected that the fusion of them can take advantage of the complementarity of electrophysiological information and muscle morphology information. This paper proposed two kinds of feature fusion method. The one is concatenating the manual designed sEMG and ultrasound features, and the other is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature exaction and fusion method for sEMG and ultrasound signals. Eight able-bodied subjects were involved to participate in the experiments. In the experiments, four channels of sEMG and A-mode ultrasound signals corresponding to 20 gestures were collected synchronously to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated that the fusion sEMG-ultrasound feature always outperformed the separate sEMG or ultrasound feature regardless of the feature extraction method, and as for fusion sEMG-ultrasound feature, the CNN based method achieve a high accuracy (97.38±1.49\%) in 20 gestures, which surpassed the method of concatenating the manual designed features and applying machine learning algorithm (LDA, KNN, SVM).},

  abstract  = {Catastrophic forgetting is a major problem that affects neural networks during progressive learning. In it, the previously learned representation vanishes as the network learns new information. The extreme learning machine is one of the variants of the neural network. It is used in many domains due to fast training and good generalization ability. However, like other neural networks, it suffers from catastrophic forgetting and negative forward and backward transfer during the progression of neurons in incremental learning. The study hypothesizes that it is due to overlapping in hidden neurons and output weights. The global representation by an activation function further supports this hypothesis. To address this, the study proposes a neuron clustering approach to mitigate it in an adaptive class incremental extreme learning machine. The neuron clustering method activates k nearest neurons during learning and testing. It helps to partition the network to select overlapping subnetwork. Experimental results on four food datasets show that the proposed approach reduces negative forward and backward transfer when neurons are added incrementally during progressive learning.},

It is hypothesized that there is an unknown time delay comprising at least neural conduction time in the process of corticomuscular interaction. In this study, we developed a novel delay estimation method, defined as the rate of voxels change (RVC) for the estimation of time delay in two coupled physiological signals. The RVC is the dynamic variation of the local CMCs observed in different time offsets. Both simulation and physiological data confirm the capability of RVC in estimating cortical-muscular delay. The underlying mechanisms of individual discrepancy of the latency is also investigated via exploring the correlation between delays, brain activity and motor performance. Correlation analyses indicate an intrinsic link between the connectivity strength of the brain network and the length of time delay in cortical-muscular interactions.},

In the associated Android smartphone app, two functions are provided: instant monitoring based on in-home sensor data and fall detection using the three-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation sensor inbuilt into the smartphone. When the sensor data are abnormal, the remote controller is notified immediately. Moreover, the remote controller can view real-time images by using an IP camera to guarantee home safety. As for fall detection, given that falls cause severe injuries in elder people and children, the proposed app can detect a fall event, send a help message, and indicate the user&#39;s location by using the global positioning system and Google Maps API. According to the simulation results obtained in this study, the proposed system exhibited a fall-detection sensitivity of 92.5\% and specificity of 97.6\%, thus proving that the system can be effectively used for home care.},

We utilizes a set of three-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes and Electromyography (EMG) sensing modules to design our proposed wearable devices. Through computer and smartphone, the analysis and real-time assessment of the weight training in barbell free bench press can be performed to avoid injury in weight training and improve the quality of training performance.In this study, 21 subjects are recruited to use our proposed wearable devices for weight training in barbell free bench press. In the training, the subject&#39;s physiological signals and videos are captured, and the subject&#39;s signals are extracted according to the 11 most common kinds of errors marked by the fitness instructor, including 7 posture errors and 4 kinds of muscle force errors. After the extracted signal is normalized, the data is fed for the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) training through the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to classify the weight training errors. The experimental results show that the classification threshold used in the classification has the best classification result when set at 0.5, and the overall average accuracy, accuracy, recall rate, F1 Score, FPR and FNR are 91.84\%, 89.25\%, 88.17\%, 88.18\%, 6.50\% and 11.83\%, respectively. We found that in some categories, because the sensors are not powerful enough to capture the characteristics of the errors, the accuracy is low. While the overall accuracy of the other categories is higher than 85\%.In order to accelerate the training speed of LSTM, we also try to use the common factor extraction analysis to reduce the data of accelerometers and gyroscopes from 24 to 18, 12 and 6 dimensions for training. When the total dimension including EMG is 30 dimensions, there is not much difference in the accuracy when the dimension is reduced to 24 or 18. However when it is reduced to 12 dimensions, the evaluation metrics are reduced to below 70\%, and the False Negative Rate (FNR) has risen sharply to 30.21\%. We therefore choose to reduce the training data from 30 dimensions to 18 dimensions to maintain recognition accuracy and to accelerate LSTM training.To verify the feasibility of our Virtual Fitness-Coach Information System, we have further recruited 5 subjects for user satisfaction survey of the instant voice feedback and our wearable devices. The users show relatively high satisfiaction about our instant feedback system in the following aspects: helpfulness, clearance, reliability, correctness, and performance. The users also feel relatively comfortable for our wearable devices and suggest further simplification of our wearable devices for ease of wearing.},

The neural network has an excellent learning ability, which can easily learn when using days tuning to make prediction results more accurate and yield a slight error.

Second, we introduce a HILL system (by using parallel coordinates) for learning of decision tree classifiers (DTCs). DTCs importantly emphasise the relevance of attributes and enable attribute selection, and therefore are appreciated for their transparency. The proposed system addresses a number of the shortcomings of the many HILL systems and allows for easy exploration of datasets. In particular, we incorporate parallel coordinates effectively in our tool for visualisation of high dimensional datasets. We can not only focus the learning on the accuracy of classifiers, but we can enhance performance in other important factors such as system&#39;s interpretability and the ability to gain insight into datasets. Finally, we show the advantages of our HILL system in the application area of mobile robotics using the case study of image segmentation in robotic soccer.},

We introduce a hierarchical probabilistic network that minimises prediction error at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstraction. While the lowest layer predicts brain activity directly, higher layers abstract away from the data and predict sequences of the hidden states in lower layers. The network captures both expected and actual uncertainty by relating predicted state posteriors. Each layer minimises (expected) surprise either with or without sampling new evidence from the layer below. This structure motivates both active learning and active inference as means to learn representations. Active learning refers to model parameter exploration which allows to learn regularities, especially when they are stable between trials. Active inference refers to hidden state exploration, a process that enables dynamic inference of the current context using the learned generative model. We train the model on EEG data recorded during free reading and evaluate adaptive EEG prediction in the context of Fixation Related Potentials (FRPs).},

Since modern advanced industrial cell usually deals with various tasks that are not fixed via-point trajectories but highly reconfigurable application templates, the industrial robots used in these applications must be capable of adapting and learning new skills on-demand, without programming experts. Therefore, we propose a probabilistic framework that could accommodate various learning abilities trained with different movement-primitive datasets, separately. Thanks to the fusion theory of the Bayesian Committee Machine, this framework could infer new adapting trajectories with weighted contributions of every trained datasets. To verify the feasibility of our proposed imitation learning framework, state-of-the-art movement learning framework Task-parameterized GMM is compared from several crucial aspects, such as generalization capability, accuracy and robustness. Moreover. this framework is further tested on the YUMI collaborative robot with a rivet picking assembly scenario.

  abstract  = {Having highly engaged followers on social media allows us to spread information, seek feedback, and promote a sense of community efficiently. Crafting engaging posts, however, requires careful thoughts, creativity, and communication skills. This research studied tweets and explored the effect of content types on user engagement. More specifically, we compared the number of likes and retweets between text-only and multimedia tweets. We analyzed four Twitter accounts relevant to the City of Edmonton, Canada, and performed negative binomial regressions to model the expected count of likes and retweets based on accounts, content types, and their interaction. The results showed that multimedia content increased engagement in two of the four accounts but did not change engagement significantly in the other two. In other words, multimedia content had a positive or neutral effect on user engagement, depending on accounts. Our analysis also showed the effectiveness of well-written texts in attracting the attention of users. Tweets, by design, are text-oriented, and posting multimedia content may help, but is not a necessary condition to engage with followers effectively on Twitter.},

The proposed solution integrates the domain ontologies associated with BIM and GIS at building and urban level to filter the useful data and use that filtered data to increase the public awareness for better crisis and disaster preparedness by interactive gaming. The proposed proof of concept study presents an IoT-enabled Virtual Reality (VR) environment that relies on the visual data obtained from the BIM and GIS and also sensory inputs accumulated from the building or urban layout. Such visual layouts of buildings and their surrounding areas are presented in a layered format, considering the security and privacy concerns, to identify the safe and dangerous zones on the evacuation route starting from a person&#39;s private residential area, e.g. home, and ends at a crisis gathering point (e.g. Points of Interest, PoI).

  abstract  = {Authentication on smartphones is performed at the initial entry, mostly utilizing knowledge-based authentication methods which are fast and convenient. Device-based authentication does not guarantee that the user will utilize effective authentication credentials as many users choose less robust and easy to remember credentials. To reduce the explicit intervention from users and to increase user adoption, implicit authentication should be present. This approach authenticates users based on temporal access patterns to mobile devices, such as modeling the access behavior to applications. This paper presents an intelligent risk-based authentication method based on temporal access behavior to general applications on mobile devices. The risk score is calculated from the modeled pattern on the mobile device and the approach minimizes the required credentials based on the quality of this pattern. The evaluation of the presented method is achieved on real datasets and the results show the effectiveness of the approach. Importantly, the approach requires only a short period of application usage to build the model in addition to adapting to new app usage. Ultimately, the results show that the approach provides a low false acceptance rate and false rejection rate, which enhances its usability.},

Blind users on the other hand are unable to use these pointing devices, and therefore can only rely on keyboard-based screen reader assistive technology that lets them serially navigate and listen to the page content using keyboard shortcuts. As a consequence, interacting with long web documents with just screen readers, is often an arduous and tedious experience for the blind users.To bridge the usability divide between how sighted and blind users interact with web documents, in this paper, we present iTOC, a browser extension that automatically identifies and extracts TOC hyperlinks from the web documents, and then facilitates on-demand instant screen-reader access to the TOC from anywhere in the website. This way, blind users need not manually search for the desired content by moving the screen-reader focus sequentially all over the webpage; instead they can simply access the TOC from anywhere using iTOC, and then select the desired hyperlink which will automatically move the focus to the corresponding content in the document. A user study with 15 blind participants showed that with iTOC, both the access time and user effort (number of user input actions) were significantly lowered by as much as 42.73\% and 57.9\%, respectively, compared to that with another state-of-the-art solution for improving web usability.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach of human-to-human knowledge transfer using a system based on functional electrical stimulation (FES). Using the proposed approach, hand-arm movements from a human teacher are recognized through an electromyogram signal classification algorithm. Using a master-slave approach, the movement signals are then translated into electrical stimulation signals and transmitted to a human learner using a functional electrical stimulation device. In the experiment conducted, we show how a human expert teaches seven learners a task that consists of associating hand-arm movements with visual stimuli presented to the learners. Furthermore, cognitive engagement was monitored during the learning process using an electroencephalogram (EEG) system. Experimental results show that four out of seven participants were able to learn the task with an accuracy over 80\% and their cognitive engagement correlates to their performance.},

Deep learning is often used to recognize video characteristics but requires a huge amount of computer resources. This makes it difficult to keep track of the activities of multiple people whose circumstances change. On the other hand, many trained models of one person’s motion recognition have been developed and are available. We propose to use the existing technology but to be able to do that we need to identify a single person’s activities within a group context. This is achieved by segmenting the video and cropping the area with a person, identifying the activity using pre-existing trained models. The activity of the group is recognized by a production rule system based on individual activities. To achieve our goal, we introduce the concept of atomic action to describe activities and propose categories of atomic actions. High-level collaborative categories that indicate the status of a group during collaborative meetings are based on the CIAO model. This paper ends with the results of the first experiments we conducted using video recordings of actual students’ work sessions.},

In this study, we used a small sensor device to simultaneously measure the carbon dioxide concentration in a room with multiple people. Furthermore, by comparing the predicted values using existing prediction models with the measured values, we will verify whether the prediction models can be used effectively in this measurement method. The experimental results show that the carbon dioxide generated by human exhalation diffuses regardless of the distance from the devices, the height difference, or the placement of the person. It was shown that the existing model for predicting carbon dioxide concentration was sufficiently useful for rooms with more than a certain number of ventilations, but in rooms with fewer ventilation, there was an error between the measured value and the actual value.},

This unplanned reuse leads to a high amount of historically grown software variants, which contain valuable domain expertise. Therefore, to enable planned reuse of existing control software solutions, an analysis of legacy software, inducing documentation of identified variability, is required. While so-called Software Product Lines enable the documentation of variability, they lack suitable variability visualization tailored to the needs of aPS stakeholders such as application or module developers. To address this gap, this paper introduces a variability visualization concept tailored to the needs of aPS stakeholders with the aim of supporting them in their daily tasks.

The distance from the node to the center of the circle is used instead of the node-link diagram to express the relationship, making the relationship more intuitive. In the center of the circular layout, the radial tree is used to characterize the attribute information of the nodes, which is more layered. Information Eye also introduces a round lens method, similar to the focusing function of human eyes, to realize the context change when the center of the circle is selected or not, and realizes a smooth transition of the information view. It combines multiple interactive technologies to realize the interactive exploration of two types of information. Finally, we apply this technique to movie data to illustrate its usefulness.},

Due to that, in visualizing large-scale datasets, the method suffers from high clutters produced from numerous intersection lines between neigh-boring axes, numbers of researchers have conducted techniques to boost PCPs. For instance, reducing the number of crossing lines by utilizing the re-ordering the neighboring axes in the PCP technique is a useful procedure to reduce the clutter. Motivated by this goal, the acquisition of the optimal coordinate&#39;s order can be classified as a combinatorial optimization problem. However, in high-dimensional datasets, the optimization algorithm may face difficulty to deal with this issue. In this paper, we propose a smart mutation operator to enhance the performance of Genetic Algorithm (GA) in finding the optimal order of PCP based on diminishing the numerous intersection lines. However, any other user-desired metric can be utilized as an objective function. To assess the introduced method, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation and several experiments to find an optimal coordinates&#39; order in PCP to visualize the datasets with various numbers of samples and dimensions. In the experimental results, utilizing the smart mutation represents an improvement in PCP visualization in terms of reducing the intersection lines between the neighboring coordinates compared to the original GA.},

  abstract  = {Verification of dispensed pharmaceutical packages is of paramount importance to prescription dispensing. Due to lack of identification peripherals like bar codes or RFID tags on blister packages, image-based solutions have been utilized. Earlier two-stage solutions require more resources for implementation and training, in addition to more computational time. In contrast, this paper presents an end-to-end trained solution, called Fast Rotated Occluded Rectangular (Fast ROR) pattern recognition architecture, composed of modules of: rotational rectangular detection, affine transformation, and image recognition. In particular, the features used to localize the package and the features used for identification are the same and extracted by a common feature extractor. As a result, the overall architecture is more compact with only one training set needed and more efficient computation time. Comparison experiments have been conducted on the proposed end-to-end FOR and on a representative two-stage HBIN [1] solution: Targeting a pool of 230 types of pharmaceutical packages, 30 paired front and back handheld images for each type were taken and randomly partitioned with 4:1 for training and testing, FOR (vs. HBIN) uses 41.79M (120.32M) network parameters, with a training time of 17 hours (119 hours), and a testing speed of 22.2 fps (10fps). The identification results in terms of F1-score by FOR (vs. HBIN) is 100\% (98.67\%) in familiar environment, whereas 94.30\% (91.27\%) when the identification is conducted in new environment.},

  abstract  = {Future automated vehicles may be equipped with external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) capable of signaling to pedestrians whether or not they can cross the road. There is currently no consensus on the correct colors for eHMIs. Industry and academia have already proposed a variety of eHMI colors, including red and green, as well as colors that are said to be neutral, such as cyan. A confusion that can arise with red and green is whether the color refers to the pedestrian (egocentric perspective) or the automated vehicle (allocentric perspective). We conducted two crowdsourcing experiments (N = 2000 each) with images depicting an automated vehicle equipped with an eHMI in the form of a rectangular display on the front bumper. The eHMI had one out of 729 colors from the RGB spectrum. In Experiment 1, participants rated the intuitiveness of a random subset of 100 of these eHMIs for signaling `please cross the road&#39;, and in Experiment 2 for `please do NOT cross the road&#39;. The results showed that for `please cross&#39;, colors close to pure green were considered the most intuitive. For `please do NOT cross&#39;, colors close to pure red were rated as the most intuitive, but with high standard deviations among participants. In addition, some participants rated green colors as intuitive for `please do NOT cross&#39;. Results were consistent for men and women and for colorblind and non-colorblind persons. It is concluded that eHMIs should be green if the eHMI is intended to signal `please cross&#39;, but green and red should be avoided if the eHMI is intended to signal `please do NOT cross&#39;. Various neutral colors can be used for that purpose, including cyan, yellow, and purple.},

Engagement states can be changed by clutches, but traditional clutches cannot change the direction and provide sufficient backdrivability. On the other hand, direction conversion can be realized by gear box such as bevel gears, but its backdrivability is poor. Thus, we newly develop a prototype transmission system with backdrivablity and responsiveness integrating clutch and direction converter using magnetorheological fluid (MRF). MRF is a functional fluid consisted of magnetic particles and carrier fluids which can change its viscosity rapidly and continuously according to the strength of magnetic field. MRF clutch consists of driving and driven shaft connected by vanes and coils for controlling MRF. MRF direction converter consists of bevel gears, brake, and MRF for reversing the output direction. In addition to traditional functions, such as speed and torque conversion, the proposed power transmission system provides five working modes: forward direction, reverse direction, and three kinds of free, according to states of the MRF clutch, MRF direction converter, and brake. Preliminary experiments revealed that the proposed transmission system could adequately realize implemented functions.},

Most recently, researches have proved that connectivity features were able to characterize different MI tasks. In this study, we investigated the performance of functional connectivity features measured by phase lag index (PLI), weighted phase lag index(wPLI) and phase-locking value(PLV) on MI classification. The widely-used filter-bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) approach was employed here for performance assessment. A linear support vector machine was trained to classify different MI tasks using two publicly-available datasets from BCI Competition III and IV. The classification results showed that connectivity features achieved classification accuracy &gt;85\% in most cases and PLI outperformed all other methods including FBCSP. Our work suggested that functional connectivity features could be utilized as a powerful tool for recognizing different motor intention.},

In this paper, we presented a new classification method based on Stockwell Transform of common spatial pattern and CNN. The proposed framework with two different activation functions (ReLU and ELU) was compared with CSP-SVM and CSP-CNN methods by validation on BCI competition IV dataset I calibration data to assess the performance of the proposed method. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 81.22\% (ReLU) and 81.34\% (ELU), which outperformed the conventional CSP-SVM (76.45\%) and CSP-CNN methods (69.29\%). Further interrogation showed that the higher accuracy was attributed to improved performance in the subjects with lower detection rate by CSP-SVM.

With the further research of deep learning, the task of nuclei segmentation has been automated. However, most existing methods require a great deal of manually marked full masks for training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and can only be done by professional personnel. For the purpose of reducing the cost of labeling, we propose a weakly supervised method using generative adversarial training for segmentation of nucleus. In the case of no boundary, but only the centroid of the nucleus, the proposed method segmented the nucleus region with blurred boundaries. We first use the generative adversarial network(GAN) to generate the likelihood map of the nuclear centroid, then use Guided Backpropagation to visualize the pixels that contributes to the detection of the centroid of each nucleus, and finally obtain the segmentation mask of the nucleus by graph-cut. In addition, for the purpose of training the network better, we performed stain normalization on each pathological image. We have verified the proposed method on a multi-organ nuclei dataset. The final experiment results show that our advanced method achieves better segmentation performance than other weakly supervised methods, and can even reach the level of full supervision.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound elastography is a modality that is uniquely suited to augment conventional B-mode ultrasound for various clinical applications. Motion tracking plays a critically important role during image formation for ultrasound elastography. In this study, the accuracy of four motion tracking methods tailored for acoustic radiation force-based elastography (e.g. acoustic radiation force imaging, shear wave elastography) is compared. In these elastography methods, external mechanical excitation results in small tissue displacements (i.e. 5-10 micrometers). This paper compares four published motion tracking methods: a quadratic sub-sample estimation method, a coupled sub-sample estimation method, a 2-D spline-based estimator, and a 2-D autocorrelation-based motion estimator. Those four methods are evaluated using computer-simulated and tissue-mimicking phantom data. Based on our preliminary data, we find that the autocorrelation-based method is the preferred estimator without considering the lateral displacement. Overall, the spline-based estimator is superior to the other two competitors when both axial and lateral displacements are estimated. Since the spline-based estimation algorithm is considerably time-intensive, the coupled sub-sample estimation method becomes a practical alternative.},

  abstract  = {Electricity theft can be considered as a Nontechnical Loss (NTL) in smart grids, which is very harmful to the power system. Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) is a procedure to detect atypical behaviours in smart grids, which can be achieved via the massive amount of data that is generated by these networks due to using smart meter tools and Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Since the existing methods are not exceptionally robust to detect this type of attack, also considering the strength of the convolutional neural network (CNN), an Ensemble Deep Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN) algorithm for ETD in smart grids has been proposed. As the first layer of the model, a random under bagging technique is applied to deal with the imbalance data, then deep CNNs are utilized on each subset, and finally, a voting system is embedded as the last part. This study has been conducted on a dataset which contains consumption information of more than 42,000 customers over 24 months. Various performance parameters containing AUC, precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy have been reported as the results.},

  abstract  = {In the actual industrial production processes, various faults occur at different frequencies and the resulting fault data may be class imbalanced. This means machine learning-driven fault diagnosis methods have to learn from imbalanced data, and accordingly lead to lower diagnostic accuracy or even directly errors in identifying minority class. To solve this problem, we present a novel Minority-class Sensitive Fault Diagnosis approach (MSFD), which can reduce the imbalance of data and enhance the sensitivity of our diagnostic model to minority-class samples. Specifically, we first design a new generative oversampling method by combining Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the whole dataset and improve the distribution of the minority-class samples. WGAN is adopted to learn the distribution of minority-class samples and generate some minority-class samples as a supplement to the original dataset, while SMOTE is applied to the resulting dataset to further enhance the diversity of synthetic samples for weakening the influence from WGAN’s mode collapse. In addition, a deep forest or multi-Grained Cascade Forest (GcForest) based minority-class aware fault classification model is developed. First, during multi-grained scanning processes, we score the forests and select the corresponding forests with higher scores to generate feature representations for accelerating model convergence. Second, weights are introduced for different forests in cascade levels to further improve the overall performance of our fault diagnostic model. A series of experiments are conducted to testify the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the experimental results show that our approach can synthesize new minority-class samples with higher qualities and improve the diagnosis performance for minority-class samples as well as its overall classification accuracy. Meanwhile, in case of extremely imbalanced datasets, the proposed approach still maintains a relatively high recognition rate for minority-class samples.},

  abstract  = {Satellites are complicated systems, and there are many interconnected devices inside a satellite that needs to be healthy to ensure the proper functionality of a satellite. Uncertainty and mechanical failure in different integral parts of the satellite pose the major threat for the satellite to remain fully functional for its expected life span. One of the most common reasons for satellite failure is the reaction wheel (RW) failure. Satellite RW fault prognosis can be formed as a two-step process. In this paper, we study the first step where a data-driven approach is used for forecasting the RW parameters that can be used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of a reaction wheel onboard satellite. Autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known as the long short-term memory (LSTM) are used for time-series forecasting in this paper. Both models can predict up to a degree of accuracy, even when limited historical data is available. ARIMA works very efficiently as it can capture a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series. Still, when it comes to accuracy, LSTM provides a better regression outcome for our dataset. The results obtained by the models are very optimistic when model parameters are tuned.},

This work is devoted to studying the applicability of various well-known dimensionality reduction techniques in combination with four classification models in diagnosing open circuit faults in smart grids. By providing a comparative study, this work aims at finding the best combination of dimensionality reduction techniques and classification models for diagnosing faults under normal, high signal-to-noise-ratio, low sampling rate, and high fault-resistance conditions.

  abstract  = {This paper is devoted to studying the effect of false data injection attacks on the state estimation of discrete linear time-invariant systems in the presence of unknown disturbance. The proposed scheme firstly decouples the disturbance signal from the estimation error by exploiting the concepts of unknown input observers. Then, the observer gain has been designed based on the Kalman filter algorithm while a saturation term has been assigned to the output error in the update rule of the estimated states. Thanks to the saturation-limit dynamics introduced into the error dynamics of the Kalman filter-based estimation, the proposed method is applicable for the real-time applications. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been validated through a numerical example by taking two different scenarios into considerations. First, the comparative results show the superiority of the proposed scheme in state estimation under the presence of high-frequency measurement noise. Next, further to the high-frequency measurement noise, it is assumed that the sensed measurements are also manipulated by an adversary, leading to outliers in the measurements. As for this scenario, the attained results show how successfully the proposed scheme can mitigate the effect of the outliers in the presence of unknown disturbances.},

The microeconomic theory that is expected to model this market is implemented within the simulation model to predict the strawberry price based on the difference between total supply and total demand. In this study, the observed yield of strawberry for the two main suppliers in California is considered as total supply; and for predicting the demand, different demand functions are presented. To estimate the ABM model parameters, two optimization methods are applied with Python-Netlogo. Finally, the computational results are presented to show the performance of the prediction model with directions for future research for improving the results.},

  abstract  = {The importance of imputation for having highly performing prediction models is highlighted in this work. Three imputation techniques are tested against a non-imputation approach that discards records with any missing values; the complete-case analysis (CCA). The deep learning linear memory vector recurrent neural network-RNN (LIME) imputation model is tested along with two other nondeep learning models such as the linear function and Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). The simple LSTM deep learning (DL) prediction model is deployed to decide the best performing imputation model, the one resulting in the lowest price and yield prediction errors. Five performance evaluation measures are utilized; the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), R 2 correlation measure along with two aggregated measures summarizing these three measures to decide the overall prediction performance; the average aggregated measure (AGM) for each considered step ahead and the average of the AGM across all considered steps ahead (AAGM). Based on AGM, it is found that the LIME imputation model leads to the best prediction performance of the simple LSTM DL model across both applications of 5 weeks ahead strawberry price and yield predictions using weather; W2P and W2Y. Therefore, the LIME imputed file is reused to train two compound DL models, Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory RNN with attention (ATT-ConvLSTM) and ATT-CNN-LSTM along with their Voting Regressor ensemble (VR). The same models are retrained with files preprocessed with the non-imputation approach, CCA. It is found that the overall AAGM of the compound DL and ensemble prediction models across all the 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead price predictions confirm that using LIME highly improves the prediction performance of the ensemble and its compound DL components. The VR ensemble price prediction performance is improved by 72\% and the ATTConvLSTM component is improved by 89\% compared to their performances without imputation; using CCA preprocessed files.},

We explicitly model channels interdependencies within modules and adaptively calibrate the feature response between channels to enhance the representation of the entire network. To enable the network to perform feature recalibration, global information is learned to selectively enhance useful features and suppress few less useful features. We proposed a Siamese Network tracker based on SE-ResNet-50. In the training phase, meta-learning was introduced to solve the problem of lack of training data, so that the model can achieve a better result on an extremely small amount of data. Our method overcame the limitations of Siamese Network through weighted cross-correlation.

If there are only a few training data and annotations, the object detectors easily overfit and fail to generalize. It exposes the practical weakness of the object detectors. On the other hand, human can easily master new reasoning rules with only a few demonstrations using previously learned knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a few-shot object detection via knowledge transfer, which aims to detect objects from a few training examples. Central to our method is prototypical knowledge transfer with an attached meta-learner. The meta-learner takes support set images that include the few examples of the novel categories and base categories, and predicts prototypes that represent each category as a vector. Then, the prototypes reweight each RoI (Region-of-Interest) feature vector from a query image to remodels R-CNN predictor heads. To facilitate the remodeling process, we predict the prototypes under a graph structure, which propagates information of the correlated base categories to the novel categories with explicit guidance of prior knowledge that represents correlations among categories. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {System verification is a critical process in the development of engineered systems. Engineers gain confidence in the correct functionality of the system before it is deployed into operation by executing verification activities. Choosing the right set of verification activities at the right system development stage, that is, designing a verification strategy (VS), is essential to balancing information discovery and verification cost. Only recently, quantitative methods have been proposed to support the design of verification strategies. However, their applicability in real-life scenarios is impractical due to their limited computational efficiency in the high dimensional solution space of the VS selection problem. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to search for a near-optimal VS. Specifically, the VS design problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which a value function is required. Then we combine tree search and a neural network (NN) to design a RL algorithm. In the RL algorithm, the value function is approximated as a NN that is trained in an iterative way. The near-optimal VS can be generated from the trained NN. A case study is presented to show the superiority of the proposed method.},

Among all selected activation functions, sigmoid leads to faster training process and greater approximation capability than others in general tasks. Meanwhile, the statistical analysis demonstrates that the type of activation function does not affect the performance of BLS too much.

  abstract  = {Due to the particularity of SAR image, existing SAR image classification models often lack strong robustness against noise. Moreover, SAR images are naturally prone to speckle noise and sensitive to observed azimuth. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel fusion framework in which the convolutional layer with increased stride is used to replace the max pooling layer. Unlike max pooling layer roughly extracts the maximum pixel value in one region as its main feature, which is easy to introduce noise, convolution operation can update the weights and learn features more rationally by back-propagation. It also can achieve the same purpose of down sampling as pooling layers. In order to make full use of feature maps from different layers, our framework fuses the feature vectors extracted from different layers, which helps improve the performance of our classification model. For the problem of overfitting caused by the small MSTAR dataset of SAR images, we replace fully connected layers with convolution layers to relieve the overfitting of the convolution layers by reducing the number of parameters. In order to improve the robustness against observed azimuth angles of the dataset, we adopt the multi-channel calibration and superposition as model’s input, which can be used in real flight platform. The extensive experiments conducted on the MSTAR dataset have clearly demonstrated that our framework achieves higher classification accuracy, stronger robustness against noise than other existing methods, as well as its excellent classification performance for the targets of the same category and different subcategories, which is more difficult to be classified.},

  abstract  = {One of the toughest challenges in the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is that when the opponents&#39; policies change rapidly, the collaborative agents can&#39;t learn well to respond to the opponents&#39; policies effectively. This may lead to a local optimum w.r.t. the learned policy of the collaborative agents may be only locally optimal to the opponents&#39; current policies. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm termed Friend-or-Foe Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (FD2PG), in which the cooperative agents can be trained more robust and have stronger cooperation ability in continuous action space. These collaborative agents can generalize easily and respond correctly, even if their opponents&#39; policies alter. Inspired by the classic Friend-or-Foe Q-learning algorithm (FFQ), we introduce the idea of minimizing the foes and maximizing the friends into the centralized training distributed execution framework, multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (MADDPG), to enhance collaborative agents&#39; robustness and cooperativity. Besides, we introduce a Minimax Multi-Agent Learning (MMAL) method to explore two special equilibriums (the adversarial equilibrium and the coordination equilibrium), which can guarantee the convergence of FD2PG and improve optimization. Extensive fine-grained experiments, including four representative scenario experiments and two scale-performance correlation experiments, were conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of FD2PG comparing with existing baselines.},

However, the connection information among VMs during the execution of scientific workflows is seldom considered in existing studies. Therefore, this paper intends to build a novel connection-aware model for VM placement in scientific workflows. Different from existing studies, as the connection information of VMs is considered following the topology of workflows, not only the CPU capacity and memory capacity but also the transmission bandwidth among machines should be considered. An energy- aware, traffic-aware, connection-aware ant colony optimization (ETCACO) approach is developed. The proposed ETCACO combines Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with a scheduler, namely greedy placeman. Experiments are performed to compare the proposed model with the traditional approach. It is discovered that by taking the connection information into consideration, the proposed approach can reduce energy consumption by 7\%.},

  abstract  = {In large-scale multi-agent systems, the existence of a large number of agents with different target tasks and connected by complex game relationships causes great difficulty for policy learning. Therefore, simplifying the learning process is an important issue. In multi-agent systems, agents with the same target tasks or attributes often interact more with each other and exhibit behaviors more similar. That means there are stronger collaborations between these agents. Most existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms expect to learn the collaborative strategies of all agents directly in order to maximize the common rewards. This causes the difficulty of policy learning to increase exponentially as the number and types of agents increase. To address this problem, we propose a goal-based hierarchical group communication (GHGC) algorithm. This algorithm divides the agents into different groups, and maintains the group&#39;s cognitive consistency through knowledge sharing. Subsequently, we introduce a group communication and value decomposition method to ensure cooperation between the various groups. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods on the widely adopted StarCraft II benchmarks across different scenarios, and also possesses potential value for large-scale real-world applications.},

Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is a fundamental problem for UAV applications, which means to find a path covering all the targets or regions of interest. Researches on CPP in a single region have been studied for decades, but rare to be devoted to covering multiple scattered regions of multiple UAVs. This paper proposes an attempt to solve this problem in a short time and take the task balance of multiple UAVs into account meanwhile. This work constructs a model for multiple UAVs to cover scattered regions firstly. In view of the high computational complexity of the precise solution, we keep innovating a heuristic measure based on the model to make the solving process feasible. To settle the problem of imbalanced time consumption caused by super regions, we improve the previously built model furthermore. A series of experiments validated that the presented approaches exhibit the effectiveness and balance of time consumption in diverse scenarios.},

This has led to an increase in devices showcasing camera-based eye tracking capabilities. Such devices, however, can be orders of magnitude more expensive than conventional off-the-shelf HMDs. In this study, we explore the use of low-cost sensors embedded directly into the faceplate of the HMD to measure electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. In a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; manner, we rely on the openBCI biosignal amplifier for data acquisition. A 7-channel system was tested on four participants who attended visually to a moving target in their field-of-view that moved every 10 degrees over a circumference. Time series and handcrafted features were extracted from the measured ExG signals and served as input to two different classifiers: support vector machine (SVM) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). A hierarchical classification approach was proposed and found to achieve the best results with the fusion of both features sets, resulting in an average accuracy of 76.51\% with an SVM. The results are encouraging and suggest that accurate, low-cost classification of saccadic eye movements may be possible.},

Advancements in physiological signal monitoring with wearable sensors have made way for real-time mental workload assessment using physiological signals. However, these models have typically been conducted in controlled laboratory settings and rely on a single physiological modality. As a result, such models often experience a drop in performance due to movement artifacts introduced in real-life conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that a multi-modal mental workload model not only improves measurement accuracy, but can also increase robustness against physical activity artifacts. To this end, an experiment was conducted where mental workload and physical activity levels were modulated simultaneously while physiological data was collected from 48 participants using off-the-shelf wearable devices. Results show improved mental workload assessment with multi-modal fusion under varying physical activity conditions.},

We propose a low-cost, 3D-printed armband with fully adjustable electrode placement for the detection of single-finger tapping motions. We trained machine learning classifiers on features extracted from eight-channel sEMG signals to detect movement from nine fingers. We obtained a classification accuracy of 71.5 ± 1.1\% for a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier using features extracted from 500 ms windows of sEMG data. Moreover, a KNN model trained on 200 ms windows from a subset of particularly clean data obtained an accuracy of 93.0 ± 0.5\%. We also introduce a novel haptic feedback mechanism to improve user experience when using the armband, and propose an augmented reality typing interface as a potential application of our armband.},

  abstract  = {As Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) advances, more and more people will have the opportunities to drive vehicles with autonomous capabilities. This rise in number of semi-autonomous vehicles also gives rise to several challenges with regards on how human factors come into play in interacting with the vehicle’s Automated Driving System (ADS). One important interaction of an ADS with Level 3 Conditional Automated Driving capabilities is Request-to-Intervene (RTI), which alerts drivers to takeover the vehicle during an automated driving session, however, the driver is not necessarily ready to receive the authority. To see whether an ADS can detect the readiness of the user for RTI, in this preliminary study we evaluated the mental states of ADS users in naturalistic driving conditions by comparing them with those of drivers and passengers. The mental states were evaluated by measuring their heart rate and by calculating specific features of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), specifically NN50 and pNN50 indices, during driving events (turning, lane changing, and stopping) and no-events. The results showed the NN50 and pNN50 values of manual driving were significantly different from those of ADS driving and passenger, suggesting that ADS driving has a higher level of relaxed state. In addition, events such as lane-changing in the ADS driving did not induce significantly different NN50 and pNN50 from nonevent situation, which may imply the participants did not pay attention to such events.},

Increased functional connectivity between different brain regions were associated with improved gait performance in stroke patients but indicated increased mental workload with no gait changes in SCI patients. Neural efficiency provided cost of maintaining motor performance in all four patients.

  abstract  = {Multiarticulate bionic arms are now capable of mimicking the endogenous movements of the human hand. 3D-printing has reduced the cost of prosthetic hands themselves, but there is currently no low-cost alternative to dexterous electromyographic (EMG) control systems. To address this need, we developed an inexpensive (~$675) and portable EMG control system by integrating low-cost microcontrollers with a six-channel surface EMG (sEMG) acquisition device. Using this low-cost control system, we quantify, in a pilot study, the performance of a common EMG-based control algorithm-the modified Kalman filter (MKF)-when computational resources and electrode count are limited. We also demonstrate the ability to provide proportional and independent control of various six-degree-of-freedom prosthetic hands in real-time using the MKF. We found no significant differences in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the low-cost control system and that of a high-end research-grade system (paired t-tests). We also found no significant difference in the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) of predicted hand movements for the low-cost control system and that of the research-grade system when using only six sEMG electrodes. We then demonstrate that the SNR of the low-cost control system is statistically no worse than 44\% of the SNR of the research-grade system (equivalence tests). Likewise, we demonstrate that RMSEs were typically a few percent better than, and statistically not more than 6\% worse than, RMSEs of a research-grade system. This held true even when controlling up to six degrees of freedom on a prosthetic hand. Despite minimal computational resources and only six sEMG electrodes, the system performs satisfactorily and highlights the practicality and efficiency of the modified Kalman filter for dexterous EMG-based control. Successful deployment of this low-cost control system constitutes an important step towards the commercialization and wide-spread availability of dexterous bionic hands.},

  abstract  = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson&#39;s disease, essential tremor and epilepsy is an established palliative treatment. DBS uses electrical neuromodulation to suppress symptoms. Most current systems provide a continuous pattern of fixed stimulation, with clinical follow-ups to refine settings constrained to normal office hours. An issue with this management strategy is that the impact of stimulation on circadian, i.e. sleep-wake, rhythms is not fully considered; either in the device design or in the clinical follow-up. Since devices can be implanted in brain targets that couple into the reticular activating network, impact on wakefulness and sleep can be significant. This issue will likely grow as new targets are explored, with the potential to create entraining signals that are uncoupled from environmental influences. To address this issue, we have designed a new brain-machine-interface for DBS that combines a slow-adaptive circadian-based stimulation pattern with a fast-acting pathway for responsive stimulation, demonstrated here for seizure management. In preparation for first-in-human research trials to explore the utility of multi-timescale automated adaptive algorithms, design and prototyping was carried out in line with ISO risk management standards, ensuring patient safety. The ultimate aim is to account for chronobiology within the algorithms embedded in brain-machine-interfaces and in neuromodulation technology more broadly.},

Using the guaranteed cost control technique, both robust stability and existence of the cost bound are attained. To avoid high complexity of directly solving the HCMEs, a recursive algorithm based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) is presented. Finally, a practical SIR time-delay model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed strategy.},

This paper examines the reaction of individuals to the virus outbreak-through the analytical lens of specific hashtags on the Instagram platform. The Instagram posts are analyzed in an attempt to surface commonalities in the way that individuals use visual social media when reacting to this crisis. After collecting the data, the posts containing the location data are selected. A portion of these data are chosen randomly and are categorized into five different categories. We perform several manual analyses to get insights into our collected dataset. Afterward, we use the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network for classifying the images associated with the posts, and attention-based LSTM networks for performing the caption classification. This paper discovers a range of emerging norms on social media in global crisis moments. The obtained results indicate that our proposed methodology can be used to automate the sentiment analysis of mass people using Instagram data.},

To tackle these issues, we first highlight the wireless signal model in BLE standard and formulate the transmitted signal, wireless channel model, and the signal received by Linear Antenna Array (LAA). In addition, the paper introduces a novel fusion processing technique to eliminate the destructive impact of the wireless channel on the received signal, which leads to accurate angle detection following precise position estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed fusion processing method is evaluated through an experimental testbed in the presence of noise and Rayleigh fading channel.

It is shown that the redefined Bayesian surprise in linear Gaussian dynamic systems is a function of the Kalman filter parameters and plays a key role in the state-estimation process. The proposed representation of the Kalman filter illustrates that the information from the Bayesian surprise and the innovation process contributes to the estimation of the state vector and its covariance matrix. This unique approach yields a new set of linear estimation algorithms, where filtering is purely performed with respect to the Bayesian surprise. Simulation results confirm that the information in Bayesian surprise can be sufficient to achieve optimal estimation. In addition, an alternative approach is proposed to test filter consistency based on Bayesian surprise.},

One of such human-machine systems is an interactive three-dimensional (3D) virtual environment (VE). In this paper, we proposed proportional likelihood estimation (PLE) as a model of integration for vibrotactile and force cues. Assuming human responses to cues as Gaussian distributions, PLE integrates these cues proportionally according to certain weighted contributions. We conducted an experiment to verify the suitability of PLE. For the experiment, we created a VE in which a human user executed interactively an identification task. The task required the user to identify visually indiscernible defects on a transmission line with a flying drone. The defects were indicated to the user through vibrotactile and/or force cues. These cues were in a co-located or dis-located setting, respectively, on the user&#39;s right hand and/or forearm. The PLE predictions of integrating the vibrotactile and force cues were able to match the empirical observation of these combined cues. PLE also elucidated this cue integration successfully when applying to an existing dataset acquired under a different experimental condition. Further analyses revealed that the cue integration may not be entirely additive. Hence, PLE could shed a light on the cue integration for facilitating user interaction in human-machine systems, like VEs.},

The localization process is two-fold: the initialization phase and subsequent localization phase. If a node receives the information broadcast from three anchor (or beacon) nodes, it will be localized initially and then enter the subsequent phase. Different from the localization methods using EKF with RSSI requiring three anchor nodes or more, the proposed method estimates the position of a localized node whether or not any anchor node is received. The simulation results indicate that the node localization rate of the proposed method outperforms. Also, more anchor nodes received, more accuracy localization results observed.},

  abstract  = {Robots are widely used as unmanned vehicles in smart factories. In order to operate the robot in a known environment, the robot must be able to plan the path. The planned path must enable the robot to reach a destination from the starting point and the robot must avoid all obstacles during movement. This study uses a four-parameter logic curve path planning method that uses a closed formula solution and a curve with minimal design parameters to quickly generate an ideal path. The characteristics of the curve are used to derive the S and half-S curves as the solution path. The shortest path is used as the selection reference target to select parameters B and C for the four-parameter logic curve. For the S path, the best solution is chosen. The half -S curve is limited by the elastic end-point heading angle, which gives a unique set of parameter solutions. The generated path does not allow the robot to completely avoid obstacles so a hierarchical half-S curve path planning mechanism is used. A via point is generated at the collision point using the gradient vector for the edge of the obstacle. The planner continues to perform half-S path planning until the path planning ends.},

  abstract  = {Contracture is assessed by the palpation performed by a physician or physical therapist based on the range of motion and slidability of a joint. However, the diagnosis of contracture depends on the experience and skills of the therapist and is subjective. Quantification could improve the efficiency and accuracy of the diagnosis. Therefore, we aim to quantify contracture palpation using a wearable tactile sensor by focusing on the frictional vibrations that are generated by the disturbance in the slidability during palpation. In a previous study, the pulse density that was measured by detecting a pulse from the sensor output at a threshold exhibited a good relationship with the subjective rating of the frictional vibration. However, as this sensor measures the propagational vibrations of the skin, it is influenced by the characteristics of individual therapist’s fingers. Thus, in this paper, three types of pulse detection threshold setting methods (constant, adjustment with a sine wave, and adjustment with white noise) are proposed. While conducting experiments, the same frictional vibration was applied on several participants by reproducing the frictional vibrations with a vibrator as a tactile display. The results demonstrated that the threshold adjusting method with white noise, which overlapped with the frequency band of the frictional vibrations, significantly reduced the variance in the finger characteristics.},

  abstract  = {Hand gesture recognition with wearables typically focuses on the characteristics of a single point on hand, but ignores the diversity of motion information over hand skeleton. As a result, current methods suffer from two key challenges to manage multiple hand joints: displacement detection and motion representation. This leads us to define a spatio-temporal framework, named STGauntlet, that explicitly characterizes the hand motion context of spatio-temporal relations among multiple joints and detects hand gestures in real-time. The framework introduces the Lie algebra to capture the inherent structural varieties of hand motions with spatio-temporal dependencies among multiple joints. In addition, we developed a hand-worn prototype with multiple motion sensors respectively attached to various joints on hand and collected 7000 samples of seven gestures from nine subjects. Our in-lab study shows that STGauntlet is capable of detecting gesture types together with their 3D tracking trajectory with 97.35\% and 95.17\% accuracies for subject dependent and independent recognition, respectively.},

Myoelectric prostheses are costly, and most commercially available sEMG acquisition systems are not suitable for real-time gesture recognition. In this paper, a method of acquiring sEMG signals using novel low-cost, active, dry-contact, flexible sensors has been proposed. Since the active sEMG sensor was developed to be used along with a bionic arm, the sensor was tested for its ability to acquire sEMG signals that could be used for real-time classification of five selected gestures. In a study of 4 subjects, the average classification accuracy for real-time gesture classification using the active sEMG sensor system was 85\%. The common-mode rejection ratio of the sensor was measured to 59 dB, and thus the sensor&#39;s performance was not substantially limited by its active circuitry. The proposed sensors can be interfaced with a variety of amplifiers to perform fully wearable sEMG acquisition. This satisfies the need for a low-cost sEMG acquisition system for prostheses.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents two Inverse Kinematics (IK) algorithms that are used for digital twin Augmented Reality (AR) applications. The first algorithm is a simple Inverse Kinematics (IK) Unity code that considers up to 9 points on the human body to model the motion. The second algorithm is the BIO IK that can consider up to 38 points. The performance of the algorithms is compared with data obtained by a Motion Capture (MoCap) measurement system. The metric of accuracy was used to quantify the performance evaluation and was modeled as the error of the position of the modeled joints of a human avatar with those measured by the MoCap system. It is observed that the obtained accuracy of the position increases with the number of points that is considered by the IK algorithm. For the purpose of this investigation, a MoCap system based on 13 cameras and 38 markers on the human body was used to measure the location of the joints of a human operator performing specific motions. The motion of lifting was the epicenter of the investigation that causes the larger amount of accidents in typical manufacturing facilities. The application of this research falls within the concepts of Digital Twin (DT) in Industry 4.0 scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Whether for localization, path planning, or scene manipulation, complete and accurate scene reconstruction is an essential component of robotic operation. Due to their low cost and versatility, vision-based scene reconstruction methods have been the subject of research for decades. However, a major disadvantage of vision-based methods is that they require the scene to be populated with distinctive features that can be unambiguously matched across different images. In the absence of these features, such as in planar homogeneously painted surfaces, the scene reconstruction fails. This paper proposes a novel idea, where the user can virtually texturize planar surfaces at run-time to be used for the scene reconstruction. To do so, the corners of planes are tracked across the images and used to warp virtual texture patches to the correct perspective. Two methods are then proposed, one that actively tracks the corners as long as they are in view, and one that requires the camera poses to augment planes once their corners are no longer visible. The conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as it increases the number of points in scene reconstructions. The end result is a denser scene reconstruction where textureless planes, typically not recovered in traditional methods, are reconstructed.},

However, current visual-inertial odometry algorithms still struggle with high computational cost, which severely hinders its application on computational resource limited platforms. In this paper, a novel tightly coupled visual-inertial odometry algorithm that can maximize utilize the information provided by 3D map points and IMU pre-integration to reduce the algorithm&#39;s computational cost is proposed. In the front-end, an accelerated optical flow tracking algorithm using the depth known 3D map points and IMU pre-integration between two consecutive frames is proposed to reduce the tracking time. In the back-end, a joint optimization model based on hybrid residuals is proposed, which consists the geometric, the photometric and the IMU residuals. It&#39;s worth noting that partial feature points with good tracking quality from all the feature points that the algorithm is tracking on are selected to construct photometric residuals. Therefore, those selected feature points can provide double constraints for the motion. The one feature point provide double motion constraints strategy allows our odometry algorithm use fewer feature points under the condition of same number of motion constraints which really reduced the amount of feature points also the computational resource needed by our algorithm to achieve a comparable pose estimation accuracy. Experiment results on public available dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

In this work, we present an EMG based learning framework that can allow for an immersive interaction with Virtual Reality environments. To do that, EMG activations from the muscles of the forearm and the hand were acquired during the execution of object manipulation tasks in a virtual world along with the motion of the object. The virtual world was visualized using an HTC Vive VR headset, while the hand motions were tracked with a dataglove equipped with magnetic motion capture sensors. The object motion decoding was formulated as a regression problem using the Random Forests methodology. The study shows that the object motion can be successfully decoded using the EMG activations, despite the lack of haptic feedback.},

Using this framework, we studied the interaction of different locomotion interfaces with visual information on wayfinding decisions in a virtual environment. We compared decisions made using a dual joystick gamepad with a walking-in-place metaphor. Paths presented on a given trial differed visually in one of the following aspects: (a) slope, (b) friction, (c) texture, and (d) width. In this experiment, choices made with the walking-in-place interface more closely matched visual conditions which would minimize energy expenditure or physical risk in the natural world. We provide some observations that would further validate this approach and improve this method in future implementations. This approach provides a way of both studying factors in perceptual decision making and demonstrates the effect of interface on natural behavior.},

So far, there is a lack of intuitive human-machine interfaces that resolve present incompatibilities between operator orientation, the crane&#39;s joint movements, and the resulting load movement. This results in poor interface quality and thus in unnecessary time losses, errors, and mental stress. To overcome this gap, an intuitive app interface is developed and applied on a loader crane with boom tip control. An evaluation study with 56 test persons in two experience groups is used to assess the interface&#39;s usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Results show that the human-machine interface presented here reduces errors and increases the operator&#39;s satisfaction in both user groups. Furthermore, unexperienced crane operators in particular profit from better load placement accuracy and greater time efficiency. The intuitive app-based human-machine interface can therefore improve remote crane operation significantly.},

Switching back to fully manual controls is uncomfortable once being passive and engaging in non-driving-related activities. A more comfortable way is controlling the car with elemental maneuvers (e.g., &quot;turn left&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;). Whereas touch interaction concepts exist, contactless interaction through voice and mid-air gestures has not yet been explored for maneuver-based car control. In this paper, we, therefore, compare the general eligibility of voice and mid-air gesture with touch interaction as the primary maneuver selection mechanism in a driving simulator study. Our results show high usability for all modalities. Contactless interaction leads to a more positive emotional perception of the interaction, yet mid-air gestures lead to higher task load. Overall, voice and touch control are preferred over mid-air gestures by most users.},

  abstract  = {This paper ponders the effects of introducing an assistive force visual display on a subject&#39;s force perception. Correct and incorrect displays were tested and were found to significantly affect the subject&#39;s force perception as compared to no visual feedback case. The elbow joint was considered for this study and assisted with four wearable artificial muscles called pneumatic gel muscles (PGMs). It was observed that subjects tend to underestimate the assistive force. The introduction of a visual display could significantly reduce this force underestimation. Moreover, the level of force underestimation was higher in case of higher force values. In other words, the higher the actual force provided, the higher the level of force underestimation in all three conditions: correct, incorrect and no visual feedback. It was also observed that the perceived error (perceived force - actual force) was directly in proportion with the visual error (visual force - actual force).},

  abstract  = {Recently, various types of robot partners aiming at social implementation have been developed and researched, but they have not yet been popularized. In the case of communication robots, it has been reported that it is easier and more comfortable for humans to communicate with multiple robots. However, multirobots require large installation space; the role or character of each robot is not clear, and it is difficult for users to design utterance and action contents. Therefore, we propose a new design methodology of the body-sharing multi-robot system and develop a kangaroo-based robot that contains two physically interconnected objects as one of the models of multiple communication robots. Next, we show the evaluation of the proposed robot in terms of impression and discuss the possibility of social implementation of the developed body sharing multirobot system.},

  abstract  = {Latest generations of automobiles are gradually being equipped with technologies that have increasing automation, a trend which had led to increase in the system complexity as well as increased human-automation interactions. Failures in such complex human-automation interactions increasingly occur due to the mismatch between what operators know about the system and what the designers expect operators to know. Causes of road accidents also change due to role shift of drivers from controlling the vehicle to monitoring the in-vehicle controllers. Failures in such complex systems involving human-automation interactions increasingly occur due to the emergent behaviours from the interactions, and are less likely due to reliability of individual components. Traditional safety analysis methods fall short in identifying such emergent failures. This paper focuses on using a systems thinking inspired safety analysis method called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to identify potential failures. The analysis focuses on a SAE Level-4 Vehicle that is in the development phase, and is controlled partially by a safety driver and its built-in Autonomous Driving System (ADS). The analysis yields that while increase in complexity does increase system functionality, it also brings a challenge to evaluate the safety of the system and potentially causes incorrect human-automation interactions, leading to an accident. After the possible inadequate driver-vehicle interactions are identified by STPA, corresponding requirements were then proposed in order to avoid the unsafe behaviour and thus preventing the hazards.},

  abstract  = {In mixed-initiative systems where teams of humans and automated agents collaborate to perform decision-making tasks, determining factors of joint performance include human cognitive workload and the level of trust placed by the operators in the automation. Both workload and trust are dynamic variables that change over time based on current task allocation and on the result of past interactions. In this paper, we propose a methodology leveraging quantitative models of trust and workload to automatically and dynamically suggest efficient task allocations in mixed human-machine systems. Our approach is based on a Markov decision process framework and is presented for concreteness in the context of a human-machine team performing repeated binary decision-making tasks. Simulation results show the emergence of interesting automation behaviors such as seeking trust, attempting to repair trust after an error and adjusting human workload for optimal performance. Overall, the human-aware dynamic task allocation strategy shows the potential of significant team performance improvement compared to a static task distribution, even in the presence of significant errors in the trust and workload models used.},

  abstract  = {When drivers encounter a road narrowing two potential adaptation strategies come into play that may increase safety margins: decreasing speed and increasing neuromuscular stiffness of the arms. These two adaption strategies have so far been studied in isolation. We expect that there is a trade-off between these two strategies, and that risk duration would impact a driver&#39;s selection of the trade-off. Specifically, we hypothesized that for a short risk duration, drivers will favour increased neuromuscular stiffness over speed reduction; and vice versa for longer risk durations. Twenty-six participants drove in a driving simulator and encountered different risk durations; realized by road narrowings (from 3.6 m to 2.2 m) of varying lengths (10 m, 100 m, 250 m, and 500 m). The neuromuscular stiffness was quantified by measuring the grip force exerted by both hands. The results show that all road narrowing conditions successfully induced driver adaptations, as a significant reduction in speed and increase in grip force was observed. However, the tested drivers did not consistently select the hypothesized different trade-offs for increasing duration of road narrowing: a low correlation was found between speed and grip force adaptations. Interestingly, individual trade-off were consistent: the within-subject variability in speed-grip force adaptations was low across the tested risk durations. Future research should further elucidate the underlying motivations for these individual adaptation strategies.},

  abstract  = {The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a reflexive eye movement that is generated in a direction opposite to that of the head movement and is affected by mental workload (MWL). In a previous study, VOR was modulated by providing a mental task when participants gazed at a fixation point and were exposed to unpredictable body motion induced by a motion platform; the modulation was described by changes in the parameter of the VOR computational model. However, further studies are required to determine whether these results are valid when participants actively operate a vehicle in an outdoor environment, such as driving. Therefore, in the present study, an experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of a mental task for car drivers based on a parameter of the VOR model. The MWL during the experimental trials was evaluated via the weighted workload (WWL) score calculated from the NASA-Task Load Index. Specifically, the eye and head movements were measured when participants drove a car in situations with and without a mental task. The experimental results indicated that the self-motion estimation parameter of the model decreased, and the WWL score increased with the addition of a mental task. The results suggest that the influence of MWL on VOR during driving can be described by the self-motion estimation parameter of the model.},

As society moves further into incorporating data rich systems, like the internet of things (IoT), into daily life, it is expected that conversational agents will take on an increasingly important role to help users manage these complex systems. In this, the concept of personality is becoming increasingly important, as we seek for more human-friendly ways to interact with these CAs. In this work a conceptual framework is proposed that considers how existing standard psychological and persona models could be mapped to different kinds of CA functionality outside of strictly dialogue. As CAs become more diverse in their abilities, and more integrated with different kinds of systems, it is important to consider how function can be impacted by the design of agent personality, whether intentionally designed or not. Based on this framework, derived archetype classes of CAs are presented as starting points that can hopefully aid designers, developers, and the curious, into thinking about how to work toward better CA personality development.},

  abstract  = {Effective teams coordinate their actions to achieve shared goals. In Human-Agent teams, the Artificial Intelligent Agents (AIAs) struggle to coordinate effectively due to a lack of understanding of their human teammate&#39;s intent. This places a burden on the human teammate to extensively communicate explicitly what goals they are pursuing and how they are pursuing them. To improve the AIAs ability to coordinate, we have proposed Operationalized Intent as a means to explicitly model how an operator qualitatively desires a task to be performed. In this paper, we report the results of a study to track operator intent through a tactical scenario. The focus of this paper is on the dynamics of intent and it&#39;s cohesiveness across operators. The study employed an immersive, advanced research, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) simulator to study intent in a synthetic task environment. Using operational pilots and sensor operators in realistic scenarios we were able to elicit their intent under naturalistic conditions in the midst of challenging tactical situations to study the real-time dynamics. Analysis indicates that the method models intent which is dynamically responsive to changes in the situation and the data are suitably cohesive across operators to generalize to an operator role. When the intent data is coupled to situated data from the simulator it provides a labeled data source for future AIAs to estimate intent in real-time.},

  abstract  = {Military sign language is an important form of tactical communication, especially in restrict situations where either distance or a requirement for silence precludes oral means. Unfortunately, when soldiers cannot see each other, the communication mode of tactical gestures is no longer effective, which may hinder military operations. Vision-based approaches have been at the forefront in the field of hand gesture recognition. However, there still lacks of specific datasets and models for the task of military sign language recognition. In this paper, we collected a new first-person dataset named MSL, which contains 16 classes of 3, 840 tactical gesture samples on battle scenario with more than 11, 0000 video frames performed by 10 subjects. Moreover, we present a novel deep network, called ST-Xception architecture, in light of the depthwise separable convolutions to recognize such military sign language. By expanding the convolution filters and pooling kernels into 3D, our network can characterize the inherent spatio-temporal relationship of a certain tactical hand gesture. In particular, we further reduce computational cost and relieve overfitting by replacing the fully connected layers with adaptive average pooling. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing models both on our in-house MSL dataset and two other benchmark datasets.},

The results indicated that data fusion automation improved the identification of ships and planes over the native sensor group. However, over time, map clutter continually increased for the group with fusion automation, surpassing the clutter for the native sensor group.

Our research investigates situations where the presenters themselves have doubts about the information they are delivering, and we detect this via advanced affective computing techniques. To this end we examine the physiological foundations for observer recognition of the doubt effect: the subjective belief or disbelief of a presenter in some information he or she is presenting. Firstly, we construct stimulus videos that display presenters delivering information about which we manipulate their degree of doubt. We then show these stimuli to observers, and record four of their physiological signals. We find that a generalised neural network trained with physiological features is more accurate in differentiating the presenters&#39; doubt/manipulated belief when compared with the same observers&#39; own conscious judgments. The affective recognition performance improves when we analyse the physiological signals using multi-task learning techniques to train personalised and group personalised neural networks. The ability to recognise this doubt effect derives from observers&#39; fundamental emotional reactions to the viewed stimuli, reflected in their physiological responses, and learnt by our neural networks. We believe this system using observer physiological signals collected in real life could reveal accurate and hidden audience distrust, which could in turn lead to enhanced truthfulness in future public- presented statements.},

  abstract  = {Handwriting and hand drawings have historically been used as a proxy metric to evaluate psychological and cognitive traits, in addition to fine motor skills. Detecting onset of cognitive diseases early is a very challenging task due to the expertise required to evaluate each individual subject, as well as the time that the process entails. In this work, we evaluated the application of state-of-the-art deep learning and transfer learning models to determine if the author of a copied hand drawing of a template displays signs of cognitive disease. Compared to expert cognitive evaluation, our best performing method yielded a mean accuracy of 67.60\% and area under ROC of 0.595 in determining if an undiagnosed subject displays signs of cognitive disease.

Results also suggest that transfer learning did not perform as well as a purpose-built network architecture trained from scratch.

  abstract  = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been proven competent and reliable to recognize speech musculature movement patterns. In other words, we can understand what a person prepares to say by collecting sEMG signals around the mouth. Therefore, sEMG-based Mime Speech Recognition (MSR) is a potential technique for human-machine interaction within noisy surroundings as well as the application of helping dysarthric patients. In this paper, we introduce multi-layer Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) networks with attention mechanism as a classifier for MSR, and verify it in the data set collected by ourselves. Six-channel sEMG signals are firstly acquired from elaborately selected facial muscles. Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are utilized to extract time-frequency domain feature maps, replacing the handcrafted features in classic methods. The second phase of recognition process lies in the designed classifier. This classification system achieves over 97\% accuracy in the four-class MSR task, significantly surpassing simple CNN and LSTM methods. Such result also indicates that excellent MSR results can be achieved without relying on handcrafted signal features.},

  abstract  = {Person re-identification (Re-ID) with deep neural networks has made tremendous improvements recently. The existing person Re-ID methods can do well in viewpoint, occlusion, resolution, etc. However, they are short of robustness under varying lighting conditions. The variable illumination will result in the inconsistency of color, contrast, and SNR (signal-noise ratio), which will cause lots of difficulties to identify the right person. This paper presents a multi-granularity and multi-semantic Re-ID model combined with image enhancement method to minimize the impact of illumination variations and optimize the feature extraction. The Retinex-based image enhancement method is used to balance the variable illumination and enhance the contour information of images. Furthermore, we add multi-granularity and multi-semantic layers in the network to extract powerful feature representation. The proposed model is evaluated on the Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 datasets. Extensive experiments show that the new deep neural network model can extract more robustness features from the enhanced images, and verify the effectiveness of our method under changing illumination conditions.},

Based on SRGAN, the image&#39;s high frequencies extracted by discrete wavelet transformations (DWT) were then introduced into GAN. Moreover, an additional discriminator for these high frequencies was built. Since the proposed model provides a direct and efficient way to locates and estimates the high frequencies of the reconstruction image, the visual effects of reconstructed the images can be improved with fewer computation costs. Experiments show that HFD-SRGAN has improved the visual effects of SRGAN when using the same generator network as SRGAN.

In particular, we designed a feature mapping module which can be easily embedded into the existing feature extractors, and a grouping loss function is adopted to constrain the feature mapping, allows the learned similar features to be aggregated together and increase generalization.

  abstract  = {Smart Cyber Physical Grids are the new wave of power system technology that integrates networks of sensors with power stations for more efficient power generation and distribution. While utilizing communication networks is accompanied with tremendous advantages, it also increases the vulnerability of power systems to cyber attacks. Many methods for security and attack detection have been proposed in literature; however, most papers do not consider the imbalance of data in real power systems. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method, referred to as Ensemble Stacked AutoEncoder (ESAE), aimed at tackling the problem of data imbalance. This method achieves superior performance on imbalanced data by developing a deep representation learning model to construct new balanced representations. The detection accuracy and model performance is improved by utilizing an ensemble architecture based on Stacked Autoencoders and Random Forest classifiers to detect attacks from the new representations. The proposed method is tested on all degrees of data imbalance using test cases of IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, and 57-bus systems. Comparisons are made to several classifiers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Besides, the design of a zonotopically bounded watermarking signal such that enforces replay attack detectability is also addressed. The proposed detection scheme takes advantage of the observability loss of an a priori known exogenous signal during the replay phase of the attack.

This poses a critical issue in fault detection applications, where not only the training but also the validation datasets are prone to contain mislabeled samples. In this work, we propose a novel two-step framework for robust training with label noise. In the first step, we identify outliers (including the mislabeled samples) based on the update in the hypothesis space. In the second step, we propose different approaches to modifying the training data based on the identified outliers and a data augmentation technique. Contrary to previous approaches, we aim at finding a robust solution that is suitable for real-world applications, such as fault detection, where no clean, &quot;noise-free&quot; validation dataset is available. Under an approximate assumption about the upper limit of the label noise, we significantly improve the generalization ability of the model trained under massive label noise.},

  abstract  = {With the continuous growth of the number of mobile devices connected to the Internet, cellular network infrastructure owners are facing several new challenges. The fifth generation of mobile technology (5G) is planned to enable a fully mobile and connected society and to empower socio-economic transformations. In 5G, different scenarios with high and strict requirements are being deployed. To deal with such heterogeneity, more advanced communication services are required. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) combined with distributed micro data centers (MDCs) can improve the management of the data flows through several 5G base stations. On the one hand, NFV provides high scalability without requiring significant architectural changes; and on the other hand, distributed MDCs decentralize architecture management, bringing the computational capabilities nearer to the base stations, hence reducing transmission delay. Nonetheless, the introduction of MDCs raises new points of failures in the architecture, impacting user experience. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of allocating MDCs to host base station functionalities; similarly, network functions run as virtual machines in the MDC, and their failures cannot be ignored. We consider a real footrace scenario as a case study. As packets are lost due to the high mobility of the runners and spectators we examine this metric. From simulations results, we discover that as the number of MDCs increases, the number of failures increases as well. However, the impact of each failure in terms of lost packets decreases considerably when considering scenarios with more MDCs. For example, by increasing the number of MDCs from one to seven, the failure impact in terms of lost packet drops by around 87.62\%.},

These missing elements are usually a hurdle in utilizing the datasets in prediction or forecasting, making imputation of those missing values imperative. Due to the non-linear dependencies between the current and previous values, imputation remains a challenging task. Conventional methods such as averaging, deletion or filling with the last observed value add bias to the data and are therefore inefficient. Since different time series showcase varying characteristics, figuring out which imputation method works best for the respective time series is essential. In this work, seven different deep learning (DL) imputation methods are examined along with three machine learning (ML) ensembles. To enable a recommendation of the best imputation method for each time series type, the imputation models are tested using the four main types of time series: trend (T), seasonal (S), combined trend and seasonal time series (T&amp;S) and random (R) time series. Results indicate that the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks are, in general, the best for missing values imputation with varying complexity based on the time series type. For example, it is found that the residual GRU is recommended for the trend and seasonal time series while the GRU is recommended for the combined type. Conversely, all tested DL imputation models can be used with the random time series type. In addition, the considered ML ensembles do not perform as high as the DL models with all tested types of times series.},

  abstract  = {Music has always been a popular media because it can relax our pressure of life. However, the music appealing to an individual could shift under his/her different emotions. For example, the preferred music in a sad mode is very possibly different from that in a happy manner. Therefore, effectively representing the human sense hidden in music can link the user emotion to music. To aim at this issue, Music Retrieval Information (MIR) were proposed for recognizing musical emotion. In the past, although some studies have been made on music emotion recognition, their effectiveness is not satisfactory. A potential reason is that the audio features extracted are not robust enough to discriminate the diversity between music and emotion. Hence, in this paper, we propose an effective music recognition method, which fuses Deep Learning (DL) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The major difference between the proposed method and traditional audio-based studies is that the proposed method aggregates the partial recognition results of music to achieve the better recognition precision. The experimental results on a real dataset of CAL500 show that the proposed method performs better than some other audio-based music emotion labeling methods.},

  abstract  = {It is widely known that there is a lot of useful information hidden in big data, and it is prevalent for individuals to mine crucial information for utilization in many real-world applications. To find patterns that can represent the supporting transaction, a recent study was conducted to mine high-utility occupancy patterns whose contribution to the utility of the entire transaction is greater than a certain value. Moreover, in realistic applications, patterns may not exist in transactions but be connected to an existence probability. In this paper, a novel algorithm, called High Utility-Occupancy Pattern Mining in Uncertain databases (UHUOPM), is proposed. The patterns found by this algorithm are called Potential High Utility Occupancy Patterns (PHUOPs). To reduce memory cost and time consumption and to prune the search space in the algorithm as mentioned above, probability-utility-occupancy list (PUO-list) and probability-frequency-utility table (PFU-table) are used. Finally, substantial experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of proposed UHUOPM algorithm on both real-life and synthetic datasets.},

  abstract  = {One of the most important sources of revenue for social media platforms, like, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc., is advertising. An effective social media advertising plan moves people from awareness and interest in desire and action. Despite the potentiality, campaigns and marketing strategies should be improved. One of the challenges is to identify the right target audience at the right time, considering both communities of interests and locations and the development of these conditions along the timeline. This is crucial to create the right communication strategy and the right advertising message. This paper proposes a context-aware ad-targeting methodology using time, locations, and inferring users’ interests by analyzing published content. The method relies on a fuzzy extension of Triadic Formal Concept Analysis for identifying Location-based and Content-based communities of users. Then, a task of community fusion takes place, named Join, for matching a target audience. The matching may be tuned for identifying a wide or narrow community and implementing a fine-grained ad targeting. Experimental results are given.},

HMS is a recent population-based metaheuristic algorithm that has been shown to yield good performance on a variety of optimisation problems. In the first stage, we use HMS to find a high-quality initial colour palette. In the second stage, this palette is refined using k-means to converge towards a local optimum and thus to further improve the quality of the quantised image. We evaluate our algorithm on a set of benchmark images and compare it to several conventional and soft computing-based colour quantisation algorithms to demonstrate excellent image quality, outperforming the other methods.},

There are many difficulties in the detection of surface defects on fabrics, such as substantial differences in length-width ratio, uneven distribution, and few features. However, existing methods have the disadvantages of slow detection speed and high misdetection rate. This present study proposes a method of integrating deformable convolution and pyramid network in Cascade R-CNN (IDPNet) for fabric defect detection. First, image data are labeled according to the type and distribution of defects. Then we design a novel multi-stage object detection architecture named IDPNet to detect defects on the surface of fabrics. In the first stage, Resnet50, in combination with feature pyramid network and deformable convolution is used to improve the detection performance of small defects. Besides, we trained a sequence of detectors with increasing IoUs stage by stage based on Cascade R-CNN in the second stage. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network equip an outstanding performance against other approaches and achieve the accuracy of 91.57\% in fabric defect detection, which proves its utility in practice.},

  abstract  = {Deep reinforcement learning has made significant progress in multi-agent tasks in recent years. However, most previous studies focus on solving full cooperative tasks, which do not perform well in mixed tasks. In mixed tasks, the agent needs to comprehensively consider the information provided by friends and enemies to learn its strategy, and its strategy is sensitive to the received information. There is a great necessity to efficiently learn information representation for mixed tasks. To this end, we present an approach that conducts information representation learning for multiple agents using hierarchical attention mechanism. Our approach adopts the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution. It applies hierarchical attention to centrally computed critics, so critics process the received information more accurately and assist actors to choose better actions. The hierarchical attention critic uses two different attention levels, the agent-level and the group-level, to assign different weights to information of friends and enemies respectively and then summarize them at each time-step. It can achieve more effective and scalable learning in mixed tasks. In addition, our approach uses recurrent neural networks that process sequence input information more efficiently. Experimental results show that our approach is not only applicable to cooperative environments but also better in mixed environments. Especially in the predator-prey task, our approach receives twice as much reward as baselines.},

Behavior tree has drawn a lot of attention to be a practical approach to solving this problem in recent years. However, how to automatically design the logic of swarm behaviors according to the target of a task is the focus of swarm intelligence. Hence, we propose an automatic optimizing framework named Benign which is capable of using gene expression programming (GEP) to optimize the logic of swarm behaviors. In Benign, the basic swarm behaviors and the relationships among those behaviors are mapped to nodes of behavior tree by the method named Matt firstly. With these nodes, we design an artificial behavior tree. After that, the artificial behavior tree is transformed into an expression tree in GEP according to the method named Meet. Finally, GEP is used for optimization to generate the expected logic of swarm behaviors. We conduct simulation experiments to validate the efficiency of Benign. The experimental results show the superiority of Benign. Compared with the logic of the artificial behavior tree before optimization, the conduction of the optimized logic of swarm behaviors increases efficiency by more than 50\%.},

However, reported classification accuracy still low or employed techniques for obtaining brain signals are impractical to use in real environments. In this study, we aim to decode electroencephalography (EEG) signals depending on the provided visual stimulus. Subjects were presented with 72 photographs belonging to 6 different semantic categories. We classified 6 categories and 72 exemplars according to visual stimuli using EEG signals. In order to achieve a high classification accuracy, we proposed an attention driven convolutional neural network and compared our results with conventional methods used for classifying EEG signals. We reported an accuracy of 50.37 ± 6.56\% and 26.75 ± 10.38\% for 6-class and 72-class, respectively. These results statistically outperformed other conventional methods. This was possible because of the application of the attention network using human visual pathways. Our findings showed that EEG signals are possible to differentiate when subjects are presented with visual stimulus of different semantic categories and at an exemplar-level with a high classification accuracy; this demonstrates its viability to be applied it in a real-world BMI.},

Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied to this paradigm. However, due to the small amount of data, the increase in classification performance is limited. To tackle these issues, in this study, we proposed an end-to-end framework using Siamese neural network encoder, which learns the discriminant features by considering the distance between classes. The imagined words (e.g., arriba (up), abajo (down), derecha (right), izquierda (left), adelante (forward), and atrás (backward)) were classified using the raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We obtained a 6-class classification accuracy of 31.40 ± 2.73\% for imagined speech, which significantly outperformed other methods. This was possible because the Siamese neural network, which increases the distance between dissimilar samples while decreasing the distance between similar samples, was used. In this regard, our method can learn discriminant features from a small dataset. The proposed framework would help to increase the classification performance of imagined speech for a small amount of data and implement an intuitive communication system.},

This kind of technology has as potential users people with motor disabilities since it would allow them to interact with their environment without using their peripheral nerves, helping them to regain their lost autonomy. One of the most successful BCI applications is the P300-based Speller. Its operation depends entirely on its capacity to identify and discriminate the presence of the P300 potentials from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. For the system to do this correctly, it is necessary to choose an adequate classifier and train it with a balanced data-set. However, due to the use of an oddball paradigm to elicit the P300 potential, only unbalanced data-sets can be obtained. This paper focuses on the training stage of two classifiers, a deep feedforward network (DFN) and a deep belief network (DBN), to be used in a P300-based BCI. The data-sets obtained from healthy subjects and post-stroke victims were pre-processed and then balanced using a Self-Organizing Maps-based under-sampling approach prior training looking to increase the accuracy of the classifiers. We compared the results with our previous works and observed an increase of 7\% in classification accuracy for the most critical subject. The DFN achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 93.29\% for a post-stroke subject and 93.60\% for a healthy one.},

In addition, we selected the most appropriate electroencephalography channels using a functional connectivity approach for visual motion imagery decoding and proposed a convolutional neural network architecture for classification. As a result, the averaged classification performance of the proposed architecture for 4 classes from 16 channels was 67.50 (±1.52)\% across all subjects. This result is encouraging, and it shows the possibility of developing a BCI-based device control system for practical applications such as neuroprosthesis and a robotic arm.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, deep learning (DL) has contributed significantly to the improvement of motor-imagery brain–machine interfaces (MI-BMIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG). While achieving high classification accuracy, DL models have also grown in size, requiring a vast amount of memory and computational resources. This poses a major challenge to an embedded BMI solution that guarantees user privacy, reduced latency, and low power consumption by processing the data locally. In this paper, we propose EEG-TCNet, a novel temporal convolutional network (TCN) that achieves outstanding accuracy while requiring few trainable parameters. Its low memory footprint and low computational complexity for inference make it suitable for embedded classification on resource-limited devices at the edge. Experimental results on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset show that EEG-TCNet achieves 77.35\% classification accuracy in 4-class MI. By finding the optimal network hyperparameters per subject, we further improve the accuracy to 83.84\%. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of EEG-TCNet on the Mother of All BCI Benchmarks (MOABB), a large scale test benchmark containing 12 different EEG datasets with MI experiments. The results indicate that EEG-TCNet successfully generalizes beyond one single dataset, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SoA) on MOABB by a meta-effect of 0.25.},

  abstract  = {Driven by the global need for decarbonization, low carbon power generators are currently being deployed at a rapid rate. Subsequently, the power grid is posed with high operational risks due to intermittent power generation and uncertain energy demand. Along with demand-side management, energy storage plays a critical role in balancing energy supply with demand. The techno-economic analysis is conducted to compare different technological options to meet an energy problem (e.g., grid support and off-grid energy supply). Several techno-economic analyses have been conducted for low carbon energy technologies; however, different approaches were used and it is difficult to compare the present works of literature. This paper describes the on-going work of IEEE P2814, a current standards project developing recommended practices on techno-economic metrics for hybrid energy and storage systems. This standards project defines techno-economic terminologies used in the development, construction, and operation of renewable energy and electrical energy storage systems. Here, a preliminary techno-economic framework is presented and discussed. Some key aspects that need to be considered in the techno-economic analysis include the timescale of analysis and quantifying carbon emission contribution of the technologies. Future work for the standards project will be described.},

However, contextual differences between missions or products - that is, differences in objectives, destinations, environments, and constraints - mean that design reuse can rarely be a &quot;copy and paste&quot; effort. Some amount of rework can be expected to adapt designs from their native or original missions to new missions of interest. This paper develops a generalized process-driven approach for assessing the required rework effort to adapt a given design for a new mission or system. A more structured approach than what is available in the literature and practice, to date, is presented. The paper also describes how the process may be implemented primarily using SysML within an MBSE environment and thereby leverage the significant benefits of MBSE namely, digitizing and centralizing system information, and facilitating reuse via superior storage and access to information. The resulting process forms part of a larger MBSE Reuse Methodology for supporting system architects in making design reuse decisions.},

At the same time, researchers must have an environment supportive of exploring, experimenting with, and collecting performance data when using potentially heterogenous modeling constructs and algorithms over broad ranges of conditions and assumptions. These requirements jointly imply the need for a MBSE research testbed that enables experimentation with diverse modeling, analysis, simulation, verification, and validation approaches under nominal and off-nominal conditions, collect and analyze data to uncover patterns and trends, reuse models and components as applicable, and serve as a repository for scenarios, models, case studies, and lessons learned.

This paper presents an online algorithm, N-Step Look-Ahead, for solving POMDP models with specific characteristics: flexible state-space, dynamic model parameters (e.g. probability distributions), and real-time constraints (e.g. response needed in fractions of seconds). This algorithm computes the best executable policy by creating a belief-tree starting from the current belief state and employing a look-ahead search over a finite time horizon. To address time-accuracy trade-offs, various heuristics in combination with a distance-based clustering technique is employed to expand and explore only high value belief nodes. To evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm, we compare the online policies computed from N-Step Look-Ahead with offline policies calculated using a customized Q-learning algorithm. We show that the online algorithm can compute optimal policies for beliefs, where belief probabilities are not normally distributed, by looking only a few steps ahead in the belief tree. We discuss computing online policies for normally distributed belief states using our algorithm and explain why they can be different from that obtained from the offline algorithm. Finally, we show how useful heuristics can be developed from Q-learning results to improve the N-Sep Look-Ahead in terms of computation time and accuracy, especially for large POMDP models.},

However, interaction with non-solid materials - such as liquids, sediments and regolith - alongside solids, can greatly extend the versatility of this technology. Rendering rigid objects adequately requires a control loop with high update rates, whereas fluid dynamics equations are computationally expensive. To accommodate this, the fluid dynamics can be simplified - particularly for fluids with high viscosity - resulting in a fast-to-calculate model to enabling haptic rendering of viscous fluids and rigid bodies simultaneously using DLR&#39;s Exodex Adam hand exoskeleton. Viscosity as a proprioceptive cue of fluids can be presented to the human through force feedback at multiple points on the human hand - fingers and palm - letting the user interact with a virtual environment in a more natural way and making the experience more immersive. We carry out two user studies to investigate the human perception abilities of virtual fluids rendered with simplified dynamics, and the discernability of different viscosity in virtual fluids compared real fluids. Results show that virtual media can give the user the perception of interacting with a fluid, even with simplified models, at a high update frequency. Furthermore, the material discernibility corresponds well to actual interaction with real viscous fluids. This shows great promise forward for haptic in-hand interaction in fluid and mixed media environments.},

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one the most capable controllers that can handle multiple optimisation objectives, and accommodate the physical limits of the actuators and vehicle states to ensure safety and the other desired behaviour. As a high-potential solution, learning cost function from human demonstration can be integrated into an MPC. By learning the cost function from human demonstrations, extensive parameters tuning can be avoided, and more importantly, the controllers can be adjusted to provide desired control actions which are more natural to the human. In this study, an innovative Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) algorithm is proposed to learn a suitable cost function for the control task using collected data from human demonstration. The objective is to design a controller that generates motion which matches specific features of human-generated motion. These features include lateral acceleration, lateral velocity and deviation from the center of the lane. From the results, it is observed that the designed controller is capable of learning the desired features of human driving and implementing them while generating the appropriate control actions.},

This paper comprehensively investigates the applicability of the deep transfer learning for the specific task of end to end learning of autonomous navigation. Five state of the art DNNs including ResNet, AlexNet, and Densenet are applied here for extracting features from images taken by the front-facing camera of a mobile robot. Extracted features have different information values as DNNs have different architectures and learning capabilities. These features are then processed by a multilayer fully connected neural network to estimate the robot angular velocity. Obtained results for different DNNs indicate that the transfer learning-based models show a promising performance for accurately estimating the angular velocity purely using visual information. According to obtained results, AlexNet-base model outperforms others in terms of the estimation accuracy and the performance consistency.},

Among them, the palletizing task is still highly dependent on the particular problem to solve, and its optimization needs to be performed basing on the ground condition. In this paper a palletizing task problem performed by a robotic manipulator is studied. More in detail, some objects have to be transported from a pre-determined storage area to a delivery area. In the storage area the objects are stacked one on the other in columns, while in the delivery area the robotic manipulator poses the objects in horizontal levels, one over another. The process is optimized by minimizing the total distance travelled by the robotic manipulator to transport all the objects from the storage area to the delivery area. An Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem is formalized and tested by simulations and experimental results.},

However, reusing components with AI capabilities might introduce new risks as there is currently no framework that guides the selection of necessary information to assess their portability to operate in a system different than the one for which the component was originally purposed. We know from SW-intensive systems that AI algorithms are generally fragile and behave unexpectedly to changes in context and boundary conditions. The question we address in this paper is, what type of information should be captured in the Interface Control Document (ICD) of an AI-enabled system or component to assess its the compatibility with a system for which it was not designed originally. We present ongoing work on establishing an interface description template that captures the main information of an AI-enabled component to facilitate its adequate reuse across different systems and operational contexts. Our work is inspired by Google&#39;s Model Card concept, which was developed with the same goal but focused on the reusability of AI algorithms. We extend that concept to address system-level autonomy capabilities of AI-enabled cyberphysical systems.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring and predicting fishing activity is important for the fishery resource management and the maritime traffic safety. In this paper, we trained deep learning models by grid images from satellite observations to predict areas of fishing activity in next three-day period. The best model predicted the estimated size of fishing areas with more than 70\% coverage for days 1 and 3 after prediction, and areas of congestion with more than 50\% certainty for day 1. In particular, the model using time information performed with higher coverage and certainty. The models might be used not only to predict fishing activities for resource management and navigation safety but also to supplement data in cloudy weather for supporting optical satellite observations.},

A critical factor when designing a nonlinear pose filter is the selection of the error function. Conventional design of nonlinear pose filter design trade-off between fast adaptation and robustness. This paper introduces a new practical approach based on fuzzy rules for on-line continuous tuning of the nonlinear pose filter. Each of input and output membership functions are optimally tuned using graphical search algorithm optimization considering both pose error and its rate of change. The proposed approach is characterized with high adaptation features and strong level of robustness. Therefore, the proposed approach results of robust and fast convergence properties.

These models were the representatives of the possible modal behaviors of the actuator. The state variables were introduced to the Bouc-Wen models, and the hysteresis characteristics were captured in the state space. We also proposed an algorithm to calculate point estimate in the particle filter that utilizes the likelihood evaluation.

  abstract  = {Collaborative tasks require the participation of multiple agents. Each agent in collaboration needs sufficient data to make optimal decisions. However, in general, each agent can only collect and process a limited amount of data due to resource constraints. Peer-to-peer data sharing can enrich local observations, but a particular agent may not have enough resources to adequately store and process data, thus compromising group decision making. Cloud-Edge Computing (CEC) can relieve agents of these limitations by providing them with further storage and computing resources through connected cloud-like infrastructures. However, CEC-based collaborations currently face two key challenges: 1) lack of adaptability to resource restrictions in data sharing; 2) no support of offloading non-trivial tasks with complex data dependencies. This paper proposes an approach to realize adaptive data sharing and support computation offloading. Roughly speaking, the paired parameterized-structure is designed based on data flow analysis and bidirectional transformations to benefit adaptive data synchronization and offloading. And a hybrid offloading mechanism is offered for allocating computations among agents and the cloud, regarding data dependencies and restrictions. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility through a collaborative victim search and rescue case. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

These events, power quality disturbances, cause several losses for both the concessionaire and its consumers, either by damaging appliances or interrupting their operation. Among these power quality disturbances, the voltage sag stands out for being the most frequent event, causing several losses. Therefore, it is extremely important to locate the source of these disturbances in the electrical distribution system, in order to mitigate the problem. In general, methods for locating disturbances use few electrical meters and an analysis of the characteristics of voltage and current signals, which results in the estimation of a large region as a result.

Therefore, there is a great demand for a highly accurate and efficient automatic anomaly detection method based on system log analysis to ensure the reliability and the stability of large-scale distributed systems. In this paper, we propose VeLog, an automatic anomaly detection method based on variational autoencoders (VAEs). In the offline training phase, VeLog learns the patterns of normal log sequences and then generates normal intervals. In the online detection phase, VeLog detects an anomaly by automatically evaluating whether the distance between the input vector and its estimated vector matches these normal intervals. We evaluate VeLog on log datasets collected from representative distributed systems. The experimental results demonstrate that VeLog can detect anomalies with high accuracy and good efficiency.},

At the tracking stage, a discrete Kalman filter is employed to predict the location of the golf ball based on the previous observations. To increase the detection accuracy and speed, we propose to use image patches rather than the entire images for detection. In order to train the detection models and test the tracking algorithm, we collect and annotate a collection of golf ball dataset.

Most of the existing research addresses this problem either by extracting micro-Doppler from radar data or features from visual data. But these solutions do not perform well in all weather conditions and beyond a particular distance. To solve the problem of classifying small UASs and differentiating them from the birds, we propose a novel approach by merging classical Interactive Multiple Model tracking (IMM) filter and state of the art Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) unit. The IMM extracts the kinematic features of the target flight trajectory and the RNN with LSTM learn the complex sequence of flight maneuvers. We generated synthetic trajectories emulating birds and drones flights using 3D kinematic models for training.

  abstract  = {System traces are a collection of time-stamped messages recorded by the operating system while the system is running. Analysis of these traces is crucial for tasks such as system fault finding. Moreover, detecting anomalies in system behavior becomes crucial in safety-critical and time-sensitive systems where delayed detections can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, we focus on developing a lightweight and explainable approach for safety-critical time-sensitive systems.Given a set of system traces under normal conditions and anomalous conditions, trace-based anomaly detection aims at classifying the trace as anomalous or not. In this work, we introduce GWAD, a greedy workflow graph framework for anomaly detection, a novel greedy graph construction approach for both offline and online anomaly detection in system traces. Our approach utilizes both sequence of occurrence of events and the time interval between their occurrences in learning the normal system behavior. We propose two approaches, first for offline classification of the trace as anomalous or normal using the event occurrence workflow graphs and secondly an online streaming algorithm that monitors the events as they occur in real-time for detecting anomalies increasing system resilience. Our approach also provides reasoning for the cause of anomalous behavior. We show that GWAD is better than traditional state-of-the-art models. The paper shows the technical feasibility and viability of GWAD through multiple case studies using traces from a field-tested hexacopter.},

  abstract  = {The explosion of data generated by IoT devices encouraged the introduction of paradigm fog computing, which facilitates computation and analysis at the edge. Alongside fog, cloud computing co-exists for facilities such as massive storage, large processing capability, etc. However, storage and computation of data at different levels increase the risk of data security, which persuades the need for a proper access control scheme. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is a well-known cryptographic mechanism that provides data confidentiality and fine-grained access control. Unfortunately, the existing CP-ABE schemes are not well suited for the cloud-fog-IoT environment as they do not provide functionalities like key-escrow resistance, attribute update, attribute revocation, user revocation, and outsourcing of expensive operations with verifiable outsourced decryption, simultaneously in a single scheme. Therefore, this paper proposes a CP-ABE scheme named ACS-FIT, which supports key-escrow resistance, attribute update, user revocation, attribute revocation, and outsourcing of expensive operations with verifiable outsourced decryption functionalities altogether. The scheme is efficient as the expensive encryption and decryption operations are outsourced to fog nodes leaving only a small and constant amount of computation for the IoT devices. Additionally, the task of attribute update and revocation is also outsourced to a third party. The cost incurred during attribute update and revocation are also efficient as only those components are updated which are associated with the affected attributes. Meanwhile, the user holds a constant size key which remains unchanged during any update. The security analysis proves that the proposed scheme is secure against Chosen-Plaintext Attack under Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and suitable for IoT devices.},

Under the hard environment conditions, the image of railway crossings is failed to capture by the camera. We propose a foreign objects detection system based on millimeter wave radar which has a higher detection accuracy, without the limitation of weather and light. Unlike vision-based approach, it can operate in darkness, high or low light intensity environment.

Using the identified level of cooperativeness along with the driver workload, the level of assistance required is determined based on an inverse U-shaped relationship. Subsequently based on the level of assistance required, a factor is developed to modulate the assistance torque generated by the autonomous controller. For the generation of the assistance torque, a new ℓ ∞ linear parameter varying (LPV) control technique is proposed to deal with large variations in the vehicle longitudinal speed and those in the modulation factor.

While greater cognitive diversity of team members boosts the quality of innovation breakthroughs, it also intensifies the difficulty of collaboration. Transdisciplinary (TD) collaboration-often the most diverse and disruptive form of innovation---includes hidden barriers that can undermine the achievement of impacts targeted. In this paper, we identify cognitive barriers to TD project launch, as well as mobilization activities shown to boost the likelihood of TD success. The benefits of these collaboration boosters include: a) growing the team&#39;s psychological resilience and flexibility for navigating unknowns and adversity; b) uncovering top opportunities, risks and leverage points in the collective field-of-effect; as well as, c) architecting narratives which translate complex experiences into meaningful explanations and contributions-as well as, attract and energize others to join the TD learning journey.},

  abstract  = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has an increasing impact on all areas of people&#39;s livelihoods. A detailed look at existing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary metrics frameworks could bring new insights and enable practitioners to navigate the challenge of understanding and assessing the impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). There has been emerging consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy, indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of A/IS, there&#39;s a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights organizations, and others, to engage in cooperating with A/IS developers towards implementation of enhanced well-being impact assessments.},

However, smart home inhabitant&#39;s life habits are often required to obtain adequate results for energy management, security, Health at Home (HaH), and numerous other applications. In this paper, a model for life routines representation and algorithms for its generation is introduced. Study on the state of the art exposes that activity ordering and duration are key features of human behavior. Consequently, the presented approach focuses on a higher level of semantic by observing activities performed by the inhabitant rather than the sensor logs, which allow for better understanding of his comportment and universality of the model for multiple aims. Stochastic Time Automata (STA) is proposed as it adequately models activity ordering with probability associated to edges and activity duration through probability distribution associated to location delay. Presented approach does not require specific equipment besides sensors required for activity recognition and is versatile enough to be used in various applications. A case study highlights the relevancy of the chosen features and demonstrates that the proposed model is efficient to depict and understand inhabitants&#39; life habits.},

The requirements were identified through a literature review that considered laws, standards, guides, and scientific articles. This review showed the lack of tools that automate the accessibility test for the Deaf. Thus, we propose two approaches to automating accessibility testing: one that requires the programmer to encode metadata for accessibility testing, and another that relies only on descriptive analysis of data from other web pages accessible to the deaf. Our work was based on the analysis of 150 sites, 100 of them with metadata analysis, and 50 with descriptive analysis. We discuss the tradeoff for each approach.},

  abstract  = {Lipreading is an important component of audio-visual speech recognition. However, lips are usually modeled as a whole in lipreading, which ignores that each part of lip focuses on different characteristics of mouth and the overall model can not fit each part perfectly. Besides, features based on the whole lip usually vary a lot according to different speakers, which leads that the training databases usually need to contain as much speakers as possible. In this paper, A part-based lipreading (PBL) method is proposed to deal with the mismatch between an overall lip model and the separate parts of lips, also the excessive dependence of models on the speakers in training set. PBL models lips partly and predicts jointly. It employs a uniform partition strategy on convolutional features and generates several part-level sub-results for final prediction. Experiments are performed on a large publicly available dataset (LRW) and part of it (p-LRW, 65 words), in order to simulate the progressive instructions in the working scene of robots. Word accuracy of PBL reaches 82.8\% on LRW and 88.9\% on p-LRW. Finally, an end-to-end audio-visual speech recognition system using PBL is established and achieves 98.3\% word accuracy on LRW.},

  abstract  = {Visual `point-and-click&#39; interaction artifacts such as mouse and touchpad are tangible input modalities, which are essential for sighted users to conveniently interact with computer applications. In contrast, blind users are unable to leverage these visual input modalities and are thus limited while interacting with computers using a sequentially narrating screen-reader assistive technology that is coupled to keyboards. As a consequence, blind users generally require significantly more time and effort to do even simple application tasks (e.g., applying a style to text in a word processor) using only keyboard, compared to their sighted peers who can effortlessly accomplish the same tasks using a point-and-click mouse. This paper explores the idea of repurposing visual input modalities for non-visual interaction so that blind users too can draw the benefits of simple and efficient access from these modalities. Specifically, with word processing applications as the representative case study, we designed and developed NVMouse as a concrete manifestation of this repurposing idea, in which the spatially distributed word-processor controls are mapped to a virtual hierarchical `Feature Menu&#39; that is easily traversable non-visually using simple scroll and click input actions. Furthermore, NVMouse enhances the efficiency of accessing frequently-used application commands by leveraging a data-driven prediction model that can determine what commands the user will most likely access next, given the current `local&#39; screen-reader context in the document. A user study with 14 blind participants comparing keyboard-based screen readers with NVMouse, showed that the latter significantly reduced both the task-completion times and user effort (i.e., number of user actions) for different word-processing activities.},

In this paper, we propose a physiological monitoring approach based on electroencephalogram activities to classify the motor control difficulty and use that information for adjusting an admittance controller. We designed a physical human-robot interaction experiment where the human guides the robot&#39;s end-effector across four tasks with varying motor control difficulty. Each task is a combination of high/low damping and fine/gross motor control. During the experiments, we measure the muscle activation information in terms of surface electromyogram from eight channels. Two sets of features based on Riemann geometry and time domain (Hudgins&#39; features) are extracted every 500 ms from the EMG data. A support vector machine classifier is trained on these features to estimate whether the existing admittance parameters are comfortable for the user else an increase/decrease of the damping is suggested. Riemann geometry-based features yielded higher accuracy (85.7\%) than the Hudgins&#39; features (69.1\%) across 21 participants; however, the performance of these classifiers on the new sessions degraded to 63.1\% and 54.5\% respectively. To address this issue, we implemented a transfer learning approach using Riemannian features that improved the inter-session detection rate to 73.95\%.},

Although HPS has been pervasively used in medical and nursing programs in developed countries, there is a huge need in providing consistent and objective assessment on student performance during HPS. Current methods all depend on instructor subjective observation, which not only could lead to inconsistency in evaluation across different students and different instructors, but also are very time and resource intensive. Recognizing complex human activities in the context of HPS is very challenging because it involves the recognition of human actions, gestures, as well as human-object and human-mannequin interactions. Hence, we study the feasibility of developing such a system for a particular simulation where a student is required to first identify the patient and then place a neck brace on the patient&#39;s neck. The system we that we have developed identifies the actions and activities in the simulation and provides qualitative assessment on the student performance using computer vision, OpenPose, and TensorFlow. The system also consists of a debriefing mobile app that the student and instructor could use to view an automatically generated report with supporting key frames captured and annotated by our system.},

This study aimed to introduce an affordable continuous machine learning (ML) based workload assessment tool, that can provide real-time workload scores. Using experienced military unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators in a simulated operational setting, muscle behavior represented by their interaction with a joystick was modeled to predict Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) scores. Data were obtained from six professional participants. Four machine learning (ML) modeling methodologies were tested on each participant&#39;s data. It has been shown that after running an ML setup phase for each participant, an already in use available tool as the UAV joystick controller can be used to predict SWAT scores at any given time. By implementing the approach presented in this study, researchers can more accurately evaluate various aspects of the human operator&#39;s cognitive workload, and developers can evaluate the progression of their solutions on operators&#39; cognitive workload over time.},

The UAVs act as a complementary asset and bolster offensive air operations. Given the complexity of future operating environments, the degree of autonomous control required for pilots to concurrently operate multiple UA Vs and their own aircraft is one area of concern. To determine the amount of autonomous control abstraction that has the largest impact in reducing operator workload and increasing system performance, a predictive workload model was developed using the Improved Performance Research Integration Tool (IMPRINT). This research concluded that maned-unmanned teams can increase mission performance and maintain the pilot&#39;s cognitive workload at a manageable level by utilizing higher levels of human control abstraction, where unmanned systems have greater degree of autonomy.},

  abstract  = {Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders. Undesired involuntary periodic movements are generated in ET patients. Some devices have been developed to suppress ET movements up to the present. In this paper, Tonic Vibration Reflex (TVR) is studied to investigate the possibility to suppress ET movements. The TVR is a phenomenon of human reflex which is induced by applying mechanical vibration stimulation to a human muscle. If a counter-phase movement of the ET movement of the patient is artificially generated by the TVR, the ET movement would be canceled. In order to investigate its possibility, fundamental study on the TVR is carried out in this study. In order to confirm the possibility of generating the TVR in forearm pronation/supination, the effect of the amplitude and the range of frequency of vibration stimulation on the TVR in forearm pronation/supination is studied in this paper. The effect of forearm posture is also studied. Furthermore, the effect of the on-and-off vibration stimulation on the TVR in forearm pronation/supination is investigated. The experimental results show the possibility of tremor movement suppression with the TVR.},

  abstract  = {Recurrent neural networks that can capture temporal characteristics on multiple timescales are a key architecture in machine learning solutions as well as in neurocognitive models. A crucial open question is how these architectures can adopt both multi-term dependencies and systematic fluctuations from the data or from sensory input, similar to the adaptation and abstraction capabilities of the human brain. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic Continuous Time Recurrent Neural Network (CTRNN) by allowing it to learn to gate its timescale characteristic during activation and thus dynamically change the timescales in processing sequences. This mechanism is simple but bio-plausible as it is motivated by the modulation of oscillation modes between neural populations. We test how the novel Gating Adaptive CTRNNs can solve difficult synthetic sequence prediction problems and explore the development of the timescale characteristics as well as the interplay of multiple timescales. As a particularly interesting finding, we report that timescale distributions emerge, which simultaneously capture systematic patterns as well as spontaneous fluctuations. Our extended architecture is interesting for cognitive models that aim to investigate the development of specific timescale characteristic under temporally complex perception and action, and vice versa.},

Most of the context-sensitive embeddings have confirmed the positive impact on some basic tasks of classification, which have only a few types. In this paper, we make an empirical comparison of different pre-trained embeddings on the task of ultra-fine entity typing which has more than 10k types. We apply 7 kinds of pre-trained embedding to the typing model to prove whether the pre-trained embedding has a positive effect. The results indicate that almost all context-sensitive pre-trained embeddings improve the performance of models using Glove. The pre-trained embedding generated by BERT achieves the best performance in the Ultra-Fine dataset and OntoNotes dataset, which shows BERT has better capability to extract finer-grained information than other pre-trained models.},

  abstract  = {Prediction interval (PI) as a method of probabilistic prediction can output the prediction range with a certain degree of confidence. It can give the users more information than point prediction. The noise of data in PI is usually assumed as a Gaussian, Laplace or other single distribution. However, these assumptions are not suitable for all the applications. In order to solve this problem, a mixed approach based on Long Short Term Memory Network with bootstrap (LSTM-bootstrapping) and mixed Gaussian distribution (MGD) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to fore-cast intervals for time series. LSTM is chosen here because of its extremely effectiveness for time series prediction. Firstly, LSTM-bootstrapping is employed to calculate the model uncertainties and the point prediction. Afterwards, we assume that the noise satisfies a mixed Gaussian distribution and the EM algorithm is applied to estimate the noise uncertainty. Then PI can be acquired by the variances of model and noise uncertainty. The proposed predictive approach is evaluated on wind speed, heteroscedastic wind power and reg capacity price datasets. The results show that our method can solve the uncertainty problem of arbitrary distribution and obtain better performance.},

  abstract  = {One of the main objectives of production planning is to minimize the usage of resources and manufacturing-related costs while meeting the customer&#39;s requirements, such as delivery dates and quality. Production planners deal with various scheduling problems that are often NP-hard and can not be optimally solved by humans. Solving such problems often relies on methods from the Operations Research (OR) field. Recently, Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) has emerged as a promising field of research that aims at tackling different optimization tasks using the latest advancements in machine learning, including deep reinforcement learning. These methods can be successfully used for short-term production planning because of their flexibility and speed. In this paper, we examine the applicability and scalability of neural combinatorial optimization methods in the context of production planning. We define an evaluation metric to investigate the stability and quality of the solutions. Furthermore, we develop an experimental setup allowing to compare various approaches for production scheduling with sequence-dependent setup costs under real-world production conditions. Although an optimality gap is observed when compared to established OR methods, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of NCO in terms of scheduling time.},

Then, in order to capture the divergence and likelihood expression of spatial structure in each video slice, a pipeline is introduced using a pre-trained CNN. In addition, any pre-trained network can be used to extract these features. Subsequently, Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS) is established to determine the timing relationship between two adjacent slices to obtain the temporal structure of divergence and likelihood features, which are expressed as LD-Divergence and LD-Likelihood. In UCF50 and UCF101 datasets, we analyzed the impact of different feature dimensions retained by PCA on recognition. Finally, we combined LD-Divergence and LD-Likelihood to improve accuracy to 0.961 and 0.949 on UCF50 and UCF101 datasets.

Compared to the existing solutions, our model is able to predict the time to next failure on an individual water pipe level. The learned failure intensity function is used to identify value points in the deterioration process of water pipes that represent their economical end-of-life.

Time series imputation remains a challenging task due to the existence of non-linear dependencies between current and past values. Conventional methods, such as deletion of rows containing missing values or filling them with the last observed value, add bias to the data and are therefore inefficient. There are situations where data is missing at consecutive points or random points in the dataset, and one particular method may not work well for all cases. In this paper, nine commonly used models in the field of imputation, based on tools of statistics, machine learning, and deep learning, are compared. Results show that Linear Memory Vector Gated Recurrent Unit (LIME-GRU) outperforms the other tested models by having the least Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). A predictive model to gauge the impact of imputation on prediction is also used to validate the findings. The results of the prediction model illustrate that with LIME-GRU, there was a 39\% improvement in Average Aggregated Measure (AAGM) when compared with mode imputation on a particular test case.},

To achieve this goal, we utilize a pre-trained deep neural network as a 3D pose estimator for estimating human 3D pose from 2D joint locations of the person in each image. Each image in popular datasets used for training such 3D pose estimator is obtained from a camera whose axis is parallel to the ground. On the other hand, since an image in TV sports video is generally taken from a bird&#39;s eye view, joint locations of a human is distorted in the lower part of the image. Therefore, it is not appropriate to give 2D joint locations of the person directly to the pre-trained 3D pose estimator. To resolve this problem, we propose to correct 2D joint locations in an image of TV sports video by a homography transformation that maps the points in the image of TV sports video to the corresponding points in the image taken by the camera that captures training data for the 3D pose estimator. Experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate athlete 3D pose from monocular TV sports video.},

When using wind energy to generate electricity, it will be of great help to the safety and stability of power supply, if the wind speed in the future can be accurately known. In this paper, a new short-term wind speed prediction method based on historical data is proposed. Firstly, the wind speed is pre-processed through variational mode decomposition (VMD) of which the parameters are optimized using a multi-objective optimization method in this paper, owing to the effect of VMD is greatly affected by parameters. Then, the combined forecasting method combining support vector machine improved by particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-SVM), back propagation neural network (BP) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) is used to predict each wind speed component. This paper takes data sets available at the US Virgin Islands Bovoni measurement station as an example, conducting experiments and performing analysis. Compared with other prediction models, it is demonstrated that the model proposed in this paper significantly improves the prediction accuracy. Also, the wind speed in January, April, July and October are forecasted respectively to test the stability of models, and the result shows that the proposed model has the best adaptability.},

Moreover, devices connected in IoT networks are operated without any human intervention for longer times. Hence, intelligent network-based security solutions are very important to provide timely detection of these attacks to protect an IoT system from potential failure. Different machine learning based techniques have already been proposed to provide effective solution to discover and counteract network intrusion aiming to ensure security in the network. In the context of IoT networks, little attention has been paid to the identification of malicious attacks. To this end, we propose an effective intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect unforeseen IoT cyberattacks by using various bagging and boosting ensemble methods and feed forward artificial neural network. We have used a recently published dataset, UNSW-NB15, containing simulated IoT sensor data to estimate the performance of the proposed models through 5-fold cross validation technique. The performance results show the effectiveness of the models with a small set of automatically selected optimal features from the dataset.},

  abstract  = {Adaptive recommender systems are increasingly showing their importance as profiling is a dynamic problem. Their goal is to update recommendation models as new interactions take place, thus swiftly adapting to drifts in the user&#39;s behavior and desires, and item&#39;s audience. However, existing recommendation algorithms usually do not perform well during drifts, as they take long to adapt to changes, or these updates are suboptimal since they account for all profiles&#39; preferences equally, which is often untrue as each individual and its changes are unique. In this paper, we propose the ADADRIFT algorithm to deal with user and item-based drifts in adaptive recommender systems using personalized learning rates based on profile statistics. The experiments using stream-based recommender systems (ISGD and BRISMF) across four different datasets show that ADADRIFT surpasses ADADELTA with significant improvements in recommendation rates. The best results appear when the data streams have a long history of the users&#39; or items&#39; interactions and drifts become noticeable. The experimentation in this work highlight the importance of handling drifts in recommender systems.},

Using an n-ary tree structure to represent the formula, we convert the formula into a linear sequence that can be viewed as the input sentence and then embed the formula by using a word embedding model. Based on the characteristics of mathematical formulae, a weighting function is also used to get the final weighted average embedding vector. Through some experiments on NTCIR-12 Wikipedia Formula Browsing Task, our model can outperform previous formula search engines in Bpref prediction metrics. In addition, compared with traditional tree-based models, NTFEM not only improves the retrieval effect, but also greatly reduces the training time and improves training efficiency.},

And some existing methods may not be applicable when the herbs exist in actual wild environment. Therefore, how to locate the valid herb regions and extract the effective features is an open issue. In this paper, a novel CNN model is proposed for herb identification by using the part-information perception module (PPM) and species classification module (SCM). A new attention mechanism, namely part priority attention mechanism (PPAM), is proposed by training PPM independently with herb part labels. It should be pointed out that the proposed PPAM can guide the model to focus on the position of herb parts and suppress the irrelevant noisy regions. Moreover, depthwise separable convolution and label smoothing technique are introduced to decrease the model complexity and regularize the impact of mistake labels. In the experiment part, a large-scale herb dataset is constructed, which consists many kinds of challenging herb species in the wild environment. Additionally, these images contains both species labels and part labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves obviously improvement in term of accuracy and model size compared with other classical deep learning models.},

Firstly, the semantic information is used to find more reasonable correspondence, i.e. semantic point pairs. Secondly, we formulate a novel objective function to integrate the matching error of semantic point pairs as guidance of registration. Thirdly, a hyperparameter is applied to balance the confidence of semantic point pairs. At last, a novel algorithm under the ICP framework is presented to optimize the rigid transformation iteratively.

To realize sensor nodes that detect bears automatically using image recognition technology, we aim to realize an accurate and computationally-efficient bear-presence detection. In this paper, we propose a bear-presence detection method combining region proposal of a low-resolution and image classification. In the experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves 4.9\% higher recall and 2.3\% higher F-score than image classification with-out region-proposal. Moreover, the proposed method achieved 0.6\% higher recall and 18.5\% higher F-score than YOLOv3, which is one of state-of-the-art object detection methods while the execution time was reduced to 72.4\% for bear images and 55.5\% for non-bear images.},

However, the individual representations in evolutionary clustering algorithms exist redundancy and inconsistency problems, which not only wastes the search efforts but also disorders the mutual learning process between individuals. To address the problems, in this paper, we propose a genetic sequence resorting method. This method first identifies a reference parameter vector and then resorts the order of the genetic sequences in each individual according to their distance to the reference vector. In this way, the solutions represented by individuals are unified, which removes redundancy and enhances the efficiency of the mutual learning in the algorithm. Incorporating the above method, a new and generic evolutionary clustering framework is developed. Under this framework, we specifically design two algorithms: one for distance-based convex clustering and the other for density-based nonconvex clustering. Experiments show that our method can effectively improve the performance of evolutionary clustering algorithms on various datasets with both convex and nonconvex cluster shapes.},

  abstract  = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive medical imaging procedure. Image reconstruction in EIT is difficult because it involves solving a non-linear and ill-posed mathematical problem. One of the most commonly implemented inverse approaches is usually a variation of the Newton Raphson algorithm. However, this approach is not guaranteed to reach a global optimum or a local optimum and as such, it requires an accurate initial estimation of the resistance distribution, which is not always available in practice. In this paper, a new method is proposed to solve for the inverse problem in EIT while avoiding dependencies on the initial estimation of the resistance distribution. The proposed approach uses a differential evolution (DE) optimizer integrated with the Newton Raphson algorithm. The stochastic nature of DE allows the problem to be solved without having an accurate initial estimation and allows for solutions that will not be trapped in local minimal values. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional differential evolution algorithm, and performs similarly to the traditional Modified Newton Raphson algorithm with accurate initial estimation. The proposed method does, however, have an advantage over the Modified Newton Raphson algorithm as it does not require an estimate of the initial resistance distribution.},

This paper introduces the idea of evolution in opinion dynamics models into particle swarm optimization algorithm, and proposes a social opinion dynamics-guided particle swarm optimization algorithm (SODPSO). Firstly, in the process of population evolution, the idea of dynamic bounded confidence is used to select the learning object (the best individual in the confidence bound) for each particle to update, and for the individual whose learning object is itself, a difference operator is introduced to update it. Secondly, when the population stagnation reaches a certain threshold, the concepts of individual differences and acceptance are introduced. The particles are sorted and classified according to the fitness value, and different evolution strategies are used to update them in order to jump out of the current optimal solution. Finally, this paper compares SODPSO with the other five PSO variants on part of cec&#39;17 benchmark functions. The experimental results demonstrate that the SODPSO proposed in this paper has greater advantages in functions with certain specific characteristics.},

DE algorithm benefits from two populations for updating individuals, while it might cause memory problems in practice during solving large-scale optimization problems; especially when they are used in an embedded system. One strategy to tackle this problem is utilizing a one-array scheme which benefits from only one population, leading to a half-space memory. This paper proposes a novel DE algorithm based on one-array DE and a random replacement strategy; it adds an additional competition to the selection operator to make better use of the new individual that it might be potentially noteworthy. The positive feature of the introduced replacement strategy is that it does not need any extra computational budget. Also, due to employing one-array strategy, the proposed scheme has a lower memory complexity.

  abstract  = {Many real-world problems are categorized as large-scale problems, and metaheuristic algorithms as an alternative method to solve large-scale problem; they need the evaluation of many candidate solutions to tackle them prior to their convergence, which is not affordable for practical applications since the most of them are computationally expensive. In other words, these problems are not only large-scale but also computationally expensive, that makes them very difficult to solve. There is no efficient surrogate model to support large-scale expensive global optimization (LSEGO) problems. As a result, the algorithms should address LSEGO problems using a limited computational budget to be applicable in real-world applications. Coordinate Descent (CD) algorithm is an optimization strategy based on the decomposition of a n-dimensional problem into n one-dimensional problem. To the best our knowledge, there is no significant study to assess benchmark functions with various dimensions and landscape properties to investigate CD algorithm and compare with other metaheuristic algorithms. In this paper, we propose a modified Coordinate Descent algorithm (MCD) to tackle LSEGO problems with a limited computational budget. Our proposed algorithm benefits from two leading steps, namely, finding the region of interest and then shrinkage of the search space by folding it into the half with exponential speed. One of the main advantages of the proposed algorithm is being free of any control parameters, which makes it far from the intricacies of the tuning process. The proposed algorithm is compared with cooperative co-evolution with delta grouping on 20 benchmark functions with dimension 1000. Also, we conducted some experiments on CEC-2017, D = 10,30,50, and 100, to investigate the behavior of MCD algorithm in lower dimensions. The results show that MCD is beneficial not only in large-scale problems, but also in low-scale optimization problems.},

In particular, BCI has been widely used to detect the intention of users in motor imagery (MI)-based tasks. Although the MI classification accuracy has been largely enhanced from previous efforts, MI-BCI studies have focused on extracting features only during MI tasks, not during the preparatory phases. The increment of alpha band power is induced by performing a task with attention. This study proposes a n approach for increasing MI-BCI performance by analyzing brain state in preparatory before the task. EEG recordings of nine healthy subjects from the open BCI dataset were investigated. The alpha lateralization index (ALI) was calculated for each trial and high ALI trials were utilized for learning lateralization-based model. MI classification accuracy using the lateralization-based model marked high performance (median accuracy = 63.2\%; interquartile range (IQR) = 50.0\% - 54.8\%) than the total trial-based approach (median accuracy = 52.0\%; IQR = 50.0\% - 54.8\%) with statistical significance (p = 0.018). This study suggests alpha lateralization which is an imbalance pattern between ipsilateral and contralateral is one of the main factors for improvement of performance. Accordingly, since the alpha liberalization before MI task could exert an effect on the MI phase, the analysis combined preparation with MI would derive highly benefit for the MI classification.},

Advancing manipulation and control technology of external devices such as robotics, the need of MI for complex and human-like movements is growing. The two most important procedures that influence the performance of MI-BCI are feature extraction and classification. Although there have been recent studies on feature extraction for complex, there is no consensus on the classifier suitable for complex MI. This study aimed to identify the best classifier for complex MI decoding.Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings measured during complex MI, which are hand grasping, spreading, pronation and supination, were used for binary (grasp vs. twist) and quaternary classification. Time domain parameter, which have shown suitability for complex movement decoding in previous works, was used as the EEG feature. Four types of ten machine learning classifiers, which have been applied to MI-BCI, were compared.Shrinkage regularized linear discriminant analysis (SRLDA) exhibited the best classification accuracy in both binary (92.8\%) and quaternary (55.2\%). In the case of training and testing time, a small amount of time for real-time analysis were needed, except random forest and logistic regression.This study showed that SRLDA is an appropriate classifier for complex MI classification, due to its ability to handle stationary and high dimensionality feature, TDP. The findings suggest that complex MI-BCI could gain more benefit from applying linear and shrinkage regularized model (i.e., SRLDA).},

  abstract  = {Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCI) allow users to control a computer for various applications using their brain activity alone, which is usually recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Although BCI applications are numerous, their use outside laboratories is still scarce due to their poor accuracy. Some users cannot use BCIs, a phenomenon sometimes called &quot;BCI illiteracy&quot;, which impacts around 10\% to 30\% of BCI users, who cannot produce discriminable EEG patterns. By performing neurophysiological analyses, and notably by identifying neurophysiological predictors of BCI performance, we may understand this phenomenon and its causes better. In turn, this may also help us to better understand and thus possibly improve, BCI user training. Therefore, this paper presents statistical models dedicated to the prediction of MI-BCI user performance, based on neurophysiological users&#39; features extracted from a two minute EEG recording of a &quot;relax with eyes open&quot; condition. We consider data from 56 subjects that were recorded in a `relax with eyes open&#39; condition before performing a MI-BCI experiment. We used machine learning regression algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to build our model of prediction. We also computed different correlations between those features (neurophysiological predictors) and users&#39; MI-BCI performances. Our results suggest such models could predict user performances significantly better than chance (p ≤ 0.01) but with a relatively high mean absolute error of 12.43\%. We also found significant correlations between a few of our features and the performance, including the previously explored μ-band predictor, as well as a new one proposed here: the μ-peak location variability. These results are thus encouraging to better understand and predict BCI illiteracy. However, they also require further improvements in order to obtain more reliable predictions.},

The reason why the task of KMI is so difficult to perform is because there is no standardized way of instructing the subject in this mental task. This study presents an innovative BCI called Grasp-IT thought to support the learning of the KMI task, and the evaluation of two different learning methods: (i) a first one guided by an experimenter and based on the notion of progressiveness and (ii) a second one where the learners are alone and practice by trial and error.

Twelve healthy subjects performed a neurofeedback task whereby a cursor was moved to one of two targets (left and right) using only motor imagery of the corresponding hands. To evaluate the effect of aptitude, we measured the Mahalanobis&#39; distances between whole-scalp spectral patterns in four frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) during the first session of left and right motor imagery. Later, we used these features as inputs in a Support Vector Regressor to predict performance during the following two sessions. The performance was measured as the percentage of trials where the cursor correctly reached the target. Since our sample was balanced, this approach predicted performance on sessions two and three with mean absolute errors of 15.07±12.94\% and 11.98±11.40\%, respectively. The most relevant feature in both cases was the Mahalanobis&#39; distance in alpha. These results suggest that participants who can not evoke different patterns of alpha power during left- and right-hand motor imagery during the first session, also are less likely to improve during the following training sessions. The investigation of whole-scalp differences allows a holistic comprehension of the neural basis of motor imagery. This method also characterizes a potential predictor of performance for future applications of MI-based neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces.},

Masked Neural Sparse Encoder (MNSE) is proposed to be a sparse coding solver that brings out better feature bases for data representation and improvement in the anomaly detection task. To guarantee the representational capability of features, a set of masks is applied to force each feature basis is heeded on learning a specific stroke within a certain area. The mask set is constructed by clustering primary strokes from training samples, and represents them with corresponding centers of clusters. Hence, these masks stand for main strokes in concerned areas with higher probabilities. Experiments show MNSE contains better representational capability in data from different domains. Compared with the standard sparse coding and the auto-encoder based approaches, MNSE lifts the accuracy up around 20\%.},

A body pose estimation algorithm and the Lucas-Kanade optical flow method are combined to automatically detect the Region of Interest (ROI) represented by a grid of points. The movement of the ROI is then translated into the frequency of respiratory events. We used a dataset with 28 near-infrared videos, as well as 11 videos of subject uncovered and partially covered by blankets. We compared the breathing rate measurements provided by a wearable device with the ones estimated by the video-based approach. A linear correlation analysis of both measurements resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.925, and accuracy of 99.70\% for the first dataset, and 0.873 and 88.95\% for the second dataset, respectively. The ultimate application is to detect abnormalities in breathing and health emergencies in environments such as homeless shelters.},

  abstract  = {Automatic real-time emotion recognition based on multi-channel EEG signals is a significant and challenging task in neurology and psychiatry. In recent years, deep learning has been used in EEG emotion recognition. However, many existing deep learning based methods still require complex pre-processing or additional feature extraction, which make it difficult to achieve real-time emotion recognition. In this paper, an end-to-end model named Temporal Convolutional Broad Learning System (TCBLS) was designed for multi-channel EEG based emotion recognition. The TCBLS takes one-dimensional EEG signals as input, then extracts emotion-related features of EEG automatically. In this model, the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract EEG temporal features and deep abstract features simultaneously, then Broad Learning System (BLS) is used to map the features to a more discriminative space and further enhance the features. We evaluated our method on DEAP database, performing 10-fold cross-validation on each subject to obtain the classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the performance of TCBLS is better than other comparison methods, and the mean accuracy of TCBLS is 99.5755\% and 99.5781\% on valence and arousal classification task respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TCBLS in EEG emotion recognition.},

Using fuzzy set, one can tackle the problem of uncertainty representation in gray levels of MRIs during the segmentation process. This uncertainty in their gray levels occurred due to poor illumination of images. To resolve this issue, this study focused on fuzzification of gray levels and assignment of membership degrees based on membership functions. Each fuzzified gray level value was quantified using entropy. The proposed method generated multiple thresholds based on maximum entropy values of gray levels. These thresholds generated multiple segmented images with different features. Finally, image fusion operation was performed on multiple segmented images to highlight all the critical features of brain tumors. Fusion images were compared with the segmented images obtained from four additional methods, the multilevel threshold method, adaptive threshold method, K-means clustering algorithm and fuzzy c-means algorithm. The performance evaluation metrics indicated the effectiveness of the proposed method over these existing methods.},

A large number of passengers gather around the elevator entrances and may cause unexpected accidents such as stampede. An effective way to guide the flow of passengers is to use guardrails. So far, the arrangement of guardrails in most subway stations is still designed manually, which requires rich experience and expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose to use the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to design the guardrails of the elevator entrance automatically. The transfer time of passengers and the flow rate are optimized concurrently. The proposed algorithm is tested in two scenarios with different complexities. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can provide promising guardrail arrangements, and reveal some instructive conclusions for guardrail design in subway stations.},

In particular, a car-following system model is established. The primary task of the automatic vehicle is to follow the trajectory of the preceding car and maintain an expected headway. Then, the paper analyzes the powertrain of the electric vehicle. The loss of battery life over a period of time is proportional to the acceleration, so it takes the battery life into consideration. The Q-learning algorithm is conducted for the optimal car-following strategy using system data instead of system dynamics information. It utilizes reward function and greedy strategy to select actions to train the following vehicle to achieve car-following safety. When there is no collision in these two cars, acceleration is considered into reward function to reduce battery loss. Finally, it is verified by simulation that the proposed car-following strategy can keep good tracking, maintain the expected headway from the preceding vehicle, and reduce battery loss.},

Smart stations -- which consist of a Raspberry-Pi computer, a Wi-Fi adapter, and a GPS add-on-- were programmed to sniff Wi-Fi signals and transmit signal data through a cloud service to the research computer. These smart stations were mounted onboard a network of transit buses that serve the City of Bozeman, Montana, and its surrounding areas. Two rule-based methods were developed to estimate the number of passengers onboard a bus at any given time. In the first, standard method, a signal was labeled as a passenger if it met arbitrary cutoff values from six criteria pertinent to speed (how fast the signal/device was traveling relative to the bus), duration being detected (as a proxy for how long the device remained in close proximity of the bus), and signal strength (which may correlate with the distance between the device and the bus). The second method employed a cost-function minimization via grid-search to tune the cutoff values involved in those subjective rules (e.g., a valid passenger signal should be close enough to a bus stop when it is first and last detected, but how close is close?). Results suggest a strong linear relationship between model-estimates and ground-truth passenger counts -- on average, the model estimates were able to capture 67\% of the observed passenger counts. As Wi-Fi enabled personal devices continue to saturate the market, a Wi-Fi based counting tool as studied here can serve as an efficient way to monitor passenger flows of transportation systems.},

Additionally, this work applies information theory to navigate through a region such that the SLAM data association, and thus the localization, performance is improved. The results also indicate that characteristic values for a region can be used as a SLAM metric for the region. Combining the characteristic value with information theory techniques improves the localization performance at extended ranges and is a first step towards long range underwater localization using gravimeters.

The protocol is implemented for a problem of two Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) trying to find a target in a maze. The control strategy is implemented using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Simulations of the protocol demonstrate that communication is received and decoded by the teammates without explicitly revealing the tactics being used.},

  abstract  = {Recommender system (RS) commonly describes its user-item preferences with a high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrix. A latent factor (LF) model relying on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is frequently adopted to extract useful information from such an HiDS matrix. In spite of its efficiency, an SGD-based LF model commonly takes many iterations to converge. When processing a large-scale HiDS matrix, its computational efficiency should be further improved by further accelerating its convergence rate as well as maintaining its learning ability. To address this issue, this paper innovatively proposes novel SGD algorithm which incorporates a nonlinear proportional integral derivative (NPID) controller into its learning scheme for building an LF model. The main idea is to adopt an NPID controller to model the learning residual achieved in the past iterations, thereby adjusting the learning direction and step size of the current iteration, thereby making a resultant model converge fast. With the NPID-incorporated SGD algorithm, this study proposes an NPID-SGD-based LF (NSLF) model. Experimental results on two HiDS matrices demonstrate that compared with a standard SGD-based LF model, the proposed model achieves higher computational efficiency and prediction accuracy for missing data of an HiDS matrix.},

The heuristic is illustrated on a two-input two-output balance system. It integrates a self-adjusting nonlinear threshold accepting heuristic with a neural network to compromise between the desired transient and steady state characteristics of the system while optimizing a dynamic cost function. The heuristic decides on the control gains of multiple interacting PID control loops. The neural network is trained upon optimizing a weighted-derivative like objective cost function. The performance of the developed mechanism is compared with another controller that employs a combined PID-Riccati approach. One of the salient features of the proposed control schemes is that they do not require prior knowledge of the system dynamics. However, they depend on a known region of stability for the control gains to be used as a search space by the optimization algorithm. The control mechanism is validated using different optimization criteria which address different design requirements.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates a new recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for active control (AC) of impulsive noise sources. The proposed RLS algorithm is based on an objective function having robustness against the impulsive noise. This paper introduces two versions of the proposed algorithm. In the first version, the update equation comprises a fixed step-size to regulate the adaptation. Considering that a fix-valued step-size results in a trade-off situation from the view-point of the performance during the transient and at the steady-state, a second version of proposed algorithm addresses this trade-off by incorporating a convex combined step-size (CCSS) strategy. The CCSS strategy selects (automatically) a large-valued step-size at the start-up for a fast convergence speed. As the AC system approaches the steady-state, the CCSS is adapted to a small value for improving the performance at the steady-state. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in the various settings of AC systems for impulsive sources.},

A fault isolation structure is then developed based on ensemble bagged tree procedure such that it is capable of isolating faults in a steady-state runtime. As a crucial goal, increasing accuracy and robustness simultaneously are mainly centered.

  abstract  = {Quickly identifying faulty sections is tremendously important for power systems, yet challenging due to handling the variations of complex alarm patterns. Existing works have focused on finding fault section clues solely from alarm information (and ignoring power system topology information). So they are only sensitive to alarms from power systems with pre-assumed topology structures, and encounter difficulties when a system&#39;s topology changes. To adapt to unknown or varying system topologies, here we present a Topology-Adaptive Deep Model (TADM) for power system multifault diagnosis. TADM mines the underlying mapping from alarm and topology information to each section&#39;s fault status. It consists of a deep iterative network (DIN), a one-layer fully connected network (FCN), and section-wise multifault diagnosis (SWMD) subnetwork. TADM first models a fault power system as a graph, from which DIN iteratively integrates the alarm and topology information in the region from each node to its T -hop neighbors, and learns their local correlation. Limited to T &#39;s size, FCN then combines all local correlations to determine the global correlation between alarm and topology information across the entire power system. To implement multifault diagnosis, learned local and global correlations serve as topology-related fault representations for input as an SWMD (to predict all sections&#39; fault states one by one). A comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that TADM outperforms state-of-the-art models in both multifault diagnosis and adapting to system topologies. The source code of the TADM is available onlline 1 .},

In the off-line training layer, aging-aware features are extracted to improve SoC estimation accuracy throughout the entire battery life cycle. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is introduced to map the relationship between the extracted features and SoC for its strong nonlinear fitting ability. In the on-line estimation layer, Ampere-hour integral method is utilized to provide SoC reference to guarantee the stability of the proposed method. Meanwhile, to suppress the measurement noise, we adopt Kalman filter to correct the SoC value estimated by XGBoost. The superiority of the proposed method is proved under the random walk discharging experiment by comparing with the results of XGBoost, i.e., without Kalman filter. The proposed method improved the accuracy of lithium-ion battery SoC by 4\% to 10\%.},

We propose a computer vision-based early screening system for ASD to characterize the facial expressions and eye gaze attention which are considered to remarkable indicators for early screening of autism. The system provides the subjects with three different virtual interaction modes: video, picture, and virtual interactive game. During the interaction between the subject and the computer, the system extracts and analyzes the quantitative information of the subject&#39;s performance. Then, through computer vision-based emotion analysis and attention analysis methods, the subject&#39;s emotions and attention features in the three interaction modes are automatically calculated to assist in the early screening of autism. Finally, the accuracy and feasibility of the system are verified through experiments on both the publicly available dataset and the data collected from 10 ASD children.},

Second, the design and results of a study on human-machine cooperation on decision level are presented. We examine the negotiation behavior of humans in a scenario with discrete decision options and a deadline. The results indicate the validity of a previously proposed model based on negotiation theory to describe the observed human behavior.

This paper aims to validate this model in situations of interaction with different levels of haptic guidance on a driving simulator. Two experiments have been performed for this purpose. The first experiment consisted of implementing the driver model in the driving simulator and evaluating its lateral control performance when interacting with a haptic guidance system. The results reveal that the model can be adapted to different sharing levels by adjusting only the gain of an internal model of the steering wheel compliance. The second experiment consisted of estimating the evolution of the gain of this internal model using the unscented Kalman filter. The results reveal consistency between the evolution of the identified parameter and the level of sharing of the haptic guidance system. The driver model represents the process of human driver adaptation to variations in the level of sharing in haptic guidance systems.},

  abstract  = {Head pose offers vital cues to infer one&#39;s social attention in wide applications. Most existing head pose estimation algorithms have demonstrated competitive results taking high resolution images of frontal view as input. However, these approaches still work poorly if they are fed with low-resolution images. In a more common realistic scene such as computer vision assisted autism screening, images of unconstrained patients that are taken from distant cameras often have low-resolution and non-frontal faces. To this end, we present a multi-view scheme based CNN for free-head pose classification. Residual Networks are taken as the backbone model to generate effective feature representations of the low-resolution images. A novel multi-view feature fusion layer is proposed to address facial appearance variation over multi perspectives owing to free movement. Also, a multi loss function by combining binned classification and regression losses of different pose angles is employed to obtain a more precise pose estimation. The proposed method is evaluated on two scenarios: (1) a publicly available dataset and (2) a practical application to explore the social attention of a group with social deficits: autistic children. Experimental results suggest that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view pose classification methods and achieves comparable pose estimation results.

  abstract  = {A new concept for modeling the behavior and the interaction between drivers at intersections is presented. For this purpose a hybrid dynamic game is introduced using the concepts of game theory. The proposed hybrid game is used to model the interactive behavior in a junction scenario. The presented hybrid approach divides the modeling of motion into individual maneuvers. With this partition of motion, the decision process can be reduced to a simple maneuver selection that takes into account the motion of the vehicle without the need for solving complex coupled differential equations. In order to make computation of a solution feasible we propose a rule based adaption mechanism. Simulation is used to show the applicability of the developed hybrid dynamic game approach.},

  abstract  = {Humans skillfully operate many types of advanced human-robot/machine systems, such as automobiles, using their upper and/or lower limbs. Some researchers have proposed methodologies for integrating biomechanical/perceptual models of human operators into such systems to improve their safety and maneuverability. However, there has been no research focusing on the biomechanical/psychological interactions between upper and lower limbs, even though human operators often have to utilize both sets of limbs simultaneously. Thus, this study aimed to investigate human force perception properties (HFPP) with consideration for the perceptual interactions between upper and lower limbs during the operation of vehicular driving devices, such as a steering wheel and gas/brake pedal. A set of force perception experiments was conducted on eight healthy subjects. The subjects first determined the standard force magnitude applied to their right foot by the pedal, then determined the magnitude of steering force when using one or two hands, which was equivalent to the standard force magnitude. Experimental results demonstrate that the HFPPs for a single hand and both hands change with the standard force magnitude and that the HFPP for a single hand is significantly influenced by steering rotational directions resulting in smaller standard force magnitudes. Furthermore, a computational model of HFPPs for both hands was developed to explain the perceptual interactions between upper and lower limbs.},

We construct an experiment from data that includes an interface that removes the sensor set confound. The results are surprising. Adding additional sensor information to the data-impoverished non-EID interface results in poorer task performance and no improvements in control stability. Participants using the EID interface exhibited superior task performance and control stability to those in two non-EID conditions.

In the second experiment, limitations of the automation were communicated to the participants verbally. A comparison of two experiments revealed that participants classified fewer contacts when the automation support was present. Moreover, communicating the limitations of automation resulted in even fewer classifications than when no information was provided. Possible reasons for these results include confusion created by the additional information and reprioritization. These results highlight the complexity of delivering automation transparency to operators in safety-critical environments.

Recently, vehicle mirrors (side-view and rear-view mirrors) are gradually being replaced with electrical mirrors (i.e., display devices). The characteristics of electrical mirrors are different from those of conventional mirrors in many aspects. These differences can cause an uncomfortable feeling in drivers. In this paper, we focus on the half occlusion appearing in the peripheral areas of a display and investigate the effects of half-occluded regions on whether humans recognize a viewing device as a mirror. To evaluate this effect, we conducted experiments based on pairwise comparisons using a head-mounted display (HMD) to present virtual mirror objects having different characteristics in terms of half occlusion as well as binocular and motion parallaxes. Experimental results suggest that half occlusion is certainly related to the human recognition of a mirror. Furthermore, pseudo half-occlusions introduced by barriers in front of a 2D display can reinforce this recognition.},

  abstract  = {In recent times, Social Network Analysis (SNA) has become a very important and interesting subject matter with regard to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in that a vast variety of processes, comprising animate and inanimate entities, can be examined by means of SNA. As a result, prediction tasks within social network structures have become significant research problems in SNA. Hidden facts and details about social network structures can be effectively and efficiently harnessed for training AI models with the goal of predicting missing links/ties within a given social network. Thus, important factors such as the individual attributes of spatial social actors, and the underlying patterns of relationship binding these social actors must be taken into consideration because these factors are relevant in understanding the nature and dynamics of a given social network structure. In this paper, we have proposed an interesting hybrid model: Representation Learning via Knowledge-Graph Embeddings and ConvNet (RLVECN). Our proposition herein is designed for examining, extracting, and learning meaningful facts for resolving link prediction problems about social network structures. RLVECN utilizes an edge sampling approach for exploiting the representations of a social graph, via learning the context of each actor with respect to its neighboring actors, with the goal of generating vector-space embeddings per actor which are further harnessed for innate representations via a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) sublayer. Successively, these relatively low-dimensional representations are fed as input features to a downstream classifier for solving link prediction problems in a given social network. Our proposition, RLVECN, has been trained and evaluated on six (6) real-world benchmark social graph datasets.},

However, synthetic opponents must be controlled by high-quality behavior models, in order to exhibit human-like behavior. Building such models by hand is recognized as a very challenging task. In this work, we study how multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can be used to construct behavior models for synthetic pilots in air combat simulation. We empirically evaluate a number of approaches in two air combat scenarios, and demonstrate that curriculum learning is a promising approach for handling the high-dimensional state space of the air combat domain, and that multi-objective learning can produce synthetic agents with diverse characteristics, which can stimulate human pilots in training.},

Recent advances in machine learning techniques have enabled the development of methods for predicting behavior in real time. This is expected to be used for walking to predict a fall and provide support in advance to reduce injuries. Although many systems have been proposed to measure and detect a fall, there are few studies on data measured when a fall is caused by an unexpected disturbance during normal walking. Therefore, we do not know how long it takes for a person to fall over after a disturbance occurs, and we do not have much understanding of how predictable the phenomenon is in principle. In this study, we constructed a system to simulate a fall with a disturbance and measured the 3D skeletal data. From these results, the average time between the disturbance and the start of the fall was calculated. By using a neural network to make predictions, we confirmed that falls can be predicted at the point of the disturbance.},

Therefore, the alternative non-gradient descent learning algorithm was proposed and prevalently applied in kinds of domains, such as pseudoinverse learning algorithm (PIL). However, when a special variant of the PIL, taking the random configuration of weight parameters, is adopted, the generalization ability needs further improvement although it has excellent training efficiency. Thus, on consideration of integrating the idea of ensemble learning, we proposes two methods to enhance basic PIL. One method is equivalent to an additive model, which can raise the network&#39;s performance by introducing boosting mechanism, and the other is to adopt a recursive way to rectify the hidden layer output of the neural network, then the relative better model is used in the subsequent prediction. Comprehensive evaluating experiments are conducted on several datasets, and the experimental results illustrate that the our proposed methods are effective on the classification accuracy.},

How to estimate the health status of the high-speed solenoid valve accurately to improve the reliability of train braking system is a challenging issue. Most related work relies on accurate physical models or large amounts of historical data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a hybrid data-fusion estimate method for the health status of train braking system. Firstly, the physical model of the high-speed solenoid valve is established, and physical indicators which represent the working performance are extracted. Then, the dynamic driving current is processed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to calculate the information entropy. Physical indicators and information entropy indicators are combined into a feature vector, which can be reduced the dimension by the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (T-SNE) algorithm. Finally, the feature vector is input into the probabilistic neural network (PNN) to estimate the health status of train braking system. The proposed method is implemented in the high-speed solenoid valve degradation dataset, which collected by the train brake system experiment platform. The result shows that it is better than other methods in the accuracy and calculation efficiency.},

  abstract  = {Batch scheduling problems deal with jobs to be processed in batches in many industrial production systems. They are hard to solve. This work proposes a novel bi-objective batch scheduling problem with the constraints of release time and sequence-dependent setup time. As an important characteristic of the concerned problem, the number of late jobs within a batch varies with its start time. A mixed-integer linear program is proposed to describe this problem. Two objectives, i.e., minimizing the total number of late jobs and setup time, are considered. Two memetic algorithms by integrating a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and 2-opt local search are designed to solve the concerned problem. They adopt different crossover operators, i.e., partially mapped one and precedence preserved one. By comparing the results of the proposed algorithms with their peers on extensive experiments, we conclude that the proposed algorithms get much better Pareto fronts than their peers at the expense of more execution time. Yet, their speeds are fast enough to solve the problems with industrial scales and thus prove the readiness to put them in industrial use.},

While several techniques have been developed to mitigate specific AM related threats, there is little research aimed at assessing cyber-physical threats or vulnerabilities that extend across the entire AM workflow. Such an assessment requires a holistic approach that systematically analyzes all components of the AM workflow for cyber-physical vulnerabilities. Several methodologies have been successfully applied towards identifying such vulnerabilities in other domains like Information Technology (IT) systems. In response, this paper provides a systems approach towards identifying cyber-physical vulnerabilities in AM systems using the Vulnerability Assessment and Mitigation (VAM) methodology. This approach characterizes the different vulnerabilities that arise from specific AM threats by identifying the quality attributes of the AM system that introduces it. The security techniques developed to mitigate these threats are reduced to a combination of fundamental mitigation techniques, that have been compiled based on its success in other domains. Using the resources from the VAM methodology, fundamental mitigation techniques that are best suited towards mitigating specific vulnerability attributes are identified. Comparing the combination of fundamental mitigation techniques associated with an AM security technique and the list of fundamental mitigation techniques suggested by the VAM methodology provides insight into how an AM security technique can be improved. Finally, the paper provides a case study of the proposed adapted VAM methodology to demonstrate its application.},

Transfer learning including various levels of fine-tuning is also applied. For pre-trained network, we use Xception, VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception_v3, which are pre-trained using ImageNet. The result shows that the best estimation accuracy is achieved by VGG16, whose MAPE (mean average percentage error) is 11.1\%. Additionally, we fine-tune VGG16 and the accuracy reduces to 7.9\% for MAPE. From this result, the performance of CNN model can improve by fine-tuning.

It builds upon the recently introduced xDNN method addressing more complex multi-class problems, specifically when classes are highly imbalanced. DMR moves away from a direct decision based on all classes towards a layered DT of pair-wise class comparisons. In addition, it forces the prototypes to be balanced between classes regardless of possible class imbalances of the training data. It has two novel mechanisms, namely i) using a DT to determine the winning class label, and ii) balancing the classes by synthesizing data around the prototypes determined from the available training data. As a result, we improved significantly the performance of the resulting fully explainable DNN as evidenced on the well know benchmark problem Caltech-101. Furthermore, we also achieved high results in terms of accuracy for the well known Caltech-256 dataset, as well as surpassed the results of other approaches on Faces-1999 problem. In summary, we propose a new approach specifically advantageous for imbalanced multi-class problems on well known hard benchmark datasets. Moreover, DMR offers full explainability, does not require GPUs and can continue to learn from new data by adding new prototypes preserving the previous ones but not requiring full retraining.},

As ways of getting data are more various and easier, the amount of data processed is increasing exponentially and the data is more likely to be located at different clients. Traditional clustering methods cannot process the large dataset one time due to the limit of memories. In this paper, an Image Scaling Density-based Clustering (ISDC) algorithm is proposed. ISDC can process data by a client alone as well as process in parallel by several clients to deal with data located at different clients. The ISDC algorithm does not need any parameters to be designated manually. The parameters are determined by the algorithm based on the statistical features of dataset. In Parallel ISDC or PISDC, each data block located at different client is clustered alone to form intermediate clusters. By border detection algorithm, representative clusters are formed by the points that are at the edge of intermediate clusters. Then, in global clustering, representative clusters from all clients are merged by the server. The border detection algorithm reduces the communication cost between clients and the server, as well as increases the efficiency of global clustering. At last, the server feeds back the clustering information to clients to complete clustering. Our experimental results verified the effectiveness and efficiency of PISDC and ISDC.},

The performance of the proposed algorithm on colour images corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise is evaluated in terms of both objective and subjective measures, and the obtained results show our method to be competitive to other methods including curvelet domain hard thresholding and MSt-SVD.},

In the canonical PSO, velocity has a significant effect on the performance of PSO, which is updated based on cognitive and social factors. It can help particles to share information effectively. In this paper, a center-based velocity is proposed in which a new component, named opening &quot;center of gravity factor&quot;, is added to velocity update rule to propose the center-based PSO (CenPSO). Center of gravity factor benefits from center-based sampling strategy, a new direction in population-based metaheuristics, especially to tackle LSGOs. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark functions, namely, CEC2010 and CEC2017, with dimensions 100 and 1000. The experimental results verify that CenPSO is significantly better than PSO over the majority of benchmark functions.},

  abstract  = {The allocation of epidemic-control resources has been an increasingly active topic in the physical world. Most existing studies focus on the allocation of abstract and continuous epidemic control resources, and then formulate differentiable convex programming problems. However, real-world resources are usually discrete materials, goods, or services, so that resource allocation problems become non-convex. As a complementary study, this paper builds three discrete resource allocation problems based on an improved Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious- Vigilant (SEIV) spread model: the cost-constraint optimization problem (CCOP), rate-constraint optimization problem (RCOP), and eradication optimization problem (EOP). Then, existing swarm-based metaheuristic algorithms are adapted to effectively solve the problems. Thereinto, the Heuristic Majority-Voting Binary Particle Swarm Optimizer (HMV-BPSO) is present, which introduces a heuristic factor which concerns the probability distribution of resources to guide the evolution of particles and helps improve the performance of original MV-BPSO. Numerical experiments are developed to verify the effectiveness of swarm- based metaheuristic algorithms on epidemic control. Results show that HMV-BPSO can produce higher-quality solutions than other algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence method which is employed frequently for solving real-world problems. After its inception, many variants of PSO devote to improving its performance by modifying the behavior of each particle, in which the population topologies of the particle swarm may alter. This paper investigates how population topology influences the performance of PSO. A random topology generation algorithm that adopts both the greedy strategy and randomized algorithm is proposed in the paper. The randomly generated topologies are applied in PSO-w, which introduces no modification to the population topology of the original PSO. Experimental results demonstrate that algorithms using topologies with more edges tend to converge faster and generally obtain a more accurate solution. Another major result in this paper is that how clustering coefficient affects PSO largely depends on the sparsity of the topology. A lower clustering coefficient in sparse topology conduces to faster convergence and a more precise result, but a higher clustering coefficient is preferred when the topology is dense.},

  abstract  = {Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) require the algorithm to locate multiple global optima and also achieve a certain accuracy on the found optima. When applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve MMOPs, a fixed population communication topology may not be sufficient to handle these two requirements simultaneously. In this paper, a novel PSO with hybrid ring topology, termed HRTPSO, is proposed for MMOPs. In the early evolutionary process of HRTPSO, a sparse topology is constructed to enhance the population diversity to help locate multiple optima, while in the later evolutionary process of HRTPSO, the population communication topology is switched to a relatively dense topology for improving the convergence efficiency on the found optima. The switch of topology is controlled by a threshold and its effect is also analyzed in this paper. Experimental results on the 20 multimodal functions in CEC&#39;2013 benchmark set show that HRTPSO has better performance than the other six multimodal optimization algorithms.},

Feature selection is the task of reducing the number of features by removing redundant features from data while preserving the classification accuracy. It is a multiobjective problem as there are two objectives. In general, multiobjective selection algorithms with machine learning techniques are utilized to find the most promising feature subsets; however, classification performances of these machine learning techniques are analyzed separately. In this study, we propose a new multiobjective selection model that dynamically searches for the best ensemble of five classifiers to extract the best representative feature subsets. We present the experiment results on 12 well-known datasets. The results show that the proposed method performs significantly better than all the machine learning techniques when they are executed separately. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms two existing ensemble algorithms, namely AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.},

  abstract  = {The increasing interest of the research community in the intertwined fields of brain-machine interface (BMI) and robotics has led to the development of a variety of brain-actuated devices, ranging from powered wheelchairs and telepresence robots to wearable exoskeletons. Nevertheless, in most cases, the interaction between the two systems is still rudimentary, allowing only an unidirectional simple communication from the BMI to the robot that acts as a mere passive end-effector. This limitation could be due to the lack of a common research framework, facilitating the integration of these two technologies.In this scenario, we proposed ROS-Neuro to overcome the aforementioned limitations by providing a common middleware between BMI and robotics. In this work, we present a working example of the potentialities of ROS-Neuro by describing a full closed-loop implementation of a BMI based on motor imagination. The paper shows the general structure of a closed-loop BMI in ROS-Neuro and describes the specific implementation of the packages related to the proposed motor imagery BMI, already available online with source codes, tutorials and documentations. Furthermore, we show two practical case scenarios where the implemented BMI is used to control a computer game or a telepresence robot with ROS-Neuro. We evaluated the performance of ROS-Neuro by ensuring comparable results with respect to a previous BMI software already validated. Results demonstrated the correct behavior of the provided packages.},

Severely motor impaired people who have lost muscle control could benefit from this technique to control assistive devices, which support them in daily life. However, non-invasive BMIs can distinguish only a few different commands with relatively high error rates, which makes the asynchronous control of a robot with multiple degrees of freedom challenging. Here, we introduce a novel robotic grasping system, which combines scene recognition techniques and autonomous path planning with user interaction instantiated by a hybrid control system based on the electroencephalogram and the electrooculogram. The results show that healthy subjects can reliably perform a grasp-and-place task, arranging four objects at defined positions within 133-331s (193.6 ±61.5s), while they require only a few corrections. Our robot control platform proved to work solely with electrophysiological control signals and thus, constitutes a basis to perform various robot actions initiated by motor-impaired people.},

Deep learning algorithms are capable of learning flexible nonlinear functions directly from data, and their constant processing latency is perfect for their deployment into online BCI systems. However, it is crucial for the jitter of the processing system to be as low as possible, in order to avoid unpredictable behaviour that can ruin the system&#39;s overall usability. In this paper, we present a novel encoding method, based on on deep convolutional autoencoders, that is able to perform efficient compression of the raw EEG inputs. We deploy our model in a ROS-Neuro node, thus making it suitable for the integration in ROS-based BCI and robotic systems in real world scenarios. The experimental results show that our system is capable to generate meaningful compressed encoding preserving to original information contained in the raw input. They also show that the ROS-Neuro node is able to produce such encodings at a steady rate, with minimal jitter. We believe that our system can represent an important step towards the development of an effective BCI processing pipeline fully standardized in ROS-Neuro framework.},

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are becoming as a promising alter-native to help post-stroke patients rehabilitation, although there are very few associated studies and systems being applied in clinical environment. As a novelty, developing a motor imagery (MI) BCI based on pedal end-effector for motor rehabilitation, we propose to combine pedaling MI and passive pedaling into a Calibration phase. As a result, users would activate continuously their central and peripheral mechanisms linked to lower-limbs throughout BCI intervention. We hypothesize that this strategy enables to obtain a better classification model for our BCI by selecting those feature vectors corresponding to pedaling MI closer to real movements. Therefore, it is expected to have a more effective BCI intervention. Preliminary results show that the proposed method may increase the BCI performance. For almost all participants was noted, during MI tasks, a power decreasing over the foot area (Cz location), corresponding mainly to beta frequency bands, specifically for both low (13 to 22 Hz) and high (23 to 30 Hz) beta bands.},

In this work, we propose a novel entropy-based machine learning method to classify between standing and walking conditions from the sole brain activity. The Shannon entropy has been used as a complexity measure of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and subject-specific features for classification have been selected by Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) filter. Exploiting these features with a linear classifier, we achieved &gt; 85\% of classification accuracy over a long period (≈ 25 min) of standing and treadmill walking on 11 healthy subjects. Moreover, we implemented the proposed approach to successfully discriminate in real-time between standing and over-ground walking on one healthy subject. We suggest that the reliable discrimination of rest against walking conditions achieved by the proposed method may be exploited to have more stable control of devices to restore locomotion, avoiding unpredictable and dangerous behaviors due to the delivery of undesired control commands.},

  abstract  = {The number and variety of Web APIs is growing exponentially. Software engineers need to expend a significant amount of time and effort reading and understanding the accompanying documentation. In addition, system automation may use API to interact with each other. However, this is not always a simple task since the API documentation of a provider can be anything from a single HTML page description through to a complex structure with information spanning several pages. Understanding this wide variety of API documentation structures and styles is therefore a labor intensive and error-prone task for engineers. By providing a machine-learning platform that can extract and standardize API usage information, however, we believe we can accelerate the creation of API-enabled systems by using automation to simplify the task of understanding. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to automating and standardizing usage information about APIs, combining several machine-learning algorithms in order to extract key attributes from API documentation and generate a machine readable Open API Specification (OAS). We develop i) a content-based learning model that identifies the context of a block of extracted API features; ii) a signature-based machine learning model that recognizes a sequence of successful/unsuccessful extracted API endpoints; and iii) a deep mapping model that pinpoints fine-grained mapping of extracted API attributes to OAS objects. Results of our experiments show that the proposed approach successfully works with an accuracy of 99\%, 94\% and 97\% for content-based learning, signature-based learning, and Deep Mapping of API attributes respectively. We then use the models to produce OAS compliant API Specifications for more than 2,585 public APIs, validate them via API calls and finally deploy the validated APIs to the RunMyProcess software automation platform.},

In this article, we share our learning of converting a distributed software to a microservice-based architecture using containers. Though the existing system has a modular design and deployed as distributed components, analysis of the current architecture shows that the application is monolithic (though modularized) and the components are strongly coupled in an indirect manner. As a result, it turns to be impossible to attain microservice-based architecture without changing the architecture. Next, we propose a microservice-based containerized TO-BE architecture of the application, and demonstrate that this TO-BE architecture does not incur any significant overhead. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations that the practitioners can follow to convert a monolithic application to a containerized architecture.},

This paper presents a forward collision warning technique which incorporates the object detection and depth estimation networks. A deep convolutional neural network is constructed with transfer connection blocks for object detection and classification. It is capable of small object detection under the real-time processing requirement. For depth estimation, a monocular based disparity estimation network is adopted to the stereo vision framework. The epipolar constraint is applied to increase the prediction accuracy. In the experiments, the performance evaluation is carried out on public driving datasets. The comparison with the state-of-the-art networks has demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technique.},

  abstract  = {Following its applications on reception, space exploration, health care, and others, the dual-arm robot is employed for industrial automation more intensively these days. With a human-like two-arm structure of high degrees of freedom, it should be a strong competitor for industrial tasks of high complexity. However, up to date, its deployment is still far behind the traditional single-arm robot manipulator. It may be partially due to its higher price and larger installation space. Meanwhile, the lack of proper methods or devices to deal with task planning and teaching that usually involves robot motions of more than 10 DOF is also influential. Motivated by it, in this paper, we propose a novel manipulation system for the industrial dual-arm robot manipulator using virtual reality (VR). Especially, we propose taking advantage of the similarity between the dual-arm robot and human arm and come up with a human-like path planner, with an intention to incorporate that of human into robot path planning. In addition, we also furnish the system with several assistive tools, including that for physical behavior emulation and self-collision detection. Simulations based on realistic environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed manipulation system, along with the questionnaires to evaluate user&#39;s responses.},

Hence, solely training in a simulated platform for games like Billiard and Carrom, which need precise execution of a shot, would not be ideal in actual gameplay. This paper presents a real-time vision based efficient robotic system to play Carrom against a proficient human opponent. We demonstrate the challenges of adopting a reinforcement learning algorithm beyond simulations in implementing a strategic gameplay for the robotic system. We currently achieve an overall shot accuracy of 70.6\% by combining heuristic and reinforcement learning algorithms.

The design and research of continuum robots are usually based on the assumption of piecewise constant curvature (PCC). However, due to the influence of friction, etc., the actual motion of the continuum robot is approximate piecewise constant curvature (APCC). To address this, we present a kinematic equivalent model for continuum robots, i.e. APCC 2L-5R. Using classical rigid linkages to replace the original model in kinematic, the APCC 2L-5R model effectively reduces complexity and improves numerical stability. Furthermore, based on the model, the configuration self-estimation of the continuum robot is realized by monocular cameras installed at the end of each approximate constant curvature segment. The potential of APCC 2L-5R in perception, planning, and control of continuum robots remains to be explored.},

We endow RBTs with continuous sensory data that permits the online monitoring of the task execution. The resulting stimulus-driven architecture is capable of dynamically handling changes in the executive context while keeping the execution time low.

Given the co-existence of humans and robots, the precise analysis-e.g., through formal verification techniques-of properties related to aspects such as human needs and physiology is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present a formally-based, model-driven approach to design and verify scenarios involving human-robot interactions. Some of the features of our approach are tailored to the healthcare domain, from which our case studies are derived. In our approach, the designer specifies the main parameters of the mission to generate the model of the application, which includes mobile robots, the humans to be served, including some of their physiological features, and the decision-maker that orchestrates the execution. All components are modeled through hybrid automata to capture variables with complex dynamics. The model is verified through Statistical Model Checking (SMC), using the Uppaal tool, to determine the probability of success of the mission. The results are examined by the developer, who iteratively refines the design until the probability of success is satisfactory.},

  abstract  = {Traversing at a high speed while maintaining stability is important for the application of quadruped robots. Prior works mainly concentrated on optimizing the stability margin of quadruped robots when walking through a variety of terrains. However, the problem of improving quadruped robots’ walking velocity with static gait is less concerned in their works. In this paper, the static gait planning problem is considered under the assumption that a set of irregular footholds on the rough terrain is given, and two approaches are proposed to improve the walking speed. The first one is a distance optimization algorithm, which can minimize the moving distance of the center of gravity (COG) in the stance phases based on the stability and the kinematic constraint. The other is a velocity optimization algorithm, which enables the body and the feet to move at the highest velocity with the joint angular velocity limit. The joint application of these two optimization algorithms significantly improves the walking speed of the quadruped robot. Simulation results in V-REP are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in improving the walking speed. Compared with the traditional gait planning techniques, one that moves the robot with the optimal stability margin, and the other that moves the robot without optimizing the velocity, our algorithms increase the average walking velocity by 81.6\% and 32.8\%, respectively.},

This work focuses on combining programming by demonstration with path optimization and local replanning methods to allow for fast and intuitive programming of assembly tasks that requires minimal user expertise. Two demonstration approaches have been developed and integrated in the framework, one that relies on human to robot motion mapping (teleoperation based approach) and a kinesthetic teaching method. The two approaches have been compared with the classic, pendant based teaching. The framework optimizes the demonstrated robot trajectories with respect to the detected obstacle space and the provided task specifications and goals. The framework has also been designed to employ a local replanning scheme that adjusts the optimized robot path based on online feedback from the camera-based perception system, ensuring collision-free navigation and the execution of critical assembly motions. The efficiency of the methods has been validated through a series of experiments involving the execution of assembly tasks. Extensive comparisons of the different demonstration methods have been performed and the approaches have been evaluated in terms of teaching time, ease of use, and path length.},

The actuation forces are decided using innovative forms of temporal difference equations relevant to the vessel&#39;s surge and angular velocities.

  abstract  = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) platforms play an important role in translating the rapid advances of RL algorithms into the successes of real-world tasks. These platforms integrate multiple simulation environments, allowing testing, evaluating and finally applying RL algorithms in different scenarios. However, the algorithm code is required to execute in the same runtime system with the underlying environments, which limits platforms’ compatibility when adapting an algorithm and flexibility when switching between different algorithms. We propose GLUE to resolve this issue, by decoupling the executions of algorithms and environments first, then leveraging the RPC protocol to orchestrate a seamless workflow between them. GLUE is further implemented as a library, which hides the handling of language-specific RPCs from users. We evaluate GLUE by adapting 6 RL algorithm implementations to a representative RL platform. Compared with the baseline approach, GLUE enables algorithms to achieve competitive performance, but reduces lines of algorithm code to be changed in adaption by 27.77\% , at the cost of 5.40\% longer training time, on average.},

Relying on sensorless Cartesian impedance control, a task-trajectory learning algorithm exploiting a limited number of human&#39;s demonstrations (based on Hidden Markov Model), and an autonomous optimization procedure (based on Bayesian Optimization) are proposed to learn and optimize the assembly task. To validate the proposed methodology, an assembly task of a gear into its square-section shaft has been considered. A Franka EMIKA Panda manipulator has been used as a test platform. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, making the robot able to learn and optimize its behaviour to accomplish the assembly task, even in the presence of uncertainties.},

The system incorporates multiple EVs as well as inelastic loads connected to the power grid under power flow limits. We aim at minimizing both the overall charging energy payment and the aggregated battery degradation cost of EVs while preserving the robustness of the solution against uncertainties in the price of the electricity purchased from the power grid and the demand of inelastic loads. The proposed approach relies on the so-called uncertainty set-based robust optimization. The resulting charge scheduling problem is formulated as a tractable quadratic programming problem where all the EVs&#39; decisions are coupled via the grid resource-sharing constraints and the robust counterpart supporting constraints. We adopt an extended Jacobi-Proximal Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm to solve effectively the formulated scheduling problem in a decentralized fashion, thus allowing the method applicability to large scale fleets. Simulations of a realistic case study show that the proposed approach not only reduces the costs of the EV fleet, but also maintains the robustness of the solution against perturbations in different uncertain parameters, which is beneficial for both EVs&#39; users and the power grid.},

Complex, distributed, and interconnected aspects of smart grids make detection of stealthy FDIAs with high accuracy significantly challenging. To address this issue, the paper proposes an innovative Adaptive Multi-Level Features Classification for Stealthy FDIA Detection (AMLFC-SFD) based on the Alternating Current (AC) state estimation. More specifically, we focus on maintaining a trade-off between the accuracy rate of detection and its associated computational complexity by utilizing two different Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifiers, in which the number of features as the input of the classifier depends on the strength of the underlying attack. In this regard, we divide potential FDI attacks in smart grids into three decision regions, including strong, moderate, and weak attacks and obtain the most accurate Kernel to separate measurements. To evaluate the proposed AMLFC-SFD framework, comprehensive numerical experiments are performed based on the IEEE 30-bus system. Results illustrate that with a lower number of features a reasonably high detection accuracy can be achieved, leading to a considerably less run time, which is of paramount importance for practical implementation.},

  abstract  = {The filter-based real-time energy management method has been proved practical and widely utilized in hybrid energy storage systems. However, the determination for the cutoff frequency of the energy-split filter is challenging. In this paper, an optimal filter-based energy management strategy is proposed for a battery/ultracapacitor electric vehicle to minimize the total energy consumption. A cost function of energy consumption for the cutoff frequency is established first. Considering the working condition of ultracapacitors, dynamic programming is adopted to obtain the optimal cutoff frequency series, i.e., the optimal energy distribution between batteries and ultracapacitors. Such an off-line optimization process is carried out under different driving cycles, e.g., urban and highway road conditions. Optimization results are used to determine the optimal cutoff frequency of a real-time filter-based energy management strategy. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy can minimize the total energy consumption of the hybrid energy storage system with ultracapacitors state of charge limitations being guaranteed. Compared with the existing real-time energy management strategies, the energy consumption is reduced 23.85\% under aggressive acceleration conditions and 7.08\% under urban conditions by the proposed strategy.},

Hence, this research presents a heuristic strategy named, CEAT, for energy-aware scheduling of a set of real-time periodic tasks on a DVFS enabled heterogeneous multicore platform. The presented strategy operates in three stages, namely Deadline Partitioning, Task-to-Core Allocation, and Energy-Aware Scheduling. Our experimental analysis shows that CEAT is not only able to successfully schedule more task sets (as high as 3.44\% and 21.83\%) compared to state-of-the-art [1] but also improve energy savings in the system.},

  abstract  = {It takes a great deal of time and money to turn a person with no knowledge or experience into a seafarer. However, these costs can be reduced using education and training via a simulator. In simulator-based education and training, on-site situations can be replicated, while it is also possible to freely alter both the situations of other ships and other external influences. Furthermore, this means that simulator-based training is effective not only for people with no knowledge or experience but also for those with existing experience. One of the people who supports this training is the operator, who is part of the training team. If the operator does not have a sufficient amount of skill, it is impossible for other ships to function naturally. Even if the developed training content is very good, positive training effects cannot be expected without the skill of the operator. Therefore, the operator&#39;s skills is essential to produce high-quality training for those using the technology at any level. The operators themselves can be either seafarers or non-seafarers and be placed in charge even if they do not have a license as a seafarer. However, qualifying as a seafarer does not mean that the individual will be placed in charge immediately. We think operators have a special position in the training process and represent the main key to achieving success in simulator-based training. In this study, we focused on the operators and investigated their role by comparing it with that of the captain, who is rich in knowledge and experience as a seafarer. A physiological index is designed to evaluate the mental workload, heart rate, and frequency components of the R-R interval of heart rate variability. This paper shows the mental workloads of both the navigator and the operator, while considering their mental relation using LF/HF values.},

The aim of this study was to confirm that the coefficient of variation of R-R interval (CVRR) and the adaptive weighted workload (AWWL) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) are effective indexes to measure navigator fatigue. Another aim was to show the effect of fatigue on navigator SA in lookout. Thus, subjective and objective mental workload of navigators caused by fatigue was measured in bridge simulator experiments. Navigator SA was measured by using a Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT). The results of the experiments were shown that CVRR was confirmed as an effective objective index for measuring navigator fatigue. Further, navigator SA errors are likely to increase under fatigue conditions.},

This ability is extensively involved in badminton smash reception. In existing studies on HEC evaluation, this ability was evaluated according to information collected after the motion had been performed. Accordingly, it is impossible to determine the specific phase of perception or motion that causes problems in HEC. The purpose of this study was to develop a system for identifying the abilities of perception involved in HEC as it relates to badminton smash it is considered as badminton&#39;s most effective shot. Two systems were developed to identify HEC perceptual abilities, one focused on perception in a static state (i) and the other focused on perception-to-motion comprehensiveness (ii). Next, two types of tests were conducted, one involving (i) and the other using (ii). The tests were randomly administered for a total of 18 participants in three groups: six people who had previously played badminton, six people who had played ball sports other than badminton, and six people who were inexperienced at ball sports. Participants were healthy adults. The tests aimed to identify factors of perceptual ability by comparing them across systems. The results showed no significant difference between experienced badminton players and others according to the conducted tests, where test (i) was used for measuring the distance between the shuttlecock and gaze. A significant difference between the group of experienced badminton players and the other two groups was, however, observed in the test using (ii). The results suggested the ability to follow the shuttlecock with the eyes to be a perceptual ability related to HEC in badminton smash receptions.

  abstract  = {Sign Language Synthesis (SLS) is a domain-specific problem where multiple sign language words are stitched to generate a whole sentence in video, which serves to facilitate communications between the hearing-impaired people and healthy population. This paper presents a Variable Motion Frame Interpolation (VMFI) method for highly fluent SLS in scattered videos. Existing approaches for SLS mainly focus on mechanical virtual human technology, lacking high flexibility and natural effect. Also, the representative solutions to interpolate frames usually assume that the motion object moves at a constant speed which is not suitable for predicting the complex hand motion in frames of scattered sign language videos. To address the above issues, the proposed VMFI adopts acceleration to predict more accurate interpolated frames based on an end-to-end convolutional neural network. The framework of VMFI consists of variable optical flow estimation network and high-quality frame synthesis network that can approximate and fuse the intermediate optical flow to generate interpolated frames for synthesis. Experimental results on our realistic collected Chinese sign language dataset demonstrate that the proposed VMFI model achieves efficiency by performing better in PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity) and MA (Motion Activity) and gets higher score in MOS (Mean Opinion Score) than other two representative methods.},

  abstract  = {Habituation responses to startle stimuli have been linked to individuals&#39; resilience assessment. Derived from skin conductance levels (SCL), individuals&#39; who elicit quicker habituation to startle stimuli typically report possessing higher trait resilience. However, this link has not yet been evaluated in the context of individuals&#39; dynamic resilience. This study examines whether the habituation of skin conductance response (SCR) could be used as a predictive measure for classifying individuals into high, moderate and low dynamic resilience groups. A dynamic decision-making task was paired with an acoustic startle paradigm, in which 53 participants were analyzed while being subjected to acoustic startle stimuli during the task. SCL of the participants were continuously recorded during the 24-minute trials. On the contrary to previous results in the literature supporting a link between skin conductance levels and trait resilience, current results did not show a solid predictive power toward quantification of dynamic resilience. However, the results act as a first step and open the way for further research to consider testing SCL measures as predictors of dynamic resilience in more ecological task environments than in controlled laboratory settings. These more ecological task environments may yield more SCL sensitivity for dynamic resilience measurement, as individuals will experience more naturally fluctuating task load and be required to activate various combinations of cognitive functions to cope with the task stressors.},

  abstract  = {Interest for motion sickness is increasing with increasing opportunities to view digital devices in transportation systems, including automated vehicles. Hence, technology for predicting and estimating motion sickness is essential. As one such technology, computational models for estimating motion sickness from head movements have been proposed and are used for motion sickness evaluation. However, a model capable of handling the effects of visual input and the visual-vestibular interaction for motions with six-degrees-of-freedom has yet to be developed. In this study, therefore, a computational model of motion sickness with visual-vestibular inputs is proposed by extending a model of the subjective vertical conflict theory of motion sickness for a vestibular input only. The proposed model inputs are the acceleration and angular velocity of the head and the visual perception of the angular velocity. A simulation conducted by inputting 1 h of sinusoidal oscillations demonstrated that the results are consistent with those of similar experiments conducted with human participants. In addition, the results of a simulation experiment conducted by changing the visual input demonstrated that motion sickness increases significantly when a conflict occurs between the visual and vestibular signals, which imitates the reading of a book in a moving car. Furthermore, we developed a method to calculate the predicted MSI using experimental data measured by IMU and camera image by approximating the visual perception of the angular velocity through an optical flow analysis. The results of inputting camera images and inertial measurement unit signals obtained by sine-wave-like pitching motion into the proposed model demonstrate that the proposed method, can describe the difference in motion sickness by the changes in the visual environment.},

This article presents a model of wheelchair users, from the point of view of control engineering, based on the interaction between the human hand-joystick and the lumped-parameter model of the human hand muscle system. The interaction between hand and joystick is represented by a robot arm with a four-bar closed-chain mechanism. This mechanism is operated by four musculotendon units based on Hill’s muscle model. This configuration allows simulating whole motions of the joystick as well as the evolutions of muscle activities during maneuvering the powered wheelchair. The advantage of this model is the integration of the biomechanical parameters of the muscular system of the human hand, which is very useful for simulating the defects related to the degree of physical impairment of wheelchair users. To validate the proposed model, we compare the simulation outputs of the user model with the previously published experimental results in the framework of the Wheelchair Skills Test (v. 4.1). The simulation results show that the proposed model can reflect the difficulties at the biomechanical level of users in driving the wheelchair.},

  abstract  = {Automatic emergency steering maneuvers can be used to avoid more obstacles than emergency braking alone. While a steer-by-wire system can decouple the driver who might act as a disturbance during the emergency steering maneuver, the alternative in which the steering wheel remains coupled can enable the driver to cover for automation faults and conform to regulations that require the driver to retain control authority. In this paper we present results from a driving simulator study with 48 participants in which we tested the performance of three emergency steering intervention schemes. In the first scheme, the driver was decoupled and the automation system had full control over the vehicle. In the second and third schemes, the driver was coupled and the automation system was either given a high impedance or a low impedance. Two types of unexpected automation faults were also simulated. Results showed that a high impedance automation system results in significantly fewer collisions during intended steering interventions but significantly higher collisions during automation faults when compared to a low impedance automation system. Moreover, decoupling the driver did not seem to significantly influence the time required to hand back control to the driver. When coupled, drivers were able to cover for a faulty automation system and avoid obstacles to a certain degree, though differences by condition were significant for only one type of automation fault.},

This paper aims to predict driver torque control, especially when haptic guidance is part of haptic feedback. A new cybernetic driver model with an improved neuromuscular system is proposed and identified. It is assumed that the driver converts a target steering-wheel angle into torque by both indirect and direct control. Indirect control refers to the adaptation of the parameters of an internal model of steering compliance as perceived by the driver. Direct control accounts for the driver&#39;s corrective action through direct haptic feedback. The parameters of the model were identified with data collected from experiments conducted with a driving simulator. The results of identification were satisfactory and led to good representation of the driver&#39;s action, with or without haptic guidance. The model accurately predicted driver torque output. It can be used to study driver adaptation to haptic guidance systems.},

Cognitive workload decreases awareness and delays the driver&#39;s attention on the surrounding environment. Conventionally, the degree of cognitive workload on a driver, namely, the driving workload, is estimated from the steering pattern of the steering wheel. Direct measurements of the hand motions operating the vehicle might more easily and accurately detect the small changes caused by driving workload than conventional methods. Therefore, we investigate the effect of cognitive workload on the steering operation and hand motions of drivers, and verify the applicability of our approach to driving-workload estimation. The hand motions refers to the behavior of the hands operating the steering wheel. From the acceleration of the hands, we derive an index of the driving workload. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on seven participants performing a dual task. The estimation accuracy of the proposed method at least matched that of the conventional steering-entropy method.},

Monotonous road situations can produce drowsiness, resulting in poor driving performance. Conversation in automated vehicles is expected to mitigate fatigued driving. However, few studies have examined effects of conversation. This paper reports a driving simulator study describing impacts of passenger conversation on driver fatigue and driving performance regarding the relationship between a driver and a passenger. Participants were categorized into two groups: a passenger&#39;s friends (ConvR) and people who had not met the passenger before (ConvNR) to examine whether the acquaintance with the passenger affects driver behaviour, driving performance, fatigue and workload. The results showed that drivers in ConvNR felt lesser sleepy and found it easier to drive than the drivers in ConvR, but no difference of driver behaviour and driving performance was observed between two groups. In addition, regardless of the relationship, making casual conversation led decreased fatigue and workload in comparison with solo driving without conversation. The practical implication for further conversation methods to regard driver fatigue and driving performance in the automated vehicle is discussed.},

However, preliminary analysis shows that for some applications, it is more advantageous to use different activation functions for different neurons - i.e., select a family of activation functions instead, and select the parameters of activation functions of different neurons during training. Specifically, this was shown for a special family of squashing functions that contain rectified linear neurons as a particular case. In this paper, we explain the empirical success of squashing functions by showing that the formulas describing this family follow from natural symmetry requirements.},

The classification employs 100 computed features beside the four observed ones, including morphological, gradients and Gabor wavelet features. The output of the decision ensemble is fed to morphological and structural post-processing, which regularize the shape of the detected tumors and improve the segmentation quality.

However, the image position distribution of plant diseases is very uneven. If we use convolutional neural network for plant disease recognition, there will be insufficient feature response, which will cause recognition errors. Aiming at such problems, we have designed a deep complementary feature classification network. First, the network uses DeepLabv3+ and Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate disease part detection frames in a weakly supervised manner and combines semantic segmentation to extract disease object instances. Then we designed Complementary Feature Part Generation Models. Finally, it uses a bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to perform the classification and recognition of the complementary features described above. We performed experiments on the PlantVillage dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed network recognition accuracy is 99.21\%, which is 4.2\% higher than the baseline model xception-65 used. We also performed experiments on the grape disease data set that we created. The accuracy of the proposed network recognition is 93.46\%, which is 7.2\% higher than the baseline model xception-65. In addition, compared with the better algorithms for plant disease identification in recent years, the accuracy performance has also been improved.},

In this paper, we propose a novel temporal neural network framework that tracks user engagement and activity associated with particular subjects (e.g. CVE IDs) across online platforms. The framework is able to simulate which user will do what activity and at what time. Furthermore, this framework captures groups of users reacting to an event. It also captures responses to an event on a platform and the influence of the event on activity on other platforms over time. The proposed framework aims to predict future user activity related to specific subjects across platforms. The framework also illustrates the importance influence of activities that occur on other platforms when predicting user activity for particular events on a different platform. The learned model can do simulations in a timely manner. We evaluated our user group activity prediction method on the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) related user groups (software vulnerability) using 3 public online social network datasets: Github, Reddit, and Twitter. Groups of users who work on a particular CVE ID are identified. Each user group has information on all users&#39; activities related to a CVE ID. The 3 datasets from Github, Reddit, and Twitter contain more than 490,000 cross platform activities related to over 20,000 user groups (CVE IDs) from more than 50,000 users. Compared to the proposed baseline, our simulation method is better in both predictions of total activity volume over time and activity associated with an individual CVE ID.},

  abstract  = {Speech is converted to digital signals using speech coding for efficient transmission. However, this often lowers the quality and bandwidth of speech. This paper explores the application of convolutional neural networks for Artificial Bandwidth Expansion (ABE) and speech enhancement on coded speech, particularly Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) used in 2G cellular phone calls. In this paper, we introduce AMRConvNet: a convolutional neural network that performs ABE and speech enhancement on speech encoded with AMR. The model operates directly on the time-domain for both input and output speech but optimizes using combined time-domain reconstruction loss and frequency-domain perceptual loss. AMRConvNet resulted in an average improvement of 0.425 Mean Opinion Score - Listening Quality Objective (MOS-LQO) points for AMR bitrate of 4.75k, and 0.073 MOS-LQO points for AMR bitrate of 12.2k. AMRConvNet also showed robustness in AMR bitrate inputs. Finally, an ablation test showed that our combined time-domain and frequency-domain loss leads to slightly higher MOS-LQO and faster training convergence than using either loss alone.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we proposed a new clothing brand prediction method which is rooted on a dense-block based deep convolutional neural network for brand logo detection and recognition. To learn convolutional neural networks deeper and more accurately, we adopted dense blocks into deep convolutional neural networks to make connections between layers shorter. In this work, we propose several dense-block based designs to improve clothing brand logo detection and recognition accuracies. We also constructed a new large-scale clothing brand and price (CBP) dataset and its subset, called clothing brand logo (CBL) dataset with the brand attribute and logo information to carry out this task. To lower proposed framework complexity, two pixel search steps for the bounding box movement are implemented in the training procedure. In the experiment, we show our search reduced model can outperform several state-of-the-art methods and attain good performance.},

  abstract  = {Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly evolved and demonstrated outstanding performance, their uninterpretable nature is still considered to be a major problem. In this study, we take a closer look at CNN interpretability and propose a new method called Evolutionary Generative Contribution Mappings (EGCM). In EGCM, CNN models incorporate both a classification mechanism and an interpreting mechanism in an end-to-end training process. Specifically, the network generates the class contribution maps, which indicate the discriminative regions for the model to identify a specific class. Additionally, these maps can be directly used for classification tasks; all that is needed is a global average pooling and a softmax function. The network is represented by a directed acyclic graph and optimized using a genetic algorithm. Architecture search enables EGCM to deliver reasonable classification performance while maintaining high interpretability. We apply the EGCM framework on several datasets and empirically demonstrate that the EGCM not only achieves excellent classification performance but also maintains high interpretability.},

Revealing the complex influence mechanisms between IET and its influence factors is necessary for effectively analyzing, evaluating and improving the performance of IET. A three stages machine learning method including learning, verification and generalization based on dominance-based rough set approach is presented to extract the influential relationships between the IET and its contextual influence factors. The proposed method excavates and learns the historical panel data of China&#39;s 30 provinces, and the cross-validation is conducted to produce a set of highly credible &quot;If-Then&quot; decision rules to generalize the synergistic influential relationships and intensities in IET. The results show that China&#39;s investment strength, resource allocation efficiency, command controlled and economic incentive environmental regulations are determinants to enhance the performance of IET, which helps to select the optimal transformation patterns by taking the historical development characteristics as lessons.},

The facial expressions synthesis has a wide range of applications in human-computer interaction and virtual reality. In recent years, image synthesis base on generative adversarial networks(GANs) is developing rapidly. In the image-to-image translation work, we propose a new facial expression generation method base on the idea of conditional GANs and realize the optimization of the generated results. The main work of this paper includes: Editable facial lines map is utilized as a constraint, combining with neutral face images as inputs of generator, so that a variety of facial expression images can be generated by editing the constraints. Correntropy loss of feature matching is added, which is used to measure the intermediate representation between the real images and the generated images by improving the adversarial loss. Consequently, the generated facial expressions can be more realistic. Base on the ideas above, the proposed method needs only one generator to generate different realistic facial images with various expressions.},

Although it is possible to learn an effective representation in supervised settings, there are problems requiring enormous effort focused in data collection and labeling, and the difficulty in labeling continuously changing events like facial expressions is significant. In this paper, we propose a method for separating the latent representation of facial images into identity factors and facial expression factors using the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. In our method, we only use subject labels to control training, and we do not use information attached to facial expressions like emotional labels. The separation between extracted facial expression factors and identity features is very useful for controlling image generation and for classifying facial expressions. Using this latent representation, we also suggest a new approach for facial expression recognition with a simple clustering method, which is based on Euclidean distance. Our classification method dramatically reduces the cost of labeling. The experimental results show that our method successfully disentangles the representation of facial images and separates the latent representation into identity and facial expression factors. Moreover, in a facial expression recognition task, our approach shows advantages over the baseline method without supervision.},

This competence is calculated using the performance of the regressors in a local region of the feature space around the query pattern that is called the region of competence. Nonetheless, defining the correct measure to compute the degree of competence of the regressors is a hard task. In this work, we propose a new technique to DRS that selects the best competence measure for a given dataset. To validate our technique, we perform a set of comprehensive experiments on 15 regression datasets. The proposed technique can operate in three different fashions: (i) selection of the most competent regressor; (ii) combination of all regressors from the ensemble; and (iii) selection of a subset composed of the most competent ones and combine them. The proposals are compared against DRS algorithms, individual regressors, and static systems that use the Mean and the Median as a fusion strategy. The results show that the proposed technique, which chooses a different competence measure per task, outperforms literature techniques.},

  abstract  = {A bug tracking system continuously monitors the status of a software environment, like an Operating System (OS) or a user application. Whenever it detects an anomaly situation, it generates a bug report and sends it to the software developer or maintenance center. However, the newly reported bug can be an already existing issue that was reported earlier and may have a solution in the master report repository. This condition brings an avalanche of duplicate bug reports, posing a big challenge to the software development life cycle. Thus, early detection of duplicate bug reports has become an extremely important task in the software industry. To address this issue, this work proposes a double-tier approach using clustering and classification, whereby it exploits Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic-based clustering, multimodal text representation using Word2Vec (W2V), FastText (FT) and Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), and a unified text similarity measure using Cosine and Euclidean metrics. The proposed model is tested on the Eclipse dataset consisting over 80,000 bug reports, which is the amalgamation of both master and duplicate reports. This work considers only the description of the reports for detecting duplicates. The experimental results show that the proposed two-tier model achieves a recall rate of 67\% for Top-N recommendations with 3 times faster computation than the conventional one-on-one classification model.},

The second model is to use empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose the original data, then use the combination forecasting model to predict the subsequences, and finally summarize the prediction results. The third model is to combine the advantages of the first and second models. First, EMD is used to decompose the original sequence. Then, the first model is used to predict each subsequence.

While people enjoy the news and anecdotes on Twitter, there are also lots of rumors, which have a negative impact on users and can compromise social order. Among these rumors, many of them are written in Cantonese. At present, the research of English rumor detection is relatively comprehensive, but Cantonese rumors are rarely studied, which brings great challenges to the detection of Cantonese rumors on Twitter. Firstly, there is no available benchmark dataset of Cantonese rumors. Secondly, it is difficult to completely extract the features of rumors. Thirdly, the classical detection approaches are not effective in detecting Cantonese rumors. In this paper, we collected and annotated Cantonese rumors on Twitter and obtained a relatively complete Cantonese rumor dataset. Next, 27 statistical features, involving four categories (user, content, propagation, and comment-based), are extracted to distinguish rumors and non-rumors in Cantonese. Seven of these features are newly proposed in this paper. Then, a novel deep learning model called BLA (namely BERT-based Bi-LSTM network with Attention mechanism) is built for Cantonese rumors detection on Twitter. BLA takes advantage of both statistical and semantic features to effectively detect Cantonese rumors. The experimental results show that the BLA model outperforms other detection models in Cantonese rumor detection.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest that it is necessary to distinguish the two aspects of spatial correlations and propose the two types of spatial graphs, named as geographic graph and semantic graph. Then two novel stereo convolutions with irregular acceptive fields are proposed. The geographic-semantic-temporal contexts are dynamically jointly captured through performing the proposed convolutions on graph sequences. We propose a geographic-semantic-temporal graph convolutional network (GST-GCN) model that combines our graph convolutions and GRU units hierarchically in a unified end-to-end network.

In this paper a deep bayesian ensembling framework is proposed for automatic detection of COVID-19 cases using the chest CT scans. Data augmentation is applied to increase the size and quality of training data available. Transfer learning is utilized to extract informative features. The extracted features are used to train the three different bayesian classifiers. The uncertainty of the neural network predictions is estimated by anchored, unconstrained and regularized bayesian ensembling methods. The reliability of predictions is then delineated. The epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties are estimated and different bayesian classifiers are compared from different perspectives. We use a small dataset containing only 275 CT images of positive COVID-19 cases. The results sounds promising and they can be improved in the future, as the performance of deep neural networks is reliant to big datasets. Prediction accuracy and predictive uncertainty estimates for unseen chest CT images indicate that the deep bayesian ensembling is a promising framework for COVID-19 detection.},

Second, pre-trained convolution filters are obtained by K-means based on image patches from TS facial images, which are used in a convolutional neural network (CNN); then, multiple recursive neural networks are applied to process the feature maps from the CNN to generate image features. Finally, with the extracted features, support vector machine is trained to classify TS facial images.

This problem has been known to be a challenging one on the account of the complex composition of breast tissue and its extensive inter-subject variability. To address this problem, this paper introduces a new approach to whole-breast segmentation which, as opposed to many existing solutions, can operate in the absence of any prior information on the patient-specific breast anatomy. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of Dijkstra&#39;s procedure which allows accurately tracking the boundary between the pectoralis muscle and breast tissue as well as between the breast and its background. The performance of the proposed method has been tested on in vivo MRI volumes and quantified in terms of several performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate consistent and stable performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of its accuracy and robustness to imaging artefacts.},

  abstract  = {3D ultrasound imaging shows great promise for scoliosis diagnosis thanks to its low-costing, radiation-free and real-time characteristics. The key to accessing scoliosis by ultrasound imaging is to accurately segment the bone area and measure the scoliosis degree based on the symmetry of the bone features. The ultrasound images tend to contain many speckles and regular occlusion noise which is difficult, tedious and time-consuming for experts to find out the bony feature. In this paper, we propose a robust bone feature segmentation method based on the U-net structure for ultrasound spine Volume Projection Imaging (VPI) images. The proposed segmentation method introduces a total variance loss to reduce the sensitivity of the model to small-scale and regular occlusion noise. The proposed approach improves 2.3\% of Dice score and 1\% of AUC score as compared with the u-net model and shows high robustness to speckle and regular occlusion noise.},

  abstract  = {Automatic segmentation of retinal vessels is an important step in fundoscopic image analysis. Recently, convolutional-neural-network-based methods have been widely explored in this vision task. However, the local fixed receptive field makes network unable to collect global information and adapt to scale variation of retinal vessels. In this paper, we propose a novel RNA-Net which can capture nonlocal context dependencies across the inputs and extract multi-scale features for segmentation task. Firstly, we build a Residual Nonlocal Attention (RNA) Module, which can guide the network to pay more attention to task-related regions of the whole feature map. Secondly, to better capture the morphological characteristics of natural blood vessels, Pyramid Pooling Module (PPM) is added to capture features at multiple scales. Experimental results on two public datasets DRIVE and STARE clearly demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract  = {In the last decades, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have demonstrated strong search capabilities in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). To improve the search performance of EAs, as problems seldom exist in isolation, transferring knowledge from related problems have attracted considerable attentions in recent years. In this paper, we present a preliminary study to enhance existing evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) by transferring knowledge from the process of solving the single objectives involved in a given MOP of interest. As the single objectives are the objectives of the MOP, they naturally share great similarity with the given MOP, which thus could yield useful traits for enhancing the problem-solving of the MOP. To the best of our knowledge, this work severs as the first attempt to improve evolutionary multi-objective optimization via transferring knowledge from single objective problems. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, empirical studies using a popular MOEA, i.e., NSGAII, on commonly used multi-objective benchmarks are conducted. The obtained results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of both convergence speed and solution quality.},

  abstract  = {Many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) are multi-objective problems that have four or more objectives. MaOPs face significant challenges because of search inefficiency, computational cost, decision making, and visualization. Most MaOP systems use variants of non-dominated sorting (Pareto ranking). However, Pareto dominance is ineffective when the number of objectives exceeds four. In this research, we explore different strategies for solving MaOPs. We use Hornby&#39;s Age-Layered Population Structure (ALPS) evolutionary algorithm in order to mitigate premature convergence and improve results. Instead of Pareto ranking, we use the many-objective evaluation strategy called sum of ranks (SR). SR is more appropriate than Pareto dominance for problems that require a majority of objectives to be optimized. We introduce and compare different objective reduction methods for ALPS, including random and correlated objective reduction. Because hypervolume and IGD performance measurements are not necessarily suitable to SR strategies, we introduce a new minimum distance measurement. Results show that different strategies are suitable for different problems, and depend strongly on the performance measure being used. Random objective reduction was the least effective strategy, while correlated reduction was more successful. The research shows that the ALPS framework with objective reduction is a promising framework for MaOPs.},

  abstract  = {Classical benchmark problems utilize multiple transformation techniques to increase optimization difficulty, e.g., shift for anti centering effect and rotation for anti dimension sensitivity. Despite testing the transformation invariance, however, such operations do not really change the landscape&#39;s &quot;shape&quot;, but rather than change the &quot;view point&quot;. For instance, after rotated, ill conditional problems are turned around in terms of orientation but still keep proportional components, which, to some extent, does not create much obstacle in optimization. In this paper, inspired from image processing, we investigate a novel graphic conformal mapping transformation on benchmark problems to deform the function shape. The bending operation does not alter the function basic properties, e.g., a unimodal function can almost maintain its unimodality after bent, but can modify the shape of interested area in the search space. Experiments indicate the same optimizer spends more search budget and encounter more failures on the conformal bent functions than the rotated version. Several parameters of the proposed function are also analyzed to reveal performance sensitivity of the evolutionary algorithms.},

This paper designs a new and efficient selection operator for GA base on the idea of promotion competition. This operator simulates the rule and process of promotion competition to protect the well perform chromosomes and eliminates poor chromosomes. This is a fundamental but significant research issue in GA that may be adopted into any existing GA variants to replace any other selection operators. We design four types of experiments to comprehensively verify the behavior of the proposed promotion selection operator, by comparing it with five other existing and commonly used selection operators. The results show that promotion selection operator has a general good performance in enhancing GA in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and running time.},

It is reported that a decomposition-based evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (i.e., MOEA/D-STAT) has good diversity performance when coping with feature selection. However, feature selection is also a time-consuming problem considering a large dataset it involves. The computation time can be easily reduced by introducing the parallelization into MOEA/D-STAT, thanks to the decomposition idea of MOEA/D. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to implement the parallelization of MOEA/D-STAT for feature selection. In this paper, we consider both master-slave models and island models, which are two different approaches of parallelization. In the master-slave models, different offspring assignment mechanisms are considered. In the island models, different island size specification mechanisms are examined. Our experimental results show that the master-slave models can achieve higher speedup and better performance than the island models.},

In this study, the impact of spatial abilities and visuospatial memory on MI-BCI performance is investigated. Fifty-four novice users participated in a MI-BCI task and two cognitive tests. The impact of spatial abilities and visuospatial memory on BCI task error rate in three feedback sessions was measured. Our results showed that spatial abilities, as assessed by the Mental Rotation Test, were not related to MI-BCI performance, however visuospatial memory, assessed by the design organization test, was higher in high aptitude users.

This scenario would be desirable for potential users such as patients with motor disabilities, however, there are still several limitations such as long calibration times and overall performance. Different approaches to improve these systems explore diverse linear electroencephalography (EEG) features in order to describe cognitive states. Alternatively, the present study proposes the use of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), which provides indices about the dynamical behaviour of non-linear systems. We evaluated the accuracy of continuous detection of mental calculation and idle state using RQA features from EEG recordings. Among the different classification methods that were tested, random forest (RF) classifier resulted in the best performance. From 35 selected RQA features, 12 healthy subjects achieved mean accuracy of 0.924 ±0.048, whereas with 150 selected features mean accuracy was 0.977 ±0.020. These results suggest that RQA features are adequate for continuous task episode detection in asynchronous BCI. However, a restriction in the number of these features, conceived for improving computational costs and time, does impact detection performance.},

A c-VEP BCI application presents flickering target objects (e. g. letters of a keyboard) coded with different time-lags of a code pattern. Template matching methods are used to identify the target of interest. Unfortunately, this approach requires a training session, in which several trials of EEG data are recorded and analysed. Long training sessions are necessary to ensure good signal-to-noise ratios. For the user, these training sessions may be tedious. Especially for patients, who may use the system on a daily basis e. g. for communication, alternative approaches are desirable. This paper investigates the feasibility of session-to-session transfer of EEG templates for c-VEP BCIs, where templates recorded in a previous session are used, so the application could be used instantly. Ten healthy participants went through training and copy-spelling tasks in two experimental sessions (they were scheduled two weeks apart). In the second session, the templates recorded in the first session were used. Eight participants yielded good results with the session-to-session transfer approach with accuracies of 97.1\% and information transfer rates of 85.7 bit/min on average. For these participants, the results were not significantly different from the values achieved using the standard approach (training in the same session). For two participants, however, the system was not controllable with the priorly recorded templates. The results demonstrate that for most users daily recalibration is not required.},

  abstract  = {The accurate measurement of brain activity by Brain-Machine-Interfaces (BMI) and closed-loop Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS) is one of the most important steps in communicating between the brain and subsequent processing blocks. In conventional chest-mounted systems, frequently used in DBS, a significant amount of artifact can be induced in the sensing interface, often as a common-mode signal applied between the case and the sensing electrodes. Attenuating this common-mode signal can be a serious challenge in these systems due to finite common-mode-rejection-ratio (CMRR) capability in the interface. Emerging BMI and DBS devices are being developed which can mount on the skull. Mounting the system on the cranial region can potentially suppress these induced physiological signals by limiting the artifact amplitude. In this study, we model the effect of artifacts by focusing on cardiac activity, using a current- source dipole model in a torso-shaped volume conductor. Performing finite element simulation with the different DBS architectures, we estimate the ECG common mode artifacts for several device architectures. Using this model helps define the overall requirements for the total system CMRR to maintain resolution of brain activity. The results of the simulations estimate that the cardiac artifacts for skull-mounted systems will have a significantly lower effect than non-cranial systems that include the pectoral region. It is expected that with a pectoral mounted device, a minimum of 60-80 dB CMRR is required to suppress the ECG artifact, depending on device placement relative to the cardiac dipole, while in cranially mounted devices, a 0 dB CMRR is sufficient, in the worst-case scenario. In addition, the model suggests existing commercial devices could optimize performance with a right-hand side placement. The methods used for estimating cardiac artifacts can be extended to other sources such as motion/muscle sources. The susceptibility of the device to artifacts has significant implications for the practical translation of closed-loop DBS and BMI, including the choice of biomarkers, the system design requirements, and the surgical placement of the device relative to artifact sources.},

Despite significant progress has been made in decoding emotion using supervised machine-learning methods, few studies applied data-driven, unsupervised approaches to explore the underlying EEG dynamics during an emotion experiment and examine how such dynamics correlate with subjective reports of emotion. This study employs the adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA), an unsupervised approach, to EEG data from the DEAP dataset where 32 subjects watched emotional videos. Empirical results showed that AMICA could learn distinct models that separated EEG date collected in the emotion experiment. The identified changes in EEG patterns were weakly-correlated with the four reported emotion scales, indicating the underlying EEG dynamics partially reflected the emotional activities as well as the emotion-irrelevant brain dynamics. Further, the correlations between EEG dynamics and individuals&#39; subjective emotional ratings were significantly higher than those between the EEG and the average ratings from online raters. Finally, building an emotion-decoding model based on the EEG dynamics revealed a significantly better classification performance for valence ratings compared to arousal. This study demonstrated the use of AMICA in characterizing the EEG dynamics in emotion experiments and provided insight into the relationship between EEG and the reported emotional experiences. The unsupervised learning approach can be applied to studying emotion and other confounding factors such as emotion irrelevant EEG artifacts, thereby improving the performance of emotion decoding for EEG-based affective computing.},

  abstract  = {Exam scheduling is a complex problem. Traditional ways are using either graph-based heuristic algorithms or mixed linear programming (MLP) plus human intelligence.

With RBC E-CARGO, and GRA + , human schedulers save a lot of effort to create symbols and the relationships among the components. This paper formalizes the problem of exam scheduling as an extended GRA with Conflicting Agents on Roles (GRACAR) problem, proposes practical solutions by using a Linear Programming (LP) solver, i.e., the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Package (CPLEX).

The UGVs are used as mobile actuators and scattered in a large area. To achieve multi-UGV communication and collaboration, the UAV serves as a messenger to fly all UGVs to transmit information. The path planning of messenger UAV is formulated as a Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (DDTSPN). A novel memetic algorithm is proposed to find the shortest route enabling the UAV to fly over all requested UGVs. In the memetic algorithm, the combination of genetic algorithm and local search is employed to find a high-quality solution in a reasonable time, and a gradient-based repair strategy is used to repair the individuals violating dynamic constraints. The calculation results on both small and large instances show that the proposed method can generate high-quality solutions as compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

However, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) enabled train positioning is susceptible to the threat from radio frequency interference, which may lead to risks to the safe and efficient train operation. It is of great necessity to evaluate the influence of GNSS jamming in developing specific anti-attack solutions in the railway applications. In this paper, tests of GNSS jamming scenarios are carried out through a jamming injection platform, with which the different signals that can be utilized in jamming are investigated, including (non-)coherent continuous wave, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and bandwidth limited noise. The trackmap database is involved to evaluate the precision level of localization under jamming-injected conditions. The result analysis in terms of the cross-track error illustrates the degradation of the receiver under the threats from interferences, although there are different levels and characteristics among the involved jamming signals.},

  abstract  = {The problem of an individual who wants to plan a long route in an electric vehicle where charging decisions are needed can be modeled as an instance of the Fixed Route Electric Vehicle Charging Problem (FRVCP). We developed a mixed-integer programming model that optimally solves a new variant of the FRVCP, the FRVCP with nonlinear energy management (FRVCP-NLEM). It considers charging times as a nonlinear function and allows to decide at which speed to drive on each segment of the route while considering the non-linearity of energy consumption functions. The non-linearity of all functions has been solved using multiple linear approximations. The proposed model is tested using an electric vehicle trip planner called PlaniCharge that uses realistic energy consumption and charging functions that take into account external factors such as temperature and road topology. The model is tested under different road types such as urban or highway routes. The proposed model is able to optimally solve most test instances within seconds. Results show that varying the vehicle speed is an important factor to consider under low temperatures and for long-range routes as it can reduce total route duration. Some routes cannot be completed at maximum speed and require varying driving speed on segment to be able to reach the destination.},

If robot-to-robot measurements are not available, the only way to merge the maps is to find and match the overlapping area between maps. But, if the overlapping area is insufficient, the performance of the existing map merging methods degenerates. This paper proposes a new map merging algorithm using the Radon transform, which can be successfully conducted with relatively insufficient overlapping areas. Because the Radon transform can extract abundant geometric information of a map according to rotation and translation, the map transformation matrix can be accurately computed by matching the sinograms producted by the Radon transform. Experiments with a public dataset and a real multi-robot system showed that our algorithm using sinograms can accurately merge the maps, and the required overlapping area is smaller than other map merging methods with similar computation time.},

However, there exist great challenges in the transition maneuvers due to model un-certainties and external disturbances. Aimed at these problems, a robust transition controller based on incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) is developed for a tail-sitter UAV in this paper. Different from existing works, the controller mainly concerns the transition pitch angle and altitude, because the altitude is more intuitive then flight speed in indicating whether a transition is successful or not. The robustness of the developed transition controller is analyzed with consideration of error terms exist in the closed-loop system, which were generally omitted in existing INDI flight control works. With some reasonable assumptions, it is proven that the tracking errors can converge into a specified neighbourhood of the origin in a finite time by choosing appropriate controller parameters. Numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of the controller in handling model uncertainties and external disturbances.},

  abstract  = {In real-world environments, robotic task planning is expected to handle both partial observability and unexpected dynamics of the environment. A robust plan for the task requires the robot’s observation actions to concurrently run with the task actions, to observe and adapt to environmental changes. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) has been widely applied for planning under partially observable domains. For realistic robotic tasks, however, the POMDP model and planning algorithm are quite restrictive and unrealistic. One limitation is that task actions are modelled as atomic entities that only have endpoint effects, with no conditions specified at arbitrary points during task action execution. Also, the observation is obtained only after each task action execution, with no intermediate observations and decision-making during task action execution. To mitigate the limitations of POMDP planning, this paper first proposes an Adjoint Action Model (AAM) that explicitly defines the continuous interaction between robot’s observation and task actions. Then we extend the POMDP task action model with intermediate invariant conditions which specifies the runtime properties of action execution. Finally, we propose the AAM-extended POMDP planning approach which handles observation action planning and task replanning for task action execution. We experimentally demonstrate that the plan from our proposed approach is more effective and robust to cope with the environment dynamics, comparing with the standard POMDP planning approach.},

The SMA is driven by heating and cooling processing with the cur-rent flowing. For the SMA, cooling is a process for recovering to original length which consumes time. In order to decrease the recovering time and making the surface deformable, a sponge sheet is applied in the mechanism. We used the cotton thread to sew the SMA into the sponge to manufacture the mechanism. The DSM contains a multi-triangle structure, and each triangle works as an individual actuation unit. By applying this structure and special sewing technique, the sponge sheet can be deformed in a vertical direction when the SMA contracted. While, when the current is turned off, the SMA can be stretched to the original length by the pushing force generated by the sponge. Therefore, a deformable surface mechanism with a rapid response can be achieved. We simulated the changing of uni-Deformable Surface Mechanism (uniDSM), and the experiments were followed to compare with the analyzed results. Additionally, different objects were examined on the DSM to test the conveyance ability.},

  abstract  = {Localization and mapping are essential tasks in mobile robotics. A purely odometry-based pose estimation accumulates errors caused by factors such as unequal wheel-diameters or wheel-slippage and is, therefore, inaccurate. The resulting error can be corrected by recognizing previously observed places and constraining the robots&#39; relative poses. A common challenge of such place recognition methods arises from the incorrect association of different places, which can corrupt the resulting pose correction and, consequently, any map update. Therefore, we propose a novel place recognition method that enables the selection of a correct place recognition hypothesis from a set of possible matches.In this work, we make use of the fact that multiple robots&#39; trajectories run parallel in many scenarios, like in warehouse corridors or on public roads. In such situations, place recognition can be regarded as a sequential task along the robots&#39; trajectories. We study the problem of repetitive, periodic and indistinguishable landmarks for place recognition on regularly-spaced guideposts on German rural roads. By interpreting place recognition hypotheses as nodes of a k-partite graph, we introduce our novel selection method, the Hierarchic Single Cluster Graph Partitioning, that enables the robust selection of the correct hypotheses by finding the optimal path within the graph. The selected place recognition information is used to build a map incorporating multiple observations acquired from multiple vehicles.},

First, a new FD criterion for the detection of multiple multiplicative actuator faults is proposed by testing consistency between the state estimation errors and the healthy state estimation error sets on-line. Then, a guaranteed FD condition is established based on set-separation of healthy and faulty invariant sets of state estimation error. Moreover, the generalized minimum detectable fault (MDF) for multiple actuator faults is defined and computed in order to characterize the performance of the two FD criteria. Finally, a proof is provided to compare the conservatism of the FD criterion using state estimation errors with the classical one based on residuals. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.},

  abstract  = {The semiconductor manufacturing industry adopts multi-cluster tools as wafer fabrication equipment. If one of process modules fails, a multi-cluster tool cannot follow the normal schedule to complete the process recipe of work-in-process wafers and must empty these wafers by a closing down phase. It is economically paramount to shorten the close-down process with a process module failure (FCDP) and make no loss of wafers. However, due to the wafer residency time constraints, it is rather difficult to respond to a module failure and find a corresponding optimal schedule. By assuming no parallel modules at a step, this work studies this important issue for multi-cluster tools. For process-dominant multi-cluster tools whose optimal steady state schedule is known, we analyze the task sequences to avoid deadlock at the shared buffer modules. Algorithms are proposed to synthesize the proper sequences for robots in case of a process module failure, then, a nonlinear program model is derived to find an optimal schedule for the corresponding close-down process or decide no feasible solutions. An example is present to show the application of our proposed method.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a continuous dynamic average consensus (DAC) algorithm for a group of agents to estimate the average of their time-varying reference signals cooperatively. We propose a consensus algorithm that is robust to agents joining and leaving the network, at the same time, avoid the chattering phenomena and guarantee zero steady-state consensus error. Our algorithm is an edge-based protocol with smooth functions in its internal structure to avoid the chattering effect. Furthermore, each agent can only perform local computations and can only communicate with its local neighbors. For a balanced and strongly connected underlying communication graph, we provide the convergence analysis to determine the consensus design parameters that guarantee the estimate of the average to asymptotically converge to the average of the time-varying reference signals. We provide simulation results to validate the proposed consensus algorithm and perform a performance comparison of the proposed algorithm to existing algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances in technology have increased the capability of mobile platforms while decreasing the cost. It has become more feasible to deploy a team of agents to cooperatively accomplish an objective. While multi-agent systems provide advantages, including lower cost and robustness to failure, there is a need for additional study of principles for the design and test of these decentralized systems. The main contribution of this paper is a novel estimation and path planning algorithm that can be used for improved estimation of uncertain environments. The estimation algorithm utilizes Bayesian fusion, measurement sharing on a graph, and belief consensus. One new component of this approach is the reward-based path planning algorithm that incentivizes agents to collect the best local information as well as improve coverage of the environment. When agents plan paths to collect more valuable information, the estimation error is reduced. This approach is studied for the application of estimating the state of a forest fire but can be applied in many domains. Simulations were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm compared to other approaches.},

  abstract  = {Multiagent pursuit-evasion problems have been widely investigated in a number of related areas. In many situations, the pursuers have energy limitation when pursuing the evader, and the pursuers moving at higher speeds consume energy more quickly. The energy limitation creates two problems for the pursuers. First, constantly moving at the maximum speed is not optimal because the energy will be exhausted quickly. Therefore, it is necessary to control the speed to achieve the optimal energy consumption, but previous studies have not presented a suitable speed-control algorithm. Second, a fraction of pursuers with insufficient energy may fail to complete the sub-tasks, and the evader can vary the escape strategy by considering the energy limitation of the pursuers. Therefore, the pursuers with sufficient energy need to help the pursuers with insufficient energy and address the variety of the evader&#39;s escape strategy. The existing pursuing strategies are not self-adaptable to satisfy this requirement. In this paper, we present a pursuing strategy consisting of both a speed-control algorithm and a path planning algorithm as sub-algorithms. Additionally, we integrate the subalgorithms into a self-adaptable cooperation strategy based on simulated annealing, which makes the pursuers adaptably help each other and is adaptable to the variety of escape strategies. The experimental results show that our strategy leads to higher capture success ratios than previous strategies when the energy of pursuers is limited. The experimental data also show that our strategy is more adaptable to the variety of the pursuers&#39; maximum speed and the variety of the evader&#39;s escape strategies.},

Previous approaches assume that robots&#39; motion is deterministic once their paths have been planned, which is however not realistic because random interferences such as noise, friction and inaccurate control input in real-life system could disturb the robot motion, leading to a stochastic behavior. In this paper, we take this stochastic behavior into account when planning the path for a heterogeneous multi-robot system. We assume that the motion time of a robot from a location to another can be modeled as a probability distribution. Every robot has its own probability distribution of motion time between any two neighbor locations. We develop a conflict-detection scheme for this model and propose using the conflict-based search algorithm via probability calculation to find the optimal path that minimizes the entire motion time. We also simplify this conflict detection such that our proposed approach is applicable online for a large-scale system. Experimental results demonstrate the high effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

Unsupervised clustering of brain data relative to respective neurons is important to understand single cell and networks dynamics. A large number of clustering techniques exist in the literature; however, the dependency of these clustering algorithms on the selection of appropriate parameters, such as, bandwidth or threshold window size is critical. Iterative methods are generally employed to estimate optimal parameters, however, significant computational time and associated large number of iterations make the clustering inefficient to implement. To address this issue, we introduce a robust Optimal Parameter Estimation (OPE) Algorithm that can estimate the optimized parameters in a fast and efficient way. The performance of the OPE algorithm is tested on MeanShift and DBSCAN clustering algorithms. Three different extracellular recorded datasets including two simulated and one single human cell, as well as two feature sets including PCA and Haar Wavelets are used for validation purposes.},

Standard automated perimetry is the gold standard for assessing glaucoma; however, the examination is subjective, where responses can fluctuate each time the test is performed, significantly confounding the test&#39;s interpretation. In this study, we present our approach that aims to provide a rapid point-of-care diagnostics for glaucoma patients by eliminating the cognitive aspect in existing visual field assessment. Unlike existing methods that mostly report the foveal target detection&#39;s accuracy, we employed a multi-task learning architecture that efficiently captures signals simultaneously from the fovea and the neighboring targets in the peripheral vision, generating a visual response map. Furthermore, we designed a multi-task learning module that learns multiple tasks in parallel efficiently. We evaluated our model classification on a 40-classes dataset, with yields 92\% and 95\% in accuracy and F1 score respectively. Our model is able to perform on a calibration-free user-independent scenario, which is desirable for clinical diagnostics.

  abstract  = {The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) are both actively involved in the reward guided learning. However, how the information is conveyed in spike trains between these two regions has not been investigated. Spike prediction models have been developed to predict the spike trains between two cortical areas, for example, CA3 to CA1 in hippocampus, as well as premotor to M1. In this paper, we investigate the co-activation between mPFC and M1 by comparing three spike prediction models with different nonlinear capacity. Our data was collected from the mPFC and M1 of a rat when it was learning a two-lever discrimination task. The mPFC spike trains are served as the input of models and M1 spike trains as the desired output. We compare the spike prediction performances of three models, including generalized linear model (GLM), second order GLM, and staged point-process model. Our results show that all three model outputs have similar discrete-time rescaling Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results and similar correlation coefficient (0.42 on average across neurons). The paired t-tests across neurons also show the lack of significant difference. The preliminary results indicate possible linear co-activation between the M1 and mPFC during the learning stage.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we propose an approach to improve detection of event related potential (ERP) component using hidden process model, which enables estimating the trial-to-trial variability of ERP latency to overcome limitation of the conventional averaging method for extracting ERP components. By using HPM, which is a generative model for estimating underlying process that has unknown onset timing, we can estimate responses of assumed processes underlying cognitive functions and the probability distribution of the onset timing of each process. We applied HPM to ERP data obtained during the oddball task and distinguished ERPs induced by target or nontarget stimuli. We designed 2-process and 3-process HPMs and estimated the responses of each process in these HPMs. Then, we compared these responses with ERP waveforms obtained by conventional averaging. As a result, the waveforms of the estimated response from each model resembled that of averaged ERP while the peak amplitude was higher in estimated responses than in averaged ERP. In addition, the difference of the area under curve between target and nontarget condition was clearer in estimated responses than in averaged ERP. This suggests that HPM might be able to overcome the latency variability of ERP components to estimate more exact components, which will enhance differentiating ERP components between conditions in an ERP study.},

  abstract  = {We propose a method to automatically classify eye-blink types using the eye-blink waveform integral value. The method is assumed to apply to an input interface using eye and It performs automatic detection of intentional blinks. Attempts to treat eye gestures and blinks as input channels in addition to conventional gaze input has studied due to the spread of gaze tracking and gaze input interfaces recently. However, classifying the eye-blink type as intentional or spontaneous using existing eye-blink classification methods is difficult because eye-blinks are highly individual motions that are significantly influenced by various conditions. Therefore, in this research, we construct a more robust measurement environment, which does not require a strict setting such as fixing the relative distance between the face and the camera even for non-contact measurement. In order to realize this, we defined new feature parameters are defined to correct the individual differences from moving image measuring by Web camera to assume applying on mobile interface. The proposed method performs automatic detection of intentional blinks by automatically determining the threshold of blink types based on the waveform integration value as new feature parameter. We also constructed a blink measurement system to evaluate the proposed method and evaluated the proposed method by experiment. The system splits the interlaced image field into disparate fields for blink measurement with sufficient temporal resolution. It then extracts the waveform feature parameters and automatically classifies the eye-blink types. Experimental results show successful classification of intentional eye-blinks with 86\% average accuracy, thus demonstrated the high accuracy of the proposed method compared to conventional methods based on eye-blink duration.},

Cerebral Palsy is a development disorder that may be predicted by observing the spontaneous kicking patterns of an infant. Early detection and intervention can improve the overall long term outcome through specific physical therapy exercises. Since all infants are unique it may be beneficial to learn child specific stimuli that optimize the quantity of kicking actions. Discovering the stimuli that will encourage a particular infant to perform kicking actions will give healthcare professionals more opportunities to observe and evaluate these actions for possible atypical patterns. We expand on previous work that utilizes computer vision and a robotic baby mobile that detects infant kicking motions and activates stimuli to encourage continued kicking. Based on the observed state-action pairs recorded while an infant interacts with the robotic baby mobile, we develop a Markov Decision Process and calculate an optimal policy to encourage an increased amount of kicking. This method could theoretically be applied to different infants, which would result in varying optimal policies that are specific to each child. In this paper we will briefly describe the robotic system, discuss the resulting Markov Decision Process and optimal policy, and describe future works.},

However, cognitive workload (CW) is still one of the issues that can negatively affect device usability and satisfaction. In order to evaluate CW of prosthetic devices early in the design cycle, it is first necessary to select the most appropriate measures. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: (1) review the CW measurement techniques used in prior EMG-based prosthetic device evaluations; and (2) provide guidelines to select the most appropriate measurement techniques. The findings suggested that cognitive performance models (CPM), subjective measures, task performance measures, and some physiological measures were sensitive in detecting CW differences among prosthetic device configurations and therefore could be useful tools in usability evaluation of these technologies. However, in order to reduce intrusiveness and cost, methods such as subjective workload measures, task performance, and CPM are more beneficial as compared to physiological measurements. Guidelines proposed in this study can be beneficial to select the most appropriate CW measurement techniques in order to improve sensitivity and accuracy and reduce intrusiveness and cost.},

  abstract  = {An increasing frequency of fall accidents associated with demographic aging in Japan has given rise to a need for effective fall prevention methods. Elderly people often use support devices such as canes and walking frames to reduce the risk of falling, however such solutions may be inappropriate for certain environments. Previous research has shown that unsteadiness can be mitigated via light touch contact (LTC) with a force of up to around 1 N with curtains or similar (Jeka, 1994), and the authors also previously proposed a virtual light touch contact (VLTC) approach based on LTC (Shima et al., 2013). VLTC supports standing stability based on a surrounding virtual partition connected to a vibrotactile fingertip stimulator. Here, it is known that the VLTC effect is not achieved via simple constant fingertip stimulation. Thus, vibrotactile stimulation is in VLTC needs to be controlled based on fingertip motion characteristics such as acceleration. However, LTC effect can be achieved via constant contact fingertip with a piece of paper or similar without fingertip movement. Assuming that reaction force from a fixed point fluctuates with body sway or psychological tremors in LTC, the LTC effect may be achievable by reproducing such fluctuations via vibrational stimulation. In this study, the authors proposed a novel VLTC method involving the use of vibration stimulation control to reproduce fluctuations in contact reaction force caused by the individual&#39;s movement based on fingertip acceleration data. Verification of the method indicated the proposed method can reduce body sway and reproduce the LTC effect. This suggests that reduction may be associated with slight improving fingertip positional sense.},

With a wide range of potential users including the elderly and others with mobility challenges, demand for WAE devices is rapidly increasing.Whilst WAE technologies have recently progressed significantly, their mechanical designs do not adequately reflect the complexity of human joint articulations; most notably, the knee, which plays a significant role in human mobility. The human knee joint, a 3-dimensional joint, is often over-simplified during WAE design processes. Typically modelled as a single degree of freedom joint, kinematic and kinetic incompatibilities yield at the user-device interface. This, in turn, restricts the natural motion of the user, causes discomfort, and reduces the efficiency of the device.Polycentric joints are known to reduce the inherent kinematic mismatch between exoskeletons and their users, creating a more comfortable interaction. Researchers have begun to implement polycentric exoskeleton knee joint designs, as they take into account the complexity of the biological joint. Some devices follow a pre-defined path of rotation based on average biological joint geometries, whereas others decouple translations and rotations to allow for passive adjustment to the user.This paper presents a review of current WAEs that incorporate powered polycentric knee joints. Subsequently, a theoretical comparison between conventional single-axis joints, polycentric joints that follow pre-defined paths of rotation, and polycentric joints that allow passive translation is also provided.},

Nevertheless, nodes in the edge often own limited resources and constrained energy capacities. It is impossible to entirely execute tasks in the edge due to their unsatisfied quality of service. Cloud data centers (CDCs) own almost unlimited resources yet they might cause large transmission delay and high resource cost. Consequently, it is highly needed to intelligently offload tasks between CDC and edge. This work proposes a task offloading algorithm for hybrid cloud-edge systems to achieve profit maximization of a system provider with response time bound assurance. It comprehensively investigates CPU, memory and bandwidth limits of nodes in the edge, and constraints of available energy and servers in CDC. These factors are integrated into a single-objective constrained optimization problem, which is solved by a simulated-annealing-based migrating birds optimization algorithm to yield a close-to-optimal offloading policy between CDC and the edge.

In addition, many factors in CDCs, e.g., the wind and solar energy and prices of power grid have spatial differences. It becomes a challenging problem of how to achieve the energy cost minimization for CDCs in such a market. This work applies a G/G/1 queuing system to evaluate the optimization of servers in each CDC. Furthermore, a single-objective constrained optimization problem is given and addressed by a proposed Simulated-annealing-based Bees Algorithm to yield a close-to-optimal solution. Based on it, a Fine-grained Task Scheduling (FTS) algorithm is designed to minimize the energy cost of CDCs by intelligently scheduling heterogeneous tasks among distributed CDCs. In addition, it also determines running speeds of servers and the number of switched-on servers in each CDC while strictly meeting tasks’ delay bounds.

In spite of their numerous benefits, cloud/edge providers face some challenging issues, e.g., inaccurate prediction of large-scale workload and resource usage traces. However, due to the complexity of cloud computing environments, workload and resource usage traces are highly-variable, thus making it difficult for traditional models to predict them accurately. Traditional models fail to deal with nonlinear characteristics and long-term memory dependencies. To solve this problem, this work proposes an integrated prediction method that combines Bi-directional and Grid Long Short-Term Memory network (BG-LSTM) models to predict workload and resource usage traces. In this method, workload and resource usage traces are first smoothed by a Savitzky-Golay filter to eliminate their extreme points and noise interference. Then, an integrated prediction model is established to achieve accurate prediction for highly-variable traces. Using real-world workload and resource usage traces from Google cloud data centers, we have conducted extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and adaptability of BG-LSTM for different traces. The performance results well demonstrate that BG-LSTM achieves better prediction results than some typical prediction methods for highly-variable real-world cloud systems.},

We adapt sequence-to-sequence architecture consisting of two long short-term memory (LSTM) units. One is an LSTM encoder for encoding the previous sequence of human poses, and the other is an LSTM decoder for generating the next sequence of robot poses. The weights of the LSTMs are trained using human-human interaction data such as greeting and handshaking. The trained model is implemented in a humanoid robot, Pepper, to show its feasibility. Experimental results show that the robot can generate gestures appropriate to the situation and recognize subtle differences in user behavior.

Sensors in wearable devices and smartphones are widely used not only because they are low cost but also because they are not invasive to users and are easy to deploy. However, accurately predicting human activities using wearable devices is challenging as the generated data provides only indirect information about the activities being performed. In this study, we propose a self-attention network that processes data from inertial measurement unit sensors of smartphones to classify common human activities. Self-attention networks are able to extract useful information from time-dependent signals by carefully allocating their focus among relevant input features. Our method was tested along several popular human activity recognition algorithms using two datasets, including a new human activity dataset that is publicly released in this study. Our method consistently obtains state-of-the-art results predicting the activities of the tested datasets with an average accuracy of 97\%.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional neural network (CNN) based clothing attribute recognition has been applied in many clothing-related applications, such as recommendation system and clothes retrieval. However, the outperformance of existing recognition approaches is limited on account of the requirement of manual spatial prior information, such as landmarks and bounding box. In this paper, we innovatively transfer existing instance-irrelative knowledge to our proposed method where salient prior information is employed to assist the attribute prediction to avoid such laborsome annotations. Concretely, we first propose a saliency-guided method composed of salient object detection network (SOD-N) and clothing attribute recognition network (CAR-N). SOD-N provides the saliency map as the prior information guiding CAR-N to focus on the valid region. Furthermore, a new learnable fusion module is designed in CAR-N to aggregate the high-level features from the deep salient and clothing features. That can strengthen the ability of CAR-N to represent the correlative clothing attributes, resulting in further improving the final performance. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by the experimental results on clothing- related datasets, which improves among 1\% to 10\% mAP on each attributes category and almost 5\% mean AP.},

But most of them ignore the palm&#39;s angles, which could not satisfy the alignment initialization when the hand has a large in-plane rotation. In this paper, we propose a palms alignment with affine transformation method based on a two-stage convolutional neural network (CNN). The basic idea is to rotate the target palm into the same angle category to avoid the following affine registration has a big matching error at the beginning. At the stage I, the given target palm is classified into two angle categories. At the stage II the upside down palm is firstly rotated 180 degrees, and then inputted into the subsequent feature extraction network, feature matching layer and regression network to achieve the affine alignment. Experimental results have proved the effectiveness of our method.},

Mastering the information of evaporation duct in advance can effectively avoid the electromagnetic wave loss caused by the evaporation duct in the atmospheric environment. In this study, a regression algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to solve the prediction problem of evaporation duct height (EDH). This paper introduces a method of extracting the data of EDH series, splits the data of EDH series by EMD in spectrum and trains several instances of support vector regression machine to complete the prediction of each component. In addition, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and its variants are introduced to solve the parameter optimization problem of SVR. The experimental results demonstrate that the EMD strategy and particle swarm optimization strategy are effective to improve the accuracy of the prediction results.},

Self-Generation of Reward (SGR) solves this by making the agent creates its own reward from the changes in the surrounding, rather than being dependent to the reward produced by the environment. SGR achieved this by perceiving the changes using sensors, similar to how living things perceive the changes in environment in term of stimulus. The input from sensors are evaluated using Universal Sensor Evaluation Index (USEI), before converting it into rewards. Current USEI uses only strength and predictability evaluation, making the evaluation for danger detection inaccurate for certain environment. To create a more accurate evaluation, we proposed that time-based evaluation needs to be included in USEI. The performance for both previous and proposed evaluation index are tested using maze-like environment and Q-learning. Performances for both evaluation index are then compared against one another.},

Credit scoring becomes even a hotter topic in emerging countries, as interest rates and customer behavior swiftly vary, given the economic (in)stability of the country and as fintechs are chasing robust solutions for improved credit scoring solutions. Batch machine learning is often deployed for credit scoring, yet, they are tailored for static scenarios, i.e., they are not prepared to swiftly detect and adapt to changes in customer behavior, thus leading to slow recovery in such scenarios. In this paper, we bring forward an analysis on how batch machine learning can be combined with data stream mining techniques, thus leading to better recognition rates in credit scoring scenarios. We analyze three different real-world datasets from Brazilian financial institutions, whilst keeping their secrecy preserved, and show how batch and stream learning can be combined towards improved credit scoring systems, as well as highlighting relevant gaps that still require attention.},

Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and AD Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) are two prevailing clinical measures designed to evaluate the AD progression. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised Temporal Multitask Matrix Completion (TMMC) framework, which combines a novel transductive multitask feature selection scheme, to simultaneously predict AD progression measured by MMSE and ADAS-Cog, and identify related biomarkers trackable of AD progression. Specifically, by treating the prediction of cognitive scores at each time point as a regression task, we first formulate AD progression problem as a standard Multitask Matrix Completion (MMC) model. Secondly, considering the limited number of samples available in this study, we introduce a transductive feature selection scheme to jointly select the task-shared features for multiple time points and the task-specific features for different time points, and thus alleviate the over-fitting defect caused by Small-Sample-Size issue. Thirdly, aiming at the small change of cognitive scores between successive time points for a patient, we employ a temporal regularization scheme to capture the temporal smoothness of cognitive scores. Furthermore, we design an efficient optimization algorithm based on Alternative Minimization and Difference of Convex Programming techniques to solve the proposed TMMC framework. Finally, the extensive experiments performed on real-world Alzheimer&#39;s disease dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our TMMC framework.},

In this method, it is easy to select appropriate parameter values for effective search, and numerical experiments showed its good search ability. However, the search of the PSO-SDPC is not rotation-invariant because the perturbation terms of the chaotic updating system are added along the coordinate system of the standard basis, and the component-wise selection from the chaotic and the standard PSO updating systems for a particle&#39;s position deeply depends on the coordinate system. Therefore, in this paper, we improve the PSO-SDPC: the perturbations are added along a new coordinate system that is selected according to two best solutions, and all components of each particle&#39;s position are updated by the same system, which is selected from the two updating systems. Moreover, we show that the proposed method can be regarded as the rotation-invariant and keeps a high search ability for many problems through numerical experiments.},

Recent works have focused on investigate dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs), which adds an additional challenge to the search convergence. Some evolutionary strategies have emerged based on the adaptation of consagrated multiobjective algorithms previously proposed for static continuous optimization problems, such as, NSGA-II and MOEA/D. This work presents a novel evolutionary algorithm for dynamic discrete many-objective problems named D-MEANDS. It uses the subjacent search proposed in MEANDS. This algorithm has been successfully investigated in static MOPs and herein we propose some adaptations to be used in DMOPs. A comparative analysis of the new proposal is made using two DMOP evolutionary algorithms from the literature: DNSGA-II and MS-MOEA. A dynamic many-objective version of the knapsack problem (KP), known as dynamic multiobjective knapsack problem (DMKP), was explored. Results using DMKP formulations with 4 and 6 objectives suggest that D-MEANDS is a promising algorithm to deal with DMOPs with many objectives.},

The proposed SAS integrates a high-level shift move to change the wavelength of one lightpath and two low-level ejection chain-based shaking (ECS) procedures to find the best routings for the related lightpaths. This new neighborhood is embedded into a simple iterated local search algorithm, called SAS-ILS, for solving min-RWA.

The problem&#39;s complexity increases proportionally with the number of rooms because the robot must act avoiding obstacles, saving time and energy. The proposed algorithms employ a combination of different search techniques to control a robot during a surveillance task. Our inspiration came from the possibility to use a discrete model employing a cellular automata combined with different heuristics approaches. This improvement of the best path selection was performed due to A* search optimization. Then, for solving collision problems a cellular automata rule is used in the expansion of obstacles, for a collision-free path. Finally, the surveillance task was implemented in a simulator called V-REP using e-Puck architecture. Simulation and experimental results indicate that this surveillance task could be implemented in low-cost architectures in a simplified way. The novelty consists of implementing these techniques in a realistic robot simulator, and also of a systematic analysis of each heuristic function used in contrast to the data structure optimization algorithm proposed herein.},

  abstract  = {In the evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) community, hypervolume (HV) has been frequently used to evaluate the performance of EMO algorithms. The HV is a Pareto compliant indicator which can simultaneously evaluate both the convergence of solutions to the Pareto front and their diversity. No other Pareto compliant indicator is known. In the EMO community, it is implicitly assumed that a set of uniformly distributed solutions over the entire Pareto front including its boundary has the best HV value. This is true for a linear Pareto front of a two-objective problem when a reference point for HV calculation is not too close to the Pareto front. In this paper, we numerically examine this issue for three-objective problems. We perform computational experiments to search for the optimal distribution of a small number of solutions for HV maximization. This is to visually explain the characteristic features of the optimal distribution. Our experimental results clearly show that a set of uniformly distributed solutions is not always optimal for HV maximization. It is also shown that the optimal distribution for HV maximization is often inconsistent with our intuition. For example, a set of ten solutions systematically generated by Das and Dennis method is not optimal.},

For fair comparison, it may be needed to use the best specifications for each algorithm instead of using the same specifications for all algorithms. This is because each algorithm has its best specifications. However, in the evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) field, performance comparison has usually been performed under the same parameter specifications for all algorithms. Especially, the same population size has always been used. In this paper, we discuss this practice from a viewpoint of fair comparison of EMO algorithms. First, we demonstrate that performance comparison results depend on the population size. Next, we explain a new trend of performance comparison where each algorithm is evaluated by selecting a pre-specified number of solutions from the examined solutions (i.e., by selecting a solution subset with a pre-specified size). Then, we discuss the selected subset size specification. Through computational experiments, we show that performance comparison results do not strongly depend on the selected subset size while they depend on the population size.},

  abstract  = {In the evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) community, it is usually assumed that the final population is presented to the decision maker as the result of the execution of an EMO algorithm. Recently, an unbounded external archive was used to evaluate the performance of EMO algorithms in some studies where a pre-specified number of solutions are selected from all the examined non-dominated solutions. In this framework, which is referred to as the solution selection framework, the final population does not have to be a good solution set. Thus, the solution selection framework offers higher flexibility to the design of EMO algorithms than the final population framework. In this paper, we examine the design of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) under these two frameworks. First, we show that the performance of MOEA/D is improved by linearly changing the reference point specification during its execution through computational experiments with various combinations of initial and final specifications. Robust and high performance of the solution selection framework is observed. Then, we examine the use of a genetic algorithm-based offline hyper-heuristic method to find the best configuration of MOEA/D in each framework. Finally, we further discuss solution selection after the execution of an EMO algorithm in the solution selection framework.},

  abstract  = {Finding preferred solutions is important for DMs to take the next step in solving Multi-objective optimisation problems (MOPs). When no specific preferences are available, knee point(s) are typically considered to be the most preferred solutions in multi-criterion decision-making since their smallest trade-off loss at all objectives. Knee point(s), including concave, convex and edge knee point(s), can reflect some geometry characteristics of the given non-dominated solutions because of its unique location. However, most of contemporary research for knee point identification (KPI) is only designed for convex knee point(s). Based on Voronoi diagram which can effectively reflect the distribution of the given set, we propose a method to identify all three types of knee points from a geometry view. In order to validate our method, we compare the performance of our method with other three state of the art approaches on benchmark problems for knee point identification. Experimental results fully show the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed KPI method based on Voronoi diagram (KPIVD) for identifying three types of knee points.},

  abstract  = {In Pareto based multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs and MaOEAs), non-dominated sorting is an important step that divides the set of solutions into different disjoint non-dominated fronts. In the last 20 years, there have been various approaches proposed for non-dominated sorting. Recently, an approach known as Dominance Degree Approach for Non-Dominated Sorting (DDA-NS) has been proposed. This approach guarantees that the number of floating-point comparisons is always bounded by O(M N log N) for N solutions and M objectives, which is not true for various approaches. However, the worst-case time complexity of DDANS is recently proved to be Θ(MN 2 + N 3 ). In this paper, we develop an approach on the top of DDA-NS, which also guarantees (M N log N) floating-point comparisons and its worst-case time complexity is proved to be Θ(MN 2 ) as opposed to Θ(MN 2 + N 3 ) of DDA-NS.},

  abstract  = {Recent years have witnessed the success of deep learning in many fields. Commonly, the deep neural networks are trained by gradient-based methods, which is however ineffective in some cases when the optimization landscapes contain many local optima. In this study, we propose a novel optimization approach that combines neuroevolution with gradient-based method, which possesses the advantages of global search and fast convergence. The main challenge is the high expense of network training, especially when the network structure becomes deeper. This motivates us to utilize the concept of transfer learning which borrows knowledge from a source domain to enhance the learning ability in a target domain. Unfortunately, the design of transfer learning strategies for specific scenarios usually requires external expert knowledge. We therefore propose an adaptive transfer system (ATS) based on dataset similarity, which adaptively adjusts the transferring and retraining modules according to the similarity of the source and target tasks. Empirical studies on image classification problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We are the first attempt to show that the neuroevolution can be successfully applied to deep transfer learning.},

When developing approaches to deal with concept drifts, some datasets such as the Forest Covertype and Nebraska Weather are common choices for testing, even though there is no consensus on whether these exhibit concept drifts or not. We argue that some well-known real-world concept drift datasets present a high serial dependence in the target class and may have only minor changes. With this in mind, we propose the use of Naïve methods that should be used for comparison with methods that deal with concept drifts. The experimental results using six real-world well-known concept drift datasets show that the Naïve approaches can be better than some methods to deal with possible concept drifts in datasets such as the Forest Covertype, Electricity, and Nebraska Weather. These results suggest that some widely used datasets may be trivial from the concept drift standpoint, and thus, should be avoided, or at least the results should be compared with the proposed Naïve methods.},

It is extremely challenging and difficult to produce promising solutions in high-dimensional search space. In this paper, an Autoencoder-embedded Evolutionary Optimization (AEO) framework is proposed for the first time. As an efficient dimension reduction tool, an autoencoder is used to compress high-dimensional landscape to informative low-dimensional space. The search operation in this low-dimensional space can facilitate the population converge towards the optima more efficiently. To balance the exploration and exploitation ability during optimization, two sub-populations coevolve in a distributed fashion, where one is assisted by an autoencoder and the other undergoes a regular evolutionary process. The information between these two sub-populations are dynamically exchanged. The proposed algorithm is validated by testing several 200 dimensional benchmark functions. Compared with the state-of-art algorithms for HEPs, AEO shows extraordinarily high efficiency for these challenging problems.},

The proposed method aims to find a better clustering model and donor for imputation, comparing with individual clustering algorithms. It makes use of agreements among different clustering algorithms to generate a set of sub-clusters, and, then, merges these sub-clusters based on the matrix of the performance measures of sub-clusters. The proposed method is evaluated using ten public datasets from UCI data repository and V2X communication data with induced missing samples, and compared with three standard clustering based imputation methods, k-means imputation, fuzzy c-means imputation, and partition around medoids imputation. Missing values are induced through each dataset by different missing mechanisms, missing rates, and missing distribution, and, thus, various incomplete datasets are generated. The performance of these methods are checked using normalized root mean square error (NRMSE). The attained experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed missing values imputation method.},

The advantage is to allow subjects to learn to control the external device without real limb movements. Internal-reward-based RL-BMIs train the decoder based on the reward information extracted from neural activities, which is a step towards autonomous BMI design. Studies have used medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity to extract the internal reward when rodents are in the learning process. However, the reward and non-reward classification using single neuron spikes is noisy. In this paper, we explore the reward interpretation ability of local field potentials (LFPs) in the mPFC area of SD rats, especially on the high-frequency bands. We also investigate whether LFPs contain extra information over spikes by using support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier to distinguish the rewarding and non-rewarding trials. We find that among the three bands, namely, gamma (30-80Hz), high-gamma (80-200Hz) and bhfLFP (200-400Hz), the bhfLFP band has the highest decoding accuracy (86.97\% for a high lever task and 79\% for a low lever task). Compared with the spike only, the integrated LFP-spike feature has comparable or better classification performance. It potentially provides more stable internal reward for RL-based BMIs.},

The lack of operational guidelines to identify the SCG feature points in the signal waveform made the investigation of SCG feature-point-labeled template be one of the essential topics in SCG researches. For this reason, a new SCG template generation method was studied and proposed in this article. The new method leveraged the clustering skill of K-means algorithm and the waveform alignment capability of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. The merits of using the new method are the flexibility to average cardiac signal segments with different data lengths and the alleviation of the flattened template problem which often bother the conventional ensemble average method. The strategies to achieve the global minimum of the cost function in K-means clustering, to recognize the clustered groups and to improve the warping criteria for DTW averaging were addressed. Experimental results demonstrated the capabilities on the extraction of the frequent appearing SCG waveforms and the generation of DTW averaged templates from the clinical data of 16 subjects (8 healthy subjects and 8 heart failure subjects). The pros and cons of using DTW based averaging were compared with those of using conventional ensemble averaging.},

Being progressive in nature, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients require frequent hospital readmission. Frequent hospital readmission, may be preventable, is a patient-centric approach which result in expensive health services and poor utilization of overly-burdened medical resources in recent times. In this research study, we envisaged a ML-based model to predict hospital readmission in 30-day by analyzing daily physical activity (PA) data with an accelerometer-based wrist-worn device. Prediction models based on logistic regression, lasso regularization, and MLP deep neural network have been used for training and testing PA data. For analysis, 70\% of PA data used for training and 30\% for testing and predicting readmission. Readmission predicted with sensitivity 0.88, positive predictive value 0.75, false positive 0.25 and area under ROC curve 0.50. The novelty our approach is to predict hospital readmission by monitoring health condition with accelerometer-based wrist-worn device which generate PA data electronic in nature, can be readily employed with various e-healthcare services. Therefore, we propose to develop a cloud-based system, coordinated &amp; aligned with local-health services and e-healthcare, to provide better patient care system and alarming notifications; and to reduce preventable hospital readmission to cut medical expenses and conserve medical resources for better patient care and readily available medical services for all.},

In Contrast, the Aridity index is computed by using Jensen formula to formulate, which is worldwide accepted. At the same time, ETo can be calculated using the well-known scheme by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) through Penman-Monteith FAO-56 (PM). We used 10-year data (2000-2009) of 12 climate locations positioned in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, Pakistan. We acknowledged an increasing drift within the Aridity index rate had been observed mostly in spring, summer, and winter, with a downward tendency through fall. Furthermore, the statistical investigation demonstrations an increasing drifts in AI during spring and winter. In conclusion, we presented an efficient procedure which may, therefore, benefit by including in irrigation, water resource management, and meteorological modeling for future enlargement.},

  abstract  = {The complexities associated with Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) and their interaction with the environment pose a challenge for their safety evaluation. Number of miles driven has been suggested as one of the metrics to demonstrate technological maturity. However, the experiences or the scenarios encountered by the ADSs is a more meaningful metric, and has led to a shift to scenario-based testing approach in the automotive industry and research community. Variety of scenario generation techniques have been advocated, including real-world data analysis, accident data analysis and via systems hazard analysis. While scenario generation can be done via these methods, there is a need for a scenario description language format which enables the exchange of scenarios between diverse stakeholders (as part of the systems engineering lifecycle) with varied usage requirements. In this paper, we propose a two-level abstraction approach to scenario description language (SDL) - SDL level 1 and SDL level 2. SDL level 1 is a textual description of the scenario at a higher abstraction level to be used by regulators or system engineers. SDL level 2 is a formal machine-readable language which is ingested by testing platform e.g. simulation or test track. One can transform a scenario in SDL level 1 into SDL level 2 by adding more details or from SDL level 2 to SDL level 1 by abstracting.},

  abstract  = {Adaptive traffic signal control is one key avenue for mitigating the growing consequences of traffic congestion. Incumbent solutions such as SCOOT and SCATS require regular and time-consuming calibration, can&#39;t optimise well for multiple road use modalities, and require the manual curation of many implementation plans.A recent alternative to these approaches are deep reinforcement learning algorithms, in which an agent learns how to take the most appropriate action for a given state of the system. This is guided by neural networks approximating a reward function that provides feedback to the agent regarding the performance of the actions taken, making it sensitive to the specific reward function chosen. Several authors have surveyed the reward functions used in the literature, but attributing outcome differences to reward function choice across works is problematic as there are many uncontrolled differences, as well as different outcome metrics.This paper compares the performance of agents using different reward functions in a simulation of a junction in Greater Manchester, UK, across various demand profiles, subject to real world constraints: realistic sensor inputs, controllers, calibrated demand, intergreen times and stage sequencing. The reward metrics considered are based on the time spent stopped, lost time, change in lost time, average speed, queue length, junction throughput and variations of these magnitudes. The performance of these reward functions is compared in terms of total waiting time. We find that speed maximisation resulted in the lowest average waiting times across all demand levels, displaying significantly better performance than other rewards previously introduced in the literature.},

This literature review identifies applicable research in smart transportation technologies with consideration to aspects of technology, policy, community, and environment.

Two main contributions are highlighted in this work: 1) to show that the alliance of the multi-agent systems (MAS) and the metaheuristics, based on the interaction and the parallelisms concepts, facilitates the hybrid metaheuristics development and allows the simultaneous exploration of different regions of the search space and 2) to demonstrate that the use the multi-agent approach, in the context of optimization, is a crucial option in the process of hybridization allowing the development of generic structures. These later promote the interaction between metaheuristics independent of the problem to be addressed. Our challenge in this ABOS framework is to endow the participant agents, with a set of rational behaviours allowing them to change in real time their strategies, according to the optimization process evolution. The simulation results show that the collaborative optimization can be effective in some cases, hence the need to set effectively the parameters of the optimization algorithms behaviours and the collaborative protocols. We also demonstrate that the use of ABOS framework with MAS allows a more robust and generic structure, capable with minimal changes handling different COP.},

Aiming at the adaptive migration service, a deep Q-learning service migration decision algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adjust the vehicular service migration decision according to traffic information. Furthermore, a service migration framework consisting of neural networks is proposed in this paper to improve the adaptability and real-time performance of the algorithm. By using this framework, training and decision-making can be carried out simultaneously in different places. Finally, compared with the two existing algorithms, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, multi-core processing systems have to perform complex functionalities on densely packed multi-million gate platforms, which makes such systems prone to uncontrolled surges in core temperatures, if not effectively controlled. Increasing temperature above specified limits not only leads to high cost of cooling but also results in higher dissipation of leakage power together with a reduction in performance and lower system life expectancy. In this work, we propose a two-level low-overhead proportional fair resource allocation strategy called TEARS: A temperature-aware real-time scheduler for heterogeneous multi-core systems, for scheduling of periodic tasks with bounded number of migrations and context-switches. The proposed algorithm&#39;s first level divides time into distinct windows based on deadlines of tasks, so that exact proportional fairness is maintained at all window boundaries. The second level accomplishes intra-window scheduling with the aim of maximising the use of resources while not breaching a specified thermal threshold. Our experimental analysis shows that the presented strategy not only improves upon the state-of-the-art in terms of resource utilisation (as high as 16.09\%) but also reduces average temperatures of cores in the system.},

  abstract  = {K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) has remained one of the most popular methods for supervised machine learning tasks. However, its performance often depends on the characteristics of the dataset and on appropriate feature scaling. In this paper, we explore characteristics of a dataset that make it suitable for being used within KNN. As part of this, two new measures for dataset dispersion, called mean neighborhood target standard deviation (MNTSD), and mean neighborhood target entropy (MNTE) are formulated to determine the expeced performance while using KNN regressors and classifiers, respectively. It is empirically demonstrated that these measures of dispersion can be indicative of the performance of KNN regression and classification. This idea is further used to learn feature weights that help improve the accuracy of KNN classification and regression. For this, it is argued that the MNTSD and MNTE, when used to learn feature weights, cannot be optimized using gradient-based optimization methods and we develop optimization strategies based on metaheuristic methods, namely genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. The feature-weighting method is tried in both regression and classification contexts on publicly available datasets, and the performance is compared to KNN without feature weighting. The results indicate that the performance of KNN with appropriate feature weighting leads to better performance.},

Gaps in requirements formulation can lead to solutions that are not fitfor-purpose. However, the completeness of a set of requirements cannot be demonstrated; rather, completeness is an attempt, a best-effort pursuit. In current practice, where requirement gaps are frequent in system development, the human (engineer or team of engineers) becomes a major factor in the comprehensiveness of the resulting set of requirements. In this paper, we present a concept of an intelligent systems engineering (SE) advisor that supports the (human) engineer in identifying gaps as requirements are formulated, the set of structural rules that the intelligent SE advisor uses to perform the assessment, and a proof-of-concept implemented as a plugin for a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) software environment. The proposed intelligent SE advisor evaluates requirements that are formulated in the form of models leveraging a knowledge repository to read the model-based requirements. If potential gaps in the set of requirements are identified, these are presented to the engineer, who decides how to address the gaps. In this way, the intelligent SE advisor contributes to assessing requirements validation, beyond simply verifying model construction.},

  abstract  = {Smart power grids are one of the most complex cyberphysical systems, delivering electricity from power generation stations to consumers. It is critically important to know exactly the current state of the system as well as its state variation tendency; consequently, state estimation and state forecasting are widely used in smart power grids. Given that state forecasting predicts the system state ahead of time, it can enhance state estimation because state estimation is highly sensitive to measurement corruption due to the bad data or communication failures. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning-based method is proposed for power system state forecasting. The proposed method leverages Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting voltage magnitudes and a deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for predicting phase angels. The proposed CNN-RNN model is evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus benchmark. The results demonstrate that the proposed CNN-RNN model achieves better results than the existing techniques in the literature by reducing the normalized Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of predicted voltages by 10\%. The results also show a 65\% and 35\% decrease in the average and maximum absolute error of voltage magnitude forecasting.},

Providing evidence of flu-like symptoms, a decision support system based on causal networks is capable of providing the operator with vital information for decision-making. A modified residual temporal convolutional network is proposed for action recognition using skeleton features. This paper addresses the capability of using results from a machine-learning model as evidence for a cognitive decision support system.

For instance, it is important for the policy makers to know where homeless populations live so that they can provide necessary services accordingly. This article presents a satellite image tent-detection solution with three deep learning methods that utilize transfer learning from the ResNetV2, InceptionV3, and MobileNetV2 models, trained on ImageNet, attached to a unique architecture referred to as &quot;TentNet&quot;. The performance of these models are first shown in detecting planes and ships within satellite imagery in previously defined datasets as a baseline. Then, a new dataset is created from a compilation of tents from the xView project to use for testing, along with another dataset of synthetic images from the generative adversarial networks StyleGAN2 and DCGAN for training. After training on a dataset containing only synthetic images for the tents class, the ResNetV2 architecture achieved the highest accuracy of 73.68\% when testing on the real satellite imagery.},

  abstract  = {With the development of IoT technology, it has become possible to accumulate and regularly measure multidimensional time-series data. In this study, we focus on the usage of multidimensional time-series data from printer products&#39; log data and propose a method for its analysis. In addition to the number of sheets printed by each customer, the log data includes various time-series information such as the amount of remaining toner, the number of stoppages that occur, and the activation times. To utilize these data for business purposes, it is desirable to construct a model for predicting future changes in use characteristics for each customer. In this study, we apply the random forest algorithm to predict such changes. However, if all measurable features of the problem are included, the model becomes complex and cannot be interpreted. Although the accuracy is relatively high if an appropriate learning algorithm is applied, the complex model tends to overfit the training data. In this paper, we propose a method to select the modeling features that can be interpreted by graph mining while maintaining accuracy. This would enable us to interpret the data at the field level and discover the hypotheses that are necessary for planned marketing policies. Finally, the proposed method is applied to real data and its efficacy is demonstrated.},

Moreover, we utilize an improved metaheuristic algorithm, the global-best guided quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm (GQTS), which has a fast and stable feature to efficiently search for the optimal trading strategy of MA. Our approach employs the sliding window technique to avoid overfitting problem. In addition, we propose year-on-year sliding windows and 2-phase sliding window to adapt to the phenomenon of an economic cycle in the investment period and to efficiently solve stock trading problems. The experimental environment is the United States stock market. The experiment result shows that combine GQTS and MA can find better strategies that outperform other normal strategies. The performance of remuneration indicates that the trading system is enhanced with a year-on-year sliding window and 2-phase sliding window.},

This paper presents a new approach for developing and selecting fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to address the non-ferrous scrap metal supplier selection problem with fuzzy data. The approach develops different fuzzy MCDM methods by combining three normalization processes and three aggregation processes commonly used in MCDM research. In particular, a specific defuzzification process is used to reflect the decision maker&#39;s risk attitude about the current global commodity market. A validation procedure using fuzzy c-means clustering is applied to select among inconsistent ranking results produced by different fuzzy MCDM methods. An empirical study on a non-ferrous scrap metal company in China is conducted to illustrate how fuzzy MCDM methods are developed and selected.},

The model considers the cost of attack, attack success rate, defense, cooperation, and noncooperation strategies during the game process. The defense strategy can help nodes resist different attacks. Nodes can dynamically adjust their own strategies according to different behaviors of attackers to achieve effective defense.

Advertising through world wide web is mainly performed by Real Time Bidding in which the advertisers and the publishers participate to online auctions for trading the ad slots. Publishers usually set the reserve prices for their ad slots and any winning buyer in the auctions performed by ad exchanges has to pay at least the value of reserve price. Header bidding is a way of real time bidding and it becomes very popular, but how to use it together with advertising Exchanges (AdX) to achieve good revenue for online publishers is not well studied. In this paper, we propose a method that makes use of the historical auction data from header bidding and AdX to learn and optimize the reserve price for AdX. We propose a method based on supervised learning and survival analysis to increase the reserve price. The method assumes no information about current auctions and the bids of header bidding and AdX response are predicted and used to determine the highest possible reserve price. The experiments with real-world auction data show the promising results of our method in increasing the expected revenue of online publishers.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we will consider the dimension reduction of the set of time series, such as economic data, to find the meaningful basis vector for the set of data, and indicate which data use which basis vector. Usually each of the time series is analyzed independently in economics but here we will analyze the set of time series simultaneously. Since some of the economic data are measured as positive values and we want to decompose them as a mixture of the parts, we will apply non-negative matrix factorization to the economic data. Non-negative matrix factorization can compress dimensions by approximating a non-negative matrix with the product of two non-negative matrices. The two non-negative matrices are called the coefficient matrix and the basis matrix, and the basis matrix can be considered as a dimensionally compressed matrix. If the standard non-negative matrix factorization is used for economic data, the basis matrix may not be smooth. We think that the basis vectors should be smooth except a few special economical incidents. In the proposed method, a Graph-based non-negative matrix factorization is introduced to regularize the basis matrix of the time series. A path graph for representing the time series of economic data is incorporated into the non-negative matrix factorization as regularization. As a result, basis vectors that maintains the time series of economic data are decomposed. Furthermore, we propose to introduce a sparsity in the non-negative matrix factorization. Traditionally, the sparsity incorporated into non-negative matrix factorization has been used for basis vectors. However, the proposed method introduces the sparsity for coefficient vectors. Thus the proposed method, which simultaneously incorporates the sparsity for the coefficient vectors and the smoothness for the basis vectors, can extract the smooth basis vectors and the original economical data are approximated as the weighted sum of the few bases vectors. This allows us to discover economic trends and the best-fit trends for each data at the same time.},

  abstract  = {Transformation of data into knowledge is the hallmark of modern medicine. As an evolving field of medicine, e-Health involves the electronic processing of a patient&#39;s personal, medical and other health-related data to improve healthcare delivery. Data captured from clinical interactions between patients and their care providers, as well as health data collected through medical sensors, provide a rich source of data, known as patient medical records (PMRs), which can be processed in various ways to enhance the delivery of healthcare services. However, indiscriminate processing of PMRs could potentially result in the violation of the security or privacy of patients. To ensure that PMRs are not processed in ways that could be harmful to the security or privacy of the patients, modern data protection regulations, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires healthcare service provides to obtain the consent of a patient for any processing operation on their PMRs. The mechanism by which a patient exercises their right to control who can process their PMRs, when and for what purpose, is referred to as consent management in e-Health. Existing health information technology systems do not provide adequate support for consent management; there is a lack of transparency and auditability in the existing systems to monitor and ensure that healthcare service providers comply to the relevant data protection regulations in processing PMRs. The emerging blockchain technology offers an opportunity to design an e-Health consent management system that is compliant with modern data protection regulations such as GDPR. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an e-Health consent management framework, based on the state-of-the-art blockchain technologies, for processing PMRs. Our analysis confirms that our system satisfies the requirements for consent management in e-Health.},

We model human-machine systems as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process to develop an assistant system operating on maneuver or navigation level featuring an automatic detection of the humans goal which is initially unknown to it. Predicting the next actions of the human allows for computing corresponding assistant actions by employing Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning With Observation Widening. These supporting actions are generated based on continuous action-, observation- and state spaces and are executed synchronously to the actions of the human. New information about the humans goal is gathered through observations to further enhance future supporting actions. With a progressing certainty of the goal recognition, the assistant system is increasingly able to assist the human by completing the task both cooperatively or even fully autonomously, thus reducing workload, while always allowing for the human to smoothly in-or decrease their involvement. The assistant system demonstrates its ability to recognize the goal pursued by the human as well as to execute appropriate supporting actions while being robust to the human changing their goal in multiple experiments investigating the interaction of a real human with a simulated cooperative positioning scenario.},

  abstract  = {With the increasing demand of personalized products and the application of emerging technologies, substantial unexpected events appears in smart factories. Machine learning based adaptive scheduling shows significant appeal in smart shop floors, yet still has limitations in accommodating unexpected events. This paper presents a novel framework of HCPS (Human Cyber Physical System) based on the conventional CPS. A human-machine cooperative mechanism is proposed to coordinate task allocation between human and machine. Meanwhile, in order to integrate human intelligence and machine intelligence within scheduling decision making, a novel human-machine cooperative approach for adaptive scheduling is put forward. In the process of online scheduling, human operators adjust the deviation of production indicators on the basis of current condition. Subsequently, an enhanced fuzzy inference system combining with human intelligence is designed to obtain optimal dispatching rules, in which parameters are reduced by a K-means algorithm and optimized by a PSO algorithm. Finally, a case study is performed on the Minifab model. The simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed framework and approaches, and show good potential in efficiency and stability.},

  abstract  = {Over the past decade, online crowdsourcing has established itself as an emerging paradigm that industry and government have been using to harness the cognitive abilities of a multitude of users distributed around the world. In this context, microtask crowdsourcing has become the method of choice for addressing a wide range of diverse problems. Microtasks typically require a minimum of time and cognitive effort, but combined individual efforts have made it possible to accomplish great achievements. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the ongoing effort of understanding whether the same success that microtask crowdsourcing has achieved in other domains can be obtained in the field of social news curation. In particular, we ask whether it is possible to turn online news curation, typically a social and collaborative activity on the Web, into a model in which curatorial activities are mapped into microtasks to be performed by a crowd of online users.},

  abstract  = {Human motion tracking (HMT) has been a research focus in the last decades. In this paper, we propose an IMU/TOA-fusion-based platform to solve this problem. Firstly, Time-of-arrival (TOA)-based distance ranging method is considered to compensate for the drifting errors and accumulation introduced by inertial sensors. Secondly, a geometrical kinematic model and maximum correntropy criterion (MCC)-based Kalman filter method are proposed to fuse the multiple information. The open-source hardware and software are detailed in this paper for real-time human motion capture and reconstruction applications. Experiment results show that our proposed hardware can be easily equipped for total body motion reconstruction with a considerable enhancement of the wear-ability and comfort. Furthermore, the main achievements have been presented with a performance comparison between the proposed platform and state-of-the-art commercial ones. Above all, our proposed platform can significantly suppress the accumulative error and drifting problem of conventional inertial systems. More importantly, it realizes the open-source software and hardware, thus it has promising prospects for wearable human motion tracking applications.},

The IoT has multiple human-computer interaction challenges due to its many formats and interlinked components, and central to these is the need to provide sensory information and situational context pertaining to users in a more human-friendly, easily understandable format. This work addresses this by applying mixed reality toward expressing the underlying behaviors and states internal to IoT devices and IoT-enabled objects. It extends the authors&#39; previous research on IoT Avatars (mixed reality character representations of physical IoT devices), presenting a new head-mounted display framework and interconnection architecture. This contributes i) an exploration of mixed reality for smart spaces, ii) an approach toward expressive avatar behaviors using fuzzy inference, and iii) an early functional prototype of a hybrid physical and mixed reality IoT-enabled object.

  abstract  = {In the decision-making process, many complex problems may be difficult to deal with traditional approaches. In particular, in the construction sector, the large volume of information and the involvement of non-expert users can make time consuming and inconsistent the choice. In this paper, a new method supported by the Augmented Reality (AR) is proposed to simplify and improve the decision-making process. Such novel approach starts from the theoretical basis of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simos-Roy-Figueira method (SRF) and develops a virtual environment to support the decision-making. In particular the AR provide a large amount of visual information transforming a complex decision method in a user-friendly tool. The proposed approach is applied in the field of building energy retrofitting in order to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, the goal of the analysis is the selection of the best panel, chosen from a set of experimental Precast Construction Panels, to improve the envelope performances of existing buildings. The decision involved both quantitative data (such as costs and thermal behavior) and qualitative data (such as the aesthetic impact).},

A lot of research interests have been drawn to other building blocks of a connected vehicle system, such as communication, planning, and control. However, less research studies were focused on the human-machine cooperation and interface, namely how to visualize the guidance information to the driver as an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS). In this study, we propose an augmented reality (AR)-based ADAS, which visualizes the guidance information calculated cooperatively by multiple connected vehicles. An unsignalized intersection scenario is adopted as the use case of this system, where the driver can drive the connected vehicle crossing the intersection under the AR guidance, without any full stop at the intersection. A simulation environment is built in Unity game engine based on the road network of San Francisco, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation is conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed system regarding travel time and energy consumption.},

This compact hand-based text input system is proposed for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) devices. To recognize and classify hand gestures, the hand image is captured by a standard camera. After, the hand is segmented using background subtraction, and then the segmented hand gesture is input in the trained neural network for gesture recognition. Finally, hand movements are tracked and recorded using a convex hull algorithm. The corresponding written character is passed to a trained neural network. The proposed architecture is tested and the experimental results are compared with other methods, which showed that the proposed method performed better than traditional methods and achieved 96.12\% accuracy, achieved accuracy is overall better than existing methods.},

  abstract  = {Most stroke patients with hemiplegia have difficulty on heel rocker function due to weak dorsiflexors at their paralyzed side. The proposed high-dorsiflexion assistive robotic technology (RT) supports ankle dorsiflexion during gait rehabilitation. Aside from the McKibben-type artificial muscle&#39;s contraction to assist swing phase dorsiflexion, a tension spring is aligned in series to support heel rocker function upon heel strike. Because of different requirements of dorsiflexion torque during loading response phase, selection of suitable spring for corresponding user could be important. Springs with either excessively large or small coefficients might the normal heel rocker function. In this research, an identification method based on observing tension on the spring in loading response phase was derived. We aim for simple clinical setting and availability on patients with various pathological gait patterns, especially gait asymmetry. A case study on a stroke patient with hemiplegia was conducted to evaluate effect with the identified spring. Increase of knee angle (before intervention: mean 2.118°, SD 0.418°; during intervention: mean 12.814°, SD 1.764°) and shank angular velocity to the ground (before intervention: mean 117.300°/s, SD 9.491°/s; during intervention: mean 255.875°/s, SD 34.130°/s) indicates sufficient heel rocker function could be supported during intervention of the identified tension spring in this specific case.},

Some of the main challenges for achieving good tracking performance, stability and transparency in telerehabilitation are nonlinearities, uncertain and time-varying parameters in the robot and human models, and communication delays. Additionally, a paramount challenge for this technology is ensuring safe and compliant interaction between the robots and the human operators. This paper presents a novel control approach utilized during unilateral and bilateral teleoperation which address these challenges. An Adaptive Impedance Controller is designed using Lyapunov-based methods for the master exoskeleton while a Proportional-Derivative Impedance Controller is implemented on the slave exoskeleton. Subsequently, a torque limiter technique was implemented on the master side to ensure stability in the presence of time delays. The advantages of these controllers are that they address unknown dynamics, incorporate designed impedance response for rehabilitation applications, and are simple to implement. Simulations for two two-degree-of-freedom robotic exoskeletons are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in both passive and assistive telerehabilitation modes, and with time delays.},

Both stationary and moving obstacles can be detected by our approach without recovering the camera motion. Firstly, In order to compute the ground shape invariant feature, the image is mapped into the top view image. And then feature points are extracted and matched between adjacent frames. Secondly, the points are grouped according to image patch partition. Finally, the ground shape invariant feature is computed for each group of points to detect obstacle points. Extensive experiments have been carried out with prerecorded video sequences including various obstacle types, various scenes and various illumination conditions. The experimental results show promising detection performance of the proposed method.},

Uncertainty caused by their different usage stages exists when disassembling them. In this paper, we propose a stochastic multi-objective disassembly sequencing and line balancing problem based on an AND/OR graph. By considering disassembly failure risk, we construct objectives of maximizing profit and minimizing carbon emission and energy consumption to help sustain economic development. Then, we propose a novel multi-objective discrete grey wolf optimizer to solve it. We show its effectiveness via a product example. The results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over classical non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition.},

In our experiment, participants evaluated whether a given brand extension sample was acceptable during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. Brand extension samples included parent beverage brand name and extended goods name from beverage or household appliance categories. We pre-processed 3-D fMRI image data and extracted 2-D feature images based on a preliminary study. To overcome the limited number of fMRI samples, we conducted image augmentation for the training dataset. A deep neural network model with the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used to classify fMRI images in response to visual presentation of each brand extension sample into one of the two classes: acceptable vs. non-acceptable. The train classifier was tested using 10-fold cross validation. Our model estimated the evaluation of brand extension with high accuracy (90.4\%). This result indicates that one can predict how a consumer evaluates a new brand extension proposal only by their brain activity.},

In the recent, ophthalmologists are increasingly using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images to diagnose many ocular diseases including cataract. The relationship between cataract and the lens opacity based on AS-OCT images has been being studied in clinical pioneer research. However, using AS-OCT images to classify cataract automatically based on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique has not been seriously studied. This paper proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model named GraNet for nuclear cataract classification based on AS-OCT images.

To further improve the classification performance, we propose a simple and efficient cross-training method is comprised of focal loss and cross-entropy loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on the AS-OCT image dataset, the results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve better nuclear cataract classification results than baselines.},

Hence it is difficult to solve and optimize in designing estimators. In this paper, the simple delay product type LKF with negative definite terms is established for the use of the Wirtinger based inequality together with mixed convex combination approach. The delay dependent conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are obtained which lead to less conservative and more flexible estimator design results.

  abstract  = {Semantic segmentation is a critical method in the field of autonomous driving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view (FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment, making automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by fisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and the fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with large distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be directly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation method is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more comprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed into fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by cameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result shows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model&#39;s accuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This seven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for fisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide specific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At last, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye images and obtained satisfactory results. The code and configurations are released at https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/FisheyeSeg.},

In particular applications such as image recognition and natural language processing, the entire computing process is completely handed over to the machine learning algorithm to directly learn the mapping from the feature space to the expected output, without considering much of the semantical information and domain knowledge of the data. In this paper, we propose a generic data refinement approach called divideup, which incorporates finer semantical information into the dataset to obtain a prediction model capturing more detailed information in the training data. By providing the information theory, we have high confidence that the learned model trained with the refined dataset has better prediction accuracy than the original one. We conduct extensive experiments on different datasets with the state-of-the-art neural network architectures such as ResNet and DenseNet. The experimental results show that divideup improves the prediction accuracy of all these deep learning architectures on the original test set. The divideup approach is also applied to other machine learning models such as random forest, XGboost and SVM. The results supports the conclusion that the refined training data obtained by divideup produces better prediction accuracy of the learned model.},

Value function factorization learning is a promising way as it can efficiently address multi-agent credit assignment problem. However, existing value function factorization methods have been focusing on learning fully decentralized value functions, which are not effective for some complex tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a framework which enhances value function factorization by allowing communication during execution. Communication introduces extra information to help agents understand the complex environment and learn sophisticated factorization. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism of communication differs from existing methods since we additionally design a descriptive key along with the message. By the descriptive key, agents can dynamically measure the importance of different messages and achieve attentional communication. We evaluate our framework on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks, and show that it significantly outperforms existing value function factorization methods.},

  abstract  = {The Choquet Integral (ChI) is an aggregation operator defined with respect to a Fuzzy Measure (FM). The FM encodes the worth of all subsets of the sources of information that are being aggregated. The monotonicity and the boundary conditions of the FM have limited its applicability to decision-level fusion. But in a recent work, we removed the boundary and monotonicity constraints of the FM, which we then called a bounded capacity (BC), to propose a Choquet Integral regression (CIR) approach that enables capability beyond previously proposed ChI regression methods. In the same work, we also presented a quadratic programming (QP)-based method, batch-CIR, to learn the BC parameters of the CIR from training data. However, the QP used for learning the BC scales exponentially with the dimensionality of the training data and thus it becomes impractical on data sets with 7 or more dimensions. In this paper we propose an iterative gradient descent approach, online-CIR, to learn the BC. This method iteratively processes the training data, one data point at a time, and therefore requires significantly less computation and space at any time during the training. The application of batch-CIR required the dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data sets to enable computation in a reasonable time. The proposed online-CIR approach has enabled us to extend CIR to data sets with larger dimensionality. In our experimental evaluation using benchmark regression data sets, online-CIR has outperformed batch-CIR on high-dimensional data sets while also matching the batch-CIR performance on low-dimensional data sets.},

  abstract  = {In a resource allocation system, resource suppliers and customers can be naturally modelled as autonomous and interactive entities. In this context, we propose in this paper a multiagent system architecture based on trust and honesty concepts between agents in order to synchronize resource allocation in a distributed environment. Indeed, agents use several means in order to allocate resources efficiently as dialogue, adaptability, cooperation, collaboration and even negotiation in addition to the notion of trust. So, individual agents have to evaluate the trustworthiness of others to select those to interact with. Moreover, resource inadequacies can exist in the resource allocation systems, and it is difficult to meet the resource requirements of all agents simultaneously. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a distributed multiagent resource allocation system that emphasizes the issues of agents trust and resource inadequacies, which is called MARA-T&amp;R. In this system, the evidence theory is improved thanks to the Deng entropy to estimate the trustworthiness of agents. Additionally, we use the concept of reservations to solve the problem of resource inadequacies. Our simulation results highlight the excellent performances of this improved trust model and the efficiency of the proposed MARA-T&amp;R system for resource allocation.},

In this paper, firstly, triangular fuzzy numbers(TFNs) are used to represent parameter values, and then the Pythagorean triangular fuzzy interaction geometric Bonferroni mean(PTFIGBM) operator and the Pythagorean triangular fuzzy interaction weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (PTFIWGBM) operator of Pythagorean TFNs environment are proposed.

In this paper, we propose a new way to use multiple evaluation metrics, which is different from the aggregating method and the mutliobjective method. Our method is based on genetic programming. The idea is to randomly use one metric in each iteration of the selection operator. Therefore, multiple metrics can be used alternatively in the running process. To validate the effectiveness of our new approach, we conduct experiments on ten benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the new approach can improve the population diversity, and can achieve the performance better than or similar to that of the traditional symbolic regression algorithms.},

  abstract  = {We propose a chaotic evolution algorithm with elite strategy. The conventional chaotic evolution algorithm uses each individual to search in its local area. The proposed algorithm searches the parameter space always around the elite individual from the last generation. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in both single-objective and multi-objective optimization problems. In the single objective optimization problem, the elite is the individual has the best fitness value, and in the multi-objective optimization problem, the elites are the individuals in the first Pareto front. We design and evaluate these two algorithms with elite strategy using single- and multi-objective benchmark functions. We design a jump strategy to avoid searching within a local optima areas by applying elite strategy several generations one time. The numerical evaluation results demonstrate the proposed algorithm has strong local exploitation capability in the early generations. The optimization performance of chaotic evolution algorithm has a potential possibility to apply in high dimensional and more complex optimization problems.},

  abstract  = {Surrogated assisted evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve real-world expensive optimization problems. However, in some situations, no online data is available during the evolution process. In this situation, we have to build surrogate models based on offline historical data, which is known as offline data-driven optimization. Since no new data can be used to improve the surrogate models, offline data-driven optimization remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process assisted offline estimation of multivariate Gaussian distribution algorithm to address the offline data-driven optimization problem. Instead of using surrogate models to predict the fitness values of individuals, we utilize a surrogate model to predict the rankings of individuals based on the frequently used lower confidence bound. In this way, the robustness of the proposed algorithm could be enhanced. Experiments are conducted on five commonly used benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed offline surrogate model and the multivariate Gaussian estimation of distribution algorithm are able to achieve competitive performance.},

Reducing the feature set to the most significant subset of features typically results in an increase in the overall accuracy of a system. It has been shown that in some cases, the use of feature selection can make an underlying system susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the susceptibility of a feature selection-based Authorship Attribution System (AAS) to adversarial authorship attacks. The AAS studied is an instance of a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM). The feature selection algorithm used is an instance of Genetic &amp; Evolutionary Feature Selection (GEFeS)In order to evaluate the GEFeS+LSVM-based AAS, we use three adversarial authorship masking techniques to generate adversarial texts to attack the AAS. Our results show that in some cases the GEFeS+LSVM-based AAS is more susceptible to adversarial authorship attacks. We provide a simple measurement to determine whether the use of GEFeS is beneficial or detrimental to a LSVM-based AAS.},

Accurate evaluation of the patient’s physical condition is of importance as it would significantly help to decide appropriate care, medications or medical interventions needed. Thus, a fast and efficient risk factor selection algorithm demonstrates a clinical significance for the more precise diagnosis, and an accurate prediction model will hopefully be able to improve current treatment. In this paper, we designed a novel and universal architecture, broad learning attribute selection system (BLAS), to deal with the risk factor diagnosis and disease performance prediction on RA patients. The attribute selection based on rough set and entropy can identify significant risk factors affecting RA and broad learning possesses the ability of randomly generating nodes to investigate the desired connection weights simultaneously without the need for deep architecture. Experiments on clinical RA patients’ dataset demonstrated that our proposed BLAS model achieved the highest average accuracy of 99.67\% with mean absolute error of 0.32\%, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The results proved the robust classification ability of BLAS in RA risk factors assessment and prediction.},

  abstract  = {Emergency Department (ED) crowding has become an issue of delayed patient treatment and even a public healthcare problem around the world. According to recent research studies of many countries, the increasing number of patients in the emergency department which has led to unprecedented crowding and delays in care. For that reason, triage into five-level Emergency Severity Index (ESI) has become a major method for improving medical priorities in ED. Although the ESI mitigates the process of ED treatment, so far it still heavily relies on the nurse&#39;s subjective judgment and is easy to triage most patients to ESI level 3 in current practice. Therefore, a system that can help the doctors to accurately triage a patient&#39;s condition is imperative. In this work, we propose a system based on the patients&#39; ED electronic health record to predict hospitalizations after assigned procedures in ED are completed. While most of the related studies have employed traditional machine learning for triage-related classification and highly relied on a feature selection process, our proposed system used data-to-image transform to produce the input and a convolutional neural network as a classifier. For validation, the data from an open dataset (National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey) is used which includes 118,602 patient visits of United States EDs from 2012 to 2016 survey years. To sum up, the resulting AUROC and accuracy achieve 0.86 and 0.77, respectively, in our work.},

  abstract  = {The dynamic tumor tracking radiotherapy (DTT-RT) is the cutting-edge technology that attempts to track and irradiates the moving tumor continuously. Prediction of the 50 -500 ms future position of the tumor is necessary for successful implementation of DTT-RT to compensate for the positioning lag of the multi-leaf collimator (MLC). It is known that lung tumor exhibits respiratory induced motion. Precise prediction of lung tumor motion is known to be a very difficult problem since it exhibits large variation both on the amplitude and the phase of the trajectory, although it is induced by respiration of a patient that is nearly periodic. This paper proposes a prediction model of a lung tumor motion. The proposed model utilizes the high-order repetitive control to generate prediction corresponding to periodic baseline of the trajectory and the long-short term memory to cope with the remaining portion. We have developed nine personalized prediction models for nine patients who underwent respiratory gated stereotactic body radiotherapy in Yamaguchi University Hospital to predict 666 ms ahead 3D tumor position for each patient. The average 3D RMS position error for the nine patients was 2.18 mm (±1.66).},

As a result, classifying RNA sequences is converted to an image classification problem that can be efficiently solved by available CNN-based classification models. The paper also considers the folding potential of the ncRNAs in addition to their primary sequence. Based on the proposed approach, a benchmark image classification dataset is generated from the RFAM database of ncRNA sequences. In addition, three classical CNN models have been implemented and compared to demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed approach.

  abstract  = {Patients in intensive care for severe acute brain injury will undergo a series of behavioural and neurological assessments to evaluate their residual neural function and track the progression of their recovery. However, the degree to which covert conscious awareness is retained during the acute stages of a serious brain injury is unclear. In this study, we developed an EEG protocol to assess narrative processing - a proxy measure of awareness - during English and French versions of a naturalistic listening task. In two groups of healthy controls, we used EEG and a correlated components analysis to uncover a common pattern of neural activity associated with following the plot of a short, suspenseful audio clip from the movie “Taken”. Inter-subject neural correlations (ISCs) were used to compare the similarity of the EEG between participants during intact and scrambled versions of the audio. We found that the intact English version of &quot;Taken&quot; produced significantly higher ISCs than the scrambled version, though we did not observe a similar effect for the French audio. However, both the intact English and French versions of &quot;Taken&quot; produced significantly more time windows of ISCs across the group than their respective scrambled versions. Finally, the time course of ISCs for the intact English audio was significantly correlated with an independent set of subjective ratings of suspense during the task, while the correlation between suspense and the time course of ISCs for the intact French audio approached significance. These preliminary results suggest that our naturalistic listening protocol could be used to assess narrative processing, and thus, preserved awareness at the bedside using EEG in patients with acute brain injury in critical care centres across Canada.},

  abstract  = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have shown enormous promise in the detection of consciousness in minimally responsive individuals. To date, most BCIs have relied on the presence of high-level cognitive abilities (e.g. attention, language comprehension) in non-responsive individuals, resulting in a large number of cases of undetected - or covert - consciousness. An alternate approach is to measure the underlying properties of brain networks, which makes no assumptions about the presence of certain cognitive capacities. Brain networks can be represented through functional connectivity of different brain areas. To date, the vast majority of studies have used time-averaged functional connectivity to represent a state of consciousness. In this paper, we compare time-averaged versus time-resolved functional connectivity, and the information contained by each in different states of consciousness. We present a novel analysis to evaluate the dynamic properties of time-resolved, high-resolution estimates of phase-based functional connectivity using weighted phase lag index (wPLI) calculated from high-density EEG. In a case study of two individuals in disorders of consciousness, we demonstrate that time-resolved functional connectivity reflects the dynamic properties of brain networks, providing more information about an individual&#39;s state of consciousness than traditional time-averaged approaches. Our findings support time-resolved functional connectivity as the basis for a passive BCI with the potential to characterize the level of consciousness in behaviourally unresponsive patients.},

Consciousness is closely related to memory consolidation in that memory is a critical component of conscious experience. So far, many studies have been reported on memory consolidation during consciousness, but there is little research on memory consolidation during unconsciousness. Therefore, we aim to assess the unconsciousness in terms of memory consolidation using electroencephalogram signals. In particular, we used unconscious state during the nap; because sleep is the only state in which consciousness disappears under normal physiological conditions. Seven participants performed two memory tasks (word-pairs and visuo-spatial) before and after the nap to assess the memory consolidation during unconsciousness. As a result, spindle power in central, parietal, occipital regions during unconsciousness was positively correlated with the difference in location memory performance. With the difference in memory performance, there was also a negative correlation between delta connectivity and word-pairs memory, alpha connectivity and location memory, and spindle connectivity and word-pairs memory. Additionally, brain activity and connectivity for differences according to nap and unconsciousness during memory recall were explored. These findings could help present new insights into the assessment of unconsciousness by exploring the relationship with memory consolidation.},

Recently, there has been a great interest in using fNIRS as a tool to assess command-driven brain activity in patients with severe brain injuries to infer residual awareness. In this study, time-resolved (TR) fNIRS, a variant of fNIRS with enhanced sensitivity to the brain, was used to assess brain function in patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (DOC). A portable system was developed in-house, and patients were assessed in their homes or long-term care facilities across London and the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. Five DOC patients and one locked-in patient were recruited in this study, and motor imagery was used to elicit command-driven brain activity. TR-fNIRS data were analyzed using the general linear modelling (GLM) approach, as well as with basic machine learning. Three patients showed activity with GLM, four with machine learning, and two with both techniques. Interestingly, the two patients that showed activity by both approaches also had detectable motor imagery activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging. These promising preliminary results highlight the potential of TR fNIRS as a tool to probe consciousness and map brain activity at the bedside.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, Japan is experiencing a drastic increase of inbound tourists. In order to improve the environment for accepting foreign tourists visiting Japan, the Licensed Guide Interpreters Act was partially revised in 2018, which allows anyone to work as a compensated guide interpreter without the national license. Because inbound tourists have a wide variety of preferences on sightseeing, guides are needed to manage those diversified or sometimes complex requests flexibly. Thus, it is an important issue to ensure a quality of the interpreted guide services, as such uncertified guides may include inexperienced volunteers. This paper proposes a decision support system for inexperienced guides who is developing sightseeing plans for foreign visitors. First, inbound tourist behavior patterns in a city in Japan are extracted from a guide log data, which are recorded by some volunteer guides. By applying the collaborative filtering, the support system is constructed that predict and recommend sightseeing spots and activities by inputting new visitors&#39; interested spots and/or activities. Experimental test demonstrates that the proposed system holds a certain level of accuracy.},

  abstract  = {The evolution of cooperation can be investigated using Prisoners&#39; Dilemma game(PD) models on spatial networks. It has been shown that other-regarding preferences, such as inequality aversion, a taste for fairness, or reciprocal preference, can cause cooperative behavior to evolve. In this paper, we consider whether relationships among agents, alone or in combination with reciprocal preference, can drive cooperation. We study the emergence of cooperation in PD games on a two-dimensional spatial network where some individuals are reciprocators, altering their future behavior based on comparison with a randomly chosen neighbor. Simulation results show that, if the intensity of reciprocal preference is fixed, the frequency of cooperation increases with the fraction of reciprocators. When reciprocal preference intensity is high, a low level of cooperation can be sustained, even if there are few reciprocators -- though cooperation does not diffuse through the population. We also show that the particular linking rule matters, in that cooperators are more likely to survive under a Cooperate-Stay, Defect-Shift (CSDS) linking rule, as opposed to a Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS) rule. As the fraction of reciprocators increases, the CSDS rule provides a more favorable environment for the evolution of cooperation. In addition, there is a threshold fraction of reciprocators such that a large value of network evolution strength contributes to cooperation most the threshold is exceeded. On the other side of the threshold, stronger reciprocal preference intensity does not necessarily promote cooperation more powerfully. Our results provide insight into how relations between neighbors can be a potent force, in combination with reciprocal preference, in inducing cooperation.},

The Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) was used for the analysis, using the preference ranks obtained by both the standard method in which the analysts set the preference ranks subjectively and the new TOPSIS method, which incorporates a de-escalation perspective. As a result, it was found that the analysis method using TOPSIS ranking with de-escalation aspect was able to obtain conflict analysis results that more clearly reflected the intention of the analysis when compared with the standard method.},

Statistics have shown that the mortality rates related to traffic accident are more among youth. Although various road safety strategies and rules are developed by the government and law-enforcement agencies to combat the situation, these methods mainly target design, operation, and usability of traffic-ways. Most of the recent data-driven analysis papers model the traffic patterns or predict accidents from the past data. In this paper, we consider a comprehensive, year long fatality analysis reporting system (FARS) data to analyze the role of various factors related to humans, weather and physical conditions (e.g., road surface, light condition etc.) involved in traffic accidents. We build an intelligent risk prediction model that can help decision-makers to ensure road safety. The proposed model estimates (i.) the accident risk over a future time frame, and (ii.) the risk associated with the drivers present on the traffic-way based on the driver’s behavior, history, environmental conditions and physical conditions related to traffic-way.},

Instead of learning from human-driving demonstrations, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to learn how to initiate lane changes from traffic context, the action of a self-driving vehicle, and in-vehicle user&#39;s feedback. The proposed offline algorithm rewards the action-selection strategy when the user gives positive feedback and penalizes it when negative feedback. Also, a multi-dimensional driving scenario is considered to represent a more realistic lane-change trade-off. The results show that the lane-change initiation model obtained by this method can reproduce the personal lane-change tactic, and the performance of the customized models (average accuracy 86.1\%) is much better than that of the non-customized models (average accuracy 75.7\%). This method allows continuous improvement of customization for users during fully autonomous driving even without human-driving experience, which will significantly enhance the user acceptance of high-level autonomy of self-driving vehicles.},

This paper aims to present a data fusion of vehicle-based and ECG signals for classifying three levels of driver drowsiness, including alert, moderately drowsy, and extremely drowsy. Lateral deviation from the road centerline, steering wheel angle, and lateral acceleration are employed as vehicle-based signals. Two ECG leads are also exploited to collect heart rate variability of drivers. Thirty-nine features from vehicle-based data and ten features from heart rate variability signals are extracted. Finally, k-nearest neighbors and random forest are used as classifiers to classify the level of drowsiness using selected features by the sequential feature selector. Age and gender, as the two most effective human factors, are considered to assess the performance of the method in different age/gender groups. The proposed method is evaluated on experimental data that were collected from 93 manual driving tests using 47 different human volunteers in a driving simulator. Results show that hyperparameter-optimized random forests obtain an accuracy of 82.8\% for the detection of drowsiness levels based on vehicle signals only, and an accuracy of 88.5\% based on ECG derived data only. Data fusion of ECG signals and vehicle data improves the accuracy of classification to 91.2\%. The model performs slightly better on older than on younger drivers, but no gender difference was found.},

However, road users that do not communicate their planned activities can create dangerous situations, so prediction models are needed to foresee and anticipate their motions in the drivable space. Various prediction methods exist, either physics-based, data-based or hybrids, but they all make conservative assumptions about others’ intentions, or they are developed using unrealistic data, and it is unclear how they perform for trajectory prediction. In this work, we introduce and demonstrate an optimal hybrid framework that overcomes these limitations, by combining the predictions of several physics-based and data-based models. Using on-road measured data we show that this novel framework outperforms the individual models in both longitudinal and lateral position predictions. We also discuss the required prediction boundaries from a safety perspective and estimate the accuracies of the models in relation to automated vehicle functions. The results achieved by this method will enable increased safety, comfort and even more proactive reactions of the automated vehicles.},

A new algorithm called Circuit Interference Reduction - Minimum Allocation Slots (CIR-MAS) is presented in this work. This algorithm seeks to select a modulation format that is more resistant circuit interferences (established circuits on the networks). Also it selects a route with the minimum allocation slots among the alternative routes, in order to reduce the blockage caused by degradation of circuits. The performance of the CIR-MAS algorithm was evalueted on the NSFNet and EON topologies by comparing with the following algorithms: K-Shortest Path Computation (KS-PC), Modified Dijkstra Path Computation (MD-PC) and K-Shortest Path with Reduction of QoTO (KSP-RQoTO), wich have already been presented in the literature. The CIR-MAS algorithm presented a minimum gain of 40.5\% in terms of circuit blocking probability, and in terms of bandwidth blocking probability, it obtained a minimum gain of 37.5\% when compared all competing algorithms.},

We solve this problem by leveraging programming-by-example data transformations, sketching data structures such as bloom filters, and leveraging entity resolution rules. The paper proposes to use programming-by-example data transformations along with reducing the size of examples generated for it. We build upon current work to involve the user in the process of making PBE examples. The paper also proposes to use sketching data structures for the database completion process under dynamic rules, along with reducing their numbers and sizes of them. We again build upon existing work to involve the user in the process of making a summary on an incomplete database, which also increases efficiency.

Containers are a form of lightweight virtualization that can be used to provide cloud services. Adopting this kind of technology in a bare- metal context is becoming strong because they can offer many benefits, like performance efficiency and costs reduction. Docker is a widespread platform for the creation and management of containers. As in any computational cloud service, Docker environments must deal with the intensive workload and may have a long-term life cycle, which might trigger some problems that compromise the system dependability. The software aging phenomenon is one of these likely problems. It is a process of cumulative errors or system misbehavior that leads to application failures and performance degradation throughout its runtime. This paper aims to monitor and evaluate software aging effects on the Docker platform in a cloud computing environment. We conducted two experimental studies with automated workloads to simulate containers&#39; life cycle and the intensive use of Docker features, while the system was monitored. The results show high resource consumption by the operating system&#39;s network utility, in addition to memory fragmentation in the sub-processes of the Docker platform. Trends of increasing resident memory consumption were also observed in one of these scenarios.},

A gap exists in the literature for solo or swarm-based drones to identify radio frequency spectrum attacks. Any non-delivery specific function, such as attack sensing, added to a drone involves a weight increase and additional complexity; therefore, the value must exceed the disadvantages.

  abstract  = {Network virtualization recognized as an enabling technology for the forthcoming networks is utterly popular. One of the main challenges of network virtualization is called the virtual network embedding problem. Virtual network embedding (VNE) aims to allocate a set of virtual machines onto a set of interconnected physical hardware in the cloud computing environment. Traditional exact solutions, considered as a time-consuming process to achieve a global optimal solution, have been proofed to be NP-hard. On the other hand, some existing heuristic solutions tend to decouple VNE problems into two stages: virtual node mapping (VNoM) and virtual link mapping (VLiM). Undoubtedly, these kinds of decomposition would result in low acceptance ratio and inefficient substrate resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a distributed parallel Genetic Algorithm combined with graph theory for solving VNE in one-stage.

  abstract  = {Describing an image with natural sentence without human involvement requires knowledge of both image processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most of the existing works are based on unimodal representations of the visual and textual contents using an Encoder-Decoder (EnDec) Deep Neural Network (DNN), where the input images are encoded using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the caption is generated by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This paper dives into a basic image captioning model to quantify the impact of multimodal representation of the visual and textual cues. The multimodal representation is carried out via an early fusion of encoded visual cues from different CNNs, along with combined textual features from different word embedding techniques. The resultant of the multimodal representation of the visual and textual cues are employed to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based baseline caption generator to quantify the impact of various levels of complementary feature mutations. The ablation study involves two different CNN feature extractors and two types of textual feature extractors, shows that exploitation of the complementary information outperforms the unimodal representations significantly with endurable timing overhead.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a deceptive version of guarding a territory in a grid world is proposed. Like the original version, a defender tries to intercept an invader before it invades the targets. However, the discerning invader can deceive the defender about its real goal so that it can improve its performance. On the other hand, the defender tries to confront the invader by guessing its true goal. A two-level policy is obtained via reinforcement learning (RL). In the lower level, the invader and the defender learn their optimal policies to invade or defend a particular territory. In the higher level, the invader learns which territory it should pretend to invade in order to manipulate the defender&#39;s belief function. A multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is implemented for obtaining the optimal policies via the minimax Q-learning algorithm at the lower level. Whereas for the higher-level policy a single-agent Q-learning algorithm is utilized. Results of different reward functions are compared. The results show that the invader can improve its performance by taking advantage of deception.},

  abstract  = {Decreasing birth rates and an aging population in society often cause labor shortages in the manufacturing industry, making the development of methods to improve productivity based on limited human resources imperative. One way to achieve this is by enhancing product quality via the reduction of product losses and the consequent need for reassembly due to human error. Human error during assembly can arise from specific actions via the arms and fingers. We assumed that these errors can be captured based on the information on human skeletal models. The purpose of this study is to propose and develop a system that acquires information about assembly procedures by using human skeletal models, including the fingers of workers, and notifies them of skipped procedures and errors in part types. Further, we confirm the basic capability of the proposed system via experiments based on simulated assembly work. The proposed system monitors workers&#39; motion based on color and depth images captured by a single RGB-D camera. In addition, we developed a function to detect the process and to point out errors with audible and visual feedbacks when errors were made by workers in assembly processes. In the experiment using simulated assembly work, the proposed system exhibited an accuracy rate of 98.3\% with respect to acquisition of assembly processes. In the case of an error in an assembly process, the system was able to point out the error correctly and provide feedback to the worker before he had finished picking up the wrong part. In conclusion, we confirmed that the developed system exhibited the basic capability to acquire work procedures and efficiently point out errors in real time.},

The autonomous driving needs to make consideration of the driver individuality in addition to safety. This paper considers a human-machine cooperative system balancing safety with the driver individuality using the Human-In-The-Loop System (HITLS) for rear-wheel steering control. This paper assumes that it is safe for HITLS to follow the target side-slip angle and target angular velocity without conflicts between the controller and driver operations. We propose HITLS using the primal-dual algorithm and the internal model control (IMC) type I-PD controller. In HITLS, the signal expander delimits the human-selectable operating range and the controller cooperates stably the human operation and automated control in that range. The primal-dual algorithm realizes the driver and the signal expander. Our outcomes are the making of the rear-wheel steering system which converges to the target value while reflecting the driver individuality.},

We first formulate the total cost minimization problem as a Markov game, and then a novel household loads energy consumption scheduling algorithm is proposed based on Mutil-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG). It is worth mentioning that the proposed algorithm can achieve cooperation between agents so that it can meet the peak power-limiting constraint.

Soft robotic hands have been proposed for safe grasping due to their passive compliance, but even such a hand can crush objects if the applied force is too high. Thus for safe grasping, regulating the grasping force is of uttermost importance even with soft hands. In this work, we present a force controlled soft hand and use it to achieve safe grasping. To this end, resistive force and bend sensors are integrated in a soft hand, and a data-driven calibration method is proposed to estimate contact interaction forces. Given the force readings, the pneumatic pressures are regulated using a proportional-integral controller to achieve desired force. The controller is experimentally evaluated and benchmarked by grasping easily deformable objects such as plastic and paper cups without neither dropping nor deforming them. Together, the results demonstrate that our force controlled soft hand can grasp deformable objects in a safe yet stable manner.},

This paper presents a systematic background flow sensing framework, which plays an important role in improving the navigation/control intelligence of AUVs. This flow sensing framework utilizes distributed pressure measurements of AUVs to estimate surrounding flow fields. The proposed method first determines the flow pattern/model around AUVs based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum analysis and then uses recursive Bayesian estimation and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based modeling to identify model parameters. This method is capable of sensing background flow fields even in flow pattern changing environments, e.g., open waters in real-world scenarios, thus dramatically expanding the application scope of the existing flow sensing methods. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed flow sensing method.},

  abstract  = {Driving a car is a complex and potentially risky activity in people&#39;s everyday life, and it requires the full involvement of physiological and cognitive resources. Any loss of these resources can cause traffic accidents. For example, drowsy driving affects the ability to adapt, predict and react to unexpected events. A solution to this problem is the adoption of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), which can warn the driver if sleepiness is detected. Thus, they should include a Driver Monitoring System (DMS) to understand, measure and monitor human behaviour in different scenarios. This article is focused on detecting driver drowsiness by using non-intrusive measures such as the behavioural approach, as it is the most promising solution to use in real vehicles. The developed framework allows the extraction of drowsiness-related measures by analysing the driver&#39;s face with a standard camera. First, a face detection stage identifies the driver face in a video frame. Then, a set of facial landmarks locations are identified. These landmark points are used to estimate the head orientation and to detect when a blink occurs. By monitoring properly defined ocular variables, the degree of driver drowsiness is detected through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS).},

The method involves applying an alternating current to the sample and measuring its electric impedance at various frequencies. The spectrum is fit to a equivalent electric circuit that mimics the shape of the tissue&#39;s impedance spectrum. The model parameters are then used for classification. This paper proposes a new solution to decompose the model fitting problem into a form suitable for multi-objective optimisation, from which all the non-dominated solutions are used to form the database of parameters for a given tissue, as opposed to a single solution that is typically seen in impedance spectroscopy. The solution explores the use of the reference point dominance condition within Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to fit the data to the double dispersion Cole model. Each non-dominated solution contain values for the dispersion model elements. The multiple parameter value solutions from the optimiser are used as features in a weighted Naïve Bayes classifier to identify a new tissue sample. Experiments results in 3 different tissue samples shows that the method is successful in correctly labelling the data with an average accuracy of 89\%.},

Legged robots are able to move across irregular terrains, however, have an issue on energy efficiency compared with other morphology. A bio-inspired approach often provides effective solutions, for example, a lizard is able to mainly walk by utilizing only twisting its waist. To mimic this characteristic by robotics, a robot consisting of four-bar linkage mechanism is proposed. This idea improves simplification of its locomotion analysis. In this paper, two important kinematics characteristics are analyzed in order to propose locomotion ability and effectiveness of the robot. In particular, a turning angle and a stride distance are analysed. After that, a trajectory tracking control system is designed based on the PID control low. Ideas for the control system design in this paper are both to decide an bias of an input angle function as a input of the system and to set a control period on half period of the input angle function. Finally, effectiveness of the designed control system is verified via numerical simulations. A straight line and a circle trajectory are adopted for the verification. As the results, it is shown that the designed trajectory tracking control system is capable of tracking two different trajectory. In addition, it is also shown that the designed trajectory tracking control system satisfies the kinematics analysis results from the side of view of the kinematic of the robot.},

However, measuring nasal temperature is time-consuming because of the manual detection of the nasal position in infrared (IR) images.

Based on experiments conducted using simulators, the automatic measurement of nasal temperature using both motion-sensing devices and an IR camera has been demonstrated.

CAV&#39;s benefits are promising, and this has led to an increasing interest in the literature. Despite different levels of autonomy, people might stay (to some extent) on the control of CAV, because full autonomy remains rare in transportation. Consequently, human errors are vulnerabilities that remain as potential reasons for malware infections in CAV. Usability becomes a vital attribute to mitigate the occurrence of such errors or prevent them from occurring. We aimed to understand users&#39; expectations of privacy towards CAV&#39;s most autonomous levels, part of users&#39; satisfaction and CAV&#39;s usability. Our survey gathered 50 responses, among 40 vehicle owners and ten non-owners. Responses showed six tendencies of users&#39; behavior about CAV and its privacy issues.

  abstract  = {The use of machine learning algorithms is surging in industrial condition-based maintenance systems. However, machine learning algorithms are often considered a black box undermining the adoption of these systems by creating human-automation interaction challenges. To address this opacity issue, we must explain and describe the logic and outcome of the algorithms (known as explainability and transparency). Existing design practices are not effective in meeting these requirements; thus, more user-based experiments should be conducted to identify effective design practices. Experimental platforms that support the empirical validation of transparency and explainability approaches are extremely limited both in academia and industry. We propose an open-source platform to assist researchers in conducting human-subjects experiments.},

  abstract  = {Data exfiltration is a serious threat to organizations. Such exfiltrations cause breach events that can lead to millions of dollars of loss. Perimeter defense is not enough by itself since successful exploits from insiders can also be very damaging. Internal network user activities need to be monitored to detect malicious actions. Automatic machine learning methods can be applied for network anomaly detection, but they create a lot of false alarms. Domain experts can identify malicious users, but they are unable to process large volumes of data. Interactive machine learning (iML) deals with this tradeoff by creating an efficient collaboration between domain experts and machine learning algorithms. Previous research in iML has focused mainly on collaboration with non-experts. The design and requirements for expertise-driven iML have yet to be delineated for cybersecurity applications. In this research, we proposed an Active Learning (AL) model trained with outputs from a liberal (outputting many false alarms as well as possible hits) anomaly detection (AD) criterion to study expert-iML collaboration in anomaly detection. The results showed that: iML in this context can prune false alarms and minimize misses; the performance/compatibility tradeoff that typically occurs in conventional machine learning updates may be less salient in iML. We suggest that compatibility between experts and algorithms can be improved by presenting information about feature relevance during the training process.},

In comparison with the conventional meter measurement, HDRI-assisted lighting measurement is a remote, efficient, affordable yet time-consuming method. The fast HDRI technique increases the film speed (ISO) to speed up the process taking a sequence of low dynamic range images. Since increasing camera&#39;s film speed may introduce more image noise, the possible error rate of the proposed method is evaluated by applying Gaussian noise estimation and impulsive noise detection on the image with different film speeds. In addition, a new per-pixel calculation process is developed to retrieve the illuminance of a target scene with selected regions of interest, which can be used to assist human-centric lighting tasks. Extensive comparative experiments are also conducted to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.},

However, wearable robotics increases the risk from falling. Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence for the involvement of frontocentral and parietal cortices in postural control and this opens up the possibility of using decoders for early detection of balance loss by using electroencephalography (EEG). This study investigates the presence of commonly identified components of the perturbation evoked responses (PEP) when a person is in an exoskeleton. We also evaluated the feasibility of using single-trial EEG to predict the loss of balance using a convolution neural network. Overall, the model achieved a mean 5-fold cross-validation test accuracy of 75.2\% across six subjects with 50\% as the chance level. We employed a gradient class activation map-based visualization technique for interpreting the decisions of the CNN and demonstrated that the network learns from PEP components present in these single trials. The high localization ability of Grad-CAM demonstrated here, opens up the possibilities for deploying CNN for ERP/PEP analysis while emphasizing on model interpretability.},

  abstract  = {Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a higher cognitive dysfunction that can occur after a stroke. It is defined as an impairment in finding, reporting, reacting to, and directing stimuli opposite the damaged side of the brain. We have proposed a system to identify neglected regions in USN patients in three dimensions using three-dimensional virtual reality. The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to propose a system for numerically identifying the neglected regions using an object detection task in a virtual space, and second, to compare the neglected regions during object detection when the patient&#39;s neck is immobilized (`fixed-neck&#39; condition) versus when the neck can be freely moved to search (`free-neck&#39; condition). We performed the test using an immersive virtual reality system, once with the patient&#39;s neck fixed and once with the patient&#39;s neck free to move. Comparing the results of the study in two patients, we found that the neglected areas were similar in the fixed-neck condition. However, in the free-neck condition, one patient&#39;s neglect improved while the other patient&#39;s neglect worsened. These results suggest that exploratory ability affects the symptoms of USN and is crucial for clinical evaluation of USN patients.},

When humans assume a supervisory or tactician role in managing the robot swarm, the humans&#39; (physiological) state significantly affects the mission performance. In this work, we explore the physiological correlates with the user&#39;s tactical decisions in a simulated search and rescue mission. The mission consists of supervising three groups of unmanned aerial vehicles and three groups of unmanned ground vehicles to search for a target building. The mission complexity is increased by introducing static adversarial teams.Due to the adversarial team&#39;s presence, the user should employ different tactics to search for a target. While the user interacts with the swarm, brain activity in forms of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movements are recorded. 20 participants, with prior experience in playing real-time strategy games, took part in the study. A linear mixed effect model is used to study the correlated physiological features and tactical decisions. Six features are extracted from the physiological data: engagement level, mental workload, Fz-Pz coherence, Fz-O1 coherence, pupil size, and the number of gaze fixations. The results show that mental engagement and Fz-O1 coherence are the important factors in predicting the tactical decisions. Specifically, Fz-O1 coherence in Beta (22.5-30 Hz) and Gamma (38-42 Hz) band is found to be significant.},

  abstract  = {Due to the challenges of autonomous driving, for the near future, automated vehicles will not be able to drive in all conditions without any human intervention. The challenge arises when no human driver is inside the vehicle to resolve the challenging situation. One solution for this might be teleoperation, here a remote operator takes control over the car and resolves the situation from a distance. But teleoperation technology itself comes with certain challenges, one of them being creating a good situational awareness at the operator site based on the sensor data transmitted from the automated vehicle. To understand this challenge better, in this paper a five-week long-time study is conducted with the goal of measuring the impact of different displays, video-canvases and -streaming quality on situation awareness, workload and decision making. The objective results show a significant impact of video streaming quality on various factors of situation awareness. On the other hand the subjective results such as workload, immersion, usability and presence indicate that video streaming quality only has an impact in situations with high contrasts and over all scenes the impact of video quality on subjective satisfaction is not significant. Between the three display modes no significance regarding quality was found. However, the participants preferred the head mounted display over the other options even though the results indicate that the head mounted display is most sensitive to changes in video streaming quality.},

  abstract  = {Machine learning based acute stress detection systems use physiological sensor data to objectively predict acute stress. However, machine learning algorithms developed for stress detection do not consider how machine learning algorithm performance may be affected based on a change(s) in the deployment environment. In this study, the deployment environment changes that are investigated are sensor type and sensor placement. Electrodermal activity (EDA) and skin temperature (TEMP) data from two different sensors, the RespiBAN Professional (RespiBAN) and the Empatica E4 are used to train three different machine learning models. The RespiBAN records the EDA data from the rectus abdominis and records the skin TEMP data from the sternum. The Empatica E4 sensor records both EDA and skin TEMP data from the wrist. Three different support vector machine (SVM) models were trained to classify no-stress versus stress states using EDA and skin TEMP data. The first model was trained using data from the RespiBAN wearable sensor (SVM-R), the second model was trained using data from the Empatica E4 sensor (SVM-E) and third model was trained using data from both sensors (SVM-RE). The accuracy of SVM-R on a test set recorded by the RespiBAN sensor was 100\%. The accuracy of SVM-E on a test set recorded by the Empatica E4 sensor was 99\%. The accuracy of SVM-RE on a test set recorded by both the RespiBAN and Empatica E4 sensor was 82\%. The accuracy of the SVM-R on a test set recorded by the Empatica E4 was 64\%. These results suggest that research and development cannot be hardware or placement agnostic with wearable sensing data. Sensor type and placement must be taken into consideration when reporting performance metrics of physiological based stress detection machine learning algorithms.},

This mirroring effect can help determine the level of comfort or the extent of engagement and genuine interest between two or more interlocutors. In this work, using an annotated dataset consisting of videos of three-person conversations, we aim to analyze the extent of rapport in each of the triadic groups. We generate behavioral curves from features extracted from the participants&#39; face and body movements. These are the sampled time series signals resulting from their multimodal features. Next, the extents of synchrony are analyzed by aligning the behavioral curves of pairs of participants. The alignment tests show that basic correlation coefficient measures outperform more advanced curve matching techniques when used to estimate the similarities between multidimensional behavior curves. They also show that in this dataset, synchrony is better observed from facial expressions than body movements. For this reason, using facial action units, we show that an end-to-end recursive neural network (RNN) trained using a regression loss yields good results in predicting the extent of synchrony in small groups.},

All data were stored in single ROSbag files rather than in conventional Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. This not only ensures synchronization of signals and videos in a data set, but also allows researchers to easily analyze and verify their algorithms by connecting directly to this dataset through ROS. The generated affective dataset consists of 1,602 ROSbag files, and the size of the dataset is about 787GB. The dataset is made publicly available.

The research of Personality Computing shows that it is possible to recognize personality automatically from texts (TB-APR), using paradigms of supervised learning. As concerns these paradigms, texts need to be labeled by psychometric instruments and, in order to realize this task, personality inventories are used. Personality inventories display great facilities for application and correction, but they do not evince efficient ways of controlling intentional or non-conscious omissions of undesired personality characteristics by the individual, which may explain the low correlations found in literature regarding TB-APR models. In this article, we propose the labeling of a textual corpus using the Z-test projective instrument, in order to mitigate the limitations of inventories, since it is very sensitive and offers the possibility of collective application. The proposed model used bag-of-words techniques, with some state of art machine learning inductors. The results are promising, with AUC-ROC on 0.85 average.},

  abstract  = {Micro-expression (ME) recognition is an effective method to detect lies and other subtle human emotions. Machine learning-based and deep learning-based models have achieved remarkable results recently. However, these models are vulnerable to overfitting issue due to the scarcity of ME video clips. These videos are much harder to collect and annotate than normal expression video clips, thus limiting the recognition performance improvement. To address this issue, we propose a micro-expression video clip synthesis method based on spatial-temporal statistical and motion intensity evaluation in this paper. In our proposed scheme, we establish a micro-expression spatial and temporal statistical model (MSTSM) by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of micro-expressions and deploy this model to provide the rules for micro-expressions video synthesis. In addition, we design a motion intensity evaluation function (MIEF) to ensure that the intensity of facial expression in the synthesized video clips is consistent with those in real -ME. Finally, facial video clips with MEs of new subjects can be generated by deploying the MIEF together with the widely-used 3D facial morphable model and the rules provided by the MSTSM. The experimental results have demonstrated that the accuracy of micro-expression recognition can be effectively improved by adding the synthesized video clips generated by our proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Genetic Programming (GP) is an evolutionary method for automatic programming. In recent years, crossover operators based on the semantics of programs have attracted much attention for improving the search efficiency. We have previously proposed a semantics-based crossover that deterministically generates an optimal offspring by utilizing the target semantics explicitly in symbolic regression problems. The GP method using this crossover is called Deterministic Geometric Semantic GP (D-GSGP). However, this operation may cause rapid convergence of the population. One of the ways to maintain diversity is to use an improved selection method. ε-Lexicase Selection is a method to select individuals based on their responses to a part of fitness cases. D-GSGP has a high affinity with ε-Lexicase Selection because the responses to a part of fitness cases are components of the semantics of the program. Therefore, in this research, we combine D-GSGP and ε-Lexicase Selection to maintain the diversity of the population. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we applied the method to a practical symbolic regression problem, the Boston Housing Dataset.},

  abstract  = {PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) is attracting attention in recent years to solve the multivariate optimization problems. In PSO, multiple individuals (particles) which records its own position and velocity information are placed in the corresponding search space, and the particle swarm move to discover the optimal solution by sharing information with other particles. The search process of PSO has problem such that it is difficult to deviate from the local solution because of convergence speed of the swarms is too fast. In TCPSO (Two-Swarm Cooperative PSO), particle swarm consists of two different types of particles (a master particle swarm and a slave particle swarm) with different characteristics of search process. Experimental results of using several benchmark problems indicate that TCPSO has high performance of finding optimal solutions for multidimensional and nonlinear problems. This study introduces the concept of specificity of each master particle which indicates the diversity of master particle swarm, and proposes an algorithm that improves the efficiency of the solution search process in TCPSO by periodically analyzing the behavior of master particle swarm. This study conducts several numerical experiments for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {As many real-world optimization problems are large-scale and expensive, the large search space and expensive gradient computation may lead to failure of metaheuristic and classical algorithms. The problem even gets more crucial as we move from continuous domain to the discrete or mixed type one, because most of the discrete optimization problems are NP-hard and cannot be treated as convex or linear optimization, therefore there exists no cost-effective algorithm to cope with large-scale discrete global optimization (LSDGO) problems. However, due to the low memory demand and computational cost of coordinate descent (CD) search methods they are appropriate algorithms for optimizing large-scale expensive problems. In this paper, we propose a discrete version of CD algorithm called Discrete Coordinate Descent (DCD) as an effective method for solving LSDGO problems. Our proposed algorithm makes the most of two essential phases referred to as finding the region of interest and folding the search space, which shrinks it into two halves per variable and results in ${\left( {\frac{1}{2}} \right)^D}$ shrinking of the whole search space at each iteration (D indicates the problem&#39;s dimension). Since the proposed algorithm shrinks the search space rapidly, it requires a low computational budget to find the optimal value for each coordinate. In order to investigate the efficiency of our algorithm precisely, we tested it on 20 well-known large-scale problems with dimensions of 30, 50, 100, and 1000. The results demonstrate the potency of DCD not only in low-scale discrete problems, but in large-scale discrete optimization problems as well.},

  abstract  = {The tactile properties of objects are important for robotic dexterous manipulation. An increasing number of attempts have recently been made to enable tactile information processing in robotic hand via tactile sensors. However, it remains relatively unexplored how to build tactile information processing models. In this study, we aimed to develop a spiking neural network (SNN) based on neural information processing mechanisms in sensory afferents. The SNN processes electrical signals collected from tactile sensor arrays attached to the gripper of the robotic hand while grasping objects with different shapes. We converted each of 42 -channel sensor signals from 2 arrays of 21 sensors into a spike train using the Izhikevich model, which was then fed to the SNN. The synaptic weights of the SNN were learned by the Hebbian learning through pair-based spike timing- dependent plasticity (STDP) algorithm. In addition, we implemented lateral inhibition of the second-layer neurons based on unsupervised learning similar to the one used in self-organizing maps, resulting in a winner-takes-all network. By this unsupervised learning, SNN could learn to discriminate the shape of objects via tactile sensing. In particular, it demonstrated object shape recognition with 100\% accuracy. The proposed model could be useful for robots manipulating objects with tactile senses.},

  abstract  = {Image hiding, one of the most important data hiding techniques, is widely used to enhance cybersecurity when transmitting multimedia data. In recent years, deep learning-based image hiding algorithms have been designed to improve the embedding capacity whilst maintaining sufficient imperceptibility to malicious eavesdroppers. These methods can hide a full-size secret image into a cover image, thus allowing full-image-to-image hiding. However, these methods suffer from a trade-off challenge to balance the possibility of detection from the container image against the recovery quality of secret image. In this paper, we propose Camouflage Generative Adversarial Network (Cam-GAN), a novel two-stage coverless full-image-to-image hiding method named, to tackle this problem. Our method offers a hiding solution through image synthesis to avoid using a modified cover image as the image hiding container and thus enhancing both image hiding imperceptibility and recovery quality of secret images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cam-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art full-image-to-image hiding algorithms on both aspects.},

This fragility exposes CNNs to malicious attacks, resulting in safety concerns in many application domains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient strategy for decreasing the effectiveness of black-box attacks that need to sequentially query the classifier network in order to build an attack. The general idea consists of applying controlled random disturbances (noise) at the softmax output layer of neural network classifiers, changing the confidence scores according to a set of design requirements. To evaluate this defense strategy, we employ a CNN, trained on the MNIST data set, and attack it with a black-box attack method from the literature called ZOO. The results show that our defense strategy: a) decreases the attack success rate of the adversarial examples; and b) forces the attack algorithm to insert larger perturbations in the input images.},

This work addresses the challenge of classifying such short video clips, using a domain-specific feature design approach, capable of performing significantly well using little training data. The method is based on Gunner Farneback dense optical flow (GF-OF) estimation strategy, Gaussian mixture models, and information divergence. We first aim to obtain accurate 3D representations of the human movements/actions through clustering the results given by GF-OF using K-means method of vector quantization. We then proceed by representing the result of one instance of each action by a Gaussian mixture model. Furthermore, using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence), we attempt to find similarities between the trained actions and the ones in the test videos. Classification is done by matching each testing video to the trained action with the highest similarity (lowest KL-divergence). We have performed experiments on the KTH and Weizmann Human Action datasets, and the results reveal the discriminative nature of our proposed methodology in comparison with other state of the art techniques.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm in which a control is learned automatically based on rewards through trial and error based on rewards. When reinforcement learning is employed for robot control, the action that is output by reinforcement learning and the input of the actuator are often the same. A robot&#39;s actuator has a time constant of a first-order delay element between input and output. Delays result in the deterioration of the reinforcement learning performance because the environments that contain them lack the Markov property. Although there have been studies of such environments, they are problematic in that performance deteriorates when the time constant of a first-order time-delay element greater than the control cycle. The principal contribution of this paper is to propose a compensator for reinforcement learning that is more effective than conventional methods for environments with a time constant of a first-order time-delay element greater than the control cycle. The purpose of the compensator is to minimize the difference between actions in delayed environments and those not in delayed environments. Experiments reveal that the compensator increases rewards within wider ranges than conventional methods.},

This work presents a two-level sampling strategy for pruning methods that are applied to the credit scoring task. The first step of the proposal is to generate a pool using two well-known sampling methods, bagging and random subspace, that work complementarity in order to produce a diverse pool. After, a pruning method reduces the generated pool maintaining only the most competent classifiers. So, the proposal improves the MCS regarding the accuracy and the computational effort, since only a small percentage of the original pool is stored. The proposed architecture is evaluated in a credit scoring application, and the results showed that the proposed architecture obtained better accuracy rates than the single best approach and literature methods. These results were also obtained with ensembles whose sizes were around 20\% of the original pools generated in the training phase.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of representing a multiple-criteria (i.e., multiple heterogeneous measurements) object by a single value that we can use to compare and rank different objects. An intrinsic characteristic of the multiple-criteria is their different nature (e.g., high quality and low price), and thus, the ranking process is vastly dependent on the decision-makers&#39; preferences and viewpoints. The different criteria denote a severe problem to find an overall value to represent the trade-offs of an object.For example, is it possible to represent the different criteria of a car by a single number and utilize this number to rank different cars in single and multiple decision-makers settings? To answer this question, we extend our proposed method to calculate a weight vector of the Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) operator based on the Laplace distribution [1] and use it to illustrate how to rank a dataset of used cars, and we compare the results with six other OWA operators. In this paper, we prove the characteristics of the new operator and illustrate its benefits in single and multiple decision-making settings. Finally, to find out how well the new OWA operator can represent the information per object; we employ the values produced by the new OWA in a regression model to estimate the used car price.},

Recently, several approaches based on an allocation of information granularity have been proposed for supporting it.

However, they do not take into account that the adjusted preferences could be very different from the preferences communicated by the individuals. Furthermore, they cannot be applied in decision problems where various criteria are considered to evaluate the choices. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a new consensus approach based on minimum adjustment for multi-criteria group decision making with an allocation of information granularity.

  abstract  = {Group Key Agreement (GKA) mechanisms play a crucial role in realizing various applications in different networks, such as sensor networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). To be suitable for IoT, a GKA must satisfy several critical requirements. First, a GKA must be robust against a compromised device attack and satisfy essential secrecy definitions without the existence of a Trusted Third Party (TTP). TTP is often used by IoT devices to establish ad hoc networks securely, and usually, these devices are resource-constrained. Second, the GKA must be able to distribute session keys successfully, even with offline devices. Third, a GKA must reduce the burden of heavy cryptographic computations for IoT devices. Based on these observations, we propose a new GKA scheme that satisfies all the requirements above. The proposed scheme leverages smart contracts to alleviate the computational and storage overheads on IoT devices induced by cryptographic functions. It also brings the advantage of asynchronism such that offline devices will be able to compute the group key once they are online.},

  abstract  = {This article proposes a framework for calibrating parametric models according to data subject to uncertainty. Data uncertainty might be caused by a poor metrology system, measurement noise, model-form uncertainty or by the inability to directly measure the inputs and/or outputs of interest. The formulations developed, called Forward Maximum Likelihood (FML) and Inverse Maximum Likelihood (IML), are applicable to datasets with and without uncertainty. The FML approach performs the calibration in the space of the model&#39;s output thereby requiring repeated model simulations. Conversely, the IML approach leverages an ensemble of solutions to an inverse problem in order to perform the calibration in the space of the model&#39;s parameters. The potential loss of performance incurred by the IML approach is often justified by a sizable reduction in computational cost. In addition, we use chance-constrained optimization to eliminate the effects of outliers on the calibrated model. This practice yields a model that increases the likelihood of most of the data in exchange for a reduction in the likelihood of a few of the worst-performing data points. Metrics for evaluating the benefits and risks of outlier elimination are also presented.},

Factors including the distribution of initial emotion, credibility threshold, self-assertiveness and emotion decay function that might influence sentiment diffusion are analyzed, a novel concept of emotion fluctuation is introduced to predict agents’ behavior.

However, the influence of agents’ media literacy on the opinion evolution always have not been taken into consideration. Due to the differences in accessing, analyzing, and producing information between agents, the media literacy gap will evidently affect their communication in real life. In this paper, media literacy is introduced to improve the traditional HK model, and a novel opinion dynamics Hegselmann-Krause model with Media Literacy (HKML) is proposed. In our work we not only consider the confidence bound, but also consider the media literacy of agents. Agents under the HKML model can select and communicate with influential neighbors through a more accuracy criterion. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the HKML model breaks through the limit of the confidence bound, which makes more communication with less convergence time. Moreover, the HKML model shows strong robustness with the environmental noise.},

We propose a reinforcement learning approach to MPP for two manipulators, the first one of which tries to avoid collision with the second one. Initially, the first manipulator has no knowledge about the environment, but it successfully learns optimal collision-free paths through a Team Q-learning algorithm. We present experiments using two different methods for state discretization, namely General State (GS) Discretization and Tile Coding (TC) Discretization, as well as two different Q-learning methods, namely single-agent (SA) and multi-agent (MA) approaches.},

Then it is used by Bayesian estimation to learn an approximate optimal policy, which comprises the best past experience. The approach learns decision policy directly from the data without interacting with any supervisor/expert or using any reinforcement signal. The past experience may consider a decision objective different than the current one. Moreover the past decision policy need not to be optimal with respect to the past objective. We demonstrate our approach on simulated examples and show that the learned policy achieves better performance than optimal FPD policy whenever a mismodeling is present.},

  abstract  = {Time-sensitive safety-critical systems store traces as a collection of time-stamped messages that are generated while a system is operating. Analysis of these traces becomes a key task as it allows one to find faults or errors within a system that is otherwise difficult to discern, especially in complex systems. Furthermore, finding any form of anomalous behaviour becomes critical in time-sensitive and safety-critical systems where a late detection will often lead to dire consequences. Most available approaches are generally used in networking or business process analysis. We focus on creating a lightweight and explainable approach for time-sensitive safety-critical systems. By using a set of system traces under both normal and anomalous conditions, our approach attempts to classify whether or not a trace is anomalous. In this work, we introduce MA2DF, Multi-Agent Anomaly Detection Framework, a novel multi-agent based graph design approach for online and offline anomaly detection in system traces. Our approach takes advantage of the timing information between a sequence of events and also the event sequences to learn and discern between normal and anomalous traces. We present two approaches, an offline approach to discern anomalous behaviour by utilizing the event occurrence workflow graph. The second approach is an online streaming algorithm that monitors the sequence of events as they arrive in real-time. This can be used to detect anomalies, find the cause, and improve system resilience. We show how our approach, MA2DF, is superior to other state-of-the-art models. The paper will explore the technical feasibility and viability of MA2DF by utilizing industry strength case study using traces from a field-tested hexacopter.},

  abstract  = {Cognitive decline in aging is a pressing issue that can lead to long term functional impairments, including dementia. Computer-based cognitive training applications have been shown to improve cognitive skills, however, they often lack ecological validity. Researchers have proposed the use of Brain-Machine interface (BMI) systems as cognitive training tools but still face the limitation that the user cannot move freely while performing the cognitive training. Previously, we reported the successful use of a BMI system with a physical robotic third arm that allowed users to do multitasking by doing two tasks simultaneously, thereby engaging multiple cognitive skills such as attention switching, mental focus, coordination, decision making and visual information processing. In this paper, we present a cognitive training platform based on our previous multitasking paradigm with a BMI enhanced with a virtual reality (VR) experience. We conducted an experiment to investigate the efficiency of the proposed platform and monitored the level of accuracy and processing speed of the attention switching skill and compared to the traditional Attention Switching Task (AST) cognitive training paradigm. Preliminary experimental results showed that mean difference in attention accuracy scores were 3.96 s faster for the BMI-VR group compared to the AST group. Although there was a high degree of intersubject variability making the result not statistically significant, preliminary evidence reflects a potential for the proposed training approach to improve attention switching speed.},

  abstract  = {Drowsiness at the wheel is a major problem for traffic road safety. A drowsy driver suffers from decreased vigilance, increased reaction time and degraded decision-making ability, all of which have a huge impact on the driving performance. A driver monitoring system that warns the driver of his or her critical drowsiness state is a worthwhile contribution to traffic road safety. A drowsy driver typically exhibits some observable behaviors, such as eye blinking and head movements, that can be tracked using a camera. In this study, we analyze the potential of eye closure and head rotation signals, provided by a driver camera, to classify the driver’s drowsiness state using logistic regression models. This analysis is based on a large dataset collected from 71 subjects in driving simulator experiments. A reliable and independent reference for drowsiness, however, is required in order to perform this analysis. For this purpose, we devise a methodology that merges several drowsiness monitoring approaches to construct a reliable reference for drowsiness. Furthermore, we describe our approach to extract eye blink and head rotation features. Ultimately, we design logistic regression classifiers and combine them using the one-vs-one binarization technique. Our approach achieves a global balanced validation accuracy of 72.7\% on a three-class classification problem (awake, questionable and drowsy) by adopting a strict and rigorous evaluation scheme (i.e., leave-one-drive-out cross-validation).},
