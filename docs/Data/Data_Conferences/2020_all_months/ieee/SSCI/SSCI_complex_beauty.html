  abstract  = {Vehicle routing is a logistical combinatorics optimization problem where one attempts to find the best way to send out a fleet of delivery trucks. Evolutionary algorithms have been developed to solve this problem in the past and have demonstrated a strong efficacy with respect to organizing the route that each truck takes. In this paper, a novel representation which makes use of the adaptive generative representation for an evolutionary algorithm is presented; the representation achieves marginally better results at organizing efficient routes than the original adaptive generative representation for certain groupings of circumstances and performs competitively with it in the remainder of circumstances. The novel representation is a modification to the way that the fitness function interprets the chromosome, requiring no other algorithmic modifications. Rather than encoding the next destination in order along the chromosome, chromosome loci are tied to destinations and encode choices of next destinations from each loci.},

  abstract  = {Fleet optimisation can significantly reduce vehicular traversal of road networks cutting costs and increasing capacity. Reduced road use also leads to lower emissions and improved air quality, an increasingly important issue. Partial-ACO has previously shown promise in optimising vehicle fleets but issues remain over scalability. This paper demonstrates that increased numbers of ants improves results but with a quadratic computational cost. Consequently, this paper addresses this issue introducing two enhancements, sampling and multi-colony approaches. Whilst these are shown to reduce computational costs by up to 75\% solution quality is impacted. Hence, this paper concludes that small numbers of ants run for many more iterations provides the best scalability although with fewer ants a higher risk exists of becoming trapped in local optima. This setup yields fleet traversal reductions for real-world scenarios of over 50\% for up to 45 vehicles and 437 jobs. Moreover, using Partial-ACO, emissions of CO2 are cut by 3. 9Kg per vehicle a day improving air quality.},

  abstract  = {This paper considers the Lagrangian relaxation approach for the well-known multidimensional knapsack problem which maximises the total profits of selected items within the capacities of multiple resources. By relaxing “hard” constraints using Lagrangian multipliers, the Lagrangian relaxation approach provides a systematic framework for obtaining both the upper bound and the lower bound for hard combinatorial optimisation problems. Although tremendous efforts, both theoretical and computational, have been put into the study of the upper bound (assuming maximisation for the objective) for the Lagrangian relaxation approach, little attention has been drawn to the study of the impact of Lagrangian multipliers on the quality of the lower bound, or feasible solutions of the studied problem. In this paper, the lower bound problem is framed as an optimisation problem which chooses the best Lagrangian multipliers to obtain strong lower bound, i.e., good feasible solutions. A Bayesian optimisation approach is employed to solve this unconventional nonlinear optimisation problem. Computational experiments are carried out on the widely used benchmark instances with up to 250 items and 30 knapsack constraints. The preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution approach.},

  abstract  = {Workflow scheduling in the cloud is the process of allocating tasks to scarce cloud resources, with an optimal goal. This is often achieved by adopting an effective scheduling heuristic. Workflow scheduling in cloud is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, often existing works focus on static workflows, ignoring this challenge. Existing heuristics, such as MINMIN, focus mainly on one specific aspect of the scheduling problem. High-level heuristics are heuristics constructed from existing man-made heuristics. In this paper, we introduce a new and more realistic workflow scheduling problem that considers different kinds of workflows, cloud resources and high-level heuristics. We propose a High-Level Heuristic Dynamic Workflow Scheduling Genetic Programming (HLH-DSGP) algorithm to automatically design high-level heuristics for workflow scheduling to minimise the response time of dynamically arriving task in a workflow. Our proposed HLH-DSGP can work consistently well regardless of the size and pattern of workflows, or number of available cloud resources. It is evaluated using a popular benchmark dataset using the popular WorkflowSim simulator. Our experiments show that with high-level scheduling heuristics, designed by HLH-DSGP, we can jointly use several well-known heuristics to achieve a desirable balance among multiple aspects of the scheduling problem collectively, hence improving the scheduling performance.},

Particularly, hyper-heuristics have attracted the attention of researchers on this topic due to their promising results in this, and other optimization problems. A hyper-heuristic is a method that determines which heuristic to apply at each step while solving a problem. This investigation aims at rendering hyper-heuristics by combining unsupervised and reinforcement learning techniques. The proposed solution applies a clustering approach over the feature space, and then, it generates knowledge about heuristic selection through a reward-based system. Results show that our hyper-heuristics surmount competent heuristics, such as SPT and MRT, in various test instances. Besides, some of these hyper-heuristics outperformed the best result obtained among all the heuristics in more than 33\% of the instances. Hence, we believe that the proposed approach is promising and that more knowledge about its benefits and limitations should be derived through its application on different problems.},

  abstract  = {Parameter control and online algorithm selection are well-studied problems in heuristic-based optimization. The former adapts algorithm parameters at runtime, improving its quality; while the latter is often tackled with hyper-heuristics: problem-independent optimization algorithms, operating problem-dependent heuristics. Combining these two approaches is challenging: parameter control is algorithm-dependent, while the search space comprising multiple algorithms and their parameters is highly hierarchical and hard to model and traverse. In this paper we provide an approach to automatically select the best-performing algorithm and its configuration at runtime, combining the benefits of both parameter control and hyper-heuristics. Parameter control is realized with a surrogate-model-based approach, while the complex search space is treated by using individual surrogate models for each level in the hierarchy. We evaluate our approach with four instances of the symmetric traveling salesman problem. Our findings show that the presented approach is comparable with heuristics tuned offline and is highly recommended in cases when the best-performing heuristic is not known in advance.},

  abstract  = {The recent increase in volume and complexity of available astronomical data has led to a wide use of supervised machine learning techniques. Active learning strategies have been proposed as an alternative to optimize the distribution of scarce labeling resources. However, due to the specific conditions in which labels can be acquired, fundamental assumptions, such as sample representativeness and labeling cost stability cannot be fulfilled. The Recommendation System for Spectroscopic followup (RESSPECT) project aims to enable the construction of optimized training samples for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), taking into account a realistic description of the astronomical data environment. In this work, we test the robustness of active learning techniques in a realistic simulated astronomical data scenario. Our experiment takes into account the evolution of training and pool samples, different costs per object, and two different sources of budget. Results show that traditional active learning strategies significantly outperform random sampling. Nevertheless, more complex batch strategies are not able to significantly overcome simple uncertainty sampling techniques. Our findings illustrate three important points: 1) active learning strategies are a powerful tool to optimize the label-acquisition task in astronomy, 2) for upcoming large surveys like LSST, such techniques allow us to tailor the construction of the training sample for the first day of the survey, and 3) the peculiar data environment related to the detection of astronomical transients is a fertile ground that calls for the development of tailored machine learning algorithms.},

Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.},

  abstract  = {The prime mechanism governing the variability of pain perception across different subjects is still unexplored. This paper intends to develop a novel methodology to investigate this phenomenon using EEG signal analysis system. First, the EEG signals are procured from the scalp of subjects who are presented with three types of touch stimuli: heat, bristles and pinch with varying intensity levels. The raw brain signals acquired are analyzed using eLORETA software that confirms the involvement of primary somatosensory cortex and dorsal region of anterior cingulate cortex for this cognitive activity. Additionally, frequency analysis undertaken infers the participation of delta, alpha and theta bands for the said task. The signals are then transferred to a feature extraction module where a dual feature extraction strategy has been employed using Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the diversity of the feature set. The abstracted features are further evaluated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain the most important or optimal features. The reduced feature set is transferred to a novel General Type-2 fuzzy classifier that is able to precisely classify the distinct class labels and also outperforms its conventional counterparts. Hence, this method can help to assess the variability of pain perception amongst individuals whose communication modality is crippled due to scenarios pertaining to neurological disorders, anaesthetic treatments and the like. Moreover, the present scheme can be utilized as a neuronal marker to distinguish individuals suffering from extreme sensitivity towards pain from the healthy ones.},

  abstract  = {Short answer question is a common assessment tool eliciting a specific textual response for knowledge assessment. The divide-and-grade is an automated grading approach that uses clustering to assign answers into sets each of which is supposed to be sufficiently similar to receive the same grade. This approach can potentially produce accurate grading with significantly reduced manual grading effort. Many current clustering methods are known to suffer from the presence of anomalies, answers that are deviated from the modes of model answers or common misconceptions. The freedom afforded to the composition of answers often lead to these anomalies, and in particular, contextual anomalous answers that are marginally correct or wrong. This paper proposes an evolutionary clustering method for the divide-and-conquer approach. The method is coupled with anomalous answer recognition based on an entropy formulation of the cluster membership of answers for rectifying misclustered answers. The method has been evaluated with an open short answer grading dataset and the accuracy compares favorably with existing algorithms. Result analysis has suggested that the method can effectively leverage small manual grading effort on issues of great impact on short answer grading accuracy.},

The importance of clustering techniques in data mining has lead to the development of many methods in order to deal with data. Among these methods, we name density-based techniques, such as DBSCAN, that partitions data into heterogeneous shapes according to their local densities. DBSCAN can be suitable when handling big data that have noises and outliers. However, the classic DBSCAN method fails in identifying clusters with a variable density distribution and overlapping borders which is accurate in real-world data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning technique in an uncertain context, that combines the DBSCAN method and the framework of the belief function theory, in order to generate clusters having overlapping borders. The proposed evidential clustering method, that we called E-DBSCAN, has the ability to handle cluster membership degree uncertainty of objects by using the belief function theory.},

  abstract  = {As the uncertain nature of wind energy is the main reason behind inconsistency in functioning of the wind energy conversion systems (WECS), the accurate forecasting of wind characteristics such as wind speed and wind direction is helpful for more realistic and consistent results. Due to the efficiency in addressing long term temporal features and extreme nonlinearities, the authors have utilized Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) to model the wind characteristics in this work. However, the heuristic way of hyper-parameter selection (architecture design and activation function choice) in LSTMs makes their modelling inefficient and tedious. A novel algorithm to design LSTMs optimally by balancing the trade-off between number of parameters and accuracy, is, therefore, proposed. These LSTMs are utilized for long term forecasting by training on 4 years of real wind data with an accuracy of R 2 = 0.97. Further, to demonstrate the significance of accurate forecasting, the predictions are used to generate wind frequency maps, which forms the basis for energy calculations in WECS. These maps are subsequently used for calculating energy produced by a windfarm layout containing 37 turbines, where a recently developed Gaussian wake model is utilized for accounting the turbulence due to the presence of multiple turbines. The results and comparative studies have shown that realistic energy production is possible with the use of original and accurately forecasted data obtained from optimal LSTMs.},

  abstract  = {Embedded systems are finding their way into almost every aspects of our daily life from mp3 players and console games to the mobile phones. Different Artificial Intelligence (AI) based applications are commonly utilized in embedded systems from which computer vision based approaches are included. The demand for higher accuracy in computer vision applications is associated with the increased complexity of convolutional neural networks and the storage requirement for saving pre-trained networks. Different factors can lead to the data corruption in the storage units of the embedded systems, which can result in drastic failures due to the propagation of the errors. Hence, the development of software-based algorithms for the detection and recovery of data corruption is crucial for improvement and failure-prevention of embedded systems. This paper proposes a new algorithm for the recovery of the data in the case of single event upset (SEU) error. The association rule mining based algorithm will be used to find the probability of the corruption in each of the bits. The recovery algorithm was tested on four different pre-trained ResNet (ResNet32 and ResNet110 at two different accuracy levels each) and the best recovery rate of 66\% was found in the most complex scenario, i.e., random bit corruption. However, for the special cases of SEU errors, e.g. error in the frequently repeated bits, the recovery rate was found to be perfect with a value of 100\%.},

  abstract  = {Address event representation (AER) sensors, recording frameless event data, have recently attracted more attention due to the advantages of sparsed spatiotemporal representation. Spiking neural network (SNN) is a representative biologically plausible model, which is inherently suitable for event-driven AER data processing. However, AER object classification using SNN is still challenging due to the lack of robustness for free moving object recognition. This paper proposes a novel event-driven hierarchical recognition model using an activated connected domain (ACD) location method and an SNN classifier with fusion mechanism. The proposed model extracts bio-inspired cortex-like features by Gabor filters with multiple orientations and scales. Meanwhile, the ACD mechanism coordinates with feature extraction to obtain stable features under random movement of objects. Finally, the features are discriminated by the Tempotron classifier with feature fusion to reduce computing consumption while maintaining comparable performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on several AER datasets have shown superior performance of the proposed system. Besides, we extend the MNIST-DVS dataset to simulate random moving objects by adding a random continuous spatial offset to the event streams of its samples. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the ACD mechanism enriches the model recognizing capability for free moving objects, especially for training samples only with fixed trajectory movement, which reflects the applicability and robustness. This model equips a high potential for innovation and development in the recognition of moving objects in natural scenes.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the circuits for an edge-based bio-front-end implemented using an integrate-and-fire silicon neuron model in 22nm SOI CMOS Technology. The proposed implementation encodes both positive and negative input signals separately and, like its biological counterpart, provides asynchronous output. This asynchronous output allows for maximum sensitivity to high-information content input signals and low sensitivity for low-information content. In the proposed design, the firing rate can be controlled by an adaptation circuit to achieve maximum power savings. We demonstrate this design with a sinusoidal test signal and pre-recorded ECG signals. The proposed design achieves ultra-low-power consumption; by applying a sinusoidal input and ECG input the power consumption without adaptation (with adaptation) is 4. 069SnW(3.999nW) and 5. 1529nW (3.311SnW), respectively. In addition, the reconstruction of the ECG signal is demonstrated and the signal to error for the reconstructed ECG signal is 30.2 dB.},

  abstract  = {This paper aims to propose a new type of information-theoretic method to make collective weights, obtained by compressing all connection weights, easily interpretable. The collective weights are to be obtained by averaging all weights by different initial conditions and data subsets, where we need to stabilize the learning processes and the corresponding connection weights. For this purpose, we introduce the connective potential information reduction. The potential information is related to the concept of entropy, but it has a more concrete meaning of how many connection weights are connected with the corresponding neurons. When the potentiality is higher, the number of connection weights between neurons becomes larger. For improved interpretation, we need to reduce the potential information, because it is much easier to understand the inference mechanism with a smaller number of connection weights, though too much reduction may degrade generalization performance. For compromising between interpretation and generalization, we introduce the variance of potentiality, and we try to solve the contradiction of improved interpretation and generalization. We applied the method to the diabetic data set, where we first tried to show that the potential information could be reduced and at the same time the variance of potential information could be changed considerably in intermediate layers. Finally, those compressed weights over different initial conditions and different patterns were averaged to get the final collective weights for interpretation, which turned out to be ones showing easily interpretable, linear, and independent relations between inputs and targets.},

  abstract  = {AI has powerful capabilities in prediction, automation, planning, targeting, and personalisation. Generally, it is assumed that AI can enable machines to exhibit human-like intelligence, and is claimed to benefit to different areas of our lives. Since AI is fueled by data and is a distinct form of autonomous and self-learning agency, we are seeing increasing ethical concerns related to AI uses. In order to mitigate various ethical concerns, national and international organisations including governmental organisations, private sectors as well as research institutes have made extensive efforts by drafting ethical principles of AI, and having active discussions on ethics of AI within and beyond the AI community. This paper investigates these efforts with a focus on the identification of fundamental ethical principles of AI and their implementations. The review found that there is a convergence around limited principles and the most prevalent principles are transparency, justice and fairness, responsibility, non-maleficence, and privacy. The investigation suggests that ethical principles need to be combined with every stages of the AI lifecycle in the implementation to ensure that the AI system is designed, implemented and deployed in an ethical manner. Similar to ethical framework used in biomedical and clinical research, this paper suggests checklist-style questionnaires as benchmarks for the implementation of ethical principles of AI.},

  abstract  = {In many countries, it is illegal to make certain decisions based on sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This is because historically, sensitive attributes of individuals were exploited to abuse the rights of individuals, leading to unfair decisions. This view is extended to algorithmic decision-making systems (ADMs) where similar to humans, ADMs should not use sensitive attributes for input. We reject the extension of law from humans to machines, since contrary to humans, algorithms are explicit in their decisions, and the fairness of their decision can be studied independently of their input. The main purpose of this paper is to study and discuss the importance of using sensitive attributes in fair classification systems. Specifically, we suggest two statistical tests on the training dataset, to evaluate whether using sensitive attributes may have an impact on the quality and fairness of prospective classification algorithms. These statistical tests compare the distribution and data complexity of the training dataset between groups identified by the same value for sensitive attributes (e.g., men vs. women). We evaluated our fairness tests on several datasets. It was shown that, the removal of sensitive attributes may result in the decrease of the fairness of ADMs. The results were confirmed by designing and implementing simple classifiers on each dataset (with and without the sensitive attributes). Therefore, the use of sensitive attributes must be evaluated per dataset and algorithm, and ignoring them blindly may result in unfair ADMs.},

Based on historical mainstays and recent developments in deep learning, we study four dimensionality reduction techniques in this paper, namely Principal Component Analysis, Kernel Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders. We evaluate and compare these techniques based on quality assessments of the corresponding low dimensional surrogate models on a diverse range of test cases. These test cases are defined on combinations of three dimensionsalities, ten well-known benchmark problems from the continuous optimization domain and two surrogate modeling techniques, namely Kriging and Polynomials. Our results clearly demonstrate the superiority of Autoencoders and Principal Component Analysis on the criteria of modeling accuracy and global optimality respectively.},

Negative database is a new type of privacy protection technique. We proposed a promising method (called NDBIris) of iris template protection based on negative databases in previous work. However, its unlinkability is vulnerable under typical parameter settings (e.g. p 1 =0.8$,p_{2}$=0.14) and it does not protect the privacy of real-time iris data from users for recognition. This paper proposes an improved version called NDBIris-II to achieve better unlinkability and protect the real-time iris data. Specifically, a noninvertible transform using local sorting is performed before converting iris data into negative databases. Moreover, a method for estimating the similarity between iris data from negative databases is proposed to support effective iris recognition. Finally, an iris template in the form of negative database is generated for each iris data, and it is stored and used during iris recognition instead of raw iris data for privacy protection. Experimental results on iris database CASIA-IrisV3-Interval demonstrate that the proposed method could maintain recognition performance while achieving better unlinkability and protecting real-time iris data.},

Then, which method, GA or ACO, is fundamentally more suitable to RLO? To answer this question, in this paper, a comparative study on these two methods are carried out. The conclusion is then tested in a case study. Both methods are applied for the optimization of city air terminal locations in a large city of China, which is based on the urban road network and the passenger distribution from a survey.

  abstract  = {Relatively few surrogate-based methods have been developed for constrained expensive black-box optimization with discrete variables. Even more scarce are surrogate methods that can also be used for high-dimensional problems with hundreds of discrete variables. This paper develops the CONDOR algorithm for large-scale computationally expensive constrained optimization problems with ordinal discrete variables and many black-box inequality constraints. The algorithm builds multiple response surface or surrogate models to approximate the objective function and each of the constraint functions. The response surface models identify promising sample points for function evaluations from a large number of trial points in the neighborhood of the current best solution. The generation of trial points is controlled by two parameters, the probability of perturbing a variable and a depth parameter, which provides the maximum amount of discrete perturbation for each variable. Global and local variants of CONDOR are implemented using radial basis function (RBF) surrogates and are applied to a single-objective version of the large-scale Mazda benchmark problem with 222 discrete variables and 54 black-box inequality constraints using a simulation budget of only 10 times the number of decision variables. The CONDOR algorithms dramatically outperform global and local variants of an RBF-assisted Constrained Discrete Random Search method, the direct search method NOMAD and a genetic algorithm with various crossover fractions and yields a substantial improvement over an initial feasible design on the Mazda benchmark given the limited computational budget.},

Even with rapidly advancing technology and increasingly accessible hardware like smartphones, environmental traversal is still a huge challenge for them to have normal social activities such as meeting friends in a local neighborhood. This paper considers an intelligent method for a more accurate estimation of the users&#39; true location through adapting the particle filter algorithm with the sensed data provided by smartphones. The evaluation results clearly revealed that our proposed method can be a better alternative without any extra hardware. More importantly, it can enhance the navigational accuracy in the context of street navigation for the visually impaired.

Thereby, classification errors committed by a specialist can become more frequent. In this work, we propose a methodology for detecting possible labeling errors. For this, we use a classification technique capable of learning patient profiles in an unsupervised manner, then add semantic value to each profile by applying the majority voting technique. Our goal is to make a tool robust against labeling errors present in the data. We achieved a mean accuracy of 89.33\%, which is not an improvement considering this as a standalone tool. Then, we compare the labels with the labels provided by an artificial neural network trained in a supervised manner. We could experimentally find pieces of evidence of possible labeling errors in 9.14\% of this dataset samples. It shows that our contribution is valuable since it can indicate possible labeling errors.},

  abstract  = {Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is critical for predictive maintenance of machinery. Data-driven prognostics methods centered on deep learning are attracting ever-increasing attention. However, most existing methods mainly provide point estimates about RUL without quantifying predictive uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian models can offer a reliable framework for estimating predictive uncertainty, but these models require expensive computation cost. In this paper, we present a Bayesian framework based convolutional neural network (BCNN) that is easy to implement and can provide high-quality predictive uncertainty of RUL. The variational inference is adopted to approximate the posterior distribution over the model parameters. Then the approximating probability distribution is used for subsequent inference of newly observed data. The proposed method is validated using vibration signals obtained from the accelerated degradation of rolling element bearings. The time-frequency domain features are extracted from raw vibration signals using continuous wavelet transform. The results of the experiments show the effectiveness of the RUL prediction of machinery.},

  abstract  = {In contemporary practices, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based tools are increasingly applied to build high fidelity First Principles based Models (FPMs) for designing tactical missile systems. However, optimization, sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification using such models still remain to be extremely tedious and, hence, are performed offline. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are known to be efficient machine learning based models capable of modelling large amount of nonlinearities in the data. However, heuristics involved in their modelling prevent their application as surrogate models to computationally intensive FPMs. In this work, a novel algorithm, aimed at simultaneous optimal estimation of architecture (number of hidden layers and nodes in each layer), training sample size and activation function in ANNs is proposed. The proposed algorithm classifies as a generic multi-objective evolutionary neural architecture search strategy to design ANNs. It is solved using the population based evolutionary optimization algorithm called Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. The high fidelity data to train the ANNs are obtained from CFD model for simulating supersonic flow over a tactical missile body in ANSYS Fluent © . The obtained ANNs with a test set accuracy of around 99\% are then used for quantifying uncertainties, due to order of discretization, flux and Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in CFD simulations, on the coefficients of lift, drag and rolling moment using the method of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The applicability of optimally designed MLP surrogates for performing ANOVA based study presents novel insights into the epistemic uncertainties arising due to the CFD model which can help in realistic designs of tactical missiles.},

Experiments performed in a simulated environment tested various vehicle densities, ratios of autonomous versus Krauss-operated vehicles, and scenarios where the type of vehicle merging was adjusted. Metrics collected from the simulation include number of merges, collisions, the average merge lane speed, and the average highway or “nonmerging” speed.

  abstract  = {Wind energy is increasingly applied as a large scale clean energy generating alternative to fossil fuels. However, limited amount of real wind data results in inaccurate construction of Wind Frequency Maps (WFMs), which model the stochastic nature of wind. The inaccuracies in WFMs may lead to over or under estimation of wind power eventually causing significant losses to wind-farmers. Hence, to resolve this crisis, deep generative models such as convolutional Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are implemented in this work to enable accurate construction of WFMs from limited amount of real wind characteristics data. However, the heuristics based estimation of hyper-parameters in VAEs decrease their efficiency. Thus, in this work, a novel multi-objective evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) strategy is devised for simultaneously estimating the optimal number of convolutional and feedforward layers, number of filters/nodes in each layer, filter size, pooling option and nonlinear activation choice in VAEs. The proposed framework is designed to balance the conflicting objectives of generalizability and parsimony in VAEs, thereby reducing the chances of their over-fitting. The optimally designed VAE (with 92\% accuracy) is used to generate new wind frequency scenarios for accurate construction of WFM. Additionally, the effect of number of new scenarios required for accurate WFM construction is also studied while performing the comparison with an ideal case. It was found that WFM constructed with original limited data resulted in 9\% deficit in energy calculation from a single wind turbine, justifying the need for generative models such as VAEs for accurate wind characteristics modelling.},

Developing countries, such as India, have invested time, money, and effort into the proper development of smart cities. As there are different RE alternatives and several criteria used for its selection, researchers have adopted multi-criteria decision-making methods for systematic selection. Previous studies on RE selection did not (i) handle uncertainty effectively; (ii) calculate experts&#39; weights systematically, and (iii) consider interdependencies among experts during aggregation. Motivated by these lacunas, this paper develops a new decision framework. The framework utilizes generalized orthopair fuzzy information, which is flexible and provides rich scope for handling uncertainty. Additionally, a regret theory-based weight calculation method is proposed for systematic weight calculation. Finally, Score-based Muirhead mean is proposed for aggregation of preferences and ranking of REs. An actual case study in Tamil Nadu is presented to exemplify the usefulness of the framework. Comparison with extant models reveals the superiorities of the framework.},

ETA predictions are unreliable due to the lack of good quality historical data, while `live&#39; positions in mobile apps suffer from delays in data transmission. This study uses deep neural networks to predict the next position of a bus under various vehicle-location data-quality regimes. Additionally, we assess the effect of the target representation in the prediction problem by encoding it either as unconstrained geographical coordinates, progress along known trajectory or ETA at the next two stops. We demonstrate that without data cleaning, model predictions give false confidence if mean errors are used, highlighting the importance of a holistic assessment of the results. We show that target representation affects the prediction accuracy, by constraining the prediction space. The literature is vague about quality issues in public transport data. Here we show that noisy data is a problem and discuss simple but effective approaches to address these issues. Research generally only focuses on a single method of target representation. Therefore, comparing several methods is a useful addition to the literature. This gives insight into the value of addressing data quality issues in urban transport data to enable better predictions and improve the passenger experience. We show that `rephrasing&#39; the prediction problem by changing the target representation can yield massively improved predictions. Our findings enable researchers using deep learning approaches in public transport to make more informed decisions about essential data cleaning steps and problem representation for improved results.},

Such variance can be introduced by various factors, such as the BERT encoder layers, the fine-tuning architecture or the hyperparameter settings. Each architectural design choice leads to different results for a specific task. Hence, we are interested in reducing this variance given some settings. This study illustrates the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search, select and design a (near-) optimal fine-tuned BERT architecture for a hate speech detection task. We propose an appropriate encoding scheme for this task which represents the possible solutions in a way that supports a less time-consuming search for the global optima. Each encoding for a single solution represents both the BERT architecture and the fine-tuning architecture for a robust search. The automatic search provided by the GA, helps to reduce the time and cost involved in manual trial and error design methods. The experiments show that the resulting architectural design and hyperparameter settings are good choices for the hate speech detection task. Our method, although validated only on hate speech detection tasks, can easily be extended and generalized to other text classification tasks.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we generate an end-to-end model for electroencephalogram (EEG) motor imagery brain waves classification. EEG waves are considered a time series, however most of the literature focus on changing the representation of the waves or working on the data set as a whole. One of the goals of the investigation is reaching a conceptually simplified model so it can be generalized for the new approaches at EEG data acquisition (such as the novel EEG buds). First we mention some of the experiments and approaches that didn&#39;t obtain good metrics and then we show the results for MLP and LSTM neural networks. LSTM networks are slower to reach a higher accuracy compared to the MLP networks with less seconds of training, however they are better at reaching stable levels of accuracy when given enough data. Normalization plays an important role on the process, showing that the best and most consistent results are obtained when it is done locally at a sequence level, from where we can infer that the patterns are arguably most affected by the values (originally measured in micro volts and then normalized) in the local context of the sequence.},

  abstract  = {Brain tumor is a cluster of abnormal and uncontrolled cells growth, leading to a short life expectancy in their highest grade. Accurately and timely clinical diagnosis of such tumors play critical role in treatment planning and patient care. Various image techniques such as Computed Tomography (CT), Ultra-Sound image, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and biopsy are used to evaluate brain tumors. Among stated four, MRI is most common used non-invasive technique, however the key challenge with these images is the low-level visual information captured by MRI machines, that needs highlevel interpretation by experienced radiologist. The manual interpretation is a tedious, challenging, and erroneous task. In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Feature based Euclidean Distance (ConFED) method for faster and more accurate tumor classification. The method consists of convolutional features and Euclidean distance based one step learning. The proposed method is evaluated on Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Images (CE-MRI) benchmark dataset. Proposed method is more generic as it does not use any handcrafted features, requires minimal preprocessing, and can achieve average accuracy of 97.02\% using five-fold cross-validation. Extensive experiments, along with statistical tests, revealed that the proposed method has outperformed state-of-the-art classification methods on the CE-MRI dataset.},

  abstract  = {The Uncertain Capacited Arc Routing Problem is an important and challenging problem that has many real-world applications. Genetic Programming is utilised to evolve routing policies for vehicles to make real-time decisions and handle uncertain environments efficiently. However, when the problem scenario changes (e.g. a new vehicle is bought or an existing vehicle breaks down), the previously trained routing policy becomes ineffective and a new routing policy needs to be retrained. The retraining process is time-consuming. On the other hand, by extraction and transfer of some knowledge learned from the previous similar problems, the efficiency and effectiveness of the retraining process can be improved. Previous studies have found that the lack of diversity in the transferred materials (e.g. sub-trees) could hurt the effectiveness of transfer learning. As a result, instead of using the genetic materials from a source domain directly, in this work, we utilise the knowledge from the source domain to create a surrogate model. This surrogate is used on a large number of randomly generated individuals by GP in the target domain to select the promising initial individuals. This way, the diversity of the initial population can be maintained by randomly generated individuals, but also guided by the transferred surrogate model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed surrogate-assisted transfer learning method is superior to existing methods and can improve training efficiency and final performance of GP in the target domain.},

  abstract  = {Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) is a well-known challenging optimization problem. Over the last few decades, many different approaches have been proposed for solving different variant of RCPSPs. In those problems, it is usually assumed that the activities are homogeneous, that means, all activities are similar or they require similar types of resource over the entire project horizon. However, in real-world applications, a project consists of heterogeneous activities where the activities really need different kinds of resource. The existing algorithms, which are mostly developed for RCPSPs with homogeneous activities, can be applied to the projects with heterogeneous activities with a simple modification. However, they are computationally expensive as they need to perform many unnecessary computation. So, in this paper, we propose a customized approach for RCPSPs with heterogeneous activities based on a memetic algorithm. The proposed memetic algorithm is basically a genetic algorithm combined with a local search. The performance of the propose algorithm has been tested by solving a good number of problem instances and a few real-world problems, and comparing the results with an appropriate state-of-the-art algorithm. It is found that propose approach obtains high quality solutions within a considerably lower computational effort.},

Most of the related works mainly focused on the economic schedule, such as scheduling at minimum operating cost. In this work, we also consider the environmental impact, such as minimizing the pollutant emission. The scheduling problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem with minimization of pollutant emission from the generators as well as operating cost. Single-objective economic scheduling is also generated to compare the results with the bi-objective approach. The proposed solution approach is based on a differential evolution algorithm that is integrated with a heuristic. The proposed heuristic is basically a repairing mechanism that can produce feasible solutions quickly; thus, enhancing the algorithm performance. The performance of the heuristic-based algorithm is compared with that of without heuristic. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

This problem is proven to be NPhard and is thus computationally challenging. In this study, we tackle the mixed model assembly line problem, but additionally, we consider sequence dependant setup times between operations. We present an approach based on simulated annealing, which focuses on finding good permutations of the operations, using simple neighbourhood moves and α-Sampling. Using an efficient assignment heuristic, the operations are mapped to workstations in a greedy fashion. We conducted experiments on a range of instances, and we find that simulated annealing is more effective than a mixed integer programming model, by finding solutions to large problems in short time-frames. Furthermore, for a large number of problem instances, simulated annealing outperforms ant colony optimisation.},

Most importantly, we use the various algorithm adaptations to enhance the performance of our algorithm. To be specific, it uses smart initialization approaches to enrich the first-generation population, and proposes new crossover operator to create a better diversity on the Pareto front approximation. The MIP-EGO configurator is adopted to automatically tune the mutation probabilities, which are important hyper-parameters of the algorithm. Furthermore, different local search strategies are employed to explore the neighborhood for better solutions. The experimental results from the combination of these techniques show the good performance as compared to classical evolutionary scheduling algorithms and it requires less computing budget.

The intention of a pedestrian to cross the street can be influenced by social interactions with another one across the street, which may be manifested through various types of social signals such as hand waving. Current socially-aware multi-pedestrian path predictors mainly rely on geometric heuristics such as the distance between pedestrians in the field of view of the car, but do not consider their social interaction across the street. This paper presents a novel social interaction-based multi-pedestrian path predictor (SIMP3) which leverages a combination of dynamic Bayesian networks for intention detection and recurrent network for prediction of future pedestrian locations. The system has been evaluated on the benchmark OpenDS-CTS2 of critical traffic scenarios with socially interacting pedestrians across the street simulated in OpenDS.

The 3D poses model the posture of individual body parts of these vulnerable road users (VRUs). Fields of application for this technology are, for example, driver assistance systems or autonomous driving functions of vehicles. In road traffic, VRUs are often occluded and only become visible in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. Hence, our proposed approach is able to classify basic movements after different and especially short observation periods. The classification will then be successively improved in case of a longer observation. This allows countermeasures, such as emergency braking, to be initiated early if necessary. The benefits of using 3D poses are evaluated by a comparison with a method based solely on the head trajectory. We also investigate the effects of different observation periods. Overall, knowledge about 3D poses improves the basic movement detection, in particular for short observation periods. The greatest improvements are achieved for the basic movements start, stop, turn left, and turn right.},

  abstract  = {Limited runway capacity is a common problem faced by most airports worldwide. The two important factors that affect runway throughput are the wake-vortex separation and Runway Occupancy Time (ROT). Therefore, to improve runway throughput, Wake Turbulence Re-categorisation program (RECAT) was introduced to reduce the minimum separation distance required between successive aircraft on final approach. As a result, the constraining impact of ROT on runway throughput has now become significant. The objective of this paper is to identify data-driven intervention to reduce the ROT of landing aircraft. Specifically, we propose a data-driven approach to estimate the causal effect of landing parameters on ROT. We propose categorisation of each landing parameter into groups using Gaussian process models and employ Generalised Random Forest (GRF) to estimate the average treatment effect and the standard deviation of each landing parameters. Experimental results show that a few procedural changes to current landing procedure may reduce ROT. The results establish that slowing down the aircraft speed in the final approach phase leads to shorter ROT. In the final approach phase, ROTs of aircraft which are at least 10 knots slower than the average aircraft speed are on an average 2.63 seconds shorter. Furthermore, aircraft that are at least 10 knots faster than the average aircraft have on average 4 seconds longer ROTs. The second finding of this work is that flexible glide-slope angles should be introduced for the different aircraft types to achieve better ROT performance. Therefore, our findings also validate the industry need for Ground-Based Augmented System landing system which provides landing guidance with flexible glide-slopes.},

  abstract  = {In the status quo, taxi dispatching is not fully optimized. Low taxi capacity utilization rates along with high passenger wait times suggest inefficiency with dispatching. Computationally, the taxi dispatch problem (TDP) faces key constraints: the problem is very dynamic with information about trips unknown beforehand and must be computed in real-time. These constraints force quick, simple, intuitive, but inefficient solutions like local greedy approaches to be applied. This research study presents a novel solution for TDP. Through TaxiNet, future taxi demand is predicted in four components: the number of passengers picked up, the number of passengers dropped off, the distribution of passengers picked up and the distribution of passengers dropped off for a 15-minute time-step. The predicted demand is inputted into a proposed Monte Carlo algorithm which can link the pickup demand with the drop-off demand to generate a series of predicted trips that will occur shortly. Not only do these predictions allow for a clearer idea of where passengers and taxis will be in the future, but it also extends the window of computation time provided to calculate and find optimal dispatching solutions. A proposed ACO algorithm inputs in the predicted passenger and taxi locations and outputs an optimal dispatching solution. Simulations were run to compare the performance of a taxi fleet operating under existing systems versus the developed algorithm. The results show that the algorithm increased fleet profitability and lowered passenger wait times.},

  abstract  = {Monitoring and interpreting of the Driver behaviour is a challenging area of research as the driver behaves unpredictably under the influence of factors such as fatigue, drowsiness, inattention, weather, traffic, and roads variations. In the studies reported in the literature, the activities of the driver are monitored through longitudinal and lateral behaviours using physiological characteristics and computer vision. However, an effective method to understand and monitor the sudden changes in the postural behaviour of the driver leading to catastrophic conditions is still outstanding. Towards developing such method, the driver head posture under different driving states is monitored in this study using inertial sensors. The data produced by the sensors is modelled using Gaussian Mixture unsupervised clustering approach. The experiments were conducted on a total of 10 young healthy subjects on MATHWORKS driver-in-loop simulator, interfaced with a virtual environment designed in Unreal Engine studio. A criteria of minimum abundance range between 0.5-1\% is deployed to identify the most optimum clusters. The information contained in the clusters are analyzed to find the maximum magnitude and standard deviation of each cluster and then organized in descending order for assignment the symbols. Finally, the patterns of each driver state are validated. The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective in identifying the driver state in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, the patterns identified can be deployed in a smart early intervention system to correct the mistakes made during driving. The limitations of the current work and directions for future work are discussed.},

  abstract  = {Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network is an effective deep learning model with a wide variety of applications. Despite numerous recent success, using a single LSTM network cannot achieve reliable performance on complicated machine learning tasks. An important approach to improve the performance is to learn an ensemble of LSTMs rather than learning a single LSTM. The performance of the ensemble depends on the accuracy and diversity of individual LSTMs. This paper proposes a new evolutionary multi-objective algorithm to automatically design a collection of diverse and accurate LSTMs based on Non-dominated Sort Genetic Algorithm II. We also propose a method to select suitable LSTMs from an evolved non-dominated set of LSTMs to form the ensemble. The obtained results on multiple benchmark classification tasks show that the proposed algorithm can evolve an ensemble of LSTMs, which significantly outperform many state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract  = {Image classification is an important task that has a wide range of applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a common approach that can achieve promising performance in image classification. However, using CNNs to address a problem requires in-depth knowledge about CNN architectures and how it relates to the problem domain. Genetic programming (GP) as an evolutionary computation method can used to reduce the amount of knowledge required to design a CNN for a given problem domain by automatically searching for the optimal architecture. This paper proposes a new algorithm named, GPCNN, which encodes graph-based CNN architectures as trees and uses genetic operators, i.e. mutation, crossover and selection, to find better architectures. A more flexible crossover, partial subtree crossover, is also proposed to improve the search performance. As an preliminary work, GPCNN did not manage to achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods due to the limit on computational resource, but it is able to achieve better results than the baseline methods. More importantly, the proposed tree-based graph representation of CNN allows CNN architecture of various shapes, which has a great potential for future work in evolutionary automatic neural architecture search.},

  abstract  = {Among the different Deep Learning (DL) models, the deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in a variety of image recognition or classification tasks. Although CNNs do not require feature engineering or manual extraction of features at the input level, yet designing a suitable CNN architecture necessitates considerable expert knowledge involving enormous amount of trial-and-error activities. In this paper we attempt to automatically design a competitive CNN architecture for a given problem while consuming reasonable machine resource(s) based on a modified version of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). As CGP uses only the mutation operator to generate offsprings it typically evolves slowly. We develop a new algorithm which introduces crossover to the standard CGP to generate an optimal CNN architecture. The genotype encoding scheme is changed from integer to floating-point representation for this purpose. The function genes in the nodes of the CGP are chosen as the highly functional modules of CNN. Typically CNNs use convolution and pooling, followed by activation. Rather than using each of them separately as a function gene for a node, we combine them in a novel way to construct highly functional modules. Five types of functions, called ConvBlock, average pooling, max pooling, summation, and concatenation, were considered. We test our method on an image classification dataset CIFAR10, since it is being used as the benchmark for many similar problems. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme converges fast and automatically finds the competitive CNN architecture as compared to state-of-the-art solutions which require thousands of generations or GPUs involving huge computational burden.},

  abstract  = {As evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are robust to the problem formulation and easy to use, there is a growing interest in designing EAs for automated neural architecture search in recent years. In particular, EvoCNN is a recently proposed evolutionary algorithm to automate the configuration of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Its efficacy has been confirmed against 22 existing algorithms for CNN configuration, on the widely used image classification tasks. However, despite the success enjoyed by this method, we note that there are several limitations existed in this method. For example, only chain structured network is considered for evolution. Further, there are many decision variables, which is computational expensive. In this paper, we embark a study on evolutionary neural architecture search by proposing a memetic algorithm (MA), with the aim of addressing the problems mentioned above. Particularly, first of all, besides evolving the chain structured network, local search is designed for multibranch network search. Next, to reduce the network parameters for optimization, we focus on the architecture search only on the convolutional layers. Moreover, based on a recent hypothesis in the literature, the network evaluation is conducted based on only the early training process in our proposed MA. To confirm the efficacy of the proposed method, comprehensive empirical studies are conducted against EvoCNN for NAS, on the commonly used image classification benchmarks.},

The experimental results show that, compared with manual search, SEODP is much more effective, and compared with grid search, SEODP can achieve optimal performance much faster.

In this paper, we solve a practical MAPF problem with automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for the conveying of luggage in segment-based layouts (MAPF-SL). Most existing algorithms for MAPF are mainly focused on grid environments. However, the conflict prevention problem is more challenging with segment-based layouts in which software is constrained to oversee that vehicles remain on predefined travel paths. Hence, the existing multi-agent path finding algorithms cannot be applied directly to solve MAPF-SL. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called WHCA*S-RL, that combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with a heuristic approach for solving MAPF-SL. DRL is used for determining travel directions while the heuristic approach oversees the planning in a segment-based layout. Our experiment results show that the proposed WHCA*S-RL approach can be successfully used for making path plans in which traffic congestion is both avoided and relieved. In this way, individual vehicles are found to reach goal destinations faster than the approach with search only.},

This work proposes a hybrid model, exploring linear and nonlinear modeling capabilities of classic, modern and machine learning models which are applied to a financial time series in order to anticipate fluctuations in the price of supplies purchased by the newsvendor. This information is used to aid the decision-maker in an optimization problem involving both the decision on the order quantity and the best moment for the one-time per cycle newsvendor replenishment in situations where the purchase price fluctuates in time.

An improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (INSGAII) is developed. The novelties are mainly presented as follows. First, a probability-based extended precedence preservative crossover operator (PEPPX) is designed for accelerating the convergence rate. Second, in order to solve the multi-modal problem, a “pruning-regenerating” mechanism (PRM) is developed to remove the redundant solutions in objective space and reinsert new solutions. Specifically, a novel metric called “encoding distance” is proposed to measure the diversity of solutions with exactly the same objective function values in chromosome encoding. Meanwhile, a critical path based variable neighborhood search (VNS) is designed to regenerate new solutions replacing the removed ones. Numerical experiments on a wide set of well-known benchmarks have confirmed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed INSGA-II.},

The problem consists of multiple varieties of agri-fresh products collected in the harvest season that must be stored in a limited number of warehouses to supply demand throughout the whole planning horizon. The warehouses can be set on two modes with different energy consumption rates and different impacts on preventing product losses. The aim is to minimise the costs of energy consumption and product loss. Based on a mixed integer linear programming model for the problem, which is effective only for small instances due to the complexity of the problem, we propose an efficient two-phase heuristic method. In the first phase, a problem-specific heuristic determines and fixes the values of the binary variables, and then, in the second phase, the mixed integer linear programming problem is solved to determine the remaining variables. We evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by solving instances with different sizes. The results illustrate that the two-phase approach can efficiently find solutions of good quality.},

  abstract  = {Determining meta-parameter settings is a longstanding challenge in evolutionary computing, and often involves running repeated simulations with successive estimated values until acceptable values are found. The term metaevolution is often used to describe the optimization of one or more of the meta-parameters that control, for example, the rates of selection and variation in evolutionary optimization algorithms. Here we use self-adaptation to simultaneously evolve all of the practical meta-parameters together with the other evolved parameters as part of the main evolutionary algorithm. The meta-parameters are added to the gene, and evolved along with the other parameters. The evolved neurocontrollers with self-adaptation are compared to those with manually selected meta-parameters. Secondly, self-adapted meta-parameters from the best neurocontroller are used to evolve a further set of non-self-adapted neurocontrollers, and compared with the selfadapted and manually selected results. The effects of selfadaptation are determined through a series of experiments using a previously demonstrated multi-objective Lamarckianinherited neuromodulated evolutionary neurocontroller. The fitness of the evolved neurocontrollers is determined through their operation of a simulated vehicle pursuing a basic evader vehicle in the pursuit-evasion game. Both vehicles are subject to the effects of mass and drag. It is shown that self-adaptation can be used to automatically tune and control meta-parameters during evolution. Only a trivial amount of computational cost is added, and no degradation in evolutionary performance was observed.

  abstract  = {Agent-based autonomous control of Uninhabited Aerial Systems (UASs) promises to improve system efficiency and reduce the burden on human operators. The autonomous control of swarming UAS is inherently difficult due to challenges of coordination, role allocation, and the engineering of emergent behavior. In addition, UAS platforms are capable of multiple, possibly heterogeneous tasks, adding another dimension to the existing spatio-temporal problem and further complicating task scheduling and allocation. In this paper, we propose an extensible multi-role swarm control architecture to appropriately allocate swarm resources in a UAS swarm. The architecture is based on pheromone influencing and multi-criteria decision making to leverage emergent specialization. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-role architecture reduces role latency by as much as 50\% compared to using dedicated individual teams for each role.},

The analysis of great amounts of data coming from different sources could be very time consuming for humans, so they require automatic tools that help them to monitor vast and complex environments to detect anomalous situations. To this purpose, this paper introduces an agent-based model to allow IoT systems to monitor outdoor environments and detect suspicious or critical situations. The agent-modeling allows the accomplishment and coordination of various tasks, including object detection and data collection achieved through tracking, environmental context detection by using frame classification and semantic segmentation, contextual knowledge generation and activity detection through ontology reasoning. Finally, the agents report to humans about what happened by estimating the scene criticality through a fuzzy controller. A case study shows the potential of the whole framework and experiences evaluate the skills of the framework for activity detection.},

  abstract  = {A novel agent model is proposed that preserves the privacy of location information by using smart data i.e., data that protect themselves in a manner appropriate to the needs of the user. The model protects personal data by wrapping in a “cloak of intelligence”. This requires development of an intelligent agent that acts as the user&#39;s virtual proxy in cyberspace controlling the release of the user&#39;s information in accordance with the its preferences, context of information and/or nature of situation. The presented work focuses on developing a location data agent for smartphone users. Many applications request access to the user&#39;s location data in order to provide their services, but some may take advantage of this opportunity to continuously record location data even when they are not being used. This continuous tracking of the user&#39;s location can reveal extensive personal information. The aim of this work is to develop a neural network based intelligent agent that learns the user&#39;s privacy preferences and estimates the preferred privacy levels for future interactions. Agent in the proposed model behaves as an advanced data location manager and interacts with the apps instead of letting them directly access the location data. Apart from deciding the amount of distortion, the agent also works to prevent remove spatial and temporal correlations by adding perturbations to actual access history so as to prevent a third party from making an kind of prediction on personal data.},

Over the past few decades, honeybees have suffered a progressive decline. The ability to observe and control the activity and density dynamics of honeybees in their hives in an automated way can allow to stimulate their actions and improve the overall efficiency of the hive. In this paper we present a novel honeybee observation method that is primarily based on honeybee density estimation using a convolutional neural network. First, specially designed stationary robots were positioned inside an arena designed for young honeybees. Three robots were used, each equipped with six infrared sensors for honeybee detection. The hardware and software setup that was used during the raw data collection process is described. Using the collected data from experiments with different numbers of honeybees we tested different convolutional neural networks to evaluate the relation between the network parameters and the estimation accuracy. To obtain better results, the numbers of honeybees were grouped into four different categories. It is shown that the most influential parameters are the number of epochs and the feature map size. By using the correct parameters it is possible to obtain 100\% accuracy during network training process and 86\% accuracy during evaluation process.},

The cross-sectional OCT B-scan of Temporal-SuperiorNasal-Inferior-Temporal (TSNIT) peripapillary retinal profile is widely used to diagnose and monitor glaucoma. However, raw OCT images can be marred by noise and artifacts, especially vitreoretinal interface opacity: this can lead to segmentation error, misinterpretation of retinal thickness measurements and possibly inappropriate glaucoma management. In this study, we designed and trained a U-Net model on OCT B-scans with artifacts, and their corresponding artifact-free B-scans’. The U-Net was able to remove the artifacts successfully with better performance in terms of PSNR and SSIM values. The SNR of the OCT scans with speckle noise associated with artifacts has also been improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where automated vitreous opacity artifact removal has been applied to the TSNIT profile. The performance of the U-net model on measures such as PSNR, SSIM, MAE, and MSE is compared with the state-of-the-art image denoising models. It is observed that the proposed U-Net model performs better as compared to the other models on both parametric and visual evaluations. In the future, this U-Net model could be used to solve automatic retinal layer segmentation errors and assist clinicians in interpreting OCT images in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring.},

To overcome this problem and thanks to the recent improvements in Deep Learning, in the last few years researchers have been studying the application of Generative Adversarial Networks, a promising paradigm in deep learning, to generate the missing modalities. In this work we developed and trained two models of Generative Adversarial Networks, called MI-pix2pix and MI-GAN, to solve the problem of generating missing modalities for brain MRIs. In particular, our approaches are multi-input generative models, as they exploit as input several MRI modalities to generate the missing one. Our results are promising and show that the developed models are able to generate rather realistic and good quality images.},

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz. normal, pneumonia, other_disease, and Covid - 19. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall accuracy was measured as 90.13\% ± 0.14. In order to get an idea about the COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more attention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with clinical findings, as validated by experts.},

The performance of this algorithm is evaluated in simulation across randomly generated scenarios. The results are compared to the performance of a baseline greedy algorithm that selects the countermeasure with the highest probability of hitting a threat.

We use a differential evolution (DE) algorithm as the optimization method to couple with a system dynamics (SD) simulation model. The set of all feasible workforce planning policies is developed by the SD simulation and then searched by the DE algorithm while the fitness evaluation (i.e., total cost) of policies is evaluated by the simulation model. We demonstrate the approach through numerical experiments on a military workforce planning problem to provide insight into how the different strategies affect the overall system performance with regards to both total cost and fleet availability.},

Finding solutions is often computationally costly and time consuming. Surrogate models have been useful for constructing approximations that effectively replace the complex and costly original models. Statistical and computational intelligence based techniques have been effective for creating surrogate models, such as neural networks, support vector machines and boosted trees (labeled black box techniques). This paper approaches the problem of finding surrogate models aimed at solving inverse problems for deterministic systems described by a partial differential equation. This situation, often intractable when using first principles methods, is illustrated with a case study of heat transfer in a rectangular space. Unsupervised methods are used for gaining insight into the properties of the input/output state spaces and supervised approaches, composed of white (explainable), black box modeling methods and ensembles, explore the feasibility of retrieving the input from the system&#39;s outputs.

In addition, unsupervised methods are used for gaining insight into the properties of the input and output state spaces. White-box ML techniques exposed the nature of the inter-dependencies and the importance of the predictor variables. Individually, support vector regression outperformed all other models for the fixed-location, fixed time and also for the fixedlocation, time dependent scenario.

Efforts have been made for the detection of hate speech and harassment; providing us with a rather humble place to begin, as we explore further, such methods are proven ineffective. We propose a step forward in solving this problem with the demonstration of an automated racial microaggression detection method. Whilst racial hatespeech detection method provides us with an idea as to where we can start, we find further on, that microaggressions and hatespeech use very different features to portray their sentiment. This work aims to provide a technical review which explores the understanding of the automated racial microaggression detection, outlining the definitions of microaggressions currently described in the literature, with the presentation and assessment (through precision, callback and F-measure) of a promising approach in regards to racial microaggression detection. We also intend to analyse a case study in which we detect the presence of racial microaggressions within new reports with the intention of laying a foundation for the potential security-related applications of this work. Our further works begin to discuss this notion in a higher level of detail.},

  abstract  = {Maritime vessels around the world risk encountering dangerous situations during their voyages such as piracy, kidnappings, hijackings, and smugglings. Such dangers may put crews at risk and potentially cause extensive damage to both the vessel and its cargo. Maritime risk assessment is a process of analyzing such factors to positively impact the safety and timeliness of operations. Analyzing the high-risk areas in seas and oceans can help vessels route around areas with previously recorded high levels of dangerous activities. This information is scraped and extracted from various maritime documents, including newspaper articles, social media, incident blogs, and operational reports. After textual data sources are parsed, it is possible to use this extracted information as training datasets into a Machine Learning (ML) model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) Deep Learning (DL) techniques. With these methods, we can perform document classification, risk extraction, text summarization, topic modeling, and information extraction in an automated manner. Methods that are used include the bag-of words (BOW) approach and, in particular, the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific areas around the world that are considered a risk to a particular voyage. Once this information is processed, the model can determine and aggregate specific areas of high-risk activity. We propose a Maritime Event Log (MEL) pipeline using DL methods. This pipeline includes binary document classification (DC) to extract positive instances of incidents, an incident type classification (IC,) and an information extraction module (IE) including date and location and ship type extraction. With such information available, it is possible to avoid dangerous situations, which may have a significant level of impact on the safety and success rate of maritime operations.},

  abstract  = {Recently, a number of many-objective evolutionary algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Those algorithms are often evaluated using the frequently-used DTLZ and WFG test problems. One feature of those test problems is the use of the same distance function in all objectives in each problem. As a result, the distance from each solution to the Pareto front is minimized by optimizing the distance function. This means that the convergence improvement is a single-objective optimization independent of the number of objectives. This feature makes the DTLZ and WFG test problems easy. Recently, some difficult test problems have been proposed by removing this feature. In this paper, we examine the performance of many-objective evolutionary algorithms through computational experiments on a recently-proposed difficult test problem with no distance function. We show that totally different comparison results are obtained for the easy test problems with distance functions (i.e., DTLZ and WFG) and the difficult test problem with no distance function.},

  abstract  = {Feature extraction is essential to many machine learning tasks. By extracting features, it is possible to reduce the dimensionality of datasets, focusing on the most relevant features and minimizing redundancy. Autoencoders (AE) are neural network architectures commonly used for feature extraction. A usual metric used to evaluate AEs is the reconstruction error, which compares the AE output data with the original one. However, many applications depend on how the input representations in intermediate layers of AEs, i.e. the latent variables, are distributed. Therefore, additionally to the reconstruction error, an interesting measure - to study the latent variables - is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). This work analyzes how some variations on the AE training process impact the aforementioned measures. Those variations are: 1. the AE depth, 2. the AE middle layer architecture, and 3. the data setup used for training. Results have shown a possible relation between the KLD and the reconstruction error. In fact, lower errors have happened for higher KLDs and less compressed latent variables, i.e. more neurons on the AE middle layers.},

It relies on multiobjectivization of the original problem and applies the recently proposed and here slightly modified multi-objective local search mechanism MOGSA. We use a sophisticated visualization technique for multi-objective problems to prove the working principle of our idea.

This paper extends the idea of the parameter configuration landscape and proposes the use of geomorphons, a physical landform classification scheme, to visualize and characterize the parameter configuration landscape. Additionally, a measure of ruggedness is proposed to quantity the difficulty associated with tuning the control parameters for an algorithm. The proposed methodology is applied to the parameter configuration landscape of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm on 20 benchmark problems in 10, 30, and 50 dimensions.},

  abstract  = {Genetic and Evolutionary Algorithms (GEAs) rely on operators such as mutation and recombination to introduce variation to the genotypes. Because of their crucial role and effect on GEA performance, several studies have attempted to model and quantify the variation induced by different operators on various genotypic representations and GEAs. One metric of particular interest is the locality of genetic operators and representations, or how sensitive the phenotype is to small changes in genotype. Consequently, there is a considerable body of empirical work on the effects that different representations have on locality, with an emphasis on several popular representations, such as Gray encoding, and popular variation operators, such as single-bit mutation and single-point crossover.Here, we compute and prove tight upper and lower bounds on locality. We first precisely define our locality metrics for the single-point mutation and generic crossover operators by reformulating Rothlauf&#39;s seminal definitions specific to the binary-to-integer domain of representations. We then prove lower and upper bounds for single-point mutation locality by reducing the problem to mappings on hypercubes, and present constructive algorithms to generate representations of both optimal and pessimal locality. We also compute asymptotic bounds for generalized locality under any crossover operator.Our primary result is that the single-point locality of standard binary encoding is provably as good as Binary-Reflected Gray encoding, while other Gray encodings, which we construct, have worse locality. Another important result is that the generalized locality of any nonredundant binary-to-integer representation quickly converges to the same value, meaning that this metric cannot discriminate among representations and may therefore lose its usefulness for binary-integer representations.},

  abstract  = {Amid continuing increases in purchasing power and Internet shopping, demands for more efficient algorithms to solve the Large-Scale Vehicle Routing Problems are to be expected. The problem, which consists of finding routes for visiting customers, however, is very hard to solve due to its combinatorial nature. This becomes more notable when looking at large scale instances, i.e at least 200 customers, requiring sophisticated solution methods to solve, mostly heuristic-based. The existing meta-heuristics apply some limits to the solution space for handling the large scale nature. However, this is typically done manually, based on extensive domain knowledge. Hyper-Heuristics aim to reduce domain knowledge dependence, but current works disregard search space size, presenting poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a new Hyper-Heuristic to automatically evolve effective heuristics, based on a Genetic Algorithm framework. The new Hyper-Heuristic adds limits to the neighbourhoods of Low-Level Heuristics. In the method, the large search space is dealt with an adaptive chromosome which limits the neighbourhood size for each operator. The goal is to show whether more effective limits can be found if done automatically. Results show that the automatically evolved neighbourhood size limits outperform fixed ones for most instances tested and manually designed limits.},

  abstract  = {Uncertain Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (UCARP) is a dynamic combinatorial optimisation problem which can model many real-world logistic systems. Currently, the best available method for solving UCARP is the approach of using Genetic Programing as a hyper-heuristic to evolve routing policies for vehicles automatically. An open challenge in this area is that any change to the features of a solved UCARP instance will make trained policies ineffective for the new problem. As a result, whenever such changes happen, it is required to train new routing policies from scratch. The process of training routing policies is generally expensive. It is desirable to utilise transfer learning methods to reduce the retraining cost. However, earlier studies have identified that performing transfer learning for handling problem changes of UCARP is a challenging task. Lack of diversity and possible convergence to poor local optima are some issues that contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a new transfer learning approach with hyper-mutation in GPHH for UCARP to tackle the issue of insufficient diversity of the transferred knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that the newly proposed approach can increase the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and can allow better handling of UCARP scenario changes through transfer learning.},

UCARP has a wide range of real-world applications. One of the main challenge in UCARP is to handle the uncertain environment effectively. Routing policy-based approaches are promising technique for solving UCARP as they can respond to the uncertain environment in the real time. However, manually designing effective routing policies is time consuming and heavily replies on domain knowledge. Genetic Programming Hyper-heuristic (GPHH) has been successfully applied to UCARP to automatically evolve effective routing policies. However, the evolved routing policies are usually hard to interpret. In this paper, we aim to improve the potential interpretability of the GP-evolved routing policies by considering both program size and number of distinguished features. To this end, we propose a Two Stage Multi-Objective Genetic Programming Hyper Heuristic approach with Feature Selection (TSFSMOGP). We compared TSFSMOGP with the state-of-the-art single-objective GPHH, a two-stage GPHH with feature selection and a two-stage Multi-Objective GP. The experimental results showed that TSFSMOGP can evolve effective, compact, and thus potentially interpretable routing policies.},

However, most of the reductions used to obtain theoretical results are relatively coarse-grained and chosen for their amenability in supporting mathematical proof, and represent a selection amongst many possible reduction schemas. We propose reexamining reductions as a practical tool, since choosing one reduction scheme over another may be decisive in solving a given instance in practical settings. In this work, we examine the impact of several new reduction schema. A total of 100 experiments were conducted using challenging Hamiltonian Cycle Problem instances using Concorde, a well known and effective TSP solver, and example of a complete memetic algorithm (MA). Benefits of using MA are that it uses multi-parent recombination, local search and also provides an optimality guarantee through its implicit enumeration complete search. We show that the choice of reduction scheme can result in dramatic speed-ups in practice, suggesting that when using general solvers, it pays “to be wise” and to explore alternative representations of instances.},

  abstract  = {We present a framework to design collaborative games for team building that employs a search-based procedural content generation toolset to help designers creating levels. It comprises a multiplayer game with asymmetric interaction in which a player must reach the exit of a maze within a time limit, while wearing a head mounted display. The maze is complex and the player could not reach the exit on time without a team there to help her using a large number of printed maps describing candidate mazes. The player describes what she sees to the team who use such information to identify which one of the several available maps the player is currently navigating in virtual reality. Each game requires the generation of hundreds of very similar maps with several aliasing (confusing) situations but at the same time need to have a solution to guarantee that if the team members collaborate effectively they can guide the player to the exit. It would be infeasible for a human designer to provide such a massive number of maps for every game played. Accordingly, we developed automatic authoring tools to help designers generate such large sets of maps and also to optimize them based on design principles focusing on fun and pace.

A recently proposed framework for testing such algorithms is called EvoMan and was created based on a classic and challenging game called MegaMan II. In this framework, the agent must defeat a number of different enemies equipped with a diverse set of weapons with different behaviors. This paper follows up the Evoman: Game-playing Competition hosted at the World Conference on Computational Intelligence in 2020 with the objective of finding a general strategy capable of defeating all of the bosses training only on a subset of those. Our approach is composed of manually crafted inputs based on the available sensors fed into a Neuroevolution algorithm composed of a Genetic Algorithm evolving the weights of a Multilayer Perceptron. Our results obtained the first place on the competition and was capable of defeating the entire set of enemies.},

The agent has to play cards based on the game state, the hand cards, and the deck of cards to defeat the opponent. First, we design a rule-based agent by searching for the board evaluation criterion through genetic programming (GP). Then, we integrate the rule-based agent into the Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework to generate an advanced agent. Performance of the proposed agents are verified by playing against three participants in two recent Hearthstone competitions. Experimental results showed that the GP-agent can beat a simple MCTS agent and the mid-level agent in the competition. The MCTS-GP agent showed competitive performance against the best agents in the competition. We also examine the rule found by GP and observed that GP is able to identify key attributes of game states and to combine them into a useful rule automatically.},

We compare the strengths of the MCTS-based methods with the Star2.5 algorithm, previously reported to yield competitive results in the game of Carcassonne when a domainspecific heuristic is used to evaluate the game states. We analyse the particularities of the strategies adopted by the algorithms when they share a common reward system. The MCTS-based methods consistently outperformed the Star2.5 algorithm given their ability to find and follow long-term strategies, with the vanilla MCTS exhibiting a more robust game-play than the MCTS-RAVE.},

Previous work, mainly focused on a low-level input design, show that artificial agents are able to learn to stay on track starting from no driving knowledge; however, the final performance is still far from those of competitive driving. The scope of this work is to investigate in which measure rising the abstraction level can help the learning process. Using The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) environment and the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm, we develop artificial agents, considering both numerical and visual inputs, based on deep neural networks. These agents learn to compute either a target point on track or, additionally, a correction to the target maximum speed at the current position, which are then provided as input to a low-level control logic. Our results show that our approach is able to achieve a fair performance, though extremely sensitive to the low-level logic. Further work is necessary in order to understand how to fully exploit a high-level control design.},

  abstract  = {One of the most challenging problems in conducting machine learning is the learning process of feedforward neural networks (FFNN), which means finding the proper weights for connections and biases. The performance of FFNNs is mainly dependent on the success of the learning process. Gradient descent-based methods such as back-propagation (BP) are among the most widely employed learning algorithms, whereas they are susceptible to be trapped in local optima. Population-based metaheuristic algorithms such as differential evolution (DE) are a reliable alternative to tackle complex problems. In this paper, we propose a quasi-opposition-based differential evolution approach for FFNN learning to improve the performance of FFNNs (QODE-FFNN). Our proposed algorithm benefits from a variant of opposition-based learning (OBL) to enhance the performance of FFNN. Based on OBL concept, the opposite of a candidate solution is generated. Afterward, OBL selects the best between a candidate solution and its opposite based on their objective function values. In this paper, we employed a variant of OBL to improve the performance of FFNN, called quasi-OBL, which generates a random point between the center of search space and its opposite. Also, in our proposed algorithm, connection weights and biases are encoded as a candidate solution, while the objective function is based on a classification error. Experimental results confirm the performance of QODE-FFNN compared to other recent approaches.},

Inference time together with energy consumption and accuracy are opposing optimization criteria and constitute a multi-objective optimization problem. We propose to use a methodology that can deal with the multiple objective optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks in regard to those aspects. The method uses the NSGA-III algorithm with customized operators to find an enhanced network architecture. Proof of concept is given by using the GTSRB dataset as benchmark. Results are promising and show that a practically relevant trade-off between accuracy and computing effort can be determined with the evolutionary approach presented here.},

Greater awareness of the link between topology and application could lead to wider adoption, particularly in mission-critical systems. Here, we examine and analyze the topology of very small, minimally sized neurocontrollers that have been evolved for an extended number of generations. Previously demonstrated Lamarckian-inherited neuromodulated evolutionary neurocontrollers are synthesized to operate a simulated vehicle pursuing a basic evader vehicle in the pursuit-evasion game. Both vehicles are subject to the effects of mass and drag. Constraints in the number of neurons and synapses are used to control network size. Additional objectives are added to the multiobjective optimization algorithm to encourage the selection of neural networks with the fewest neurons and synapses. It is shown that patterns emerge in the neuromodulatory neurons, in the direct connections between neurocontroller inputs and outputs, and that topologies similar to those used in classical control are evolved. Additionally, a neurocontroller constructed from the most commonly occurring neurons that successfully capture the evader is demonstrated.},

Thus, it also has a deep backbone network similar to Residual Network. The developments incorporated are effective in general datasets and benchmarks but needlessly big for a specialized application. Hence, this paper proposes methods to create a suitable backbone for YOLOv3 with Neuroevolution. Neuroevolution is an optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm, which does not require gradients to optimize.

Reducing the number of objectives simplifies the problem into a more easily optimized mono-objective problem, or for multi-objective problems, reduces the Pareto front to a few dimensions for easy analysis. Here, multi-objective evolutionary neurocontrollers with both compound and elemental objectives are compared to a mono-objective evolutionary neurocontroller. The goal of this research is to compare the effectiveness of individual elemental and compound objective effectiveness, and not directly compare mono- and multi-objectivity. The effectiveness of each of the objectives is determined through a series of experiments using a previously demonstrated Lamarckian-inherited neuromodulated evolutionary neurocontroller. The evolved neurocontrollers operate a simulated vehicle pursuing a basic evader vehicle in the pursuit-evasion game. Both vehicles are subject to the effects of mass and drag. It is shown that under certain circumstances, binary objectives can be unsuitable choices as objectives, and that it can be more effective to use multi-objective solutions than to combine elemental objective problems into mono-objective problems by auxiliary functions. It is also shown that the obvious choice of objective may not be the most effective choice.},

Most experiments in the field converge rapidly to a single solution for the entire population. Early convergence results in a premature loss of diversity, which creates inconsistent results across multiple runs, sometimes converging to a local optimum. In Nature we can observe the opposite behavior: the more time passes, the more life becomes increasingly diverse. The increasing diversity is correlated to the formation of new species, which is catalyzed by reproductive isolation caused by physical or behavioral separation. Inspired by natural evolution, in this paper we apply artificial speciation based on morphological traits to an ER system. Individuals are forced to crossover only with individuals within the same species and a protection mechanism is applied to newly created species. In our experiments, we demonstrate that this speciation mechanism, inspired by NEAT, can evolve a population rich of many coexisting individuals, differing both in morphology and behavior.},

A critical challenge of soft robotic control is that the nonlinear dynamics imposed by soft materials often result in complex behaviors that are counter-intuitive and hard to model or predict. As a consequence, most behaviors for mobile soft robots are discovered through empirical trial and error and hand-tuning. A second challenge is that soft materials are difficult to simulate with high fidelity - leading to a significant reality gap when trying to discover or optimize new behaviors. In this work we employ a Quality Diversity Algorithm running model-free on a physical soft tensegrity robot that autonomously generates a behavioral repertoire with no a priori knowledge of the robot&#39;s dynamics, and minimal human intervention. The resulting behavior repertoire displays a diversity of unique locomotive gaits useful for a variety of tasks.

While noise is an inherent characteristic in many real-world problems, the impact of noise on shepherding is not a well-studied problem. We study two forms of noise. First, we evaluate noise in the sensorial information received by the shepherd about the location of sheep. Second, we evaluate noise in the ability of the sheepdog to influence sheep due to disturbance forces occurring during actuation. We study both types of noise in this paper, and investigate the performance of Strömbom&#39;s approach under these actuation and perception noises. To ensure that the parameterisation of the algorithm creates a stable performance, we need to run a large number of simulations, while increasing the number of random episodes until stability is achieved. We then systematically study the impact of sensorial and actuation noise on performance. Strömbom&#39;s approach is found to be more sensitive to actuation noise than perception noise. This implies that it is more important for the shepherding agent to influence the sheep more accurately by reducing actuation noise than attempting to reduce noise in its sensors. Moreover, different levels of noise required different parameterisation for the shepherding agent, where the threshold needed by an agent to decide whether or not to collect astray sheep is different for different noise levels.},

In particular, it has been shown that agents with a limited internal structure (2-neuron brains) that evolve in interaction can overcome this limitation and exhibit chaotic neural activity, typically associated with more complex dynamical systems (at least 3-dimensional). In the present paper we make two contributions to this line of work. First, we propose a conceptual distinction in levels of coupling between agents that could have an effect on neural and behavioral complexity. Second, we test the generalizability of previous results by testing agents with richer internal structure and evolving them in a richer, yet non-social, environment. We demonstrate that such agents can achieve levels of complexity comparable to agents that evolve in interactive settings. We discuss the significance of this result for the study of interaction.},

  abstract  = {Recent evidence suggests that sonar provides bats only with limited information about the environment. Nevertheless, they can fly swiftly through dense environments while avoiding obstacles. Previously, we proposed a sonar-based obstacle avoidance model that only relied on the interaural level difference of the onset of the echoes. In this paper, we extend this previous model. In particular, we present a model that (1) is equipped with a short term memory of the three most recent echo trains, and (2) uses the full echo train. Because handcrafting a controller to use more sonar data is challenging, we resort to machine learning to train a robotic model. We find that both extensions substantially increase performance and conclude that these could be used to enhance our existing models of bat sonar behavior. We discuss the implications or our method and findings for both biology and bio-inspired engineering.},

In this study, we show that counterintuitively - seemingly asocial behavior can also lead to successful problem solving performed by a swarm. We decided to test our new algorithm at first with real robots as a proof of concept, because this approach is of high conceptual novelty. We show that our social distancing algorithm (SocDist) performs similarly effective as a simple version of the well established bio-inspired social algorithm BEECLUST in a laboratory experiment, while avoiding some of its drawbacks. In additional agent-based computer simulation experiments we show that such an `asocial&#39; component within a swarm robotic algorithm can lead to a significant performance increase. Beside its effectiveness, the SocDist approach also leads to specific spatial distributions of the swarm robots, which may be useful for practical applications.},

Current community detection algorithms have time complexity, centralization, and scalability issues. In this paper, to solve this problem, we implement a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes a quality metric known as modularity. We model each node of the network as an autonomous agent that can choose other nodes to form a cluster with. They receive a reward and learn a policy that maps actions to their values. Experiments on known real-world networks show results similar to other modularity optimization methods while providing answers for decentralization, data privacy, and scalability.},

Shoids (sheep-oids) rely on the same boids rules with the addition of a repulsive force away from a sheepdog (a herding agent). Previous work assumed homogeneous shoids. Real-world observations of sheep show non-homogeneous responses to the presence of a herding agent. We present a portfolio of information-theoretic and spatial indicators to track the footprints of shoids with different parameters within the shoid flock. The portfolio is named the Centre of Influence to indicate that the aim is to identify the influential shoids with the highest impact on flock dynamics. We use both synthetic simulation-driven data and measurements collected from live sheep herding trials by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to validate the proposed measures. The resultant measures will allow us in our future research to design more efficient control strategies for the UAV, by polarising the attention of the machine learning algorithm on those shoids with influence footprints, to drive the flock to improve the herding of sheep.},

By graph theory, matrix analysis, deep learning and optimal control method, the necessary conditions and strategies for solving the optimal consensus problem of the dynamic systems are obtained. The results show that the online policy iteration algorithm not only stabilizes the distributed second-order dynamic systems, but also achieves the optimal consensus.

Since such selfish expert behaviors may not derive cooperative behaviors among agents, this paper tackles this problem by archiving the cooperative behaviors found in the learning process and by replacing the original expert behaviors with the archived one at a certain interval. For this issue, this paper proposes AMAIRL (Archive Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning). Through the intensive simulations of the maze problem for our method, the following implications have been revealed: (1) AMAIRL is superior to MaxEntIRL in terms of finding cooperative behavior; (2) AMAIRL requires a long interval period to acquire the cooperative behaviors. In particular, AMAIRL with the long interval can find the cooperative behaviors that are hard to be found in AMAIRL with the short interval.},

Multiple approaches have been documented in the literature to model this behaviour. In this paper, we present a modification to a well-known shepherding approach, and show, via simulation, that this modification improves shepherding efficacy. We then argue that given complexity arising from obstacles laden environments, path planning approaches could further enhance this model. To validate this hypothesis, we present a 2-stage evolutionary-based path planning algorithm for shepherding a swarm of agents in 2D environments. In the first stage, the algorithm attempts to find the best path for the sheepdog to move from its initial location to a strategic driving location behind the sheep. In the second stage, it calculates and optimises a path for the sheep. It does so by using way points on that path as the sequential sub-goals for the sheepdog to aim towards. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in obstacle laden environments via simulation with further improvements achieved.},

Moreover, choosing a single point from a large set even with certain preference information is problematic, as it causes a large cognitive burden on the part of the decision-makers. Therefore, many-objective optimization and decision-making practitioners have been interested in effective visualization methods to enable them to filter down a large set to a few critical points for further analysis. Most existing visualization methods are borrowed from other data analytics domain and they are too generic to be effective for manycriteria decision making. In this paper, we propose a visualization method, following an earlier concept, using star-coordinate plots for effectively visualizing many-objective trade-off solutions. The proposed method respects some basic topological, geometric and functional decision-making properties of high-dimensional tradeoff points mapped to a three-dimensional space. We demonstrate the use of the proposed method to a number large-dimensional test problems and a 10-objective real-world problem. The use of `Pareto Race&#39; concept from MCDM literature is introduced within the proposed visualization method to demonstrate the ease and advantage of the visualization method.},

Through the Bayesian models, we can consolidate the information of all analysts&#39; recommendations on stocks and predict the post-recommendation price drifts of the underlying stocks. In addition, typically there are only a small number of recommendation revisions on specific stocks on each day. It implies that other analysts&#39; views to a specific stock are unobservable. With the advantage of generative models, missing observations in the data of recommendation revisions can be accommodated easily. Secondly, we perform an empirical investigation of the Hong Kong equity market and find that the impact of recommendation revisions on stock prices is significant in the 1-day horizon, but insignificant in the longer time horizon when taking account of the transaction costs. Also, we propose trading strategies derived from the posterior probability of directions of price drifts based on the Bayesian models. In our experiment, during the out-of-sample period (1 Jan, 2019 to 21 Feb, 2020), the trading strategies gain double-digit profit returns after transaction costs.},

In this paper, a system for creating robots is introduced in order to allow for their body plans to be designed algorithmically and physically instantiated using the previously introduced Robot Fabricator. This system consists of two types of components. Firstly, skeleton parts are created bespoke for each design by 3D printing, allowing the overall shape of the robot to include almost infinite variety. To allow for the shortcomings of 3D printing, the second type of component are organs which contain components such as motors and sensors, and can be attached to the skeleton to provide particular functions. Specific organ designs are presented, with discussion of the design challenges for evolutionary robotics in hardware. The Robot Fabricator is extended to allow for robots with joints, and some example body plans shown to demonstrate the diversity possible using this system of robot generation.},

In this work, instead of analyzing the adaptability of a population, we investigate how different environments influence the evolution of morphologies and controllers of modular robots. Previous work analyzed how robot evolution is influenced by different environments while keeping fixed the robot task. However, each environment may present different tasks that influence robot success. In this work, we investigate how different tasks in the same physical environment influence the evolutionary outcome. Specifically, we compare morphologies and behaviors under two tasks, undirected locomotion, and rotation in a flat terrain environment. We perform this analysis by analyzing the morphological and behavioral traits of the final population. Results suggest that both morphology and behavior types are strongly influenced by the environment, with the rotation task producing more proportionate and balanced robots compared to the locomotion task.},

Here we address the task of directed locomotion in modular robots with controllers based on Central Pattern Generators. We present a bio-inspired adaptive feedback mechanism that uses a forward model and an inverse model that can be learned on-the-fly. We compare two versions (a simple and a sophisticated one) of this concept to a traditional (open-loop) controller using Bayesian optimization as a learning algorithm. The experimental results show that the sophisticated version outperforms the simple one and the traditional controller. It leads to a better performance and more robust controllers that better cope with noise.},

  abstract  = {In Evolutionary Robotics a population of solutions is evolved to optimize robots that solve a given task. However, in traditional Evolutionary Algorithms, the population of solutions tends to converge to local optima when the problem is complex or the search space is large, a problem known as premature convergence. Quality Diversity algorithms try to overcome premature convergence by introducing additional measures that reward solutions for being different while not necessarily performing better. In this paper we compare a single objective Evolutionary Algorithm with two diversity promoting search algorithms; a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm and MAP-Elites a Quality Diversity algorithm, for the difficult problem of evolving control and morphology in modular robotics. We compare their ability to produce high performing solutions, in addition to analyze the evolved morphological diversity. The results show that all three search algorithms are capable of evolving high performing individuals. However, the Quality Diversity algorithm is better adept at filling all niches with high-performing solutions. This confirms that Quality Diversity algorithms are well suited for evolving modular robots and can be an important means of generating repertoires of high performing solutions that can be exploited both at design- and runtime.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a comparative study regarding the evolutionary design of quantum operators in the form of unitary matrices. Three different techniques allowing the generation of unitary matrices are investigated whose parameters are tuned by means of evolutionary algorithms. Such problem may be considered as a numerical optimisation task because the unitary matrices are represented by complex numbers with real-valued coefficients. Specifically, Genetic Algorithm and Evolution Strategy are applied, each in four different setups, and evaluated on three case studies: the 2-qubit Controlled-NOT gate, 3-qubit entanglement operator and 4-qubit detector of an element with the maximum amplitude. The evolutionary algorithms in combination with the given representation techniques are evaluated in order to determine the abilities of various experimental setups to solve the given tasks. The main contribution is the utilisation of QR decomposition, a technique for generating unitary matrices from theoretically any sequence of complex numbers, that has been applied for the first time in this paper for the evolution of quantum operators. It will be demonstrated that the QR decomposition exhibits a good performance especially in solving more complex quantum operators in comparison with other representations.},

  abstract  = {Symbolic regression via genetic programming is considered as a crucial machine learning tool for empirical modelling. However, in reality, it is common for real-world data sets to have some data quality problems such as noise, outliers, and missing values. Although several approaches can be adopted to deal with data incompleteness in machine learning, most studies consider the classification tasks, and only a few have considered symbolic regression with missing values. In this work, the performance of symbolic regression using genetic programming on real-world data sets that have missing values is investigated. This is done by studying how different imputation methods affect symbolic regression performance. The experiments are conducted using thirteen real-world incomplete data sets with different ratios of missing values. The experimental results show that although the performance of the imputation methods differs with the data set, CART has a better effect than others. This might be due to its ability to deal with categorical and numerical variables. Moreover, the superiority of the use of imputation methods over the commonly used deletion strategy is observed.},

  abstract  = {The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a recent interpretable machine learning algorithm that requires relatively modest computational power, yet attains competitive accuracy in several benchmarks. TMs are inherently binary; however, many machine learning problems are continuous. While binarization of continuous data through brute-force thresholding has yielded promising accuracy, such an approach is computationally expensive and hinders extrapolation. In this paper, we address these limitations by standardizing features to support scale shifts in the transition from training data to real-world operation, typical for e.g. forecasting. For scalability, we employ sampling to reduce the number of binarization thresholds, relying on stratification to minimize loss of accuracy. We evaluate the approach empirically using two artificial datasets before we apply the resulting TM to forecast dengue outbreaks in the Philippines using the spatiotemporal properties of the data. Our results show that the loss of accuracy due to threshold sampling is insignificant. Furthermore, the dengue outbreak forecasts made by the TM are more accurate than those obtained by Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees (DTs), and several multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), both in terms of forecasting precision and Fl-score.},

Registering data electronically can result in misspelled data, variations in naming order, case sensitive data and inconsistencies in abbreviations and terminology. Therefore, trying to obtain the true identity (or identities) of a suspect can be a challenge for law enforcement agencies. We have developed a targeted approach to identity resolution which uses a rule-based scoring system on physical and official identity attributes and a graph-based analysis on social identity attributes to interrogate policing data and resolve whether a specific target is using multiple identities. The approach has been tested on an anonymized policing dataset, used in the SPIRIT project, funded by the European Union&#39;s Horizon 2020. The dataset contains four `known&#39; identities using a total of five false identities. 23 targets were inputted into the methodology with no knowledge of how many or which had false identities. The rule-based scoring system ranked four of the five false identities with the joint highest score for the relevant target name with the remaining false identity holding the joint second highest score for its target. Moreover, when using graph analysis, 51 suspected false identities were found for the 23 targets with four of the five false identities linked through the crimes they had been involved in. Therefore, an identity resolution approach using both a rule-based scoring system and graph analysis, could be effective in facilitating the investigation process for law enforcement agencies and assisting them in finding criminals using false identities.},

Such anomalies are relevant for various practical use cases, such as misbehavior detection and data quality analysis. Effective methods for identifying them are particularly important when analyzing very large or noisy sets, for which traditional anomaly detection algorithms will return many false positives. In order to be able to identify high-density anomalies, this study introduces several nonparametric algorithmic frameworks for unsupervised detection. These frameworks are able to leverage existing underlying anomaly detection algorithms and offer different solutions for the balancing problem inherent in this detection task. The frameworks are evaluated with both synthetic and real-world datasets, and are compared with existing baseline algorithms for detecting traditional anomalies. The Iterative Partial Push (IPP) framework proves to yield the best detection results.},

It is one of the most recent marketing research strategies and may become the future of marketing research. Many research works have been carried out in this area to obtain better outcomes. However, literature shows that there is an opportunity for further improvement. Hence, in this study, a model is presented using data mining and machine learning algorithms for consumer behavior analysis from EEG signals. Time-frequency distribution features are extracted from EEG signals on which different classification algorithms are applied. Consumer&#39;s responses toward marketing strategies and their behavior towards purchasing or selecting goods can be studied and analyzed to understand the producer-consumer relationship. EEG signals from 25 people are collected where the participants varied in age and gender for a better understanding of consumer behavior towards a marketing policy. By analyzing the data, the reason behind how and why they like certain marketing policies was uncovered. The performance of our proposed model with an existing technique is compared. The accuracy of our model on the dataset is 95\%, whereas the accuracy of the existing technique on the same dataset is 70\%. We also evaluated whether neuropsychological measures can capture differences in consumer&#39;s actions according to different marketing stimuli. The experimental results on our model indicate that studies in this field can bring a change and improve marketing strategies for the betterment of both the producer and the consumer, resulting in an eventual mutual benefit.},

The present work is divided into the following stages, viz. preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, ranking of the selected features and finally classification of the segmented tumor. Gray-Level-Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Law&#39;s Texture and Mass Effect features are extracted from the brain tumor and feature selection is carried out for each individual type followed by the ranking of the individual feature types. The final step comprises of the classification algorithm where a three stage classifier using Interval Type-II Fuzzy Logic System is designed in order to classify the segmented tumor into benign or malignant class. Finally, the work is validated with the help of BRATS 12 dataset and the superiority of the model is showcased in comparison with Type-I Fuzzy Inference System.},

  abstract  = {Recently, there have been many studies on driving assistance systems to reduce traffic accidents. In such a situation, we proposed a method to construct dynamic saliency maps for predicting driver attention while driving in our previous work. In this construction method, multiple feature maps are first created from the video data of a car-mounted camera. Subsequently, this method computes dynamic saliency maps as combinations of the feature maps that perform center-biasing and normalization. Additionally, this method has been successfully applied to a real-world open dataset, including car-mounted camera videos. However, there is room for further improvement in the model used in this method, since the model cannot capture drivers&#39; characteristics, so that the degree of center bias changes depending on the driving situation. In this paper, we propose an improved model that incorporates multiple center biases into the center-biasing process. It is expected that, by using this improved model, one can appropriately consider changes in the center bias depending on driving situations, and the improved model outperforms the previous model. In addition, the performance of the improved model is compared with that of the conventional model for a real-world open dataset.},

  abstract  = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are regarded as one of the promising candidates to overcome the high energy costs of artificial neural networks (ANNs), but the accuracy gap between them is still large on practical tasks. A straightforward yet effective conversion scheme was developed recently to narrow this gap by mapping a trained ANN to an SNN. However, current conversion methods require a relatively large number of time steps and spikes, alleviating the advantages of spike-based computation. In this paper, we propose a new augmented spiking neuron model composed of a double-threshold firing scheme, and it is advanced with the ability to process and elicit augmented spikes whose strength is used to carry the number of typical allor-nothing spikes firing at one time step. Based on this model, a new conversion method called AugMapping is developed. We examine the performance of our methods with both MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Our results highlight that the as-proposed methods, as benchmarked to other baselines, are advantageous to accurate and efficient computation with SNNs. Therefore, our work contributes to improving the performance of spike-based computation, which would be of great merit to neuromorphic computing.},

Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a biologically inspired learning mechanism that can be used to train SNNs. Evolutionary algorithms have also been demonstrated as a method for training SNNs. In this work, we explore the relationship between these two training methodologies. We evaluate STDP and evolutionary optimization as standalone methods for training networks, and also evaluate a combined approach where STDP weight updates are applied within an evolutionary algorithm. We also apply Bayesian hyperparameter optimization as a meta learner for each of the algorithms. We find that STDP by itself is not an ideal learning rule for randomly connected networks, while the inclusion of STDP within an evolutionary algorithm leads to similar performance, with a few interesting differences. This study suggests future work in understanding the relationship between network topology and learning rules.},

Automating the detection of anomalies is necessary to deal with large volumes of data and to satisfy real time processing constraints. Current Machine Learning (ML) methods have had some success in the automated detection of anomalies, but no ideal ML solutions have been found for any domain. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), an emerging ML technique, have the potential to do AD well, especially for Edge applications where it needs to be low power, readily adaptable, autonomous and reliable. Here we investigate SNNs doing anomaly detection on streams of text. We show that SNNs are well suited for detecting anomalous character sequences, that they can learn rapidly, and that there are many optimizations to the SNN architecture and training that can improve AD performance.},

Spiking neural network (SNN) draws from the characteristics of biological brain and realizes a more advanced brain-like level. In this study, a scale-free spiking neural network (sfSNN) with small-world property is constructed, in which the Izhikevich neuron model is used as the node, the synaptic plasticity model based on the coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory synapses is used as the edge, and the scale-free network with small-world property is used as the topology. Taking the relative change rate of firing rate and the correlation between membrane potential as indexes, the robustness function of the sfSNN is analyzed. Based on the adaptive regulation of synaptic plasticity, the robustness mechanism is explored. The experimental results indicate that: (1) the sfSNN has better anti-interference function to the AC magnetic field of no more than 25 mT; (2) the sfSNN has better anti-interference function to the white Gaussian noise of no more than 10 dBW; (3) the sfSNN has better anti-injury function to the random attacks of no more than 40\% injured proportion; (4) the adaptive regulation of synaptic plasticity is the intrinsic factor of the robustness function.

  abstract  = {Commercial waste collection activities are critical from environmental, societal, as well as economic perspectives. Logistic activities carried out in any large or small human settlement, must be efficient by passing through obstacles while optimizing rare and valuable resource usages. With the advent of the Internet of Things and smart waste management ideas, the concept of static waste collection resource optimization and more specifically vehicle routing problem are being exposed to a fortunate mutation. This study introduces a dynamic waste collection optimization model and its solution for a unique type of waste collection problem. Unlike public waste collection, which is made up of homogeneous customers, commercial waste collection has to consider other factors, relating to the quality or time of service, while considering the socio-economic characteristics of the customers. Moreover, the paper has completed a comprehensive literature review over the waste collection filed to emphasize the singularity of the problem and the proposed mathematical model. The data-driven model proposed in this paper targets the optimization of costs in the embedded solver with invoking real-time data generated by filllevel sensors integrated into waste containers. The outputs of the model are dynamic and time-wise vehicle routing chains for efficient waste collection under the field official guidelines, constraints, and priorities. In order to scrutinize the scalability, applicability and validity of the proposed model, a real-life network in Luxembourg with multiple vehicles, stops, as well as a depot and a disposal site has been considered. The partnership with a waste management company, called Polygone, benchmarking results with real data conclude the merits, excellence, and findings of the paper.},

A torque control method is also described, akin to using proportional and derivative control of the angular position of the actuators. Finally, a Zero Moment Point based capture step is described and implemented within simulation. With torque control alone, the result is a stable bipedal recovery from disturbances along the saggital plane of up to 11.25N of force, from a standing pose. In comparison, the previous implementation without dynamic stability leads to the robot falling after a minor disturbance of 2N. When capture step is included in the approach, the robot can recover from disturbances of up to 45N. The codebase is open-source and provides a humanoid robot simulation platform for research teams working in this area.},

Therefore in order to adapt to the changing control environment and improving robustness of the controller due to an uncertain system model and dynamic uncertainties adaptive control methods are developed. This paper presents an adaptive neural backstepping control for an uncertain robot manipulator with dynamic disturbances. The dynamics of an n-link uncertain robot manipulator with dynamic disturbances is expressed as a class of 3n th order nonlinear multi-input multioutput (MIMO) system using a nonlinear disturbance observer-based model. The uncertain plant and disturbances dynamics are approximated using Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) to derive the control law. The proposed controller for each link has a simple structure with a single unknown parameter. The update law for this unknown parameter has been obtained using Lyapunov stability. It is shown that the proposed controller is able to ensure the semi-global uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of all signals of the resulting closed-loop system and the actual response eventually reaches a bounded neighbourhood of the desired response. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed technique. The tracking performance of the proposed controller is validated experimentally on a four degrees-of-freedom (4 DOF) Barrett Whole Arm Manipulator while performing dynamic ball hitting experiments.},

Accuracy and computational cost are the two main factors in SLAM determining the success of the method. Thus, we also propose the optimization methods to achieve both accuracy and computational cost.

Basically, it is difficult for a robot partner to plan such a human-friendly hand-over motions beforehand. Therefore, we focus on the degree of human comfortability on hand-over motion when the human receive an object. To evaluate the current hand-over motion, a human applies a force to the force sensor at the gripper when receiving an object. We apply fuzzy inference to adjust the position and direction of the robot gripper in hand-over motions according to the magnitude of applied force. And the position and direction at the next hand-over motion are determined. However, the adjustment is strongly dependent on the human postures. Therefore, we apply a neural network to classify the types of human postures. Finally, we show several experimental results of the interactive adaptation on hand-over motions, and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, due to the shortage of labor caused by an aging population and low birth rate in Japan, various research on autonomous mobile robots has been conducted. There are many industries in which applying autonomous mobile robots are important, for instance, the illuminance measurement industry. Illuminance measurement is a time-consuming task and the accuracy in a vast environment is still a problem due to the accumulative error. Therefore, with the purpose of improving the accuracy of illuminance measurement in a large environment by an autonomous mobile robot, various methods have been proposed in the past, including loop closing, sensor fusion, and motion analysis. In this paper, we proposed a method that reduces the accumulative error simultaneously while measuring the illuminance of the surroundings. The proposed method is based on an occupancy grid map and evolution strategy (ES). We used the data gathered by laser range finders to calculate the fitness of robot position in both the ground-truth map and constructed map. By monitoring the fitness of the robot&#39;s position, the adjustments will be conducted using evolution strategy to overcome the accumulative error. The proposed method is analyzed and evaluated in terms of accuracy through a series of real robot experiments in real-world environments.},

  abstract  = {Reinforcement learning(RL) is a method in which an agent learns a desired behavior through interaction with the environment. The agent learns the action based on the reward. The reward given to the agent is designed by the person in advance. However, since it is necessary to redefine the reward every time the environment or purpose changes, it can&#39;t adapt to various environments. Therefore, in the previous research, we have proposed a method of evaluating the input value of the sensor using a Universal Sensor Evaluation Index(USEI) that can be used in any environment, and generating self-reward based on the evaluation. However, in previous studies, in the method of evaluating only a single sensor, the input can be evaluated only by the method of directly receiving the input, and the information obtained based on other sensor information is ignored, so that it is generated by the method of the previous research. The accuracy of the reward is low. If the accuracy of the reward is low, the robot may broken because the danger cannot be recognized except by receiving dangerous input. In this study, we propose a method for generating highly accurate rewards by add relevance to individual sensors using Hebb&#39;s rule, which is the plasticity of neuron synapses, and evaluating inputs using multiple sensors. By using the proposed method, the inputs can be evaluated in consideration of multiple sensor inputs, and the range of danger recognition can be broadened, and implementation of danger prediction can be expected.},

We proposed a method which does decision making on a robot with multi-task according to a situation by using an importance of each task. To respond to changes in importance of task, the robot learned each task independently by using reinforcement learning. An action is selected uniquely using action values and importance of each task in this system. The parameters are designed according to the value that represents the status of each task as an index for evaluating the importance. Therefore, it is necessary to design parameters suitable for the environment for each task. If the environment changes, the parameters must be designed accordingly. Therefore, in this research, we propose an autonomous decision-making method based on priority self-generation. The robot self-generates the priority of each task based on the experience gained by the robot, and realizes an action selection system with the priority matching the environment. We carried out an experiment which set three tasks to the robot applied proposal method. From experimental results, we confirmed the usefulness of proposed method.},

We use the causal theory of reference to explain how not just singular denoting expressions but also artifacts such as fingerprints and classifiers (broadly, “denoting devices”) denote individuals. Our current focus is on identity in criminal justice settings. The identity relation between denoting devices is an equivalence relation inducing equivalence classes that contain devices all of which denote the same individual. This is how information on individuals is typically fused. We see a case as a constellation of situations, to which investigators refer and in which information is recorded and transferred. We discuss how argumentation schemes support identity hypotheses, and how evidence for identity hypotheses from multiple sources is combined in Dempster-Shafer theory. Our framework can be applied in principle to any approach or technique for establishing identity hypotheses. The specific techniques of a domain (e.g., machine learning) are left to domain experts; we just incorporate them into our framework.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning has been applied successfully in many areas, including computer vision, natural language processing, cyber physical systems and big data analytics. Recently, a synthesis of deep leaning techniques has been deployed to create fake images and videos that are not easily distinguishable from the real ones; this technology is known as DeepFakes. In this paper, we looked at various DeepFakes related datasets and created a model in order to identify whether a frame of a video is fake or real. This is important as videos can be easily manipulated in a way that can spread misinformation, and that can cause major problems in the world today, especially if the videos have political implications. In order to create a model, we utilize a modified AlexNet constructed of an arrangement of 6 layers: convolution2d, max pooling, dense, flatten, activation and dropout layers. UADFV, FaceForensics++, and Celeb-DF are the 3 datasets used in this research. There are many publicly available datasets, however, we found the UADFV, FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF to be the most convenient in how the data was formatted. All data for each dataset was organized into videos of varying classes. While the UADFV dataset is straightforward and only has 2 classes: real and fake, the FaceForensics++ dataset looks at the various kinds of video manipulations and has 5 different classes. Our model was able to achieve a 9S.73\% accuracy when identifying whether a video is real or fake on the UADFV dataset, a slightly adjusted version was able to accomplish an 87.49\% accuracy with the FaceForenisics++dataset, and reached 98.85\% accuracy on the Celeb-df dataset.},

  abstract  = {Speaker verification is a promising Internet of Things (IoT) user authentication model. However, verifying the identity of an individual using speech utterance is challenging especially in the presence of replay spoofing attacks, where attackers can record the speech of the user and use it for unauthorized access. In speaker verification, the voice signature is often polluted by ambient noise. This alone confounds the design of appropriate feature extractors that can distinguish the authentic signal from that of a replay signal. The literature to date reflects very poor performance; notably with state-of-the-art verification errors no less than 11.3\% false positives (FPs) from all samples. To address this difficult gap that has, up to now, prevented speaker verification from being a satisfactory IoT authentication alternative we are seeking to develop an improved approach yielding better precision compared to state of the art systems. To accomplish this goal, we have developed a new approach that uses MFCC and CQCC as input features, a CNN based front-end feature extractor, and SVM back-end classifier. Using better training techniques such as batch normalizations, we improved the precision significantly, achieving a state-of-the-art performance. In addition, a formulation that includes knowledge of distinguishing genuine voice from a replay attack is implemented. Experiment has been conducted on ASVspoof 2017 datasets. An improvement in the state-of-the-art performance has been obtained, achieving 7.1 of Equal Error Rate (EER).},

  abstract  = {Recently real-time detection, and recognition of an object of interest are becoming vital tasks in visual data processing and computer vision. Various models have been deployed to implement object detection and tracking in multiple fields. However, conventional classifiers are often faced with challenging tasks that visual frames come distorted due to overlapping, camera motion blur, changing subject appearances, and environmental variations. Models using OpenCV-based HAAR feature-based cascade classifiers, without integrating any error minimizing object detection algorithm, were unable to accurately detect an object and track it in a changing environment. Therefore, developing an embedded powerful framework for realtime object detection and recognition becomes more of a vital need for future implementation in various fields. This study presents a powerful technique for a real-time detector that utilizes integrated Deep Learning Neural Networks (DNN) for optimal computational accuracy. Deploying such a framework will ensure the flexibility and reliability of the detector by eliminating the sources of distortion previously mentioned. The model relies on integrating the ImageAI deep learning libraries and You Only Look Once (YOLO-v3) object detection method with a DarkNet53 architecture. The algorithm was trained using the TensorFlow framework to ensure accurate data processing. This paper targets one vital component of our long-term project of developing a multi-agent system, as the proposed model is to be implemented in autonomous agents for the detection of landmines, ocean debris, and wildlife beside environmental scanning missions. In this study the performance of the model has been assessed through detecting and collecting tennis balls as a preliminary test for real-world applications. The model was able to approach the desirable result of surpassing the accuracy of conventional detectors.},

This number, however, does not completely characterize the learning performance of a MCL system. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the input signal resolution, the number of compressed measurements and the learning performance of MCL. Our empirical analysis shows that the reconstruction error obtained at the initialization step of MCL strongly correlates with the learning performance, thus can act as a good indicator to efficiently characterize learning performances obtained from different sensor configurations without optimizing the entire system.},

It is a fundamental task during the process of automatic music transcription (extracting the musical score from an acoustic signal). We take advantage of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to evolve mathematical functions that act as independent classifiers for piano notes. These classifiers are then used to identify the presence of piano notes in polyphonic audio signals. This paper describes our technique and the latest improvements made in our research. The main feature is the introduction of spectral harmonic masks in the binarization process for measuring the fitness values that has allowed to improve the classification rate: 10\% in the F-measure mean result. Our system architecture is also described to show the feasibility of its parallelization, which will reduce the computing time.},

  abstract  = {Neural networks often do poorly at representing dis-continuous functions, or even just functions with rapid transitions in the response surface between closely-spaced points in feature space. However, such `edges&#39; in the data can be a useful way to partition the feature space in order to train specialised learners for individual regions. This is particularly beneficial where these regions are relatively simple, and hence low-complexity learners can be used successfully on them. Another benefit of such an approach is that it is easily parallelisable: the specialised learners use independent partitions of the data, and so they can be trained in parallel, while output prediction is based on the output of just one network, so there is no need to combine predictions. We introduce an algorithm to partition the data that is inspired by Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting. Using an implementation based on a decision tree with neural networks at the leaves, we demonstrate our approach for regression learning on patches of the feature space. We use both artificial and real-world datasets to show that, in some use cases, this method can outperform conventional neural networks that see the entire feature set in the original training.},

However, the existing work fails to consider the interaction among raw data (in terms of contextual similarity and difference), which results in inaccurate and even conflicting outcomes. In this paper, a novel context-aware extractive summarization algorithm is proposed by utilizing the concept of multi-view learning. Multi-view data are represented using latent topics, by parameterizing multiple Gaussian distributions with trainable hyper-parameters. Then those extracted latent topics are fused and integrated to produce the final summarization output. The experiments on one of the largest online-available cartoon data resources demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm, by achieving the state-of-the-art summarization results when compared with other contemporary approaches.},

Many studies have measured EMG in the shoulders and arms, where there is a lot of muscle mass. In addition, wet type sensors have been often used. However, those are inconvenient to use in everyday life and high cost. In this research, we measure wrist EMG for convenience and cost. Currently, researches have been done on the wrist EMG motion identification and personal identification. These studies have conducted simple movements and a large number of electrodes for discrimination. Furthermore, authentication by password sequence with gestures has not been done. In this paper, we propose to realize motion identification and personal authentication with complex movements using a small number of electrodes. The measured data was preprocessed such as removing noise and smoothing. We compared the accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Long Short-term memory(LSTM) for motion identification and authentication. The accuracies obtained using SVM and LSTM were 60.4\% and 62.4\%, respectively. In this case, the number of data was small. It is therefore necessary for increasing the number of data to perform deep learning.},

Existing fingerprint image enhancement algorithms aim to denoise and improve the clarity of the ridge. High-resolution fingerprint images contain three levels of features. Pores, as one of the level 3 features, have an important contribution to the identification of high-resolution fingerprint due to its abundance and strong security. In this paper, we propose an efficient high-resolution fingerprint image enhancement method based residual learning to improve details of pores and clarity of ridges. The proposed model fully exploits the hierarchical features from the poor-quality high-resolution fingerprint image by two different paths, which are the residual-learning path and low-level path. In the residua-learning path, residual blocks with wider features are used to retain effective features from preceding and current features and extract abundant high-level information of fingerprint image. In the low-level path, shallow layers are used to get fingerprint low-level feature information. The two paths are fused to combine the low-level features and high-level features to boost the reconstruction performance of fingerprint. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy, stability and performance of the recognition, and runs much faster than existing algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) has emerged as a biometric trait potentially with more security benefits compared to its conventional competitors such as fingerprint, iris scan, voice recognition, and face detection. However, there is still a long way to go to make EEG biometrics practical in real-world environments. One of the challenges of the EEG-based biometric systems is time efficiency. The protocols that can evoke individual-dependent EEG patterns are usually time consuming. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EEG signal is also low, which means a large number of epochs/trials (i.e. long acquisition time) are required to achieve a high accuracy recognition system. In this study we propose an EEG-based biometric model that could achieve high identification accuracy with data instances as short as only 1.1s (single epoch instances). In our biometric model, we propose a new protocol called the N-back task which is based on human working memory. As the nature of working memory is very short, it would be possible to elicit individual-dependent EEG responses within a very short period of time. The single epoch classification was achieved applying a deep neural network called EEGNet. Using 1.1s data instances, the proposed model could identify a pool of 26 subjects with the mean accuracy of 0.95, where recognition rate for majority of subjects was ≥0.99. Different components of this identity recognition model, from the proposed protocol to the classification algorithm, can be a line of research for the future of EEG biometric.},

There have been a number of methods proposed for palmprint recognition in recent years. However, most existing palmprint feature descriptors only extract single-type features, which usually can not completely represent the multiple information of a palmprint. In this paper, we propose a novel joint multiple-type features encoding method, which jointly extracts and encodes the important direction and texture features for palmprint recognition. Specifically, we first extract both the dominant direction and the gradient change data to respectively describe the direction and texture features of a palmprint. Unlike the existing methods that directly extract features from single pixel, we extract both the direction and texture features among the local patch by using a majority voting scheme so that the extracted multiple-type features are more accurate and reliable. Finally, we jointly encode the multiple-type features into decimal feature code, and pool them into block-wise histogram feature descriptor for palmprint representation and recognition. Extensive experimental results on the baseline palmprint databases, including the CASIA, IITD and TJU databases, demonstrate the competitive effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Since performance depends on multiple factors and hardware is priced by time slice in cloud environments, knowing beforehand the effects of each factor on time and cost becomes particularly important. The idea is to explain the functional relationship between factors and performance and to develop linear predictor models for time and cost. The approach is based on the solid statistical principles of the Design of Experiments (DoE), particularly the randomized two-level fractional factorial design with replications. The research involved 48 real clusters with different hardware arrangements, and linear models with appropriate metrics were employed for screening, ranking, and measuring each factor&#39;s impact. Our findings with DoE included prediction models and showed the small influence of cores, the neutrality of memory and disks in the total execution time, and the non-significant impact of data scale on cost. Conversely, the scale was the most relevant factor for degrading the execution time, while the number of nodes was more important to improve it. Finally, costs were balanced impacted by nodes and cores. The experiments consistently evidenced the usefulness of employing DoE to analyze factor influence on cluster performance.},

  abstract  = {Data in time series format, such as biological signals from medical sensors or machine signals from sensors in industrial environments are rich sources of information that can give crucial insights on the present and future condition of a person or machine. The task of predicting future values of time series has been initially approached with simple machine learning methods, and lately with deep learning. Two models that have shown good performance in this task are the temporal convolutional network and the attention module. However, despite the promising results of deep learning methods, their black-box nature makes them unsuitable for real-world applications where the predictions need to be explainable in order to be trusted. In this paper we propose an architecture comprised of a temporal convolutional network with an attention mechanism that makes predictions while presenting the timesteps of the input that were most influential for future outputs. We apply it on two datasets and we show that we gain interpretability without degrading the accuracy compared to the original temporal convolutional models. We then go one step further and we combine our configuration with various machine learning methods on top, creating a pipeline that achieves interpretability both across timesteps and input features. We use it to forecast a different variable from one of the above datasets and we study how the accuracy is affected compared to the original black-box approach.},

  abstract  = {The Choquet integral (ChI) is an aggregation operator defined with respect to a fuzzy measure (FM). The FM of a ChI encodes the worth of individual subsets of sources of information, and is an excellent tool for nonlinear aggregation. The monotonicity and boundary conditions of the FM limit the ChI to applications such as decision-level fusion. In a recent work, we removed the boundary and monotonicity constraints of the FM to propose a ChI-based regression (CIR) approach that enables capability beyond previously proposed ChI regression methods. However, the number of values in an FM scales as 2 d , where d is the number of input sources. Thus, with such a large number of trained parameters, we tend to lose the explainability (or interpretability) of the learned solution-which comes readily with simpler methods like ordinary linear regression. In this paper, we enhance the explainability of CIR by extending our previously-proposed ChI visualization techniques to CIR. We also present a set of evaluation indices that quantitatively evaluate the importance of individual sources and interactions between groups of sources. We train CIR on real-world regression data sets, and the learned models are visualized and analyzed with the proposed methods. The demonstrations of the proposed visualizations and analyses are shown to significantly enhance the explainability of the learned CIR models.},

The core of the prediction model is a modified k Nearest Neighbor called Hybrid Fuzzy Weighted k Nearest Neighbor algorithm. The prediction is performed on a patient dataset which consists of more than 70,000 patients with 50 attributes. We applied data preprocessing using different techniques in order to handle data imbalance and to fuzzify the data to suit the prediction algorithm.

By nature these types of problems are computationally expensive and have nested characteristics. It is even more complex when multiple follower is involved at the lower level which requires Stackelberg Nash Equilibrium to be satisfied. As these type of problems are involved in the scenario of transportation, logistics and environmental science, it is highly demanding to make efficient algorithm which requires comparatively low cost. However, so far in our knowledge nobody has tried to solve multi follower bilevel problems by using surrogate approximation approach which uses less computational cost than the traditional meta heuristics algorithm. In this paper, we incorporate Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) model for solving lower level problems which contributes to the reduction of the computational cost. Our analysis involved memetic bilevel approach with surrogate approximation at the lower level and upper level contains traditional differential evaluation strategy. Our proposed approach shows competitive result with low cost than the existing approaches.},

In this model, the supply chain is considered as running through different business processes linked by various flows so it is necessary to reveal the structure of the SCOR network. The interpretive structural modelling (ISM) is a methodology used to impose order and direction on the complexity of relationship among components of a system. Whereas previous studies have identified the business processes in the SCOR model, few studies have attempted to explore the structural relationship between these processes using the ISM approach. This study demonstrates how ISM supports executives in identifying and understanding flows among supply chain processes. ISM helps to classify and rank the business processes based on the driving power and dependencies, as well as provides a hierarchical structure displaying the business processes affecting the implementation of the supply chain network. A study case is used to illustrate the procedure. The results are useful to understand the existing supply chain SCOR model and obtain managerial insights.},

While the exploration of the CS is generally easier for molecules with fewer atoms (such as ligands and short peptides), achieving the same for larger molecules (such as nucleic acids and proteins) beyond a narrow local equilibrium is non-trivial and sometimes computationally prohibitive. In this work, we present Deep Enhanced Sampling of Nucleic Acids&#39; Structures Using Deep-Learning-Derived Biasing Forces (DESNA, pronounced DES-na), that combines variational autoencoder, a special deep neural network (DNN), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to create a robust technique for enhanced sampling, in which DNN-learned latent space is used for inferring appropriate biasing potentials for guiding the MD simulations. The results obtained show that DESNA performs better than conventional MD simulations and efficiently samples wider CS than conventional MD simulations even when DESNA is allowed to run for as short as 10\% of the length of conventional MD simulations. This suggests that DESNA is at least 10 times more efficient that conventional MD simulations in its sampling of CS of molecules.},

The main goal of this paper for managing emergency evacuation is to build a basic model that can simulate the location distribution of people, the speed of personnel, the pedestrian flow, road congestion and other situations. The proposed system mainly combines two multi-agent-based methods, i.e., cellular automata (CA) model and ripple-spreading algorithm (RSA). The CA model simulates the road network and the flow of people, the improved RSA calculates the optimal evacuation path for each people and improves the system calculation efficiency. With the proposed system, we test some specific control measures for high-risk sections in a given area by analyzing evacuation time, road congestion, etc., and the data after the control measures are compared with those before the control measures to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system in the evacuation process. The results can be used to assess the effectiveness of emergency control measures in a given area, such as crowed scenic spot.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we model and solve a multi-objective workforce planning problem in the military domain. We model the career progression of the military workforce by a systems dynamic (SD) simulation model. The developed SD model provides a holistic view by taking into account different aspects of workforce planning including recruitment, promotion, attrition and retention. However, the developed workforce simulation model-like any other simulation model-is not capable of finding optimal decisions. Therefore, we couple the SD model with a meta-heuristic; namely, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). The leveraging capabilities of simulation models with optimization algorithms is known as simulation-based optimization. In this coupling, NSGA-III searches for the best recruitment and promotion decisions that simultaneously minimize the total cost and the capability gap. The capability gap reflects the unavailability of an asset and it occurs when an asset in the fleet is not sufficiently crewed by the existing workforce. The studied joint problem contains an additional challenge due to uncertainties associated with separation rates from the workforce. To overcome this issue, the separation rates are modeled as random variables in the model. Further, we incorporate the risk-attitude of the decision maker into the workforce planning model by a risk measure; i.e., conditional value-at-risk (CVAR), to capture the worst-case performance of systems when they are subjected to severe disruptions. We conduct several numerical experiments under different risk attitudes of the decision maker to show that (i) simulation-based optimization finds efficient Pareto solutions, and (ii) the developed model enables decision maker to find root-causes leading to inferior performance.},

In this study, we focus on strategic military workforce planning, which has long-term impacts on both the efficiency and the future structure of the workforce. Strategic military workforce planning includes decisions regarding recruitment, attrition, promotion, training, and retention policies. It is usually difficult to anticipate how the system, over time, will respond to the combined effects of these strategies Thus, we develop a simulation-optimization approach by coupling a system dynamics (SD) simulation model and a genetic algorithm (GA) to find the best long-term workforce decision(s). GA seeks the optimal workforce flow between different ranks (including promotion strategies) while the SD model simulates the career progression of the workforce from recruitment, throughout the interim separation, and retirement.

Up until the Flint Michigan water crisis in 2012, many Americans were ignorant to the legitimacy of their public water systems. As infrastructure continues to age, and with more advance mining techniques such as fracking continue to deliver unsavory elements into our water supply, it is imperative that we maintain a keen eye on our water systems. This paper looks at the lead contamination levels of schools in the state of New York. Over 43,000 pipes were flagged as having more than 15 ppb of lead contamination. 4,041 are flagged as out of service, and there exist 8,300 lead free buildings in the state. We extended the school level analysis to county level analysis to test the hypothesis to know whether there exists some factor that governed the distribution of lead levels across the counties. Results indicate that there is not any single factor, that governs the distribution of the lead across the counties. While the analysis shows improvement, however more steps need to be taken at a national level to secure the safety of our nation&#39;s water supply.

  abstract  = {Neural synchronicity plays a vital role in monitoring the functions that are cognitive. Any disturbance identified in the neural synchrony might lead to a diseased state. In the case of in vitro cell recordings, the neurons demonstrate significant heterogeneity in the firing pattern. Thus, the task of automated identification of synchronous and asynchronous neurons from a large population of neuronal cells remains challenging. To address this issue, an efficient unsupervised machine learning approach has been proposed for a system of primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Here, a confocal microscope is used for imaging of intracellular calcium using Fluo-4 as the fluorescent indicator. The obtained static images are transformed into time-varying data of cytosolic calcium. Subsequently, an intelligent artificial neural network (ANN) assisted fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed for grouping the synchronous neurons from a heterogeneous set of calcium data that are spiking in nature. This novel algorithm enables a drastic variable reduction followed by the implementation of a global optimization algorithm to solve the problem in Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering. Additionally, the proposed technique computes the optimal cluster number and the hyper-parameters involved in ANNs. To validate the result obtained from ANN assisted FCM, a correlation coefficient, and a spiking pattern plot is analyzed for both the synchronous and asynchronous neuronal cells. Besides this, the proposed algorithm is compared with the traditional FCM, where the solution quality is found to be improved along-with an 88\% reduction in decision variable count. The complete novel framework combines the aspects of calcium imaging, ANN-assisted FCM, validation, and comparison, which as a whole, can be used for quick and effective quantification of synchronicity.},

More precise, during the training phase, different person-and class-specific data samples are aggregated to form overlapping sample sets. The sample sets are fed to the classification models, which use the combined information. The aim is to improve each model&#39;s generalisation ability, by exploring the variety (sample combinations) of each participant&#39;s data distribution. We evaluate our proposed method, in combination with the publicly available pain-related BioVid Heat Pain Database. Moreover, we analyse our proposed approach in combination with three types of basic classification models, namely a nearest neighbour classifier, a support vector machine, and an ensemble of decision trees. The presented results show that our proposed approach is able to significantly improve the baseline classification performance, in combination with the decision tree based ensemble and the nearest neighbour classification model.

  abstract  = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a lifelong condition generally characterized by social and communication impairments. The early diagnosis of ASD is highly desirable, yet it could be complicated by several factors. Standard tests typically require intensive efforts and experience, which calls for developing assistive tools. In this respect, this study aims to develop a Machine Learning-based approach to assist the diagnosis process. Our approach is based on learning the sequence-based patterns in the saccadic eye movements. The key idea is to represent eye-tracking records as textual strings describing the sequences of fixations and saccades. As such, the study could borrow Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for transforming the raw eye-tracking data. The NLP-based transformation could yield interesting features for training classification models. The experimental results demonstrated that such representation could be beneficial in this regard. With standard ConvNet models, our approach could realize a promising accuracy of classification (ROC-AUC up to 0.84).},

  abstract  = {Recently, a set-based particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed for portfolio optimization. The algorithm used a bi-stage search process that first selected assets and then determined the weights for said assets. Unlike other approaches before it, weight determination was accomplished by the use of a nature-inspired algorithm as opposed to quadratic programming. The algorithm was shown to be capable of obtaining goodquality solutions while being relatively fast. However, there were several aspects of the algorithm that could be improved upon, namely, convergence, efficiency, and in some cases, the ability to approximate the known Pareto optimal front. This paper suggests and investigates two modified versions of the set-based algorithm that are shown to yield substantial gains in performance. The latter, referred to as improved set-based particle swarm optimization, was able to find portfolios that are more, or as profitable as those obtained by the original approach, but faster and with lower levels of risk.},

  abstract  = {The canonical particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is generally unsuitable for use in dynamic environments owing to its loss of diversity, the inability to detect changes in the environment, and the outdated memory of the particles&#39; previous positions following such a change. In an attempt to overcome these challenges, the quantum particle swarm optimizer (QPSO) was developed. However, QPSO introduces an additional problem-dependent parameter called the “cloud radius” that requires problem-specific tuning. A recent variation of the QPSO that does not use the cloud radius as a parameter has been demonstrated to match and at times surpass the performance of QPSO. This variation has however only been tested using the ring topology, despite the self-adaptive mechanism utilized having a strong coupling to the used topology. This study aims to investigate the effects of various network topologies on the performance of self-adaptive QPSO. A topology based on the 3D von Neumann structure has been shown to perform significantly better than other topologies.},

  abstract  = {Particle swarm optimisation can easily be used to optimise a function constrained by a set of linear equalities. The converging linear particle swarm optimisation algorithm has been developed specifically for this purpose. Training of a support vector machine requires the solution of such a linearly constrained quadratic optimisation problem. Due to the combinatorial explosion experienced when solving large instances of this quadratic optimisation problem, support vector machines are notorious for poor scalability when working with large datasets. The converging linear particle swarm optimisation algorithm, in conjunction with a decomposition approach, has therefore been put forward as an alternative method for training support vector machines, with a view towards addressing the problem of scalability. In this paper, a number of problems and shortcomings that may be encountered when implementing the converging linear particle swarm optimisation algorithm for training support vector machines, such as premature convergence due to the clamping procedure employed in the original algorithmic implementations are highlighted, and an approach to overcome these shortcomings is proposed. Finally, an analysis pertaining to the scalability of the proposed approach is conducted.},

  abstract  = {While many particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms have been developed to find multiple optima to multimodal optimization problems, very few PSO algorithms exist to both find and track multiple optima in dynamically changing search landscapes. This paper presents a novel multi-swarm PSO algorithm, where the number of sub-swarms change dynamically over time to more efficiently adapt to problems where the number of optima changes over time. In addition, a repelling mechanism is employed to prevent sub-swarms from converging to the same optimum. Instead of designating one particle as the global best position, the global best position is determined by combining the best components from different particles. The new algorithm, called the dynamic multi-swarm fractional-best PSO algorithm, is compared to the best available dynamic multi-modal PSO algorithms on a large set of dynamic optimization problems with varying dynamics. The results show that the dynamic multi-swarm fractional-best PSO performs the best with reference to offline error, and second best with reference to the average number of optima found. The new algorithm&#39;s offline error is also shown to be insensitive to change severity.},

  abstract  = {We introduce two effective strategies into the conventional bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) to improve information utilization and promote information exchange, and propose a powerful multi-colony cooperation BFO (McCBFO). The first strategy randomly divides the whole population into multiple non-overlapping colonies, and the number of colonies in each generation is determined randomly rather than fixed. In other words, the same individual has the opportunity to be assigned to different colonies in different generations to maximize the diversity within the colony and avoid concentrated distribution. The second strategy aims to accelerate the search efficiency by improving information sharing within the same colony and strengthening the information exchange between different colonies. Specifically, the information of the best individual in each colony is shared with other individuals from the same colony and guides them to evolve towards the potential area. Besides, the poorer half of each colony exchange genetic information with randomly selected individuals from other colonies to generate diverse offspring individuals. To analyze the performance of two proposed strategies, we run BFO, (BFO + the second strategy), and McCBFO on three different dimensions (i.e., 2-D, 10-D, and 30-D) of 28 benchmark function from the CEC2013 test suite, and each function is independently run 30 times. The experimental results confirmed that our proposed McCBFO can accelerate the convergence speed and improve the convergence accuracy significantly, and we recommend using the second strategy only for simple problems while their combination for complex problems.},

Yet the number of control parameters involved in the VSO algorithm is relatively larger than those of other popular metaheuristics such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Besides, there is rarely any study on the possible impact of such parameters on the performance of the VSO as based on the default parameter settings when compared to those of other metaheuristics. In this work, the parameter sensitivity of the VSO is carefully examined by performing a suite of experiments.

  abstract  = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a shifting paradigm that allows the integration of billions of devices with the Internet. With its wide range of application domains, including smart cities, smart homes, and e-health, the IoT has created new challenges, particularly security threats. Traditional security solutions, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, need amending to fit the new networking paradigm. Given the recent advances in machine learning, we investigated the use of deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection. The IoT collects a massive amount of data from the environment, and deep learning is based on a set of algorithms striving for the data. Intrusion detection systems are used to expose network threats and are an effective means of protecting network assets. Anomaly detection is a conventional intrusion detection approach that separates normal and abnormal network traffic using statistical, rule-based, or machine learning models. Of the machine learning models, deep learning is a neural network algorithm that has provided breakthroughs in domains such as object and voice recognition. However, there are limitations in applying deep learning to network anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework based on unsupervised deep learning algorithms for revealing network threats. Our research explores the applicability of deep learning to detect anomalies by evaluating the use of Restricted Boltzmann machines as generative energy-based models against Autoencoders as non-probabilistic algorithms. The study provides an in-depth analysis of unsupervised deep learning algorithms. The simulations studies show $\approx$ 99\% detection accuracy, which is significantly improved compared to the closely related work.},

Several research studies have been conducted to address this issue and build more robust deep learning models. Non-continuous deep models are still not robust against adversarial, where most of the recent studies have focused on developing attack techniques to evade the learning process of the models. One of the main reasons behind the vulnerability of such models is that a learning classifier is unable to slightly predict perturbed samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel objective/loss function, the so-called marginal contrastive, which enforces the features to lie under a specified margin to facilitate their prediction using deep convolutional networks (i.e., Char-CNN). Extensive experiments have been conducted on continuous cases (e.g., UNSW_NB15 dataset) and discrete ones (i.e, eight-large-scale datasets [32]) to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results revealed that the regularization of the learning process based on the proposed loss function can improve the performance of Char-CNN.},

While there is literature available advising customers on how to avoid such scams, there is currently a lack of tools to automatically detect red flags of potential scams. One method that scammers use to trick buyers online is providing a contact phone number that belongs to a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service to hide their identities. Moreover, since scammers usually do not actually have the advertised product available to sell, they tend to use images copied from elsewhere on the Internet in their ads. Scammers also typically use certain common scam keywords to trick users. In this paper, we present a tool with intelligent components that automatically detects these indicators to determine the likelihood that a given classified ad is a scam.

However, the above techniques make placement decision on devices for DNN based on heuristics and intuitions by machine learning experts. In this paper, we propose an novel approach for designing device placement of DNN in an automatic way. For a DNN, we employ a sequence-to-sequence model as controller to sample device placement from a one-shot model, which contains all possible device placements with respect to a specific hardware environment (e.g. CPU and GPU). Then, reinforcement learning treats the execution time of sampled device placement as reward to guide the sequence-to-sequence model for finding better one. The proposed approach is employed to optimize the device placement for both model and data parallelism of Inception-V3 on ImageNet. Experimental results show that the optimal placements discovered by our method can outperform hand-crafted one.},

  abstract  = {During each cycle of automotive development, large amounts of geometric data are generated as results of design studies and simulation tasks. Discovering hidden knowledge from this data and making it available to the development team strengthens the design process by utilizing historic information when creating novel products. To this end, we propose to use powerful geometric deep learning models that learn lowdimensional representation of the design data in an unsupervised fashion. Trained models allow to efficiently explore the design space, as well as to generate novel designs. One popular class of generative models are variational autoencoders, which have however been rarely applied to geometric data. Hence, we use a variational autoencoder for 3D point clouds (PC-VAE) and explore the model&#39;s generative capabilities with a focus on the generation of realistic yet novel 3D shapes. We apply the PC-VAE to point clouds sampled from car shapes from a benchmark data set and employ quantitative measures to show that our PC-VAE generates realistic car shapes, wile returning a richer variety of unseen shapes compared to a baseline autoencoder. Finally, we demonstrate how the PC-VAE can be guided towards generating shapes with desired target properties by optimizing the parameters that maximize the output of a trained classifier for said target properties. We conclude that generative models are a powerful tool that may aid designers in automotive product development.},

  abstract  = {Neural Style Transfer has been successfully applied for generating plausible novel 2D images by transferring the style of a painting to an existing content image and has been extended to image, video, motion and animation manipulation. Besides first works on 2D/3D hybrid approaches relying on 2D rendering operations, a consistent end-to-end 3D Neural Style Transfer is missing. For realizing such an end-to-end 3D Neural Style Transfer, we suggested a first 3D voxel-based neural network architecture in previous works. Here, we extend this architecture to a resolution of 256 3 voxels to process vastly finer visual features, and we include our recently introduced standardized gram matrix approach, which reduces noise and visually improves style transfer results. We furthermore show that the type of activation function used in the network is crucial for the successful application in 3D Neural Style transfer. In particular, we demonstrate that the recently proposed bipolar exponential linear unit (belu) operator achieves a consistent style reconstruction independent of filter orientation relative to the shape surface. We compare the operator to the commonly used exponential linear units (elu) and provide insights for the shown behavior. In addition to a purely visual inspection, we evaluate the constructed shapes using local 3D shape descriptors and confirm the subjective visual improvements. We conclude that the utilization of belu operators in the deep neural network architecture is a crucial component for realizing high-resolution voxel-based 3D Neural Style Transfer.},

  abstract  = {Gesture recognition has been a research area of considerable interest for many years. This is due to the many areas it can be applied to, from aiding with sign language recognition to allowing natural interfacing with a computer. With the increase of computing power, new methods of using computational intelligence (CI) algorithms have been explored. One way to improve CI is to test new frameworks for feature extraction and gesture description. One such framework is the Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) which provides functional and expressive descriptors for human gesture. In the past, LMA has been most commonly applied to theatre and dance. This paper attempts to apply LMA to the study of conducting gestures under a computational intelligence framework. In our method, deep learning was employed by using stacked neural networks models. The stacked neural network method allows for more layers of learning, which is anticipated to produce more accurate results. Three datasets of 72 total files was used to train five different neural networks. The results show that we have achieved high accuracy in classifying the various Laban qualities, yielding a maximum accuracy rate of 99.85\% in one area. The main outcome of this research is to showing the use of deep learning in understanding and classifying Laban features and descriptors through musical conducting gestures.},

  abstract  = {Deep Neural Networks for object detection have become of significant interest with the substantial improvement in their efficiency and increase in their applications. However, training such a network requires a large annotated dataset, which is very expensive in term of time and human effort. In this context, several automatic image annotation solutions have been proposed which are dependent on rich visual features and thus suitable for color images only. On the other hand, recent experiments have proven that color cameras alone are not enough for pedestrian related applications and there is a need to use other visual sensors as well, such as thermal cameras. In this paper, we propose an automatic image annotation technique for pedestrian detection in thermal images using an adaptive background/foreground estimation model to train Faster-RCNN. The results presented in this paper, obtained through longterm experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our technique. The results also show that our proposed technique is be very useful to generate image annotations automatically and to train a deep neural network without having a manually annotated dataset for cameras with different modalities.},

  abstract  = {The development of Uninhabited Aerial System (UAS) technology has grown immensely in the last decade with its uptake producing many novel applications. However, the speed of technology adoption also brings its share of challenges, with restricted airspace breaches being a particular safety concern. From a military perspective, detecting and countering armed UAS and adversarial surveillance is also of high importance. To assist with these problems, this paper proposes a method of localisation of Small Uninhabited Aerial Systems (sUASs) commonly known as `drones&#39; from other airborne sUAS using vision-based detection. The Convolutional Neural Network-based Single Shot Detector architecture for real-time object detection known as You Only Look Once (YOLO), chosen for its speed and accuracy, was trained on a custom drone dataset and used to derive absolute coordinates of detected drones from the local position of an observing drone. These coordinates can then be used for further observation and action. Implementation on a physical aircraft for demonstration purposes shows that a target drone can be localised using off-the-shelf components to within an error of 2. 62m (±0.70m 95\% CI) when attempting to maintain a standoff distance of 12. 5m. Analysis on the performance of the YOLO algorithm presents a performance trade-off, where a higher YOLO input network resolution results in a lower distance error and a longer YOLO inferencing time.},

Considering an insider&#39;s inherently privileged level of access on a network, the main principle of network defense-keep potential threats and outsiders out-does not apply to insider threats. Current defenses are largely based on the detection of insider threat indicators which are often manually compiled from past events. This approach is limited in scalability, has difficulty generalizing to new threats, and fails to consider the wide range of behaviors within an organization. In this work, we describe a system that detects potential insider threats through the characterization of temporal behavior on a network. Our approach is completely unsupervised, based on the assumption that there are many different behavioral norms within a network. After testing the system on an operational network with over 8,000 hosts, we show through a series of case studies that the approach is effective in detecting behavioral anomalies suitable for follow up by a human analyst.},

However, at the same time the users do not want to share the sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving predictive model. We used the concept of denoising Auto-encoder to hide the sensitive attributes of a user. We divided the data sets into three different subsets: desired, sensitive, and non sensitive subsets. The output of the denoising Auto-encoder will only be the desired and non-sensitive subsets. The sensitive subsets are hidden by the non-sensitive subsets. We evaluated the efficacy of our predictive model using three different flavors of Auto-encoders (CNN, Deep, and LSTM). To retain the accuracy as similar as possible compared to the original data set, we used a convolutional neural network for classification. We measured the Fl-score of our model against each of the three Auto-encoders.},

The performance of these algorithms is analysed across six different simulated scenarios. Our findings indicate that while there was no single best approach, Evolution Strategies, Ensemble and Genetic Algorithms were the strongest performers.

In the defence sector, the PPSSP arises as a sub-process of Future Force Design (FFD), which is a strategic planning task that assists in the decision making process for future defence force capability programming. The PPSSP faced in the defence context has its own set of challenges above and beyond those typical of the problem. As such, this study investigates a formulation of the PPSSP inspired by the FFD process in the context of the Australian Department of Defence (DoD). Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, four metaheuristics are examined on large-scale synthetic data sets. Three different solution representations are examined and results are compared against solutions provided by a commercial exact solver. Results indicate that there is no observed significant difference in total portfolio value attained by the proposed meta-heuristic approaches and the commercial solver, thereby justifying their usage in this domain.},

The new formulation provides more flexibility for a dynamic optimizer to choose the trade-off between the change frequency and the change severity while the change rate is prescribed by the actual problem. Besides, this study introduces a novel performance indicator for dynamic optimization methods. Unlike conventional ones, this indicator considers the real-time change in the actual problem during a time step and the period in which the best solution should be implemented. The practical importance of this formulation and the proposed performance indicator are studied on a few carefully designed controlled experiments. Subsequently, more comprehensive numerical simulations are performed to investigate the dependency of the optimal change frequency on the employed prediction method and test problem.},

Therefore, in this paper, a novel method termed as TRANSFORM Artificial Neural Network (ANN) assisted reformulation of OC, has been proposed, which transforms the large scale optimization problem into weight training exercise of auto-tuned ANNs that in turn reduces the scale of optimization by several folds. Through this reformulation, the implementation of evolutionary optimization algorithm is enabled for solving both single and multiple objective OC formulations.

  abstract  = {Variance is an inherent part of manifold real-world empirical studies. It can appear due to non-deterministic behavior, measurement or systematic errors, information bias, etc. The former two causes are especially important for parameter tuning, as they can lead to an inaccurate search space estimation and a subsequent decrease in quality of the best found solution. Under parameter tuning we understand an optimization problem of determining the best configuration setting, given a system under investigation and a set of its configurations. Repetitive configuration evaluation is a standard approach to tackle the problem of variance. However, a high number of repetitions can overwhelmingly bloat an effort spent on the search, motivating the development of repetition management strategies. Nevertheless, numerous parameter tuning approaches are either neglecting this problem or suggesting repetition management strategies that are based on a predefined number of repetitions, which can vary for different problem instances. In this paper, we present a repetition management strategy that is inspired by the notion of acceptable measurement error to adaptively determine the number of repetitions for each configuration. Moreover, we investigate the influence of the knowledge on already performed measurements as the additional feedback for the presented repetition management strategy. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches with a set of energy optimization problems. The presented strategies prove to be more scalable and robust to changes, while the utilization of experiment-related knowledge can even further increase the quality of the found solution.},

Additionally a kernelized version of this detector is derived, to process non-linear streaming data. We also propose a method to measure the performance of drift detectors with a binary classification evaluation technique, the confusion matrix, which enables calculating statistics like the F1 score. Our experiments show, that this novel technique is superior to existing state-of-the-art Concept Drift detectors regarding its true positive detection rate.},

  abstract  = {Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to optimize deep neural networks&#39; architecture for better accuracy or smaller computational cost and has recently gained more research interests. Despite various successful approaches proposed to solve the NAS task, the landscape of it, along with its properties, are rarely investigated. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of studying the landscape property thereof and propose to use the so-called Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) techniques for this goal. Taking a broad set of designs of the deep convolutional network, we conduct extensive experimentation to obtain their performance. Based on our analysis of the experimental results, we observed high similarities between well-performing architecture designs, which is then used to significantly narrow the search space to improve the efficiency of any NAS algorithm. Moreover, we extract the ELA features over the NAS landscapes on three common image classification data sets, MNIST, Fashion, and CIFAR-10, which shows that the NAS landscape can be distinguished for those three data sets. Also, when comparing to the ELA features of the well-known Black-Box optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) problem set, we found out that the NAS landscapes surprisingly form a new problem class on its own, which can be separated from all 24 BBOB problems. Given this interesting observation, we, therefore, state the importance of further investigation on selecting an efficient optimizer for the NAS landscape as well as the necessity of augmenting the current benchmark problem set.},

Like any complicated systems, things could go wrong due to various reasons (e.g. network connection response problems, infrastructure resource limitations, software malfunctioning issues, etc.) from time to time. How to quickly resolve issues when they happen becomes critical to help improve customer satisfaction and retention. Recently, fast advancement of natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have helped solving many practical problems by analyzing text information. Powerful algorithms have been developed to interpret human language and derive predictions. Ensemble models are also well suited to further improve performances as they can further explore the latent space to take advantage of features/weights discovered from a group of trained models. In this paper, we will introduce efficient machine learning algorithms to help application service providers manage and automatically resolve trouble tickets to significantly improve user experience and operational efficiency. We propose a hybrid approach to use both unsupervised clustering approach and supervised deep learning embedding to maximize the feature exploration and learning efficacy. Then we ensemble multiple optimized models to build the recommendation engine. This approach helps to incorporate the most relevant information, explore the corpus better for a given problem, managed to produce more consistent and robust predictions, and obtained better accuracy than any single model.},

  abstract  = {Shipping containers have revolutionized the way cargo is transported all around the world by ensuring the safety of shipments during their operating lives. When containers are in transit all year, they age and are exposed to different weather conditions. Therefore, containers are susceptible to deterioration and damages. The corroded surface of the shipping container is one of the most essential defects known on the surface of the containers that leads to severe damage such as hole in which more effort and cost are needed to repairing. The existing solution for shipping container corrosion detection is based on visual inspection that requires human experts to manually inspect containers that are time-consuming. To address this problem, in this paper the optimized deep neural network architecture is proposed to automatically inspect corrosion defects on the surface of shipping containers. In the proposed architecture, deep neural network models including Faster R-CNN, SSD-Mobile net, and SSD Inception V2 are employed and optimized with anchor box optimization to inspect the corrosion defect and localize it on the surface of shipping containers. The accuracy and speed of the deep neural networks in inspecting corrosion defects on shipping containers are compared and analyzed in experimental results. The experimental results demonstrate that the combination of deep neural networks and anchor box optimization improves the performance of models in detecting corrosion of the surface of shipping containers.},

The first level is called lower-level policy, which is the policy to invade or defend a particular territory. The second level is called higher level-policy, which decides about the invader&#39;s behaviour and defenders&#39; belief. The invader tries deceiving the defenders by repeatedly changing its goal from a fake goal to the true goal. On the other side, the defenders try to guess the goal by the invader&#39;s movement. The lower-level policy is trained via the FACL algorithm, while the higher-level policy is derived via the genetic algorithm.

Recent research has shown that reinforcement learning is suitable for this prioritization problem: neural networks and XCS(F) learning classifier systems have been applied to this task. We extend the existing XCSF-based agent by incorporating experience replay (ER) in order to improve learning efficiency. In an experimental evaluation we show that this not only boosts performance but also enables our agent to exceed the aforementioned solutions. For XCSF without ER and neural networks, the most suitable reward function is strongly dependent on the underlying data set. This is in practice a downside as reward functions usually need to be chosen a priori in order to ensure the quality of the chosen test suite. However, for our improved agent this is not the case and we can give a clear recommendation for the reward function.},

  abstract  = {Building energy management and smart energy efficiency are two important application areas for computational intelligence systems. This work describes how we create computational intelligence (CI) in a building energy management system that learns about typical energy use in the building environment and alerts building managers when it detects unusual operating conditions. The CI system is part of a more extensive energy management system, named Tornado, and comprises multiple buildings, various energy forms, and roughly one hundred sensors. The Tornado computational intelligence system (short: Toci) executes both in the cloud and at the edge, on IoT devices deployed in the managed buildings. The machine learning that underlies the alerts that Toci generates runs in the cloud, but learned models are also deployed at the edge. Computational intelligence is not entirely lost when network connectivity is interrupted. One key aspect of our system is that it implemented using the serverless computing paradigm, making our system both highly scalable and efficient. In the paper, we describe several practical applications of TOCI and demonstrate that Toci can detect unusual operating conditions relevant in practice. Taking weather conditions into account, Toci can identify failing inverters in PV installations, despite the high normal fluctuation of solar power production. Due to the serverless architecture, Toci scales very well, and we demonstrate that this is achieved at a low monetary cost.},

Edge computing is an extension of cloud computing infrastructure that pushes the computing storage and network resource similar to the cloud near the data source, i.e., IoT device. The major concern in the edge computing environment to execute tasks generated by IoT devices is optimal energy consumption while satisfying the delay constraint. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization problem in IoT enabled smart city is formulated as an energy and delay minimization problem. At first, a three-layer network architecture for IoT enabled smart cities is presented. After that, we design an auction-based edge resource allocation scheme considering the proposed network architecture, to provide low computing delay with energy-efficient service for delay-sensitive tasks.

The models were evaluated based on their performance, fairness, and explainability. Potential biases, i.e. fairness, were detected with the use of NLP techniques and evaluated with the AIF360 metrics, whereas the explainability of the model was tested by post-hoc explanations (SHAP method). The best results were obtained by the reweighing algorithm that improved the fairness while maintaining a high model performance and explainability.},

The results indicate that there are significant improvements when using heterogeneous ensembles compared to single classifiers, with stacking being the most performant ensemble. The best meta-classifier for stacking was found to be a multilayer perceptron. Additionally, we identified that using probabilities as an input to the ensemble&#39;s meta-classifier, such as in soft voting and stacking variants, can increase their performance.},

  abstract  = {There are numerous challenges when designing algorithms that interact with sensitive data, such as, medical records. One of these challenges is privacy. However, there is a tension between privacy, utility (model accuracy), and fairness. While de-identification techniques, such as generalisation and suppression, have been proposed to enable privacy protection, it comes with a cost, specifically to fairness and utility. Recent work on algorithmic fairness defines fairness as a guarantee of similar outputs for “similar” inputs. This notion is discussed in connection to de-identification. This research investigates the trade-off between privacy, fairness, and utility. In contrast, other work investigates the trade-off between privacy and overall utility. In this research, we investigate the effects of two de-identification techniques, k-anonymity and differential privacy, on both utility and fairness. We propose two measures to calculate the trade-off between privacy-utility and privacy-fairness. Other research has provided guarantees for privacy regarding utility; this research focuses on the trade-offs given set de-identification levels and relies on these guarantees. We discuss the effects of de-identification on data of different characteristics: class imbalance, and outcome imbalance. We evaluated these effects on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. As a case study, we analysed the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey dataset.},

  abstract  = {Social media platforms facilitate mankind a data-driven world by enabling billions of people to share their thoughts and activities ubiquitously. This huge collection of data, if analysed properly, can provide useful insights into people&#39;s behavior. More than ever, now is a crucial time under the Covid-19 pandemic to understand people&#39;s online behaviors detailing what topics are being discussed, and where (space) and when (time) they are discussed. Given the high complexity and poor quality of the huge social media data, an effective spatio-temporal topic detection method is needed. This paper proposes a tensor-based representation of social media data and Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to identify the topics discussed in social media data along with the spatio-temporal topic dynamics. A case study on Covid-19 related tweets from the Australia Twittersphere is presented to identify and visualize spatio-temporal topic dynamics on Covid-19.},

  abstract  = {We investigate the non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) of a Bayesian hyperparameter inferring the underlying distribution of an identically and independently distributed finite random variable. For this we embed both the Bayesian hyperparameter updating process and the random data process into a Markov chain. The original publication by Bertschinger et al. [1] mentioned that NTIC may be able to capture an abstract notion of modeling that is agnostic to the specific internal structure of and existence of explicit representations within the modeling process. The Bayesian hyperparameter is of interest since it has a well defined interpretation as a model of the data process and at the same time its dynamics can be specified without reference to this interpretation. On the one hand we show explicitly that the NTIC of the hyperparameter increases indefinitely over time. On the other hand we attempt to establish a connection between a quantity that is a feature of the interpretation of the hyperparameter as a model, namely the information gain, and the one-step pointwise NTIC which is a quantity that does not depend on this interpretation. We find that in general we cannot use the one-step pointwise NTIC as an indicator for information gain. We hope this exploratory work can lead to further rigorous studies of the relation between NTIC and modeling.},

Here we implemented an abstract simulation model of the C. elegans connectome that approximates the neurotransmitter identity of each neuron, and we explored the functional role of these physiological differences for neural activity. In particular, we created a Hopfield neural network in which all of the worm&#39;s neurons characterized by inhibitory neurotransmitters are assigned inhibitory outgoing connections. Then, we created a control condition in which the same number of inhibitory connections are arbitrarily distributed across the network. A comparison of these two conditions revealed that the biological distribution of inhibitory connections facilitates the self-optimization of coordinated neural activity compared with an arbitrary distribution of inhibitory connections.},

A formal model is developed, situating the algorithm in terms of machine learning. The algorithm is then validated on the 256 possible elementary cellular automata rules. Next, the CARLA algorithm is incorporated into a larger generative system that learns musical patterns by transforming MIDI-encoded music into cellular automata. A novel postprocessing algorithm called Tendril is then developed and integrated with CARLA. This system is then used to generate a novel MIDI composition based partially on update rules learned from Chopin&#39;s Waterfall Étude, demonstrating the utility of this new algorithm for creative applications.},

The sequential strategies represented by stochastic machines were evaluated through games of Iterated Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma (IPD) with other agents in the population, allowing co-evolution to occur. We expanded upon past works by proposing a novel mechanism to mutate stochastic Moore machines that enables a richer class of machines to be evolved. These machines were then subjected to various selection mechanisms and the resulting evolved strategies were analyzed. We found that cooperation can indeed emerge spontaneously in evolving populations playing iterated PD, specifically in the form of trigger strategies. In addition, we found that the resulting populations converged to evolutionarily stable states and were resilient towards mutation. In order to test the generalizability of our proposed mutation mechanism and simulation approach, we also evolved the machines to play other games such as Chicken, Stag Hunt, and Battle, and obtained strategies that perform as well as mixed strategies in Nash Equilibrium.},

In the computational realm, considerable efforts have been made to understand mechanisms and conditions that lead to speciation. Speciation has profound implications for artificial life, evolutionary computation, and evolutionary robotics, yet many aspects of it remain unexplored. Resource distribution is one of the key factors in natural selection, which is critical for sympatric speciation. Research on speciation typically assumes that there is a consistent supply of resources in each available niche. However, fluctuations in available resources might have strong impacts on the extent to which niches are occupied. Such fluctuations could be seen as analogous to risk in economics. Moreover, just as risk necessarily leads to risk aversion in reinforcement learning agents, so might fluctuations in resources lead to a phenomenon analogous to risk aversion in evolution. In this study, the effects of fluctuations in resource distribution are investigated in a simulated biological setting that has been established to favor sympatric speciation. We conclude that fluctuations in resource distribution lead to risk aversion in the process of evolution.},

We aim to study methods that are more efficient and effective in these simple scenarios, aiming to extend them to higher complexity. We engineer two modifications to the system that advance this aim. Progressive selection allows more than an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost without damaging the emergence of modularity, while dynamic specialisation produces significant improvements in modularity while also modestly reducing computational costs. We also provide some insight into the first of the two evolutionary stages in this approach, providing some explanation of why dynamic specialisation works.},

This compels the requirement to enhance automatically generated YARA rules and increase their effectiveness for malware analysis without increasing computational overheads. Reflecting on the above requirement, this paper initially evaluates automatically generated YARA rules using three YARA tools: yarGen, yaraGenerator and yabin. These tools are Python-based open-source tools used to generate YARA rules automatically utilising different underlying techniques. Subsequently, it proposes a method to enhance automatically generated YARA rules using a fuzzy hashing method.

  abstract  = {Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated wearing a mask of anonymity and unleashing more destructive malware on a daily basis. The biggest challenge is coping with the abundance of malware created and filtering targeted samples of destructive malware for further investigation and analysis whilst discarding any inert samples, thus optimising the analysis by saving time, effort and resources. The most common technique is malware triaging to separate likely malware and unlikely malware samples. One such triaging technique is YARA rules, commonly used to detect and classify malware based on string and pattern matching, rules are triggered and alerted when their condition is satisfied. This pattern matching technique used by YARA rules and its detection rate can be improved in several ways, however, it can lead to bulky and complex rules that affect the performance of YARA rules. This paper proposes a fuzzy hashing aided enhanced YARA rules to improve the detection rate of YARA rules without significantly increasing the complexity and overheads inherent in the process. This proposed approach only uses an additional fuzzy hashing alongside basic YARA rules to complement each other, so that when one method cannot detect a match, then the other technique can. This work employs three triaging methods fuzzy hashing, import hashing and YARA rules to perform extensive experiments on the collected malware samples. The detection rate of enhanced YARA rules is compared against the detection rate of the employed triaging methods to demonstrate the improvement in the overall triaging results.},

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning based scheme to detect SFDIA on the state estimation. The scheme uses random forest classifier for dimensionality reduction and elliptic envelope for detecting these attacks as anomalies. We compare the performance of the elliptic envelope method with four other unsupervised methods. All five models are trained and then tested with a dataset from a simulated IEEE 14-bus system. The results demonstrate that the elliptic envelope based approach provides the best detection rate and least false alarm rate among these five unsupervised methods.},

  abstract  = {Malware programmers look for ways to attack computers and networks. They try to find entry points that bypass security and enable them to slip into the system. One of these ways is through Portable Executable (PE) files. On the other hand, methods are devised to discover this danger and take action against it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play an important role in the process of discovering malwares inside PE files. Using AI as a tool, this work aims to study the features of PE file headers as a means of detecting malware and assess the effect of these features on the level of accuracy. The study uses various numbers of PE features. Two different algorithms are used, each with two options, in order to discover their relative effectiveness. Tests are carried out using a specified control data set so that relative performance can be assessed. The criterion used is the level of accuracy obtained with a large number and variation of groups of studies. Each study starts with a collection of features, then features are progressively added to study the impact of these features on accuracy. This was important in showing that not all the features have a positive impact on accuracy. Also, there were some indications that using a large number of features will not always improve the accuracy. Using graphs, it was shown that accuracy will be enhanced after adding a certain number of features. Graphs also show that, along the way of adding the features, accuracy sometimes improves and, in some other times, it goes down, so not all added features are useful. More than 100 runs were made, using a total of 29 features. The highest accuracy obtained with Decision Tree was 0.987, and 0.979 in Neural Networks-Multi-layer Perceptron (NN-MLPC).},

  abstract  = {The explosion of algorithmic trading has been one of the most prominent recent trends in the finance industry. Regularized estimating functions including Kalman filtering (KF) allow dynamic data scientists and algo traders to enhance the predictive power of statistical models and improve trading strategies. Recently there has been a growing interest in using KF in pairs trading. However, a major drawback is that the innovation volatility estimate calculated by using a KF algorithm is always affected by the initial values and outliers. A simple yet effective data-driven approach to estimate the innovation volatility with some robustness properties is presented in this paper. The results show that the performance of the trading strategy based on the data-driven innovation volatility forecast (DDIVF) is better than the commonly used KF-based innovation volatility forecast (KFIVF). Autocorrelations of the absolute values of the innovations in multiple trading are used to demonstrate that the innovations are non-normal with time-varying volatility. We describe and analyze experiments on three cointegrated exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and explain how our approach can improve the performance of the trading strategies. A proposed novel trading strategy for multiple trading with robustness to initial values and to the volatile stock market is also discussed in some detail by using a training sample and a test sample.},

  abstract  = {In recent times, financial statement fraud has resulted in billions of dollars being lost from the financial system. Financial statement fraud is a problem for both listed and local government entities. The present focus in the literature has been on analysing listed entities, and the analysis is typically framed as a supervised learning problem with the labels being audit opinions. In this paper we assess the efficacy of using financial ratios for detecting fraud in financial statements of local government entities. The problem is framed as an unsupervised learning problem. Self organising maps are used due to their visual nature and the resulting accessibility of information to decision makers. The analysis shows that financial ratios are useful in the detection of fraud in the public sector. Using qualified audit opinions as an indication of fraud, the analysis shows that a high current ratio is associated with entities that have unqualified audits (i.e. non-fraudulent), while entities that are fraudulent have a high debt to revenue ratio.},

The framework is proved on daily sampled closing time-series data from JSE equity markets. The input patterns are vectors of pre-processed sequences of daily, weekly and monthly or quarterly sampled feature changes. The data processing is split into a batch processed step where features are learnt using a stacked autoencoder via unsupervised learning, and then both batch and online supervised learning are carried out using these learnt features. The outputs are a vector of point predictions of measured time-series feature fluctuations. Weight initializations are implemented with restricted Boltzmann machine pre-training, and variance based initializations. Historical simulations are run using an online feedforward neural network initialised with the weights from the batch training and validation step. The extent of backtest overfitting is determined using both combinatorially symmetrical cross validation and probabilistic and deflated Sharpe ratios.

With the increasing availability of digital historical records, using automated agents for stock market trading becomes of a significant interest. Reinforcement learning is a machine learning branch which circumvents the problem of defining explicit targets and tackles problems which require sequential decisions. Reinforcement learning has been applied in finance problems, yet execution costs optimization problem among others still gets little attention. The optimization of execution costs in stock markets is a vital problem, where a trader wants to minimize the cost of buying a predefined amount of shares over a fixed time horizon. In this study, we propose a novel reinforcement learning Q-trade model to address the execution costs optimization problem. We tested the Q-trade model using historical data of the Egyptian stock market and Nasdaq stock market, and it showed in both markets a significant improvement (more than 60\% for some securities) over the compared strategies.},

With high-frequency data availability in the last few decades, new volatility models have been proposed that make use of realized volatility measures. These models have been empirically shown to provide better performance when compared with classical low-frequency approaches. In this paper, we propose a methodology combining an MLP neural network with heterogeneous autoregressive models for daily forecasting of the covariance matrix of a portfolio and for dynamically allocating optimal weights. Using Cholesky decomposition we guarantee the positive definite estimates. We used real historical data of 5 stocks of the Brazilian market in our experiments and the results demonstrated statistically superior forecasts compared with the baselines HAR, HARQ, ARFIMA, and DCC, using the Model Confidence Set test. We also evaluate the performance of the portfolios using the matrix estimates from the different models as parameters to Global Minimum Variance Portfolio. Our approach achieved the smallest values of portfolio variance compared with the baselines.},

  abstract  = {We present results demonstrating that an appropriately configured deep learning neural network (DLNN) can automatically learn to be a high-performing algorithmic trading system, operating purely from training-data inputs generated by passive observation of an existing successful trader T. That is, we can point our black-box DLNN system at trader T and successfully have it learn from T&#39;s trading activity, such that it trades at least as well as T. Our system, called DeepTrader, takes inputs derived from Level-2 market data, i.e. the market&#39;s Limit Order Book (LOB) or Ladder for a tradeable asset. Unusually, DeepTrader makes no explicit prediction of future prices. Instead, we train it purely on input-output pairs where in each pair the input is a snapshot S of Level-2 LOB data taken at the time when T issued a quote Q (i.e. a bid or an ask order) to the market; and DeepTrader&#39;s desired output is to produce Q when it is shown S. That is, we train our DLNN by showing it the LOB data S that T saw at the time when T issued quote Q, and in doing so our system comes to behave like T, acting as an algorithmic trader issuing specific quotes in response to specific LOB conditions. We train DeepTrader on large numbers of these S/Q snapshot/quote pairs, and then test it in a variety of market scenarios, evaluating it against other algorithmic trading systems in the public-domain literature, including two that have repeatedly been shown to outperform human traders. Our results demonstrate that DeepTrader learns to match or outperform such existing algorithmic trading systems. We analyse the successful DeepTrader network to identify what features it is relying on, and which features can be ignored. We propose that our methods can in principle create an explainable copy of an arbitrary trader T via “black-box” deep learning methods.},

Unsupervised temporal models employed thus far typically work on sequences of feature vectors, and much less on temporal multiway data. We focus our investigation on twoway data, in which a data matrix is observed at each time step. Leveraging recent advances in matrix-native recurrent neural networks, we investigated strategies for data arrangement and unsupervised training for temporal multiway anomaly detection. These include compressing-decompressing, encoding-predicting, and temporal data differencing. We conducted a comprehensive suite of experiments to evaluate model behaviors under various settings on synthetic data, moving digits, and ECG recordings. We found interesting phenomena not previously reported. These include the capacity of the compact matrix LSTM to compress noisy data near perfectly, making the strategy of compressingdecompressing data ill-suited for anomaly detection under the noise. Also, long sequence of vectors can be addressed directly by matrix models that allow very long context and multiple step prediction. Overall, the encoding-predicting strategy works very well for the matrix LSTMs in the conducted experiments, thanks to its compactness and better fit to the data dynamics.},

While some interpret the whole sequence as one feature vector, others examine subsequences or extract relevant features first. Because of these various perspectives, very different statements result. In this paper, we present the clustering algorithm C(OTS)2 for multivariate time series data sets, that delivers a clustering per time point. It not only optimizes the quality of the clusters regarding intuitive demands, such as the spatial closeness of objects to their neighborhood within a cluster, but also the stability over time. Additionally, it can easily handle missing data points. The algorithm is of benefit whenever a cohesion of groups of time series can be assumed. One advantage is, that it requires only one parameter. Our experiments on different synthetic and real world data sets show, that our method works reasonable and fulfills the intention of finding temporal stable clusters without presupposing that the exact courses of the time series resemble.},

The Statistical Tests Ensemble Detector (STED) uses the results of Brown-Forsythe, O&#39;Brien, and ANOVA statistical tests combined by two voting strategies. To signal warnings, the majority vote is used with the results of the three tests, and, to detect concept drifts, the “Earlyfind-early-report” rule is adopted with the results of the Brown-Forsythe and O&#39;Brien tests only. The experiments&#39; results using Hoeffding Tree (HT) as base learner in 24 artificial and seven real-world datasets corroborates the efficiency of this proposal: STED achieved the best accuracies and was balanced in the detections of drifts, based on its second position in the evaluation using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).},

These distinct advancements are implemented as modules which result in 4608 unique versions of CMA-ES. Previous findings illustrate the competitive advantage of enabling and disabling the aforementioned modules for different optimization problems. Yet, this modular CMA-ES is lacking a method to automatically determine when the activation of specific modules is auspicious and when it is not. We propose a well-performing instance-specific algorithm configuration model which selects an (almost) optimal configuration of modules for a given problem instance. In addition, the structure of this configuration model is able to capture inter-dependencies between modules, e.g., two (or more) modules might only be advantageous in unison for some problem types, making the orchestration of modules a crucial task. This is accomplished by chaining multiple random forest classifiers together into a so-called Classifier Chain based on a set of numerical features extracted by means of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) to describe the given problem instances.},

However, in the case of small training data, transfer-learning is rather preferable. This is a complex process for high dimensional feature space due to the curse of dimensionality. To mitigate the same, this paper proposes a new feature selection method for the classification of manually created fake-face images. In the proposed method, a pre-trained deep learning model is used to extract features of an image. Next, an optimal feature subset is selected from the extracted features through an improved quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm. Lastly, the elicited features are considered to perform the classification. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available manually created fake-face image dataset, namely Real and Fake Face Detection by Yonsei University. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two methods in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected features. The experimental comparisons exhibit that the proposed method achieves promising results among the considered methods.},

  abstract  = {Voltage and reactive power control (VRPC) is one of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems. Evolutionary computation (EC) based VRPC methods have been developed for solving VRPC problems. Since VRPC is an online control, it is necessary to solve a VRPC problem in a limited VRPC interval. Recently, high level of renewable energy penetration and progress of deregulation in power systems require to shorten the VRPC interval and to solve a large-scale VRPC problem in the VRPC interval. Namely, Fast calculation is required in VRPC. Application of parallel and distributed computing (PDC) is a practical option for solving this challenge. However, since power system is a social infrastructure, a dependable method is required for keeping quality of solutions even if several servers cannot return the calculation results due to various faults. When PDC is applied to an EC method using multi-population (MP), there are two ways for realization of parallel computation, namely subpopulation based parallel multi-population (PMP) and individual based PMP. No papers have ever compared the two methods from a dependability point of view. This paper presents comparative evaluation of dependability for VRPC by modified brain storm optimization (MBSO) using the individual and the sub-population based PMP. Simulation results with an IEEE 118 bus bench mark system indicate higher dependability of the method using the individual based PMP than the method using sub-population based PMP.},

  abstract  = {The flow shop scheduling with blocking involves assigning several jobs to machines with minimum time complexity. This problem can be considered as a combinatorial optimization problem that does not have an algorithmic solution. Recently, the modified harmony search algorithm with neighboring heuristics methods (MHSNH) is proposed to tackle this problem. In this paper, the flow shop scheduling with blocking problem is tackled using the island harmony search version of MHSNH. Recently, a new version of harmony search algorithm (iHS) is proposed for global optimization problems. In i HS, the population stored in the harmony memory is divided into a set of sub-populations called islands. After a predefined number of iterations, some of the migrant individuals determined by migration rate are exchanged between islands following a migration topology to control the population diversity. In order to evaluate the island modified harmony search algorithm with neighboring heuristics methods (iMHSNH), a de facto standard job scheduling dataset, Taillard&#39;s benchmark, is used. The proposed algorithm is compared to a number of well-established methods in terms of the mean total flow time and the average relative percentage deviation. The proposed method outperforms other comparative algorithms. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared against MHSNH in terms of locating multiple optimal solutions, which has not been studied before in the literature.},

This paper established a failure probability model of overhead distribution lines under typhoon disasters considering the randomness of load effect. A simpler and faster mathematical statistics method is used to solve the distribution function of the root bending moment of poles. It is concluded that collapsed poles has a more significant impact on failure probability and the introduction of randomness avoids the overestimation of failure probability.

  abstract  = {In many real-life situations in engineering (and in other disciplines), we need to solve an optimization problem: we want an optimal design, we want an optimal control, etc. One of the main problems in optimization is avoiding local maxima (or minima). One of the techniques that helps with solving this problem is annealing: whenever we find ourselves in a possibly local maximum, we jump out with some probability and continue search for the true optimum. A natural way to organize such a probabilistic perturbation of the deterministic optimization is to use quantum effects. It turns out that often, quantum annealing works much better than non-quantum one. Quantum annealing is the main technique behind the only commercially available computational devices that use quantum effects-D-Wave computers. The efficiency of quantum annealing depends on the proper selection of the annealing schedule, i.e., schedule that describes how the perturbations decrease with time. Empirically, it has been found that two schedules work best: power law and exponential ones. In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for these empirical successes, by proving that these two schedules are indeed optimal (in some reasonable sense).},

Such techniques have significant potential within an engineering design paradigm incorporating either many-query analyses or outer-loop applications. This paper presents a hybrid parametric/non-parametric information correction method incorporating the sequential application of several distinct stages within an artificial neural network based surrogate framework. The proposed methodology may be used to correct any domain encompassing set of low-fidelity input/output correspondence using a small subset of high-fidelity samples. A global surrogate can then be generated via a double-loop ANN hyper-parameter selection and training procedure.To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-modelling approach, the aerodynamic response prediction of a parametrized waverider-based re-entry vehicle is examined. Results suggest that the incorporation of multiple corrective stages leveraging low-fidelity data can offer significant improvements in computational efficiency when modelling the expensive high-fidelity function compared with single stage correction. The costs to achieve global accuracy are examined and compared across single/multi-stage variants, with consideration given to surrogate construction and evaluation. Results are compared both with the low-fidelity approximation and a surrogate of the &#39;true&#39; response built using only the high-fidelity samples available to the corrective method.},

  abstract  = {Point cloud autoencoders were recently introduced as powerful models for data compression. They learn a lowdimensional set of variables that are suitable as design parameters for shape generation and optimization problems. In engineering tasks, 3D point clouds are often derived from fine polygon meshes, which are the most suitable representations for physics simulation, e.g., computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Yet, the reconstruction of high-quality meshes from autoencoder-based point clouds is challenging, often requiring supervised and manual work, which is prohibitive during the optimization. Target shape matching optimization using existing mesh prototypes overcomes the difficulties of recovering shape information from the point coordinates. However, for autoencoders trained on data sets comprising shapes with high degree of dissimilarity, there is not a single mesh prototype that can fit any autoencoder-based point cloud, and the selection of a set of prototypes is nontrivial. In the present paper we propose a method for optimizing a selection of prototypical meshes to match the maximum number of shapes in the autoencoder output space as possible, which is achieved by linking the advantages of the latent space representation of an autoencoder and the state-of-the-art free form deformation (FFD) method. Furthermore, we approached the balance between costs (number of mesh prototypes) and number of covered shapes by varying the number of prototypes and the dimensionality of the autoencoder latent space, showing that higher-dimensional latent spaces encode finer geometric changes, requiring more sophisticated FFD setups.},

  abstract  = {Identifying similar solutions during an engineering design process and organizing the design data set into several concepts has substantial benefits. A concept is an abstract representation of design solutions that share comparable properties and behavior. Inspecting such concepts facilitates an increase of knowledge about the structure of the design problem. Concepts also allow for the selection of archetypal representatives which can be used as prototypes for further processing. Each prototype represents a different part of the design domain and can, for example, be effectively used to initialize the starting population of a design optimization leading to meaningful variations towards increased design performance. However, identifying meaningful concepts in a large engineering design data set and objectively quantifying the quality of the identified set of concepts is a challenging task. Existing measures to evaluate concepts of design solutions exhibit substantial drawbacks as they do not consider the simultaneous existence and interactions of multiple concepts on one design data set thoroughly. Therefore, we propose a new measure for objectively quantifying the quality of a set of concepts which explicitly takes the overlap and sizes of the concepts into account. We show the benefits of our measure by comparing it to state-of-the art measures in an automated optimization-based concept identification approach for a real-world inspired engineering design data set.},

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a promising way to increase the biomonitoring volumes significantly. However, taxa abundances are typically very imbalanced, and the amounts of training images for the rarest classes are too low for deep CNNs. As a result, the samples from the rare classes are often completely missed, while detecting them has biological importance. On the other hand, one-class classifiers are traditionally trained with much fewer samples to model a single class of interest. In this paper, we examine their capability to complement deep CNN based taxa identification by indicating samples potentially belonging to the rare classes of interest for human inspection. Our experiments confirm that the proposed approach may indeed support moving towards partial automation of the taxa identification task.},

The initial experiments use a small set of seeds, and implement different neural net architectures, from a simple feed-forward neural network to multi-layer and convolutional networks, aided by image augmentation techniques. Those techniques are necessary for implementing deep learning algorithms with small data. Here we try simple rotation of images with different zooming ranges, and the resulting models for the neural nets are tested for controlling that the complex models are not just over-fitting the data, but generalizing their properties well. As a result, a model for a deep convolutional net achieves the best results, with an accuracy of 90\% in validation and 100\% in an out-of-sample (small) control-test set. These results present a promising line for research on predicting seed viability based only on RGB information (visible attributes such as shape, color and size), being a relevant application for establishing precision crops with native seeds, or for monitoring and reforesting the paramo ecosystem at The Andes mountains in South America.},

This leads to a growing interest throughout many communities; where do algorithms and trained models break? Recently, methods such as generative adversarial neural networks and variational autoencoders were proposed to create adversarial examples that challenge algorithms. This results in artificial intelligence having higher false detections or completely losing recognition. The problem is that existing solutions, are for the most part, black boxes. Current gaps include how do we better control and understand adversarial algorithms. Herein, we propose the concept of an adversarial modifier set as an understandable and controlled way to generate adversarial examples. This is achieved by exploiting the improved evolution-constructed algorithm to identify ideal features that a victim algorithm values in imagery. These features are combined to realize a tuple library that preserves spatial relations. Last, a set of algorithmically controlled modifiers that generate the imagery are found by examining the content of the false imagery. Preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate that this approach has benefits in both generating explainable adversarial examples, as well as shedding some insight into victim algorithm decision making.},

However, this method requires the use of the training data in the application process of imputing unseen data. This requirement means more computation time, especially in the case of large-scale data sets. To address this issue, this work proposes a combination of genetic programming-based feature selection and KNN-based instance selection for imputing incomplete data efficiently while constructing effective symbolic regression models.

Unfortunately, cancer data is often very expensive to collect and high-dimensional, where redundant and/or irrelevant features result in the challenges for cancer detection and hide information from useful features or key oncogenes. Therefore, an efficient and effective feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper to deal with these problems, which based on the classic Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, one of the most widely used Evolutionary Computation (EC) techniques. In this paper, the Evolutionary Population Dynamics (EPD) strategy is integrated into PSO to address its limitations and improve its performance on addressing feature selection problems. The proposed algorithm is examined on eight cancer datasets of varying difficulty. Comparisons have been done among the two versions of the proposed approaches, standard binary PSO, and three other feature selection methods in terms of the classification performance, the number of selected features and the convergence behaviors. The results show that in most cases, the proposed EPD mechanism can help PSO to achieve better performance over the compared methods.},

However, these kinds of systems have no access to direct cues about the driver’s state. Hence, the aim of this work is to extend the driver drowsiness detection in vehicles using signals of a driver monitoring camera. For this purpose, 35 features related to the driver’s eye blinking behavior and head movements are extracted in driving simulator experiments. Based on that large dataset, we developed and evaluated a feature selection method based on the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm for the driver’s state classification. A concluding analysis of the best performing feature sets yields valuable insights about the influence of drowsiness on the driver’s blink behavior and head movements.

  abstract  = {This study explores the influence and control strategies of rising photo-voltaic (PV) penetration in power system networks. The power system network is simulated for varying levels of PV penetration and a non-linear pattern of voltage increase is observed with increasing PV penetration. Popular local control strategies to tackle the overvoltage problem: reactive power control; active power curtailment; and power factor control are then analysed. Simulations of these control techniques are carried out under different weather conditions to analyse the suitablility of these techniques. The combination of active power curtailment and reactive power control strategies is explored to provide higher efficiency and cater for the deficiency of both techniques. The analysis and simulation of these control techniques would be an aid for power system operators to evaluate penetration levels of PV in the network as well as provide technical support for local control techniques to alleviate overvoltages.},

Compared with the existing works on quantum projection filtering, the proposed approach requires no prior knowledge on the structure of the submanifold, and thus can be used to deal with general open quantum systems.

SSA is a data-adaptive multimodal method based on singular value decomposition, which is a promising tool to capture the dynamic characteristics of process data, while the KPCA is used to extract nonlinear features in the process using kernel functions. Thus the proposed method takes cross correlation, auto correlation and nonlinearities of the data into account.

  abstract  = {The aim of this work is to control the longitudinal position of an autonomous vehicle with an internal combustion engine. The powertrain has an inherent dead-time characteristic and constraints on physical states apply since the vehicle is neither able to accelerate arbitrarily strong, nor to drive arbitrarily fast. A model predictive controller (MPC) is able to cope with both of the aforementioned system properties. MPC heavily relies on a model and therefore a strategy on how to obtain multiple linear state space prediction models of the nonlinear system via input/output data system identification from acceleration data is given. The models are identified in different regions of the vehicle dynamics in order to obtain more accurate predictions. The still remaining plant-model mismatch can be expressed as an additive disturbance which can be handled through robust control theory. Therefore modifications to the models for applying robust MPC tracking control theory are described. Then a controller which guarantees robust constraint satisfaction and recursive feasibility is designed. As a next step, modifications to apply the controller on multiple models are discussed. In this context, a model switching strategy is provided and theoretical and computational limitations are pointed out. Lastly, simulation results are presented and discussed, including computational load when switching between systems.},

Several maintenance incidents were recorded by the sensor system in two separate vehicles. Two approaches to selecting training data were used in the analysis. The first followed a traditional method of randomly selecting a certain percentage of data points to include in training. The second data selection strategy was to select certain incidents to include in training, with the remaining incidents unseen for testing. Using classifier and anomaly detection techniques, models of the system using 76 predictor variables were trained to distinguish between healthy and failed system states in a two-class problem. Significant differences in performance results were noted depending on the selection of data included in training. A rule-based classifier model was then applied to leverage the predictions from both the classifier and anomaly detection models yielding promising results. The construction of an ensemble model was an effective way to mitigate the challenges presented in the training strategies, where a single individual model would not succeed in both scenarios. The simplification of the system into two states could be regarded as restrictive when the `healthiness&#39; of a system is nuanced; however, despite this simplification, good performance and accurate predictions could still be achieved.},

The patients have to be monitored as to detect an epileptic episode early on in order to prevent associate risks. Research in the past has used a combination of time and frequency features for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures. An classification approach has been used to automatically detect epileptic seizures. In this paper, the epileptic seizure recognition data set is used for the investigation. Two fusion methods, ensemble and Choquet fuzzy integral, are compared using different deep neural network architectures. To aid the comparison, evaluation measures such as confusion matrix, AUC and accuracy are used in conjunction with MSE and RMSE. The results of the experiments show that the Choquet fuzzy integral fusion method outperforms the ensemble method. In addition, other state-of-the-art classification methods are also outperformed by the Choquet fuzzy integral fusion method.},

The solution model takes the form of a hyper-heuristic. As the search progresses, this strategy chooses among different heuristics, adapting the solution process to the current problem state under exploration. The proposed model relies on the k-means clustering algorithm to identify the centroids of what we define as “action regions” (regions where we can recommend one particular heuristic). To recommend a heuristic in such action regions, we use a simple yet useful reward-based approach that analyzes the performance of individual heuristics. Then, the hyper-heuristic (a collection of action regions) decides which heuristic is the most suitable one to apply given one specific problem state. The experimental setup was carried out on a total of 580 bin packing instances with promising results.},

When there are many algorithms to choose from, there are various algorithm combinations of possibilities. Selecting a well-composed algorithm portfolio becomes essential to solve a problem set efficiently. In this paper, we propose a problem set dependent method to automatically and generically accomplish portfolio construction. The problem set can be composed of any problem, and come from any distribution or any benchmark. To decide which algorithm should be added in the portfolio, we utilize the average rank of results from solving problems to find the best-performing algorithm. Then we select complementary algorithms for the portfolio by applying Pearson correlation coefficient of fitness values. The method then iterates to compose more and more complex portfolios until there is no more improvement. This method is tested under three different problem sets. The experimental result shows the good ability of this approach to detect well-cooperated algorithms; and the composed portfolio is proved to have good adaptability to the problem set.},

Data preprocessing techniques and classification algorithms can be adapted to cope directly with longitudinal data inputs, making use of temporal information such as the time-index of features and previous measurements of the class variable. In this article, we propose two changes to the classification task of predicting age-related diseases in a real-world dataset created from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. First, we explore the addition of previous measurements of the class variable, and estimating the missing data in those added features using intermediate classifiers. Second, we propose a new split-feature selection procedure for a random forest&#39;s decision trees, which considers the candidate features&#39; time-indexes, in addition to the information gain ratio. Our experiments compared the proposed approaches to baseline approaches, in 3 prediction scenarios, varying the “time gap” for the prediction - how many years in advance the class (occurrence of an age-related disease) is predicted. The experiments were performed on 10 datasets varying the class variable, and showed that the proposed approaches increased the random forest&#39;s predictive accuracy.},

Here we propose a counter-intuitive idea with the inspiration comes from the Braess&#39;s Paradox phenomenon. To be specific, we propose to delete edges from an ATN to improve its corresponding robustness. To achieve this goal, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem which aims to maximize the robustness of the focal ATN as well as to minimize the number of edges to be removed. In order to address the developed optimization model, we introduce the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and modify its algorithm operators to make it fit for the established model. To check if the research idea proposed works or not, we conduct experiments on nine real-world ATNs. In the experiments, NSGAII has been compared against its successor-NSGA-III, and another state-of-the-art optimization algorithm named MODPSO. Experiments indicate that NSGA-II performs better than the rest two algorithms on the tested ATNs. For the tested ATNs, three networks have their robustness improved by 100\% by removing less than six edges while the remaining six get an improvement of around 10\%. This work provides aviation decision makers with a new perspective on ATNs design and management.},

This is especially true for complex real-world problems where a single evaluation of configuration can take minutes, hours or even days. To overcome the problem, the eTuner and eTunerAlgo have been proposed. The distinctive feature of eTunerAlgo is that both algorithm selection and parameter tuning is done automatically. We evaluate proposed algorithms using three metaheuristics-Ant Colony optimization (ACO), Evolutionary Strategy (ES) and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) and two NP-hard problems - Aerial Surveying Problem (ASP) and Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Furthermore, a metaheuristic tuning benchmark containing 18,760 configurations is generated for efficient method evaluation.

In the context of black-box optimization, these features have to be derived from a set of (x, f(x)) samples. A number of different features have been proposed in the literature, measuring, for example, the modality, the separability, or the ruggedness of the instance at hand. Several of the commonly used features, however, are highly correlated. While state-of-the-art machine learning techniques can routinely filter such correlations, they hinder explainability of the derived algorithm design techniques.We therefore propose in this work to pre-process the measured (raw) landscape features through representation learning.

  abstract  = {The main goal of the multitasking optimization paradigm is to solve multiple and concurrent optimization tasks in a simultaneous way through a single search process. For attaining promising results, potential complementarities and synergies between tasks are properly exploited, helping each other by virtue of the exchange of genetic material. This paper is focused on Evolutionary Multitasking, which is a perspective for dealing with multitasking optimization scenarios by embracing concepts from Evolutionary Computation. This work contributes to this field by presenting a new multitasking approach named as Coevolutionary Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm, which finds its inspiration on both the Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic and coevolutionary strategies. The second contribution of this paper is the application field, which is the optimal partitioning of graph instances whose connections among nodes are directed and weighted. This paper pioneers on the simultaneous solving of this kind of tasks. Two different multitasking scenarios are considered, each comprising 11 graph instances. Results obtained by our method are compared to those issued by a parallel Variable Neighborhood Search and independent executions of the basic Variable Neighborhood Search. The discussion on such results support our hypothesis that the proposed method is a promising scheme for simultaneous solving community detection problems over graphs.},

  abstract  = {This work presents a comparative evaluation of four population-based optimization algorithms for workflow scheduling in cloud-fog environments. These algorithms are as follows: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE) and GA-PSO. This work also provides the motivational groundwork for the weighted sum objective function for the workflow scheduling problem and develops this function based on three objectives: makespan, cost and energy. The recently proposed FogWorkflowSim is used as the simulation environment with the aforementioned objectives serving performance metrics. Results show that hybrid combination of the GA-PSO algorithm exhibits slightly better than the standard algorithms. Future work will include expansion of the workflows used by increasing the number of tasks as well as adding some more workflows. The addition of some more objectives to the weighted objective function will also be pursued.},

  abstract  = {The cost of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inference can be reduced by pruning weights from a trained network, eliminating computations while preserving the predictive accuracy up to some threshold. While many heuristic saliency metrics have been proposed to guide this process, the quality of pruning decisions made by any one metric is highly contextsensitive. Some metrics make excellent pruning decisions for one network, while making poor decisions for other networks. Traditionally, a single heuristic saliency metric is used for the entire pruning process. We show how to compose a set of these saliency metrics to form a much more robust (albeit still heuristic) saliency. The key idea is to exploit the cases where the different base metrics do well, and avoid the cases where they do poorly by switching to a different metric. With an experimental evaluation of channel pruning on several popular CNNs on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, we show that the composite saliency metrics derived by our method consistently outperform all of the individual constituent metrics.},

In this paper, we present an environment-oriented adapted DQN implementation on the OpenAI Gym CarRacing self-driving environment where a driver agent successfully learns difficult control policies from raw pixels using a deep convolutional neural network. By implementing multiple optimizations and environment-specific adaptations on the original DQL algorithm, we were able to improve on some of the limitations of the base DQN algorithm significantly on this platform. Our trained agent was therefore able to produce successful results and obtain higher convergence scores while being more time efficient and using less computational resources. Obtaining a promising average score over one hundred consecutive trials, the results achieved suggest that the proposed adapted DQN agent improves substantially on the base DQL algorithm. Our agent surpassed Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and multiple other approaches in the CarRacing RL environment.},

  abstract  = {Deep reinforcement learning has recently seen huge success across multiple areas in the robotics domain. Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-toreal gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the different approaches and point to the most promising directions.},

However, this approach is computationally intractable when scaled to complex tasks. We propose a distributed evolutionary meta-learning strategy using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that is highly parallel and scalable to arbitrarily long tasks with no increase in memory cost. Using a Prototypical Network trained with evolution strategies on the Omniglot dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.4\% on a 5-shot classification problem. Our algorithm used as much as 40 times less memory than automatic differentiation to compute the gradient, with the resulting model achieving accuracy within 1.3\% of a backpropagation-trained equivalent (99.6\%). We observed better classification accuracy as high as 99.1\% with larger population configurations. We further experimentally validate the stability and performance of ES-ProtoNet across a variety of training conditions (varying population size, model size, number of workers, shot, way, ES hyperparameters, etc.). Our contributions are twofold: we provide the first assessment of evolutionary meta-learning in a supervised setting, and create a general framework for distributed evolution strategies on TPUs.},

We conduct experiments on two real-life weather datasets. The datasets are measurements from cities in Denmark and in the Netherlands.

The manipulated contents have reached to such sophisticated level that human cannot tell apart whether a given content is real or fake. To deal with this serious threat, a rich body of visual forensic techniques has been proposed for detecting forged video and images. However, existing techniques either rely solely on engineered features or require a complex deep learning model to extract the underlying patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end visual forensic framework that can incorporate different modalities to efficiently classify real and forged contents. The model employs both the original content and its frequency domain analysis to fully exploit the richness of the image latent patterns. They are forwarded into two separated EfficientNet, a light yet efficient neural network architecture specialized for image classification, for pattern extraction. Then, we design a late-fusion mechanism to fuse the learnt features in original and frequency domain based on the importance of the underlying information. Our experimental results show that our proposed technique outperforms other state-of-the-art forensic approaches in many datasets and being robust to various visual forgery techniques.},

The general idea is to develop a system that is able to detect different maneuvers that drivers perform while driving a car. With that we want to detect not only the type but also the time window when the maneuver was performed. As this paper shows, maneuver detection could be done by analyzing the basic senors and signals normally measured in a car, such as revolutions, speed, steering wheel angle, pedal position and others. Moreover, the proposed method does not require any additional (intelligent) sensors such as cameras, radar, etc. On the basis of these signals we can identify two new maneuvers: U-turn and 3-point turn. For the experiment purposes we have acquired a real data from a car simulator with experienced drivers. The experiments show that the evolving fuzzy cloud-based system efficiently deals with detecting of driver maneuvers. Easily we could adapt the algorithm for online processing, analyzing and detecting the maneuvers in real time. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for real applications.},

Generating an ensemble classifier generally is composed of three steps: selecting a base classifier, applying a sampling strategy to generate different simple classifiers and aggregating the classifiers&#39; outputs. This paper focuses on the classifiers&#39; outputs aggregation step in ensemble learning and presents a new interval-based aggregation approach using Bagging and Interval Agreement Approach (IAA). Bagging is an ensemble learning approach to generate ensembles of classifiers by manipulation of the training data set and IAA is an aggregation approach in decision making which was introduced to combine decision makers&#39; opinions when they present their opinions by intervals. In this paper, we use Bagging approach to generate uncertainty intervals for simple classifiers in ensemble learning and implement IAA to aggregate the intervals with the aim of capturing uncertainty. In fact, we design some experiments to encourage researchers to use interval modeling in ensemble learning because it preserves more uncertainty and leads to more accurate classification. We compare the results of implementing the proposed method to the majority vote, as the most commonly used aggregation function in ensemble learning, for 10 medical data sets. The results show the better performance of the proposed interval-based aggregation approach in binary classification when it comes to ensemble learning. The Bayesian signed-rank test confirms the competency of our proposed approach in this research.},

Moreover, a detailed survey of IML methods along with identifying the essential building blocks of a black-box model is presented here. Herein, we have identified and described the requirements of IML methods and for completeness, a taxonomy of IML methods which classifies each into distinct groupings or sub-categories, is proposed.

In many applications, however, one needs to know the confidence of classifications, e.g. to facilitate risk management. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for measuring TM confidence based on the logistic function, calculated from the propositional logic patterns that match the input. We then use this scheme to trade off precision against recall, producing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for TMs. Empirically, using four real-world datasets, we show that AUC is a more sensitive measure of TM performance compared to Accuracy. Further, the AUC-based evaluations show that the TM performs on par or better than widely used machine learning algorithms. We thus believe our scheme will make the TM more suitable for use in decision support, where the user needs to inspect and validate predictions, in particular, those being uncertain.},

One way to achieve the zenith for these is to identify factors including curricular and extracurricular activities of students. The basic aim of the proposed work is to predict a learner&#39;s performance based on certain parameters such as the number of absences, family background, eating and sleeping habits, etc. This kind of performance prediction can be used by facilitators or faculties to help learners improve their academic conduct. In this paper, the Classification and Regression Tress(CART) algorithm is used for the construction of the initial population of decision trees. The dataset is pursued in two ways for construction of decision tree: 1) It is divided into five different sub-datasets depending on the similarities of attributes and 2) Original one single dataset is considered. To make an optimal prediction, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is, a genetic algorithm has been used. According to genetic algorithms, the best chromosome(solution) to the problem survives amongst all possible chromosomes(solutions). However, its performance might get deeply affected by the choice of the genetic operators used in various steps of the genetic algorithm. There are four different classes namely Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4 based on the different attribute values of the instances. The proposed approach yields 91\% accuracy for the final prediction of classes, which is quite encouraging as compared to the other existing works in the same domain.},

  abstract  = {Rule induction in traditional machine learning (ML) concentrates on finding rules that minimize error to produce high accuracy through a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. But what if the machine learning task is to produce minimal length rules with zero error (the error-free ML optimization problem)? In its most basic form, the problem can be recast as reverse-engineering the syntactically-minimal well-formed formula (wff) that correctly covers all rows of a given Boolean truth table. The main problem for evolutionary approaches to zeroerror rule induction is the design of a suitable fitness function to cope with a search landscape that is not amenable to hillclimbing. In this paper we demonstrate how using the ratio of true to false rows in the truth table can be used as a heuristic to guide a memetic algorithm for exploring and exploiting the search for zero-error, syntactically minimal wffs in randomly generated truth tables for up to 12 variabes. The search depth of candidate solutions is determined by the number of variables in the data and the size of a solution is allowed to increase as long as its coverage improves. Significant differences in solution size were found depending on the ratio of true to false values in the data. The results provide a basis for further formalization and development of zero-error rule induction if ML is to be used confidently in safety critical situations where no error in induced rules is permissible.},

  abstract  = {As the real-world applications (image segmentation, speech recognition, machine translation, etc.) are increasingly adopting Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), DNN’s vulnerabilities in a malicious environment have become an increasingly important research topic in adversarial machine learning. Adversarial machine learning (AML) focuses on exploring vulnerabilities and defensive techniques for machine learning models. Recent work has shown that most adversarial audio generation methods fail to consider audios’ temporal dependency (TD) (i.e., adversarial audios exhibit weaker TD than benign audios). As a result, the adversarial audios are easily detectable by examining their TD. Therefore, one area of interest in the audio AML community is to develop a novel attack that evades a TD-based detection model. In this contribution, we revisit the LSTM model for audio transcription and propose a new audio attack algorithm that evades the TD-based detection by explicitly controlling the TD in generated adversarial audios. The experimental results show that the detectability of our adversarial audio is significantly reduced compared to the state-of-the-art audio attack algorithms. Furthermore, experiments also show that our adversarial audios remain nearly indistinguishable from benign audios with only negligible perturbation magnitude.},

However, most of existing data reduction algorithms focus solely on either feature selection or instance selection.

  abstract  = {Microresistivity imaging logging is a crucial technique for evaluating the glutenite, carbonate and other complex reservoirs in oil exploration field. Because the size of the electrode pads in the electric imaging logging instrument can not match the borehole size well, it is hard to get full borehole covering images, which leads to many blank strips in the logging images. Thus it is necessary to fill the blank strips to ensure the accuracy of the subsequent processing and interpretation. The existing filling methods work well only in simple formation structures, but for images whose structure is very complex, for example, glutenite formation, the filled regions appear blurred and indistinct. To remedy the drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a machine learning method to inpaint the blank strips in electrical logging images based on deep convolutional neural network with the attention mechanisms embedded, which can capture a large number of low-level image statistical prior information. The attention mechanisms here refer to both the channel attention and the spatial attention. The channel attention focuses on the information to be attended in the intermediate feature maps while the spatial attention serves determining where to attend. Extensive experiments validate and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed filling method, which produce more compelling results than the existing filling approaches.},

To overcome these problems, we have proposed, BCINet, a novel optimized convolution neural network model.

People with motor disabilities are potential users of this technology since it could allow them to interact with their surroundings without using their peripheral nerves, helping them regain their lost autonomy. The P300 Speller is one of the most popular BCI applications. Its performance depends on its classifier&#39;s capacity to identify and discriminate the presence of the P300 potentials from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. For the classifier to do this correctly, it is necessary to train it with a balanced data-set. However, as the P300 is usually elicited with an oddball paradigm, only unbalanced distributions can be obtained. This paper applies an under-sampling method based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) on P300 EEG signals looking to increase the classifier&#39;s accuracy. Two classifying models, a deep feedforward network (DFN) and a deep belief network (DBN), are tested with data-sets obtained from healthy subjects and post-stroke victims. We compared the results with our previous works and observed an increase of 7\% in classification accuracy for our most critical subject. The DBN achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 95.53\% and 94.93\% for a healthy and post-stroke subject, while the DFN, 96.25\% and 93.75\%.},

After the bounding box of the objects is estimated, the location of the SSVEP flickers are designed to overlap on the object locations. An overlapping FFT and SVM is used to recognize the EEG signals into corresponding classes. In experimental results, the classification rate for camera view scenario is more than 94.1\%.

  abstract  = {Depersonalisation/derealisation refers to a transient psychological condition characterised by losing the sense of body ownership and feeling detached from the outside world. It is often accompanied by a lack of emotional responsiveness and sometimes memory fragmentation. Studies have shown the temporary occurrence of this condition among 34-70\% of the general population during their life span. However, if the symptoms become consistent, they can be intolerable and can profoundly affect the quality of life in such an extent that it would be considered as one type of the dissociative disorders, depersonalisation disorder (DPD). Currently, there is no laboratory method to diagnose DPD, and studies have expressed a period of seven to 12 years for the correct diagnosis of DPD. We recently aimed to investigate DPD and its symptoms based on inexpensive and convenient electroencephalogram (EEG) neuroimaging technique, using calculation of event-related-potentials (ERPs) over the somatosensory cortex. We showed that DPD symptoms could be as a result of impairment in early (implicit) stages of information processing in the brain. We also introduced P45 as a potential electrophysiological biomarker to study DPD. In this paper, we first replicated our results and then used P45 as a feature to discriminate between individuals with high and low tendency to DPD symptoms. We used Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW) to address the possible time shift and distortion in the ERP signals and to reach better classification performance. We reached 85\% accuracy (Kappa 0.7) using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, which confirms the feasibility for discrimination between DPD patients and a control group using EEG signals.},

  abstract  = {The Hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) test reflects the average amount of glucose accumulated in the blood over the last 2-3 months. The HbAlc is considered as one of the fundamental indexes for diabetes management. It is used to monitor long-term glycemic control, adjust therapy, assess the quality of diabetes care, and predict the future risk of complications. Predicting levels of HbAlc in advance holds a critical significance for maintaining long term health of diabetes patients. A higher than the normal value of the HbAlc increases the likelihood of diabetes-related complications. This study aims to predict the HbAlc levels 2-3 months in advance, which will facilitate early intervention and avoiding complications arise from diabetes. We propose novel feature extraction from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data using the fractional derivative, glucose variability, time in range, and wavelet decomposition methods. The highly correlated features were identified and used while developing the HbAlc prediction models. The developed framework was evaluated using the CGM data sourced from the Diabetes Research in Children Network (DirecNet). The ensembling of the random forest and extreme gradient boosting models coupled with the feature fusion obtained the best performance of low mean absolute error (MAE) 3.39 mmol/mol and a high coefficient of determination (R-squared) score of 0.81.},

  abstract  = {As the global population of older adults increases, measures are put in place to monitor their well-being, promote independent living and improve their quality of life. Among those measures are in-house monitoring system that allows for the collection of data in a non-invasive form to identify the activities of daily living of the older adults and detect abnormalities in their daily routines. Abnormalities can be an early sign of health decline or other related challenges, thereby informing the family and carers of the need for intervention. However, existing anomaly detection systems are unable to adapt to the dynamic nature of human activities which are subject to changes due to different factors, resulting in an increased false prediction rate. To address this deficiency, the anomaly detection system must be adaptive to the changes in human routines as well as factors leading to the changes. This paper presents a consolidation of the achievements recorded in the development of an adaptive anomaly detection system. This system consists of a data collection and interpretation component, anomaly detection component and a feedback component. An ensemble of novelty detection model based on a consensus approach is utilised for the anomaly detection while the feedback component is based on a gesture recognition model implemented on an assistive robot platform. The results of our proposed approach for anomaly detection and gesture recognition performs better when compared to other existing approaches. The obtained results for the different system components show the potential of the system for in-house monitoring of older adults.},

Besides, the proposed classifiers extract the determinants that identify an active person. The classifiers yield an AUC of up to 0.81 and specificity and sensitivity of up to 0.79. From the classifiers, we conclude that age and gender are the most influential determinants. Notably, body mass index (BMI) impacts females more strongly than males, whereas screen time for TV impacts males more strongly.

By investigating the implications of the current pandemic data, we propose a fuzzy-geospatial modelling approach, in which uncertainties and linguistic descriptions of data, some of which being geo-referenced, are handled by non-singleton fuzzy logic systems.

While research in machine learning applications for concussions has focused on using advanced metrics such neuroimaging techniques and blood biomarkers, these metrics are yet to be implemented at a clinical level due to cost and reliability concerns. Therefore, concussion diagnosis is still reliant on clinical evaluations of symptoms, balance, and neurocognitive status and function. The lack of a universal threshold on these assessments makes the diagnosis process reliant on a physician’s interpretation of these assessment scores. This study aims to explore the use of machine learning techniques to aid the concussion diagnosis process. These models could provide an automated means to flag concussed patients even before being seen by a doctor as well as expand the scope of concussion diagnosis to remote locations and areas with limited access to doctors.},

The experiments are carried out on two modified versions of PSO, namely Power- and Zigzag-PSO, which act without any preliminary information about external forces modeled by vector fields. We propose four dynamic topologies inspired by the game-theoretic concepts and investigate their performance relative to the ordinarily static ones with regard to convergence and “energy expenses”, reflecting the amount of collective effort needed to eliminate the produced drift. The results reveal that the topology of social connections on its own is not an effective way to cope with the unknown disturbance during the search. However, within the predefined coping mechanism against the disturbance as in the case of Zigzag-PSO, the considered dynamic topologies show the advantage before static ones for a limited communication radius, indicating its potential in swarm robotics applications.},

The vast majority considers a single UAV, which comes with several constraints such as its range of operations or the number of sensors it can carry. Using multiple autonomous UAVs simultaneously as a swarm makes it possible to overcome these limitations. However, manually designing complex emerging behaviours like swarming is a difficult and tedious task especially for such distributed systems which performance is hardly predictable. This article therefore proposes to automate the design of UAV swarming behaviours by defining a multi-objective optimisation problem, so called Coverage of a Connected-UAV Swarm (CCUS), and designing a Q-Learning based Hyper-Heuristic (QLHH) for generating distributed CCUS heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of QLHH to generate efficient heuristics for any instance from a given class.},

  abstract  = {A multi-agent differential robot system requires a definite algorithm to behave as a swarm with goal searching capabilities. The classic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed for particles with no mass or physical dimensions unlike differential robots. Therefore, it cannot be directly used to search for a goal using a robotic swarm. We propose the use of the PSO as a trajectory planner to enable the agents to collectively find the optimal path to a goal. The proposed PSO trajectory planner uses multiple known parameters such as inertia weight, a constriction parameter, two scaling factors and two random weighing factors (for the cognitive and social components of the PSO) optimized for differential robots. The planner takes into account the restrictions derived from the kinematic equations of the robotic agents and the finite dimensions of the search space. For that purpose, it is coupled with the necessary controllers to map particle velocities into smooth and continuous differential robot velocities. Four different controllers were tested, including the Transformed Unicycle Controller (TUC), Transformed Unicycle with LQR (TUC-LQR), Transformed Unicycle with LQI (TUC-QI), and a Lyapunov-stable Pose Controller (LSPC). The TUC-LQI controller outperformed the others in terms of achieving smooth continuous differential robot velocities, while following the paths generated by the PSO trajectory planner.},

The new topological structure enables the algorithm to have more control over the interaction and information exchange between the particles to reduce the loss of diversity and avoid premature convergence. In the new algorithm, the population is initially divided into two sub-populations, first sub-population is further divided into sub-swarms that are formed using the introduced topological structure. The particles of sub-swarms are guided using heterogeneous behaviour by selecting various exemplars. The second sub-population employs the classical PSO search with local and global information to simulate a homogenous behaviour. There is information flow between the two subpopulations. The algorithm was tested on the CEC2005 and CEC2017 test suites with comparison against various state-of the-art PSO variants and other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics.

As in nature, the BIS algorithm makes gender distinction among agents and the main search strategy exploits competition between male agents in an attempt to provide a better location for females. BIS agents embark on various nature-inspired mating strategies and the inspiration for the reproduction model is derived from temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a reptilian reproduction system. The BIS algorithm&#39;s TSD inspired reproduction model enables female agents to control the gender of offsprings based on guidance provided by their male mates, subsequently resulting in regulation of the male-female ratio in the swarm which in turn auto-controls the balance of exploration and exploitation within the population of agents. The efficiency of the BIS algorithm was tested over a wide range of benchmarks including unconstrained high dimensional and real-world problems. The BIS algorithm performed very well in comparison with a number of leading population-based stochastic search methods, finding the highest number of global optimums.},

When both of these measurements approach the level of humans, the method and system will also become practical as high score and short time performance for learning can lead to practical real-world applications. Other well-known approaches, such as DeepMind&#39;s Atari game player, achieve human-level scores but the time taken to learn to play the games is many orders of magnitudes slower than that of humans, leading to inapplicability in real-world scenarios beyond the games. In our previous paper, we demonstrated the ability of a causal learning framework to learn to play the Atari game, Space Invaders, at both the score and time performance levels of a human novice. In this paper, we show that an extension of this system reported earlier leads to the ability for the system to perform at both the score and time level of a human expert.

Because actions are a critical aspect of establishing causality for robotic systems, the term actional-perceptual causality is used to emphasize their importance. Using a distinction between diachronic (over time) and synchronic (timeless, contextual) to characterize the causal conditions involved in an actional-perceptual situation, a framework of inductive causal learning for AI and robotics can be made equivalent to the well-established and sound statistical method of causal learning used in experimental sciences, thereby placing actional-perceptual causal learning for AI and robotics on a firm foundation.

Initially, we modelled bilingual acquisition and demonstrated the agent’s skill to appropriately detect the spoken content and automatically match the human user’s language. We aim to contribute at designing multilingual robot agents able to understand and communicate contexts in multiple tongues without loss of meaning in translations, which can greatly affect human cognitive and interaction capabilities. Furthermore, we design a novel methodology to teach the robot how to learn gradually from experience new knowledge not specified at design time and directly apply it for task solving, without being trained anew. The demonstrated system shows promising potential to becoming a low-cost social companion that can be easily integrated in the human world.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we investigate whether a humanrobot scenario continuously influenced participants after an experimental human-robot scenario. Many studies have been conducted on the social behaviors of robots. It is important that these robots try to naturally participate in a human community and behave in a human-like way. As robots get sociable, humans that interact with the robots are likely to be affected by the robots that behave in a human-like manner like they are affected by other humans. In particular, some studies showed that robots had an influence on humans in some human-robot experimental scenarios. Although previous studies on social robots investigated the social influence on a human from robots in the human-robot scenario, long-lasting influence on a human after the scenario is still incompletely understood. This study investigates the longlasting effect on human decision-making in an experimental scenario of human-robot groups, which included robots learning group norms. We assess this influence by analyzing the results of two kinds of questionnaires that the participants answered during the experimental human-robot scenario and more than one week after the scenario. The questionnaire results reveal that some participants&#39; decision makings was limited by a group norm developed in a human-robot group more than one week after the experimental scenario.},

The results that we highlight here could easily have been revealed at the time that the relevant key papers were published, more than a decade ago, but the accepted methodology at the time of those publications involved a somewhat minimal approach to experimental evaluation of trader-agents, making claims on the basis of a few thousand test-sessions of the trader-agent in a small number of market scenarios. In this paper we present results from exhaustive testing over wide ranges of parameter values, using parallel cloud-computing facilities, where we conduct millions of tests and thereby create much richer data from which firmer conclusions can be drawn. We show that the best public-domain AI/ML traders in the published literature can be routinely outperformed by a “sub-zero-intelligence” trading strategy that at face value appears to be so simple as to be financially ruinous, but which interacts with the market in such a way that in practice it is more profitable than the well-known AI/ML strategies from the research literature. That such a simple strategy can outperform established AI/ML-based strategies is a sign that perhaps the AI/ML trading strategies were good answers to the wrong question.},

An empirical evaluation of the proposed methodology we term NCS-NEAT leads to improved performance over basic NEAT in terms of accuracy and problem specific criteria and is a promising way to scale neuroevolution up to handle larger datasets without placing restrictions on the topology neural networks that are able to be learned. Two different machine learning problem classes were selected to be representative of a broad range of applications of deep learning and neuroevolution: the first is a price forecasting problem to predict the prices of mobile phones based on their characteristics; the second is a reinforcement learning test problem to validate the novel approach in a different type of problem.},

Here we use an ontology to represent and structure information extracted from financial SEC reports in a way that is optimised for search. These mandatory reports are originally published as XML using a schema that has varied over the years. The XML format itself is not easy to query, e.g. projections to fields or their composition are hard to find even when using an XML store. Our ontology-based approach provides uniformity of representation, which is further enhanced by the strife to use common vocabulary wherever possible. The ontology is then used to identify links between companies, by finding common senior employees or major shareholders. This is also potentially useful information to identify suitable pairs of stock. We show that the ontology increases the probability of selecting cointegrated pairs of stock from the data, with no negative effect on the survival time of such pairs when compared to random ones.},

For the case when the target state is an eigenstate of the internal Hamiltonian, we introduce a virtual control law into the system model and design corresponding control law. The stability of the system under the action of the Lyapunov control law is analyzed via the LaSalle invariance principle. For the case when the target state is a superposition state, we design a control law by performing a unitary transformation for the quantum system model under consideration. To achieve desired state transfer, we further introduce a PSO algorithm to search for the unknown parameters contained in the control law. Numerical results on a five-level quantum system and a three-qubit system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

Although the potential of completely removing the user out of the tuning cycle is questionable, taking more informative autonomous decisions is highly desirable as part of the general pursuit of artificial intelligence. Towards this goal, we propose an enhanced version of a recently proposed gradient-based parameter adaptation method that can be used by any population-based metaheuristic. The enhancement lies in the use of reinforcement learning to adapt the tuner’s parameters, offering overall performance gains. The REINFORCE family of algorithms is considered in the present paper as the proof-of-concept approach. The proposed method is demonstrated on the differential evolution algorithm, which stands among the most popular metaheuristics. Experimental assessment on an established test suite offers promising results, also verifying previous evidence regarding the tuner’s robustness and simplicity.},

The majority of approaches reduce the clustering problem to the optimization problem, which is non-linear, multi-dimensional, and multi-extreme. Evolutionary algorithm based clustering is known as one of the most efficient approaches. Nevertheless, many modern evolutionary algorithms demonstrate low performance when solving large-scale global optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an approach for solving large-scale clustering problems using decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms. We have compared the performance of the standard k-means, k-means++, and the proposed CC-SHADE and CC-SHADE-RAG2 algorithms using benchmark problems with 16 clusters and 512 and 1024 attributes (the corresponding optimization problems use 8192 and 16384 objective variables). The experimental results show the decomposition-based approaches essentially outperform the standard evolutionary and k-means clustering algorithms.},

A Success-History Based Parameter Adaptation for Differential Evolution (SHADE) is a well-established variant of DE algorithm which employs a historical performance of the successful control parameters. L-SHADE algorithm extends SHADE with a linear population size reduction strategy. The SHADE and L-SHADE algorithms employ current-to-pbest/1 strategy for evolution, whilst the order of candidate solutions is not considered in their schemes. This paper proposes an ordering strategy for SHADE and L-SHADE algorithms which has shown a satisfactory influence on the performance of both algorithms. In the first direction, we propose current-to-3order/1 strategy for SHADE algorithm, which is based on ordering three candidate solutions. In the second direction, L-SHADE algorithm is improved based on ordering two candidate solutions, called current-to-pbest-2order/1. The proposed strategies can improve the performance of SHADE and L-SHADE algorithms without adding any extra significant computational cost. The proposed strategy is evaluated on CEC-2017 benchmark functions and with dimensions 30, 50, and 100. Our experimental results clearly verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.},

In this paper, we propose a novel partial opposition-based DE scheme. Given that the partial OBL reduces the likelihood of converting good variables to their opposites, the main challenge of this technique is still the selection of variables which should be replaced with their opposites. The proposed scheme addresses this issue by creating a reference solution using averaging on the best candidate solutions. This reference solution plays a crucial role in intelligent selection of variables to compute their corresponding the opposite value based on their distance to the set of best solutions. The proposed partial opposition-based scheme is embedded in Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm and compared with opposition-based DE (ODE) and DE using the set of CEC-2014 benchmark functions on dimensions 30, 50, and 100. Experimental results indicate a promising improvement over DE and ODE.},

The intrinsic characteristics of ACO algorithms enables them to transfer knowledge from past optimized environments via their pheromone trails to shorten the optimization process in the current environment. In this work, change-related information is also utilized when a dynamic change occurs. The dynamic vehicle routing problem is addressed where nodes are removed, representing customers that have already been visited, or added, representing customers that placed a new order and need to be visited. These change-related information are used to heuristically repair the solution of the previous environment, based on effective moves of the unstringing and stringing operator.

  abstract  = {In the basic vehicle routing problem, the best routes need to be found for a fleet of vehicles to serve a set of customers. The dynamic vehicle routing problem is a variant of the vehicle routing problem, in which part or all the information defining the routing problem might change over time. This requires an optimizer to perform a fast search of new routes once the change happens. For its robustness with respect to noise, evolutionary algorithms have shown great potential for the dynamic vehicle routing problem. However, the existing evolutionary methods only evolve a population of solutions online for the ever-changing problem, which might not be very efficient. In this work, we propose a new evolutionary method which combines offline computation and online optimization to solve the dynamic vehicle routing problem. It first searches for a set of good solutions for possible environmental changes in an offline way, and then searches for the new optimal solution online for the ever-changing problem through doing local search on this solution set. Competitive co-evolution is applied to search for the solution set in the proposed method. Experimental study has been conducted on one dynamic vehicle routing benchmark with the change of customers&#39; demands. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Multi-population evolutionary models are effective methods for solving many difficult optimisation problems due to their ability to preserve population diversity via isolated evolution mechanisms. However, applications to multi-objective combinatorial problems containing time-varying characteristics is limited. In this paper, we propose a multi-population model to improve optimisation performance on the recent dynamic formulations of the Travelling Thief Problem. A key feature of our model relates to how the currency of exploitable problem information, with regard to problem dynamics, can be used for population seeding in response to dynamic events. We contrast performance of a multi-population model with differing optimisation goals in each isolated sub-population with a similar model featuring migration between populations and a standard single population method. The sharing of information between differently directed subpopulations provides significant improvements in terms of hypervolume measurements throughout the optimisation procedure. A performance analysis method is applied here to capture the significant improvements of the different models throughout the varying dynamic intervals of the problem instances. Significant performance improvements are achieved with a relatively simple multi-population topology and migration patterns that ensure currency of exploited problem information. The application of multi-population techniques to further examples of complex dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems remains an ongoing research pursuit.},

To tackle these problems, evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used due to their effectiveness and minimum design effort. However, for dynamic problems, extra mechanisms are required on top of standard evolutionary algorithms. Among them, diversity mechanisms have proven to be competitive in handling dynamism, and recently, the use of neural networks have become popular for this purpose. Considering the complexity of using neural networks in the process compared to simple diversity mechanisms, we investigate whether they are competitive and the possibility of integrating them to improve the results. However, for a fair comparison, we need to consider the same time budget for each algorithm. Thus instead of the usual number of fitness evaluations as the measure for the available time between changes, we use wall clock timing. The results show the significance of the improvement when integrating the neural network and diversity mechanisms depends to the type and the frequency of changes. Moreover, we observe that for differential evolution, having a proper diversity in population when using neural network plays a key role in the neural network&#39;s ability to improve the results.},

Moving adverse weather areas, restricted zones, and time-variant airflow characteristics are taken into account in the airspace. Second, a ripple spreading algorithm adapted to a dynamically weighted network is introduced. The optimal flight route can be achieved by a single run of this efficient method.

It corresponds to a many-to-many path planning problem in dynamic routing network. The existing static plan optimization and dynamic path optimization method are difficult to ensure the theoretical optimality of the solution in a dynamic disaster environment, and may lead to the failure of emergency material transportation. In this paper, a method of co-evolutionary path optimization is proposed and improved to resolve the many-to-many path planning problems. The ripple diffusion algorithm completes the search process in the form of a ripple diffusion relay race in a given routing environment. Furthermore, the coevolutionary path optimization method combines the ripple diffusion process with the routing environment change process. When different ripples compete with each other, the routing environment changes dynamically at the same time. Finally, the theoretical optimal solution is obtained in just a single off-line operation. The experimental results show that the coevolutionary path optimization method has advantages over the traditional method in success rate, solving time, optimality, and flexibility.},

In this paper, we evaluate the Forward Actor-Critic against the regular Actor-Critic, and Continuous Actor-Critic Learning Automation. We also propose and evaluate a new algorithm called True Online Continuous Learning Automation (TOCLA) which combines these two approaches. The chosen benchmark problem was the Mountain Car Continuous-vO environment from OpenAI Gym, which represents a further step in complexity over the benchmark used to test the Forward Actor Critic in previous works. Our results demonstrate the superiority of TOCLA in terms of its sensitivity to hyper-parameter selection compared with the Forward Actor Critic, Continuous Actor Critic Learning Automation, and Actor Critic algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In practice, it is quite common to face combinatorial optimization problems which contain uncertainty along with non determinism and dynamicity. These three properties call for appropriate algorithms; reinforcement learning (RL) is dealing with them in a very natural way. Today, despite some efforts, most real-life combinatorial optimization problems remain out of the reach of reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning approach to solve a realistic scheduling problem, and apply it to an algorithm commonly executed in the high performance computing community, the CHOLESKY factorization. On the contrary to static scheduling, where tasks are assigned to processors in a predetermined ordering before the beginning of the parallel execution, our method is dynamic: task allocations and their execution ordering are decided at runtime, based on the system state and unexpected events, which allows much more flexibility. To do so, our algorithm uses graph neural networks in combination with an actor critic algorithm (A2C) to build an adaptive representation of the problem on the fly. We show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics used in high performance computing runtime systems. Moreover, our algorithm does not require an explicit model of the environment, but we demonstrate that extra knowledge can easily be incorporated and improves the performance. We also exhibit key properties provided by this RL approach, and study its transfer abilities to other instances.},

In this paper, we present an acceleration scheme, called Anderson acceleration (AA), for RL, where the value function in the next iteration is calculated using a linear combination of value functions in the previous iterations. Since the original AA method suffers from instability, we consider adaptive Anderson acceleration (A3) as a stabilized variant of AA, which contains both adaptive regularization to handle instability and safeguarding to enhance performance. We first apply A3 to value iteration for Q-functions and show its convergence property. To extend the idea of A3 to model-free deep RL, we devise a simple variant of deep Q-networks (DQN). Our experiments on the Atari 2600 benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms double DQN in terms of both final performance and learning speed.},

We first present a generalized MaxEnt formulation based on minimizing a KL-divergence instead of maximizing an entropy. This improves the previous heuristic derivation of the MaxEnt IRL model (for stochastic MDPs), allows a unified view of MaxEnt IRL and Relative Entropy IRL, and leads to a model-free learning algorithm for the MaxEnt IRL model. Second, a careful review of existing inference algorithms and implementations showed that they approximately compute the marginals required for learning the model. We provide examples to illustrate this, and present an efficient and exact inference algorithm. Our algorithm can handle variable length demonstrations; in addition, while a basic version takes time quadratic in the maximum demonstration length L, an improved version of this algorithm reduces this to linear using a padding trick. Experiments show that our exact algorithm improves reward learning as compared to the approximate ones. Furthermore, our algorithm scales up to a large, real-world dataset involving driver behaviour forecasting. We provide an optimized implementation compatible with the OpenAI Gym interface. Our new insight and algorithms could possibly lead to further interest and exploration of the original MaxEnt IRL model.},

In particular, we propose a Q-learning technique to design a finite horizon optimal control with event-based availability of the observed state vectors. The observer adaptively estimates the system dynamics along with the states. The action dependent value function or Q-function parameters are estimated at the controller using the observer states transmitted intermittently to the controller. Aperiodic update laws are proposed to estimate the action dependent value function or Q-function parameters that satisfy the terminal condition. An event-triggering condition is derived to orchestrate the events, i.e., the time instants of feedback transmission and control execution, such that the closed-loop event-triggered system is ultimately bounded in the finite time horizon. It is also shown that the closed-loop system parameters converge asymptotically to zero when the time horizon extends to infinity. With the proposed method, the optimal control is learned in a forward-in-time and online manner without any knowledge of system dynamics. Finally, the analytical design is validated by using a numerical example via simulation.},

This joint learning problem is alleviated through expert demonstrations, auxiliary losses, or neural inductive biases. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach called Hindsight Generation for Experience Replay (HIGhER) that extends the Hindsight Experience Replay approach to the language-conditioned policy setting. Whenever the agent does not fulfill its instruction, HIGhER learns to output a new directive that matches the agent trajectory, and it relabels the episode with a positive reward. To do so, HIGhER learns to map a state into an instruction by using past successful trajectories, which removes the need to have external expert interventions to relabel episodes as in vanilla HER. We show the efficiency of our approach in the BabyAI environment, and demonstrate how it complements other instruction following methods.},

We developed a three-step phishing detection (PD) framework inspired by machine learning and a secure storage distribution (SSD) for cloud to improve model accuracy and storage security. The partition-based selection of features is designed for phishing detection (PD) with a hybrid classifier approach and hyper-parameter classifier tuning. Initially, the entire data set is partitioned by entropy and is hybridised for each performing model partition. In order to reduce the complexity, the next entropy is applied to decrease the dimension of each partition. Finally, to improve precision, the performing model is optimised with hyper-parameter tuning. The partition-based feature choice with the hybrid classifier approach outperforms with 97.86\% accuracy for both attack detection from the experimental and comparative results of SVM, LM, NN and RF. Atlast, SSD performance is evaluated against other storage models where SSD outperforms other models.},

  abstract  = {UWB-based indoor localization technology uses weak, extremely short pulses to detect the environment, which is useful for artefact processing. However, the traditional received signal strength (RSS) features are difficult to be used for UWB-based localization. A feature novel extraction method based on mixed graph similarity is proposed to locate the indoor environment. Each scattered signal is converted into two types of graph: a nature visibility graph (NVG) and a horizontal visibility graph (HVG). Two input RF signals of each measurement can be constructed into a 4×4 similarity matrix by mixed the NVGs and HVGs. Then all features are forwarded into a support vector machine and a k-nearest neighbours classifier for identifying four environments. The results show that the best classification effect based on 10-fold validation approaches can reach 97.43\% accuracy. The statistical analysis shows that the similarity between NVGs and HVGs has a positive correlation with room size.},

  abstract  = {In the seismic domain, collecting seismic signal and alerting movements of earth crust is crucial for monitoring and forecasting seismic activities. At the same time, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, the device interoperability is the minimum requirement for communication among any available sensing device. Semantic web technologies promote this interoperability, by enhancing the quality of data that become ontology-annotated. The paper introduces an ontology model for describing the seismic domain, through the data collection from sensors, to gather seismic signals aimed at the seismic event recognition. The ontology has been built on the well-known SOSA and SSN ontologies, modeled to describe systems of sensors, actuators, and observations. The ontology, namely VEO (Volcano Event Ontology), has been modeled on actual data sensors, collected by a monitoring network at Mt. Vesuvius (Naples, Italy). Along with the ontology model of the seismic domain, a machine learning-based classification has been accomplished to identify seismic events (underwater explosions, quarry blasts, and thunders). A VEO-driven knowledge-base collects raw seismic data and detects events, accessible by SPARQL queries.},

Multi-objective optimization problems offer two spaces for a decision maker to analyze, the decision space and the objective space. In the literature, most of the focus has been on analyzing the objective space, however, in this paper, two procedures are presented for analyzing the decision space by identifying the variables that predominantly influence the structure of the objective space. Both procedures employ a recently proposed rule mining approach, which is used to find significant rules in terms of the variables. The rules are then combined and an influence score is calculated. The method is demonstrated on four problems, two scalable test problems (DTLZ2 and WFG2) with cases of three, five and seven objectives, one engineering design problem and one simulation-based optimization problem. The experiments show that the proposed approach is able to identify influential variables in most problem cases.},

  abstract  = {The Pareto dominance relation is a special case of a cone order. Cone orders and the Pareto order are translation invariant and also multiplication invariant by any positive real. Employment of more general cone orders instead of the Pareto order gives rise to interesting exploration opportunities for algorithm design. In this paper, the standard Pareto dominance relation has been extended to cone dominance with a pointed convex obtuse cone, a superset of the Pareto dominance cone, i.e., the non-negative orthant, by rotating the edges of the Pareto order cone. The basic idea is in line with earlier work on cone-orders in multicriteria decision making and here, in particular, the cone-order is used (1) to increase solutions&#39; dominance area and hence improve the convergence speed of the algorithm and (2) to formulate trade-off constraints. The minima of the obtuse cone order are also Pareto optimal. However, not all minima of the Pareto order are also minima of the obtuse cone order. Therefore we use the edge-rotated cone in an alternating manner with the standard Pareto cone to guarantee coverage of the entire Pareto front. The edge-rotated cones have been integrated in several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and proven to be able to improve the performance of MOEAs on multi-objective optimization problems with the linear, concave, convex and disconnected Pareto front. Furthermore, when the edges of the cone are rotated by different angles, the algorithm obtains solution sets located in different areas of the Pareto front. This behavior can be used to take the preference of the targeted region on the Pareto front into the algorithm. In particular, by using obtuse cones, regions where trade-off is very unbalanced can be discarded. This is quantified by showing a relationship between the angle and the trade-off rate corresponding to this angle.},

  abstract  = {The hypervolume indicator is a popular performance indicator in the field of Evolutionary Multi-objective optimization (EMO). However, there are two issues associated with it in addition to its large calculation cost for many-objective problems. The first issue is that the maximization of the hypervolume indicator leads to a non-uniform solution set on a nonlinear Pareto front. The second issue is that it cannot handle preference information. To address these two issues, some hypervolume variants have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, first we review these variants and extract the common characteristic among them, i.e., all these variants can be converted to the standard hypervolume indicator with a transformed solution set. Based on this observation, we propose the transformation-based hypervolume indicator, which is a framework for designing hypervolume variants. Then, we propose two new hypervolume variants based on our framework. Empirical studies suggest the effectiveness of the proposed variants for addressing the above-mentioned two issues. Our experimental results also suggest the possibility of designing other hypervolume variants for different purposes using our framework.},

There have been a wide variety of different methods which have incorporated semantics into single-objective GP. The study of semantics in Multi-objective (MO) GP, however, has been limited and this paper aims at tackling this issue. More specifically, we conduct a comparison of three different forms of semantics in MOGP. One semantic-based method, (i) Semantic Similarity-based Crossover (SSC), is borrowed from single-objective GP, where the method has consistently being reported beneficial in evolutionary search. We also study two other methods, dubbed (ii) Semantic-based Distance as an additional criterion (SDO) and (iii) Pivot Similarity SDO. We empirically and consistently show how by naturally handling semantic distance as an additional criterion to be optimised in MOGP leads to better performance when compared to canonical methods and SSC. Both semantic distance based approaches made use of a pivot, which is a reference point from the sparsest region of the search space and it was found that individuals which were both semantically similar and dissimilar to this pivot were beneficial in promoting diversity. Moreover, we also show how the semantics successfully promoted in single-objective optimisation does not necessary lead to a better performance when adopted in MOGP.},

  abstract  = {Recently, it has been stressed that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) should produce Pareto front approximations with good diversity regardless of the Pareto front geometry. In this light, the use of selection mechanisms based on multiple quality indicators (QIs) is a promising approach due to the exploitation of their strengths. In this paper, we propose to exploit the trade-off between the IGD+ and the Riesz senergy indicators, which assess convergence and diversity of a Pareto front approximation, respectively. Since the preferences of both indicators are regularly in conflict due to their different measure scope, it is possible to design a selection mechanism that exploits such trade-off, aiming to generate Pareto front approximations with a good degree of convergence and diversity simultaneously. Our proposed density estimator is embedded in a steady-state MOEA, denoted as PFI-EMOA, which is compared with several state-of-the-art MOEAs. Our experimental results based on the WFG and WFG -1 test problems show that PFIEMOA outperforms several state-of-the-art MOEAs, providing outcomes having good convergence and diversity. Additionally, the performance of PFI-EMOA does not depend on the Pareto front shape.},

Preferences can be used to find satisfying solutions: optimal solutions, which best match the expert&#39;s preferences. To model the preferences of the expert, and aid him/her in finding satisfying solutions, a novel method is proposed. The method utilizes machine learning combined with belief-rule based systems to adaptively train a belief-rule based system to learn a domain expert&#39;s preferences using preference information gathered during an interactive process. Belief-rule based systems are explainable generalized expert systems, which have not been used before in the manner described in this paper to model preferences of a domain expert for a multi-objective optimization problem.

This high-performing system, with its deliberately simple neurocontroller, provides an excellent foundation for the community to use for the evolution or learning of more complex behaviours in bipeds. We also investigate the effects of modified morphology with the system, significantly improving agent fitness by evolving networks alongside morphologies resembling a baby albatross. The agents with albatross morphologies travel up to three times further than default agents. We then test incrementally evolving agent morphology via the simultaneous evolution of a separate morphological genotype. We initialised this genotype either alongside a high-performing controller or from a completely random point in both fitness landscapes. Agents evolved from this random initialisation travel up to four times further than default agents. One randomly initialised incremental morphology also achieves gaits with significantly higher upper body and swing knee controller input weights than the default.},

Specifically, individuals from a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), with movement rules defined by Genetic Programming, survive by predating on individuals from an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) system that operates on traditional optimization rules.

Identifying and understanding warning signs that would indicate where when a system gets irrevocably out of control before this happens would be a critical tool in being able to attain a viable long-term strategy that takes the needs of both economy and ecology into account.We here explore a route towards such quantities. In the last years, the concept of empowerment has been investigated as a measure of control of an actor over its environment, i.e. the potential impact that an actor can have on its environment; in addition an extension had been proposed towards a concept of sustainable empowerment which, in addition, limits oneself only to control strategies which can be undone.We investigate both concepts inside a framework of systems of coupled elements endowed with a dynamics governed by cubic differential equations, which have been established as simple but powerful models to study sustainability. In this framework, we illustrate how the dynamical properties of such a system affect empowerment and sustainable empowerment. The results suggest that these quantities can provide relevant indicators for desirable strategies to guiding such systems under sustainability considerations.},

Yet despite these extensive researches, the role of the environment in the emergence of complexity is often experimenter-dependent. In this work, we present a framework in which environmental variables are the sole control mechanism for directing the evolution of an autonomous population of artificial creatures. The Environment-Driven Evolutionary Selection (EDEnS) algorithm automatically and simultaneously explores multiple alternatives, initially identical but with potentially differing dynamics with respect to their (a)biotic constraints. By exposing populations to different sets of constraints, they are subjected to divergent fitness functions both across the simulation space and between successive elementary steps. This framework is applied on a system composed of artificial plants autonomously reproducing in a 2D environment subjected to three factors: topography, temperature and hygrometry. We show that some of the populations obtained via EDEnS exhibit increased capabilities to invade foreign environments over populations evolved in a hospitable, constant environment. Moreover, the data thus collected highlighted two fundamental advantages of the automated exploration of abiotic constraints: the positive effects of catastrophical trimming and the unbiased designing of dynamical environments.},

  abstract  = {Modeling a complex system is a daunting task for students as several perspectives need to be employed at varying resolution levels. Students need to abstract a real system, understand the system entities, their interactions, and the effects these interactions have on system properties. In addition, students need to validate and evaluate their models. As such, teaching modeling and simulation of complex systems requires an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced by students in order to design the best learning experience. In this paper, we explore the reflections of 24 students after submitting two modeling and simulation assignments in a complex systems course. We identify that students struggle with the chosen simulation tool, as expected, but also that focusing on system entities and their interaction is not straightforward due to several system complexities and learning barriers. We discuss three course design principles to address these barriers, focused on scaffolded tool introduction, abstraction introduction, and mastery learning.},

In this paper, we propose an EEG-based cryptographic key generation system using EEG signals and present experiments performed on two groups of subjects, alcoholic and non-alcoholic groups in the Alcoholism database. This EEG-based cryptographic key generation system is based on an assumption that EEG signal is quasi-stationary if the time window is sufficiently short. With this assumption, stable EEG features are extracted to generate cryptographic keys. The impact of alcoholism on performance of the system is analysed based on our experimental results.},

The nature of OSNs allows the spammers to bypass the combating techniques by changing their behaviours. Classification based approaches are the most common technique for spam detection. “Data labelling” “spam drift” “imbalanced datasets” and “data fabrication” are the most common limitations of classification techniques that hinder the accuracy of spam detection. The paper presents a two-stage fully unsupervised approach using a user&#39;s peer acceptance within OSN to distinguish spammers from genuine users. User&#39;s common shared interest over multiple topics and the mentioning behaviour are used to derive the peer acceptance. The contribution of the paper is a pure unsupervised method to detect spammers based on users&#39; peer acceptance without labelled datasets. Our unsupervised approach is able to achieve 95.9\% accuracy without the need for labelling.},

  abstract  = {The biogeographical ancestry (BGA) information can provide supporting information in epidemiology and leading intelligence in forensics. Several sets of ancestral informative markers (AIM) have been proposed to facilitate the BGA inference. A small set of markers can improve efficiency though, it has limitations in their ability of balancing different populations and differentiating sub-populations. Genome-wide SNPs provide much more comprehensive information of an individual&#39;s ancestral information. In this paper, we study the problem of BGA inference under the abundance of genome-wide high density data. We studied 1043 individuals from 7 continental populations of the Human Genome Diversity Panel at 32212 genome-wide autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. We detected the population structure and compared the BGA inference accuracy using three widely used genetic sequence analysis algorithms through AIMs and genome-wide SNPs. Our results show that genome-wide SNPs reveal population structure with clearer clusterness and provide more accurate BGA inference, confirming the rich information carried by genome-wide SNPs. The findings help to give a clearer picture of candidate ancestral population groups of an individual, and potentially help the BGA inference in a fine population scale.},

  abstract  = {Avoidable hospital readmission is problematic as it increases the burden on healthcare systems, leads to a shortage of hospital beds and impacts on the costs of healthcare. Various machine learning algorithms have been applied to predict patient readmissions. However, existing literature has only focused on individual features of health conditions without consideration of associations between features. This paper proposes discriminative pattern-based features as a technique to improve readmission prediction. First, discriminative patterns that occur disproportionately between two classes: readmission and non-readmission, were generated based on hospital electronic health records. Second, the patterns were fed as features into a classification model for readmission prediction. Then, we have evaluated these discriminative pattern-based features in three datasets: diabetes, chronic kidney disease and all diseases. Experiments with each dataset showed that the features of chronic disease cohorts have fewer differences between the readmission and the non-readmission classes than the all-diseases cohort. Our proposed pattern-based model improved the prediction performance in terms of AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic curve) by about 12\% compared with the baseline models for the all-disease cohort, however, it showed little improvement for either diabetes or chronic kidney disease datasets.},

  abstract  = {General practitioners/doctors usually make disease diagnoses based on some predefined rules, which may lead to omitting some important hidden factors. Deep neural networks are well known for their ability to extract features from large amounts of labeled data, which can be used to learn and discover knowledge from electronic medical records (EMRs). Existing methods have mostly focused on treating deep networks as black-box feature extractors based on the information of labels. However, it is labor-intensive and expensive to manually generate ground-truth labels for EMRs. In this paper, we propose DeepHealth, a general semi-supervised learning framework for automatic diagnoses and feature interpretation based on autoencoders. Specifically, our end-to-end DeepHealth framework is constructed of two parts: a supervised classifier network for extracting high-level representation for classification; an unsupervised autoencoder network to make sure the features extracted from the input are meaningful and can be further used for reconstruction. Compared with existing methods, the experimental results show that our method, on both numerical data and medical images, can achieve the state-of-the-art results for EMRs classification. Hence, DeepHealth is a general flexible framework for high-precision diagnoses in healthcare, it can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to address the problem of insufficient labels in EMRs, meanwhile, it can also reconstruct medical images to help interpret the features learned by a deep neural model.},

  abstract  = {Electricity price forecasting is a fundamental step for power producers in competitive electricity markets, although it is a challenging task. Participation of renewable power plants in the electricity supply chain has increased uncertainty of electricity supply, demand, and price. Probabilistic forecasting approaches are the proper tools to take into account this uncertainty. In this paper, we use the double exponential smoothing (DES) as well as triple exponential smoothing (TES) methods to forecast electricity price volatility. Regularized forecasts for volatility have been studied using the elastic net regularization method. Sample sign correlation of standardized electricity prices (standardized by volatility forecasts) is used to identify the conditional distribution of electricity price time series. Validation of the regularized volatility forecasts is demonstrated using the publicly available hourly electricity price data of Ontario. Our data analysis results show that TES forecasts of volatility outperforms DES. In addition, elastic net regularization decreases the mean square error of TES volatility forecasting from 72.95 to 59.16. The regularized probabilistic forecast of electricity demand is used to implement a decision analysis approach and to model the scheduling of power generation units in the electricity market.},

With novel, granular FX option data based on the reporting from trade repositories and financial institutions in Japan, this paper employs machine learning approaches (Random Forest and XGBoost) to exploring the determinants of investor sentiment for USD/JPY by a different investor category, measured by the positioning of “long call and short put (bullish for USD/JPY)” minus “long put and short call (bearish for USD/JPY)”. The analysis shows that the uncertainty over the US trade policy is one of the most important variables for the sentiment of non-financial corporates, while the US yield curve appears to affect the sentiment of both non-financial corporates and institutional investors. The results imply that the recent increase in hedging behavior for a sharp fall of the dollar against the yen could be attributable to the US-China trade tensions and an inversion of the US yield curve which suggests a slowdown of global economy.},

Even though trainable adaptive normalization methods have been recently proposed to overcome this to a certain extend, these methods also tend to remove useful information from the data, ignoring the global statistics of the input time series. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose a trainable adaptive normalization approach that is capable of both maintaining important mode information, since global statistics are employed for the normalization, as well as taking into account the current behavior of the time series and adjusting the normalization scheme to this. The effectiveness of the proposed method over baseline and state-of the-art normalization methods is demonstrated using extensive experiments on two different electric load forecasting datasets.},
