However, the process of searching for code snippets and integrating them within existing source code can be tedious. In order to improve efficiency and reduce time spent on code reuse, we present an automated code reuse tool for the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Developer Environment), NLP2TestableCode. NLP2TestableCode can not only search for Java code snippets using natural language tasks, but also evaluate code snippets based on a user&#39;s existing code, modify snippets to improve fit and correct errors, before presenting the user with the best snippet, all without leaving the editor. NLP2TestableCode also includes functionality to automatically generate customisable test cases and suggest argument and return types, in order to further evaluate code snippets. In evaluation, NLP2TestableCode was capable of finding compilable code snippets for 82.9\% of tasks, and testable code snippets for 42.9\%.},

The efficiency of an evolutionary algorithm relates to the coding of the algorithm, the design of the evolutionary operators and the parameter settings for evolution. In this paper, we explore the effect of tuning the operators and parameters of a genetic algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using Design of Experiments theory. Small scale problems are solved with specific settings of parameters including population size, crossover rate, mutation rate and the extent of elitism. Good values of the parameters suggested by the experiments are used to solve large scale problems. Computational tests show that the parameters selected by this process result in improved performance both in the quality of results obtained and the convergence rate when compared with untuned parameter settings.},

However, their targets are two or three objective GP problems. Only little research on GP problems with more than four objectives, or Many-Objective Genetic Programming (MaOGP), exists. This is not because real MaOGP problems are ere are rare, but probably because there are few MaOGP benchmarks. Therefore, this paper proposes a benchmark for MaOGP. The problem consists of an analytic function generated by GP and the well-known Many-Objective KnapSack Problem (MaOKSP). In this problem, the difficulty of the problem can be easily adjusted by changing the non-terminal node set, the number of knapsacks or the number of objectives, the number of items, and so on. Moreover, the IGD# indicator is proposed, in which this is a slightly improved version of the IGD+.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic primitive granularity control (DPGC) is a promising avenue for improving the performance of genetic programming (GP). However, it remains almost entirely unexplored. Further, it may pose many unique challenges in its design and implementation that traditional GP implementations do not. This paper presents an implementation of DPGC in order to determine what aspects of conventional GP design and implementation require special consideration. There are some common techniques used in GP that have been found here to negatively impact DPGC&#39;s ability to improve performance. Parsimony pressure appears to disproportionately penalize low-level primitives, and a mixed-granularity population suffers from heavy biases towards particular granularity levels, seemingly to the detriment of evolution. This paper provides hypotheses as to why these conventional techniques harm DPGC implementations, as well as several potential alternatives for use in the future that may remedy these detrimental effects.},

  abstract  = {In combinatorial optimization, where problems are often NP-hard, metaheuristics and other approximation algorithms frequently have many parameters in order to adapt to a wide range of scenarios. Very often, obtaining good values for these parameters is a long and tedious manual task but automatic algorithm configuration has been shown to overcome this issue. At the same time, it may also be useful for parameter values to change during the search in order to fine-tune the search process. These parameters include low-level heuristic components. In this article, we propose to use automatic parameter configuration coupled with a control mechanism that switches between parameter configurations at specific times during the search, as an in-between classic parameter tuning and selection hyperheuristics. We test this idea on a local search algorithm, whose parameters allow for selecting different design components, and three combinatorial problems: the Permutation Flowshop Problem, the Traveling Salesman Problem, and the Quadratic Assignment Problem. In comparisons with traditional static automatic parameter configuration, the proposed approach time-dependent is shown to perform better. Additionally, better-performing local search component configurations are identified and discussed.},

  abstract  = {One promising method of improving Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) performance is to improve its fine tuning capabilities by using an additional local optimization operator in the evolutionary cycle. This customization on the traditional EA is typically called a Memetic Algorithm (MA). Adding the appropriate local optimization algorithm can increase performance, while a poor choice can decrease performance. Thus, some knowledge is required to select the correct algorithm. In many cases the optimal algorithm selection is not known and it may not be static, but could change during evolution.This investigation combines a method of local optimizer evolution using Push Genetic Programming with a method of automatic, self-configuration called Supportive Coevolution. This combination creates a novel MA that coevolves local optimization operators with target fitness function solution candidates. Implementation methodology is shown and experimentation details with corresponding results are presented. Some additional parameters that were discovered for performance tuning are discussed along with a study of their impact on the algorithm&#39;s performance. Discussion of some interesting insights followed by some suggestions for further investigation are also provided. Results show the proposed technique can improve the performance of an EA by providing automatically configured, coevolved local optimization operators to a MA.},

Studies that target on the analysis and understanding of the GPHH behavior are still scarce, despite their relevance for easing the application of GPHH in practice and for advancing this research field. In order to advance the body of knowledge on the understanding of GPHH behavior, this paper aims at analyzing the impact of its parameters on the evolution, diversity, and quality of generated algorithms. In particular, a Cartesian Genetic-Programming hyper-heuristic (CGPHH) applied to an NP-Complete problem of production planning (multi-level capacitated lot-sizing problem) is considered. The effects of five parameters on response variables that reflect various aspects of the CGPHH behavior, such as diversity and quality of generated algorithms, are analyzed based on a full-factorial design of experiments. Results indicate that mainly three factors affect the CGPHH behavior in different ways: mutation rate, the CGP representation, and the number of graph nodes. Nonetheless, the CGPHH still generates competitive algorithms, despite the changes applied to its parameters.},

A variety of benchmark problems are essential for the research of search algorithms. However, there is difficulty to quantitatively and visually represent differences among benchmark problems. Also, there is the same difficulty in describing differences among search algorithms. The proposed method maps optimization problems based on the difference in the search algorithm ranking on each optimization problem. Also, the proposed method maps search algorithms based on the difference in the problem ranking on each search algorithm. In the experiment, we use 26 kinds of multi-objective optimization problems included in the ZDT, DTLZ, and WFG benchmark suites and 29 kinds of evolutionary search algorithms. As a result, we show that similarities of the internal functions are reflected in the position of each problem on the optimization problem map, and the similarities of the design principles of search algorithms are reflected in the position of each search algorithm on the search algorithm map.},

However, the right network topology for the problem at hand may be complex and not immediately obvious. This has given rise to the secondary field of neural architecture search (NAS). This paper describes a NAS method based on graph evolution pioneered by Neuro-evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), but driven by the evolutionary mechanisms underlying Cultural Algorithms (CA). CA is a population-based, stochastic optimization system inspired by problem solving in human cultures, suited to solving problems such as NAS. We present CATNeuro a system for evolving DL models guided by CA metaheuristics called Knowledge Sources (KS). The KS store knowledge harvested from prior generations and use it to guide subsequent generations in the search space. A knowledge distribution mechanism, which assigns a KS to each individual in the population, is an instrumental part of this process. CATNeuro, is applied to find optimal network topologies to play a 2D fighting game called FightingICE (based on &quot;The Rumble Fish&quot; game). A policy-based, reinforcement learning method is used to create the training data for network optimization. CATNeuro is still evolving. In this primary foray into NAS, we contrast the performance of CATNeuro with two different knowledge distribution mechanisms - the stalwart Weighted Majority (WTD) - which represents &quot;wisdom of the crowds&quot; - and a new one based on the Stag-Hunt game from evolutionary game theory. We show that Stag-Hunt has a statistical edge over WTD in many areas and thus is a better candidate for future development with CATNeuro.},

It retains the multi-objective evolutionary search developed for GEVO, which searches for edits to GPU code compiled to LLVM-IR and improves performance on desired criteria while retaining required functionality. In earlier work, we studied some ML workloads in GPU settings and found that GEVO could improve kernel speeds by factors ranging from 1.7X to 2.9X, even with access to only a small portion of the overall ML framework. This workshop paper examines the limitations and constraints of GEVO for ML workloads and discusses our GEVO-ML design, which we are currently implementing.},

  abstract  = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are often trained using back-propagation, wherein the interconnection weights are determined based on the error gradient. ANNs have also been evolved using neuroevolutionary techniques. The weights in such ANNs are updated randomly by Gaussian mutation. Either all, or a random number of weights are modified, and the performance of the resulting ANN is determined. This paper describes a novel mutation strategy that enhances the performance of random selection by augmenting a dedicated mutational puissance to every weight within the ANN. These puissances are either replenished or consumed based on whether the performance of the ANN improved or deteriorated. Mutational puissance thus, tends to preserve, in some form, the information on how well the associated weight contributed to the performance of the ANN. We have embedded this technique in a robot to enable it to evolve ANN-based controllers for specific tasks, on-the-fly. The experiments and results portrayed in the paper conclusively endorse the efficacy of guiding mutation using the concept of puissance.},

  abstract  = {Recent advances in human motion sensing technologies and machine learning have enhanced the potential of AI to simulate artificial agents exhibiting human-like movements. Human movements are typically explored via experimental recordings with the aim of establishing relationships between neural and mechanical activities. A recent trend in AI research shows that AI algorithms work remarkably well when combined with sufficient computing resources and data. One common criticism is that all of these methods are gradient-based, which involves a gradient approximation, thus suffering of the well-known vanishing gradient problem.In this paper, the goal is to build an ANN-based controller that enables an agent to walk in a human-like way. In particular, the proposed methodology is based on a new approach to Neuroevolution based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). The original algorithm has been endowed with a different type of selection-reproduction mechanism and a modified management of the population, with the aim to improve the performance and to reduce the computational effort. Experiments have evidenced the effectiveness of the proposed approach and have highlighted the interdependence among three key aspects: the reward framework, the Evolutionary Algorithm chosen and the hyper-parameters&#39; configuration. As a consequence, none of the above aspects can be ignored and their balancing is crucial for achieving suitable results and good performance.},

  abstract  = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a generative model proposed to imitate real data distributions. The original GAN algorithm has been found to be able to achieve excellent results for the image generation task, but it suffers from problems such as instability and mode collapse. To tackle these problems, many variants of the original model have been proposed; one of them is the Evolutionary GAN (EGAN), where a population of generators is evolved.Inspired by EGAN, we propose here a new algorithm, called Multi-Objective Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Network (MOEGAN), which reformulates the problem of training GANs as a multi-objective optimization problem. Thus, Pareto dominance is used to select the best solutions, evaluated using diversity and quality fitness functions.Preliminary experimental results on synthetic datasets show how the proposed approach can achieve better results than EGAN.},

  abstract  = {Parallel to genetic algorithms and genetic programming, the evolutionary computation (EC) sub-field of learning classifier systems (LCS) has been an active area of research, development, and application. LCSs are best known for their ability to flexibly adapt to perform well on a wide range of problems, and to outperform other machine learning (ML) algorithms on problems characterized as being complex and heterogeneous. However, to date LCSs remain poorly recognized and thus rarely considered for comparison to other ML approaches in or outside of the EC community. One likely reason for this is the general lack of easy-to-use LCS implementations to facilitate comparisons to other well-known ML approaches. The Python-based scikit-learn library has become a very popular way to implement, utilize, and compare ML algorithms in a simple, uniform manner. In this work, we develop and evaluate the first LCS scikit-learn package, called scikit-eLCS. The scikit-eLCS algorithm is a modern Michigan-style supervised-learning LCS descended from eLCS, UCS, and XCS. We demonstrate the efficacy and capabilities of this package over benchmark n-bit multiplexer problems. We expect scikit-eLCS to serve as an algorithmic benchmark to facilitate future ML comparisons, as well as a blueprint for the implementation of other scikit-learn compatible LCS algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Biological nervous systems can learn knowledge from simple and small-scale problems and then apply it to resolve more complex and large-scale problems in similar and related domains. However, the rudimentary attempts to apply this transfer learning in artificial intelligence systems have struggled. This is maybe due to the homogeneous nature of their knowledge representation. It is believed that it is the lateral asymmetry of the brain, enabling modular learning at different levels of abstraction, which facilitates transfer between tasks. Learning classifier systems (LCSs) are a rule-based evolutionary computation technique that automatically clusters inputs into environmental niches, which makes it an ideal candidate for implementing lateralization.Recently LCSs based systems have applied lateralization and modular learning at different levels of abstraction to solve complex problems in Boolean, computer vision, and navigation domains. This paper aims to bring these three separate implementations together for the first time to understand the methodology of lateralization and appreciate its benefits. The experimental results demonstrate that the LCSs based lateralized systems outperformed state-of-the-art homogeneous systems in solving complex problems. The advances arise from the ability to consider input at both the constituent level and holistic level simultaneously, such that the most appropriate viewpoint controls the system.},

Sometimes it is not feasible to run all tests and the goal is to determine which tests are crucial and which are less important. This prioritization problem has just recently gotten into the focus of reinforcement learning. A neural network combined with prioritized experience replay (ER) was used to identify critical tests. We are the first to apply XCS classifier systems (XCS) for this use case and reveal that XCS is not only suitable for this problem, but can also be superior to the aforementioned neural network and leads to more stable results. In this work, we adapt XCS&#39;s learning mechanism to the task by introducing a batch update which is based on Monte Carlo control. Further, we investigate if prioritized ER has the same positive effects on XCS as on the neural network for this test prioritization problem. Our experiments show that in general this is not the case for XCS.},

  abstract  = {The XCS classifier system (XCS) constitutes the most deeply investigated evolutionary rule-based machine learning algorithm. Due to its online learning nature, it is not as computationally intense as deep learning approaches. However, in order to increase XCS&#39;s realtime capabilities, it is worth to improve its runtime for the inference step. A iteration through XCS&#39;s main loop involves various steps. Among them, matching usually constitutes the computationally most expensive part. Various ways for improvements have been proposed, e.g. using specialized hardware or vector commands. However, existing approaches require either a certain hardware coupled with a specific instruction set, or a dedicated multiprocessing programming language. In this context, parallel programs are often evaluated in terms of their speed up, but it turns out that qualitative criteria such as flexibility and independence of a specific hardware are also relevant. We therefore present a generic parallel approach for matching. We only rely on the minimum assumption of a multicore CPU with standard synchronization mechanisms, e.g., locks. Those assumptions are satisfied in almost all modern computing systems and high-level programming languages today. Thus we show that our approaches cannot only decrease the runtime, but are also reusable for most learning classifier systems and computing systems.},

  abstract  = {Many real-world environments are non-deterministic, thus presenting learning challenges for Anticipatory Learning Classifier Systems (ALCS). Maze problems have been widely used in ALCS literature, as they provide such environments. However, few ALCS can efficiently run in such mazes, having trouble to build a complete and accurate internal representation of their environment. ALCS can implement Probability-Enhanced Predictions (PEP) in their classifiers. Those PEP permit ALCS to handle non-deterministic environments, but they have never been experimented within ACS2 (Anticipatory Classifier System 2), yet one of the most advanced ALCS, and tested within a thorough maze benchmark. This paper introduces PEPACS, an ALCS that integrates PEP to ACS2. PEPACS integrates an aliasing detection algorithm that let the system build PEP-enhanced classifiers, and the learning process was adjusted so as to avoid over-generalization issues. The presented results show that PEP with ACS2 is a suitable approach to handle at least one kind of non-determinism (namely, the perceptual aliasing issue), without impairing ACS2 functionalities, and that PEP allows the system to build a complete and accurate internal representation of its environment.},

The most prominent example is XCS, for which many variants have been proposed in the past, including XCSF for function approximation. Although XCSF is a promising candidate for supporting autonomy in computing systems, it still must undergo parameter optimization prior to deployment. However, in case the later deployment environment is unknown, a-priori parameter optimization is not possible, raising the need for XCSF to automatically determine suitable parameter values at run-time. One of the most important parameters is the error threshold, which can be interpreted as a target bound on the approximation error and has to be set according to the approximated function. To enable XCSF to reliably approximate functions unknown at design-time, we propose the use of an error threshold, which is adapted at run-time based on the currently achieved approximation error. Our experimental evaluation shows that the adaption mechanism automatically adjusts the error threshold to a suitable value. On six different target functions, XCSF with an adaptive error threshold leads to a worst-case approximation error that is 11.5\% higher than the error achieved with the best-suited static threshold.},

This abundance of increasingly complex parallel and distributed systems necessitates new approaches to software parallelism and scalability for finding high-quality solutions to complex problems at previously unattainable rates. This research investigates the implicit and explicit use of MPI topologies applied to parallel evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in order to dynamically arrange processes and communication channels during runtime for optimal performance, adapting to underlying system architecture and state. An island model EA employing numerical optimization has been chosen as the benchmark for evaluating these techniques. Initial results using a random search of the topology space offer promising results, with some cases resulting in both faster performance and improved fitness, indicating that a multi-objective evolutionary search approach could provide near optimal performance in regard to both communication speed and solution quality, thus resulting in a novel, performance enhancing meta-EA approach, where the top-level EA evolves the MPI topology on which the lower-level parallel EA is executing.},

  abstract  = {Multi-stage classification is a supervised learning approach that distributes a set of features, each with an associated importance and cost of generation, across a series of classifiers (stages). Inputs are processed in a pipeline fashion through the stages, each of which utilizes only a subset of the complete feature set, until a confident classification decision can be made or until all features and stages have been exhausted. This design benefits from processing inputs in parallel and ensures that labels are assigned using only the necessary features, but the number and composition of stages used by the model can have significant impact on overall performance. Unfortunately, identifying these critical design aspects becomes more difficult as the number of features and possible stages increases, often making brute-force search or human intuition impractical.This paper introduces a novel evolutionary approach for discovering multi-stage configurations that provide high classification performance and fast processing times. Using this approach, multistage classifier configurations are modeled as chromosomes, and a series of selection, recombination, and mutation operations are iteratively performed to find better configurations. Since the problem has multiple objectives, a Pareto-based fitness measure is developed to rank chromosomes, where better chromosomes have high accuracy, high conclusiveness, and fast processing time. Experimental results indicate this approach is able to consistently find accurate and fast multi-stage classifier configurations under various conditions, including an increasing number of features and different feature synthesis time distributions.},

In the studied algorithms three objectives relevant to distributed processor load balancing are used as global fitness functions: the function dealing with the computational load imbalance in execution of application tasks on processors, the function concerned with the communication between tasks placed on distributed computing nodes and the function concerned with the task migration number. Internal properties of the proposed multi-objective Extremal Optimization algorithms have been discussed. A number of such algorithms with different composition of global and local fitness functions have been presented and verified by simulation experiments. The performed comparative experiments concerned execution of distributed programs represented as macro data flow graphs. Their parallel execution speed-up was discussed based on different best solution search methods such as compromise approach, lexicographic approach and hybrid approach. The obtained results have shown that the parallel multi-objective Extremal Optimization algorithms used in load balancing have visibly improved the quality of execution of the tested program graphs.},

  abstract  = {Gradient search is a classical technique for optimizing differentiable functions that has gained much relevance recently due to its application on Neural Network training. Despite its popularity, the application of gradient search has been limited to the continuous optimization and its usage in the combinatorial case is confined to a few works, all which tackle the binary search space. In this paper, we present a new approach for applying Gradient Search to the space of permutations. The idea consists of optimizing the expected objective value of a random variable defined over permutations. Such a random variable is distributed according to the Plackett-Luce model, and a gradient search over its continuous parameters is performed. Conducted experiments on a benchmark of the linear ordering problem confirm that the Gradient Search performs better than its counterpart Estimation of Distribution Algorithm: the Plackett-Luce EDA. Moreover, results reveal that the scalability of the Gradient Search is better than that of the PL-EDA.},

  abstract  = {The emerging research paradigm coined as multitasking optimization aims to solve multiple optimization tasks concurrently by means of a single search process. For this purpose, the exploitation of complementarities among the tasks to be solved is crucial, which is often achieved via the transfer of genetic material, thereby forging the Transfer Optimization field. In this context, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses this paradigm by resorting to concepts from Evolutionary Computation. Within this specific branch, approaches such as the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has lately gained a notable momentum when tackling multiple optimization tasks. This work contributes to this trend by proposing the first adaptation of the recently introduced Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm II (MFEA-II) to permutation-based discrete optimization environments. For modeling this adaptation, some concepts cannot be directly applied to discrete search spaces, such as parent-centric interactions. In this paper we entirely reformulate such concepts, making them suited to deal with permutation-based search spaces without loosing the inherent benefits of MFEA-II. The performance of the proposed solver has been assessed over 5 different multitasking setups, composed by 8 datasets of the well-known Traveling Salesman (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP). The obtained results and their comparison to those by the discrete version of the MFEA confirm the good performance of the developed dMFEA-II, and concur with the insights drawn in previous studies for continuous optimization.},

Unsolvable instances can readily be made solvable by simply changing the sequence of paths to be routed, and the inverse also holds. Our results on square meshes with 100 randomly placed terminals show that the routability of an instance can be accurately guessed a priori from its characteristics only. Furthermore, the attainable routability from random sequence change can also be accurately guessed, and a tight scaling relation suggests these results hold for a broad range of instance sizes. For our particulars, the number of routable paths can increase as much as 73\%, just by changing the order of processing.},

An experimental investigation was conducted on a set of commonly adopted benchmarks and different settings ADEP were compared among them and with respect to the other methods in the literature. Interestingly, the experimental results confirm the validity of ADEP by showing its competitiveness with respect to the state-of-the-art results for the SRFLP.},

This algorithm uses crossover, and it was shown to asymptotically outperform all mutation-based evolutionary algorithms even on simple problems like OneMax. Subsequently it was studied on a number of other problems, but all of these were pseudo-Boolean.We aim at improving this situation by proposing an adaptation of the (1 + (λ, λ)) genetic algorithm to permutation-based problems. Such an adaptation is required, because permutations are noticeably different from bit strings in some key aspects, such as the number of possible mutations and their mutual dependence. We also present the first runtime analysis of this algorithm on a permutation-based problem called Ham whose properties resemble those of OneMax. On this problem, where the simple mutation-based algorithms have the running time of Θ(n2 log n) for problem size n, the (1 + (λ, λ)) genetic algorithm finds the optimum in O(n2) fitness queries. We augment this analysis with experiments, which show that this algorithm is also fast in practice.},

In the studied problem, m heterogeneous workers have to be assigned to operate m machines, and n jobs have to be scheduled on each one of the m machines ordered in series. The objective is to find the best worker assignment and the corresponding job schedule in order to minimize the maximum completion time (makespan). Given the difficulty in solving this problem, to obtain near optimal solutions, we propose a new heuristic based on Tabu Search (TS) and Iterated Greedy (IG) algorithm. The TS heuristic, which has good local searching ability, is responsible for defining the assignment of workers to machines, and IG algorithm is responsible for obtaining a schedule of jobs on the machines. The experimental results show that the proposed heuristic is a state-of-the-art method for solving the problem under study, as seen through a comparison of the obtained results with the best heuristic available in the literature.},

In the real world the crane operators and dispatchers solve complex stacking problems targeting to minimize relocation effort while adhering to many constraints, to various time windows, and to satisfy quality demands. While our model does not include all the real-world constraints, the challenges and benefits of solving this problem as a dynamic optimization problem in contrast to a static formulation become apparent. We adapt an existing solution approach from a static formulation that is based on the block relocation problem and compare it with a hand-written rule-based approach.

In this work we propose and study a hybrid-genetic algorithm (hGAm) approach to solve this optimization problem. For the considered problem the fitness evaluation function is expensive, as it entails training a ML classifier with the proposed set of features and representations, and then evaluating the resulting classifier. We have here devised a surrogate problem by casting the feature selection and representation problem as a combinatorial optimization problem in the form of a multiple-choice quadratic knapsack problem (MCQKP). The orders of magnitude faster evaluation of the surrogate problem allows a comprehensive hGAm performance evaluation to be performed. The results show that a suitable trade-off exists at around 5000 fitness evaluations, and the results also provide a characterization of the parameter behaviors as input to future extensions.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian optimisation is a popular approach for optimising expensive black-box functions. The next location to be evaluated is selected via maximising an acquisition function that balances exploitation and exploration. Gaussian processes, the surrogate models of choice in Bayesian optimisation, are often used with a constant prior mean function equal to the arithmetic mean of the observed function values. We show that the rate of convergence can depend sensitively on the choice of mean function. We empirically investigate 8 mean functions (constant functions equal to the arithmetic mean, minimum, median and maximum of the observed function evaluations, linear, quadratic polynomials, random forests and RBF networks), using 10 synthetic test problems and two real-world problems, and using the Expected Improvement and Upper Confidence Bound acquisition functions.We find that for design dimensions ≥ 5 using a constant mean function equal to the worst observed quality value is consistently the best choice on the synthetic problems considered. We argue that this worst-observed-quality function promotes exploitation leading to more rapid convergence. However, for the real-world tasks the more complex mean functions capable of modelling the fitness landscape may be effective, although there is no clearly optimum choice.},

However, conventional MVTS algorithms are time-consuming, in particular when the number of threshold values increases. One approach to moderate this problem is to use population-based metaheuristic algorithms, but, due to the curse of dimensionality, the efficacy of such algorithms may drop sharply in higher-dimensional search spaces. Since various population-based algorithms have been presented in the literature, in this paper, we benchmark the performance of 10 such algorithms for MVTS, focussing in particular on more recent metaheuristics that have received significant attention. As such, the algorithms we evaluate include, apart from the more established differential evolution (DE), and particle swarm optimisation (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), the grey wolf optimiser (GWO), moth fame optimisation (MFO), the dragonfly algorithm (DA), the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), the multi-verse optimiser (MVO), and the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). We assess these algorithms on a set of benchmark images with regards to objective function value and structural similarity index (SSIM), and also perform a non-parametric statistical test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, to compare the algorithms statistically.},

  abstract  = {Modern compilers and interpreters provide code optimizations during compile and run time, simplifying the development process for the developer and resulting in optimized software. These optimizations are often based on formal proof, or alternatively stochastic optimizations have recovery paths as backup. The Genetic Compiler Optimization Environment (GCE) uses a novel approach, which utilizes genetic improvement to optimize the run-time performance of code with stochastic machine learning techniques.In this paper, we propose an architecture to integrate GCE, which directly integrates with low-level interpreters and compilers, with HeuristicLab, a high-level optimization framework that features a wide range of heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, and a graphical user interface to control and monitor the machine learning process. The defined architecture supports parallel and distributed execution to compensate long run times of the machine learning process caused by abstract syntax tree (AST) transformations. The architecture does not depend on specific operating systems, programming languages, compilers or interpreters.},

  abstract  = {There are generally three types of scientific software users: users that solve problems using existing science software tools, researchers that explore new approaches by extending existing code, and educators that teach students scientific concepts. Python is a general-purpose programming language that is accessible to beginners, such as students, but also as a language that has a rich scientific programming ecosystem that facilitates writing research software. Additionally, as high-performance computing (HPC) resources become more readily available, software support for parallel processing becomes more relevant to scientific software.There currently are no Python-based evolutionary computation frameworks that adequately support all three types of scientific software users. Moreover, some support synchronous concurrent fitness evaluation that do not efficiently use HPC resources. We pose here a new Python-based EC framework that uses an established generalized unified approach to EA concepts to provide an easy to use toolkit for users wishing to use an EA to solve a problem, for researchers to implement novel approaches, and for providing a low-bar to entry to EA concepts for students. Additionally, this toolkit provides a scalable asynchronous fitness evaluation implementation friendly to HPC that has been vetted on hardware ranging from laptops to the worlds fastest supercomputer, Summit.},

  abstract  = {Genetic Programming (GP) is a dynamic field of research where empirical testing plays an important role in validating new ideas and algorithms. The ability to easily prototype new algorithms by reusing key components and quickly obtain results is therefore important for the researcher.In this paper we introduce Operon, a C++ GP framework focused on performance, modularity and usability, featuring an efficient linear tree encoding and a scalable concurrency model where each logical thread is responsible for generating a new individual. We model the GP evolutionary process around the concept of an offspring generator, a streaming operator that defines how new individuals are obtained. The approach allows different algorithmic variants to be expressed using high-level constructs within the same generational basic loop. The evaluation routine supports both scalar and dual numbers, making it possible to calculate model derivatives via automatic differentiation. This functionality allows seamless integration with gradient-based local search approaches.We discuss the design choices behind the proposed framework and compare against two other popular GP frameworks, DEAP and HeuristicLab. We empirically show that Operon is competitive in terms of solution quality, while being able to generate results significantly faster.},

We revise the population initialization and crossover operation of a conventional interactive differential evolution algorithm. The initialization population of the sound composition system uses a set of well-designed sounds as individuals rather than these randomly generated in a search space. The crossover operation of a conventional interactive differential evolution algorithm is revised in order to maintain the search space within a feasible range. The differential mechanism of interactive differential evolution provides a more feasible combination of these well-designed sounds to create a new type of sounds in the timbre domain. The subjective evaluation of revised interactive differential evolution algorithm leads to the sound composition to satisfy the preference of a subject as much as possible. We invite five subjects to conduct the experimental evaluation to create sounds with their personal preferences. We analyse the sound aesthetic characteristic of these five subjects using principal component analysis and k-means clustering methods with the sound data selected in the optimization process. The characteristics of selected sound help to explain optimization process and convergence of the algorithm, and assist to better understand the aesthetic judgement of each subject. We found that the proposed system and method can generate or create a sound satisfying a subject&#39;s preference. The proposal is an efficient method to analyse the characteristics of auditory perception and sound aesthetic of the subjects as well.},

Clicker training works by rewarding the animal&#39;s behavior based on interactions between the animal and trainer called clicks. This paper adapts clicker training for use in an online, evolutionary robotic system, allowing novices to train a robot by rewarding it for exhibiting correct behaviors without the need to understand the robot&#39;s capabilities.Although clicker training traditionally relies on rewarding good behaviors, this paper introduces counterexamples as a way to encourage behavior exploration, by guiding the robot away from incorrect actions. This allows trainers to provide more feedback in less time, and allows the evolutionary system to learn from incorrect behaviors as well as correct behaviors. In this paper, we compare the performance of robots which have been trained with and without counterexamples in a real-world, noisy, environment.Results show two major developments: significant improvement in the behavior accuracy of robots trained with counterexamples compared to those trained with only positive examples and reduced average training times with counterexamples. This represents an important advance because accuracy and training time are two of the most important factors in online learning.},

  abstract  = {Interconnected devices require different types of network access to maintain functionality; however, access must also be limited to ensure security. Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) have become a core technology for securely interconnecting devices in a computer network since they can associate devices with various groups. Unfortunately, finding the smallest, most manageable number of VLANs to securely provide necessary interconnections becomes more difficult as the number of devices and security policy complexity increases.This paper investigates the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to discover the minimum number of VLANs, and the associated memberships, necessary for network connectivity and security. Using this approach, VLAN configurations are modeled as chromosomes and a series of selection, recombination, and mutation operations are performed to find suitable VLAN configurations. Since the problem is a multi-objective search, a hybrid Pareto-based fitness measure is developed to rank possible VLAN solutions, where better solutions have fewer VLANs and better security. Simulation results indicate this approach is able to consistently find concise and secure VLAN groups under various conditions, including increasing number of interconnected devices and more restrictive number of required VLANs.},

As the dependence of society on satellite constellations grows, threats to P-LEO assets are more likely to increase. Developing strategies that are effective and efficient to defend P-LEO constellations against different types of attacks is warranted. As a first step, we develop a framework to evolve defense strategies for a low-fidelity constellation system against selected low-fidelity adversarial actions by evolving attack strategies, and the strategies are evolved using coevolutionary algorithms. Results show that attackers can easily overcome defenses that are unaware and non-reactive to executed attacks and demonstrate that it may be possible to perform meaningful coevolution of attack and defense strategies that consider selective actions on individual satellites in a constellation. Evolved attack and defense strategies have the potential to promote the development of robust, reliable, and secure P-LEO constellations.},

However, the context of the software project may change due to some circumstances that generally arise, for example, new software requirements or changes in the development team. Consequently, these factors force the plan to be adjusted. When the plan is modified, it is necessary to consider at least three criteria to minimize the economic and operational impact of these changes. Therefore, this activity can be analyzed as a multi-objective problem. In the last two decades, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on the decomposition principle have become an effective and efficient tool to solve multi-objective problems. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of decomposition-based MOEAs when approximating the agile software project scheduling problem.

Since each weight vector specifies an approximation point on the Pareto front, the distribution of the weight vector set has an enormous impact on the total approximation quality of the Pareto front. The conventional simplex-lattice design has scalability on the number of weight vectors by a decomposition parameter and generates a uniformly distributed weight vector set. However, the generated set involves fewer inner weight vectors for the approximation of the central area of the Pareto front. A variant, the two-layered simplex-lattice design, generates an additional layer to introduce inner weight vectors but sacrifices the distribution uniformity. The proposed method, the incremental lattice design, also has scalability on the number of weight vectors by a decomposition parameter and always includes the intermediate weight vector pointing to the center of the Pareto front for any the decomposition parameter while keeping the distribution uniformity. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher approximation quality of the Pareto front than the conventional simplex-lattice and two-layered simplex-lattice designs.},

We evaluate our algorithm on a set of benchmark images on high-dimensional search spaces and with regards to fitness function value and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate excellent thresholding performance and our algorithm to outperform nine other state-of-the-art metaheuristics.},

  abstract  = {Colour quantisation is a common image processing technique to reduce the number of distinct colours in an image. Selecting these colour, which comprise a colour palette, is a challenging task since they determine the resulting image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel colour quantisation algorithm based on the Self-Organizing Migrating Algorithm (SOMA), in particular, SOMA Team To Team Adaptive (SOMA T3A), a recent variant of SOMA. SOMA T3A works, iteratively in three phases, namely organization, migration, and update, and performs adaptive parameter definition. Migrants are selected from the population and move towards a leader during the organization process. Experimental results on a benchmark set of images show excellent colour quantisation performance and our approach to outperform several conventional and soft-computing-based colour quantisation algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Beam-ACO, a modification of the traditional Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms that incorporates a modified beam search, is one of the most effective ACO algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Although adding beam search to the ACO heuristic search process is effective, it also increases the amount of work (in terms of partial paths) done by the algorithm at each step. In this work, we introduce a greedy variant of Beam-ACO that uses a greedy path selection heuristic. The exploitation of the greedy path selection is offset by the exploration required in maintaining the beam of paths. This approach has the added benefit of avoiding costly calls to a random number generator and reduces the algorithms internal state, making it simpler to parallelize. Our experiments demonstrate that not only is our greedy Beam-ACO (gBeam-ACO) faster than traditional Beam-ACO, in some cases by an order of magnitude, but it does not sacrifice quality of the found solution, especially on large TSP instances. We also found that our greedy algorithm, which we refer to as gBeam-ACO, was less dependent on hyperparameter settings.},

In this paper, we first propose to combine the variants of PSO or DE by modularizing each algorithm and incorporating the variants thereof as different options of the corresponding modules. Then, considering the similarity between the inner workings of PSO and DE, we hybridize the algorithms by creating two populations with variation operators of PSO and DE respectively, and selecting individuals from those two populations. The resulting novel hybridization, called PSODE, encompasses most up-to-date variants from both sides, and more importantly gives rise to an enormous number of unseen swarm algorithms via different instantiations of the modules therein.In detail, we consider 16 different variation operators originating from existing PSO- and DE algorithms, which, combined with 4 different selection operators, allow the hybridization framework to generate 800 novel algorithms. The resulting set of hybrid algorithms, along with the combined 30 PSO- and DE algorithms that can be generated with the considered operators, is tested on the 24 problems from the well-known COCO/BBOB benchmark suite, across multiple function groups and dimensionalities.},

In this problem, jobs are grouped into families and setup times are required between jobs belonging to different families. The processing of a job requires a certain amount of resource from a machine, which is supplied by upstream processes. The total resource consumed by the jobs processed on a machine must not exceed the resource supply up. The objective is to schedule the jobs on the machines so that the total tardiness of the jobs is minimized. In attempting to obtain optimal solutions for small size instances, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed. Since the problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, to obtain near optimal solutions we develop two meta-heuristic algorithms based on Simulated Annealing and Iterated Greedy. Computational experiments show that the presented algorithms can be successfully applied to the problem.},

In particular, we evaluate particle swarm optimisation (PSO), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony (ABC), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), cuckoo search (CS), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), bat algorithm (BA), firefly algorithm (FA), grey wolf optimiser (GWO), ant lion optimiser (ALO), dragonfly algorithm (DA), sine cosine algorithm (SCA), whale optimisation algorithm (WOA), grasshopper optimisation algorithm (GOA), and salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and assess their performance on different classification algorithms.},

Without a central authority, Bitcoin requires a complete list of all transactions to be made public so that they can be verified by all users. The major network influencers in a Bitcoin network are defined as users that accumulate a disproportionate amount of wealth compared to others. However, there are some defined metrics to identify major network influencers, considering multiple criteria can improve the detection task. In this paper, a multi-criteria metric is applied to identify the major network influencers based on the history of their activities recorded on the blockchain. The proposed metric is based on the Pareto front on multiple criteria, the maximum increase in wealth with the least amount of activity using non-dominated sorting inspired from multi-objective optimization. The provided descriptive statistics on extracted data demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed metric on identification of major influencers.},

Very few of these virtual robots are built as physical robots, and the few that are will rarely be further improved in the actual environment they operate in, limiting the effectiveness of the automatic design process. We utilize our shape-shifting quadruped robot, which allows us to optimize the design in its real-world environment. The robot is able to change the length of its legs during operation, and is robust enough for complex experiments and tasks. We have co-evolved control and morphology in several different scenarios, and have seen that the algorithm is able to exploit the dynamic morphology solely through real-world experiments.},

Such plasticity can result in consistent individual behavioural differences among group members, which have been described as &#39;personalities&#39; in recent years. Personality axes such as shy-bold can be represented by single variables, and may be intuitive in the context of human-robot interaction. However, for plasticity to emerge in artificial evolution, simulated environments need to be more heterogeneous and unpredictable, as in real-world natural history. Behavioral Reaction Norms (BRNs) from developmental biology are a useful concept for the transparent mapping of relevant sensory inputs to robot behavioral change. In this position paper, I identify candidate stress factors in simulated environments for artificial evolution of adaptive BRNs. I also consider some potential benefits and costs of this approach.},

  abstract  = {This work proposes a method to adaptively determine the grid granularity for the grid decomposition-based evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization. The decomposition of the objective space is one of the promising approaches for evolutionary many-objective optimization. Although the weight-based decomposition is frequently employed recently, it has been known that the grid-based decomposition is also effective for many-objective optimization. The grid-based evolutionary algorithm (GrEA) decomposes the objective space into a grid environment with the grid division parameter. The grid division parameter determines the grid granularity and affects search performance. To find out an appropriate grid division parameter, we need to perform a parameter tuning, which executes multiple runs with different parameters and is generally time-consuming. In this work, we propose an adaptive GrEA (A-GrEA) automatically determines the grid division parameter during a single run of the search. Experimental results using WFG variant problems with 6 to 10 objectives show that the proposed A-GrEA does not only to determine the grid division parameter adaptively but also achieves comparative or higher search performance than the conventional GrEA with the best grid division parameter, MOEA/D, and NSGA-III.},

This allows for simulating the execution of DE for radial functions without running this algorithm.

The present study contributes by discovering three shortcomings of SCA and making a few recommendations. We show that the mathematical model of SCA does not work as explained in the original paper and its performance can be improved by modifying the position-updating equation of SCA as stated in the original paper. Moreover, we empirically and statistically show that sine and cosine functions, which make this algorithm different from the others, can be replaced with a simple random variable having a value in the range [`-1, 1] without degrading the overall performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the behavior of SCA is biased for the functions having the global optimum at the origin. Finally, on the basis of the analysis of SCA, we make two recommendations for the meta-heuristics designers regarding the selection of the benchmarks and mapping of the inspiration when designing a new algorithm.},

With respect to previous work, our proposal can be used with any MOEA to tackle multiobjective problems regardless of their formulation/representation.Our results show that MOEA-DPF runs significantly faster (up to 3.1x speed-up using two workers) than its sequential counterpart while maintaining (and even improving) the quality of the PF. We conclude that MOEA-DPF provides an effective and simple solution to speed-up the execution of MOEAs by distributing the PF computation, making them effective for real-world problems.},

However, in such context, the build process is typically time and resource-consuming. As a response, the use of machine learning (ML) techniques has been proposed to cut the expenses of CI build time by predicting its outcome. Nevertheless, the existing ML-based solutions are challenged by problems related mainly to the imbalanced distribution of successful and failed builds. To deal with this issue, we introduce a novel approach based on Multi-Objective Genetic Programming (MOGP) to build a prediction model. Our approach aims at finding the best prediction rules based on two conflicting objective functions to deal with both minority and majority classes. We evaluated our approach on a benchmark of 15,383 builds. The results reveal that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by providing a better balance between both failed and passed builds.},

However, applying even a limited set of mutations on a small piece of code (that repairs only trivial defects) generates a huge number of possible program variants (also called a search space). The reduction of the search space, while preserving the number and quality of repairs, would make these tools more efficient and practical.We present an end-to-end repair tool for Java programs. It localises lines of source code that introduced a defect into the history of the program&#39;s development and applies a set of mutations targeting only these lines. In the reduced search space, our tool repaired defects covered by failing tests in an open-source Java program.},

In these techniques, the search process is typically guided by a single search objective called Crash Distance. Previous studies have shown that current approaches could only reproduce a limited number of crashes due to a lack of diversity in the population during the search. In this study, we address this issue by applying Multi-Objectivization using Helper-Objectives (MO-HO) on crash reproduction. In particular, we add two helper-objectives to the Crash Distance to improve the diversity of the generated test cases and consequently enhance the guidance of the search process. We assessed MO-HO against the single-objective crash reproduction. Our results show that MO-HO can reproduce two additional crashes that were not previously reproducible by the single-objective approach.},

  abstract  = {Modern code review is a common practice used by software developers to ensure high software quality in open source and industrial projects. During code review, developers submit their code changes which should be reviewed, via tool-based code review platforms, before being integrated into the codebase. Then, reviewers provide their feedback to developers, and may request further modifications before finally accepting or rejecting the submitted code changes. However, the identification of appropriate reviewers is still a tedious task as the number of code reviews to be performed is inflated with the increasing number of code changes and the increasing size of software development teams in today&#39;s large and active software projects. To help developers with the review process, we introduce a multi-objective search-based approach to find the appropriate set of reviewers. We use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimize two conflicting objectives (i) maximize reviewers expertise with the changed files, and (ii) minimize reviewers workload in terms of their current open code reviews. We conduct a preliminary evaluation on two open source projects to evaluate our approach. Results indicate that our approach is efficient as compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract  = {The expensive maintenance of legacy systems lead companies to migrate such systems to a microservice architecture. This migration requires the identification of microservice candidates, which requires analysis of many criteria. Existing search-based approaches to solve this problem are only based on the coupling and cohesion criteria. To overcome these limitations, we propose a many-objective search-based approach for identifying microservice candidates. Its five objectives correspond to criteria pointed as useful by experienced developers. Our approach was evaluated in the context of a legacy system. The results show that our approach is very similar on optimizing the traditional criteria of coupling and cohesion, but much better when taking into account the additional criteria.},

  abstract  = {Code smells, also known as anti-patterns, are indicators of bad design solutions. However, two different experts may have different opinions not only about the smelliness of a particular software class but also about the smell type. This causes an uncertainty problem that should be taken into account. Unfortunately, existing works reject uncertain data that correspond to software classes with doubtful labels. Uncertain data rejection could cause a significant loss of information that could considerably degrade the performance of the detection process. Motivated by this observation and the good performance of the possibilistic K-NN classifier in handling uncertain data, we propose in this paper a new evolutionary detection method, named ADIPOK (Anti-pattern Detection and Identification using Possibilistic Optimized K-NN), that is able to cope with the uncertainty factor using the possibility theory. The comparative experimental results reveal the merits of our proposal with respect to four relevant state-of-the-art approaches.},

The most successful configurators combine multiple techniques to search vast combinatorial spaces of parameter settings for a given algorithm as efficiently as possible. Specifically, two of the most prominent general-purpose algorithm configurators, SMAC and irace, can be seen as combinations of Bayesian optimisation and racing, and of racing and an estimation of distribution algorithm, respectively. Here, we investigate an approach that combines all three of these techniques into one single configurator, while exploiting prior knowledge contained in expert-chosen default parameter values. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over irace and SMAC on a broad range of running time optimisation scenarios from AClib.},

The configurations of members with different choices can influence the total cost (totalCost) and the total time (totalTime) for the productions of the supply chain. This paper focuses on a constrained SCC (CSCC) problem to minimize the totalCost and to meet the totalTime constraint (i.e., the deadline limitation). To handle the constrained problem, existing methods may use constraints handing techniques like penalty or repair to help obtain feasible solutions. Differently, this paper considers the constraint of totalTime as another objective, and proposes a multiobjective direction driven local search (MDDLS) algorithm to solve the CSCC problem. The MDDLS explores the search path from a solution with smaller totalCost (or totalTime) to another solution with smaller totalTime (or totalCost). This way, MDDLS can obtain a set of solutions with different totalCost and totalTime values. The solution with best (smallest) totalCost value among all the feasible solutions (whose totalTime values satisfy the time constraint) is regarded as the final solution. The experiments show that MDDLS outperforms some compared algorithms for the CSCC problem.},

  abstract  = {Stochastic1 Simulation Optimization (SSO) is one of the most useful decision-making tools for those who simulate the real-world problems in which uncertainty appear, such as manufacturing or logistics issues. In recent years many SSO algorithms, such as stochastic surrogate model, optimal computing budget allocation, and various evolutionary optimization algorithms, have been developed. We have exploited test functions for benchmarking the algorithms, in which a deterministic part whose optimal values are known is accompanied by stochastic noise with zero expected value. Using the test functions, we have evaluated the algorithm in the viewpoint of closeness between the obtained fitness and the optimal value, which indicates how good the obtained solution will be for infinitely long period since the fitness converges to the deterministic value at infinity. In the real-world decision making, however, we often use the obtained solution during the finite service time, and after that, we make a decision again. From the perspective of real-world application, we propose a method to evaluate the SSO algorithms considering finite period of service. We illustrate that the optimal solution may differ depending on the period of service when the simulation has heterogeneous noise, which may influence the performance ranking of the algorithms. Using the well-known COCO benchmarking platform, we carry out the numerical experiments on noisy test functions, and show how the service time affects the performance.},

Moreover, most such problems which must be solved for a reasonably approximate solution routinely in every few hours or every day must use a computationally fast algorithm. In this paper, we present a formulation of a dynamic vessel-to-vessel service ship scheduling problem. In a span of several hours, the service ship must visit as many moving vessels as possible and complete the trip in as small a travel time as possible. Thus, the problem is bi-objective in nature and involves a time-dependent traveling salesman problem. We develop a level-wise customized evolutionary algorithm to find multiple trade-off solutions in a generative manner. Compared to a mixed-integer programming (MIP) algorithm, we demonstrate that our customized evolutionary algorithm achieves similar quality schedules in a fraction of the time required by the MIP solver. We are currently developing an interactive decision support tool based on our proposed method for finding multiple trade-off schedules simultaneously and selecting a single preferred one.},

This work aims to identify properties of real-world problems through a questionnaire on real-world single-, multi-, and many-objective optimization problems. Based on initial responses, a few challenges that have to be considered in the design of realistic benchmarks can already be identified. A key point for future work is to gather more responses to the questionnaire to allow an analysis of common combinations of properties.

Nevertheless, theoretically comparable datasets can show considerably distinguishable properties, depending on both platform and specimen, a phenomenon known as batch effect. Batch correction is the technique aiming at removing this effect from the data. A possible approach to batch correction is to find a transformation function between different datasets, but optimizing the weights of such a function is not trivial: As there is no explicit gradient to follow, traditional optimization techniques would fail. In this work, we propose to use a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, to optimize the weights of a transformation function for batch correction. The fitness function is driven by the classification accuracy of an ensemble of algorithms on the transformed data. The case study selected to test the proposed approach is mRNA gene expression data of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a disease for which there is currently no established diagnostic test. The transformation function obtained from three datasets, produced from different specimens, remarkably improves the performance of classifiers on the task of diagnosing Chronic Fatigue. The presented results are an important steppingstone towards a reliable diagnostic test for this syndrome.},

Consiering the DHFS with fuzzy processing time and setup time constraints, we develop an improved version of BSO, named IBSO. The objective is to minimize the maximize fuzzy completion time among all the factories. First, each solution is represented by a two-dimensional vectors. The two realistic constraints, i.e., the fuzzy processing time under uncertain enviornment and the setup time, make the problem close to the reality. Then, a novel constructive heuristic based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) method, called distributed NEH, is proposed. Several local search heuristics considering the problem features and the objective are developed to enhance the local search abilities. Moreover a SA-based acceptance criterion is embeded to enhance the exploration abilities. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective for solving the considered DHFS problems in comparison with other recently published efficient algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Learning the movement of the oil spills is a challenging task. To address this, we propose an algorithm that extracts particles from the expansion aspect of an oil spill and tracks the location of the particles in time-series of oil spill data. Using principal component analysis, the oil spill data were divided, and the particles matched; this approach aims to minimize the variance of the distance of each oil spill through the use of a genetic algorithm and principal component analysis. Using the oil spill visualization data set in the previous study, the algorithm was determined to be suitable for oil spill monitoring, with the average data error of the particles 3.2\%.},

A genetic algorithm is used to find the positions of the sources by optimizing an objective function that also depends on their intensities. In this work we present a new objective function for the SUPPOSe algorithm that is independent of the source intensities. We compare both methods and prove the same performance but without the necessity to fit the intensities. This will allow to replace the optimization of the intensities with an optimization step to fit the instrument response function for a blind deconvolution.},

This development is nurtured by the availability and applicability of pre-trained models. However, their usage faces the risk of being inaccurate when used in domains different from the ones they were trained on.In this paper, we formulate the adaptation of word embeddings as a vector multiplication problem, which enables us to apply search methods to explore potential word embedding adaptations with respect to their semantic correctness. To assess the effectiveness of our proposal, we empirically investigate the use of both local and global search-based approaches (i.e. Hill Climbing, Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm) in order to maximise the semantic correctness of a popular Word2Vec pre-trained model (namely GoogleNews) when applied to another domain (i.e. the MEN dataset).The results of our study reveal that Hill Climbing, Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithm perform equally well and all outperform the original GoogleNews model as well as a baseline model based on Random Search. This shows that optimising word embeddings with search-based approaches is possible and effective.},

These materials display many interesting properties, including their ability to flow like a liquid at low densities and jam in to a solid state at high densities. However, controlling the microscopic properties of granular media to elicit bespoke functional granular systems remains challenging due to the complex relationship between the individual particle morphologies and the related emergent behaviour of the bulk state. Here, we investigate the use of evolution to explore the functional landscapes of granular systems. We employ a superellipsoid representation of the particle shape, and examine a range of bi-disperse systems of prolate particles. Results show the ability to determine optimal particle morphologies and trade-offs for density and two different structural order measures. This represents an important further step towards the creation of bespoke jammed systems with a range of practical applications across broad swathes of industry.},

The problem consists of designing a complete and cost-efficient bridge solution with geometry, cross-section, prestress and control design variables. The dynamic and static constraints create a deceptive landscape of the solution space, which, in turn, makes this problem hard to optimise via standard optimisation. We start with a conventional Genetic Approach and show that we are able to fulfill the structural requirements. Afterwards, we move to explore the variables and conditions that enable us to traverse in the solution space, optimising structural requirements while lowering the cost of solutions. The results present the sensitivities for all design variables for the baseline solution. We observed that most design variables could not be changed in any direction without compromising the structural constraints or cost. The results demonstrate that the optimisation of cable-stayed bridges requires finding a very delicate balance between multiple structural constraints and cost, which poses an interesting benchmark problem for the use of evolutionary algorithms in structural optimisation.},

It is also undeniable that the location planning of the fleet vehicles can contribute to its success. The fleet vehicles must be easily accessed and in the proximity of various transportation hubs and facilities. In this paper, we study the Vehicle Placement Problem (VPP) for round-trip carsharing and propose a novel hybrid algorithm, NGAP, which is a combination of NSGA-III and Pareto Local Search (PLS) to enhance the quality of the results over NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm is tested on 10 synthetic and four real-world instances. NGAP is shown to be significantly more efficient than NSGA-III on almost all instances in terms of Inverted Generational Distance (IGD), and Hypervolume.},

  abstract  = {Isolating the fitness-contribution of substructures is typically a difficult task in Genetic Programming (GP). Hence, useful substructures are lost when the overall structure (model) performs poorly. Furthermore, while crossover is heavily used in GP, it typically produces offspring models with significantly lower fitness than that of the parents. In symbolic regression, this degradation also occurs because the coefficients of an evolving model lose utility after crossover. This paper proposes isolating the fitness-contribution of various substructures and reducing the negative impact of crossover by evolving a set of features instead of monolithic models. The method then leverages multiple linear regression (MLR) to optimise the coefficients of these features. Since adding new features cannot degrade the accuracy of an MLR produced model, MLR-aided GP models can bloat. To penalise such additions, we use Adjusted R2 as the fitness function. The paper compares the proposed method with standard GP and GP with linear scaling. Experimental results show that the proposed method matches the accuracy of the competing methods within only 1/10th of the number of generations. Also, the method significantly decreases the rate of post-crossover fitness degradation.},

  abstract  = {In genetic programming, the parent selection method determines which individuals in the population are selected to be parents for the next generation, and how many children they create. This process directly impacts the search performance by determining on which areas of the search space genetic programming focuses its attention and how it balances exploration and exploitation. Many parent selection methods have been proposed in the literature, with aims of improving problem-solving performance or other characteristics of the GP system. This paper aims to benchmark many recent and common parent selection methods by comparing them within a single system and set of benchmark problems. We specifically focus on the domain of general program synthesis, where solution programs must make use of multiple data types and control flow structures, and use an existing benchmark suite within the domain. We find that a few methods, all variants of lexicase selection, rise to the top and demand further study, both within the field of program synthesis and in other domains.},

Various benchmarks problems were experimented with, and the practical evidence for the accuracy of the proposed model was provided.

Alternatively, genetic programming (GP) has a complementary set of strengths and weaknesses best suited to regression problems and homogeneous associations. Both approaches yield largely interpretable solutions. An ideal ML algorithm would have the capacity to adapt and blend representation to best suit the problem at hand. In order to combine the strengths of these respective algorithm representations, a framework allowing coexistence and co-evolution of trees and rules is needed. In this work, we lay the empirical groundwork for such a framework by demonstrating the capability of GP trees to be evolved within an LCS-algorithm framework with comparable performance to a set of standard GP frameworks. We discuss how these results support the feasibility of a GP-LCS framework and next-step challenges to be addressed.},

We present and approach to mitigate this problem by taking into consideration two factors: The number of evaluations and the execution time. We aim to keep the number of evaluations low by using Bayesian optimization (BO) - known to be sample efficient - and to reduce wall-clock times by executing parallel evaluations. Four parallelization methods using BO as optimizer are compared against the inherently parallel CMA-ES. Each method is evaluated on all the 24 objective functions of the Black-Box-Optimization-Benchmarking test suite in their 20-dimensional versions. The results show that parallelized BO outperforms the state-of-the-art CMA-ES on most of the test functions, also on higher dimensions.},

  abstract  = {While the sector of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is experiencing an exponential growth since several years, the majority of applications consider single devices which come with limitations such as flight duration or payload capacity. A promising way to overcome these is the usage of multiple autonomous UAVs synergistically, also referred to as swarms. Many metaheuristics have been manually designed to optimise the performance of swarms of unmanned vehicles. However developing and fine tuning efficient collective behaviours can be a challenging and time-consuming task. This article proposes to automate the generation of UAV swarming behaviours which optimise the Coverage of a Connected UAV Swarm (CCUS) problem where both the coverage time and the network connectivity are considered. To this end, we introduce a novel generative hyper-heuristic based on Q-Learning (QLHH) and evaluate the performance of the heuristics it generates to manually designed heuristics using state-of-the-art coverage and connectivity metrics. The obtained results demonstrate the capacity of QLHH to generate efficient distributed heuristics for the CCUS optimisation problem.},

The two types of problems have the common feature that all bits in each sub-problem are used for calculating its fitness value. The present model-based GAs appropriately decompose the whole of such a problem into parts and efficiently solve it. However, so far there has not been a test problem in which sub-problems are overlapped and bits of each sub-problem in the overlapped parts used for calculating a fitness value of the sub-problem vary depending on a bit pattern of a given solution candidate. This type of problems might cause difficulty in the decomposition to model-based GAs. In the study we propose the overlapped chains problem (OCP) as this type of problem. The results of applying several GAs to instances of the OCP show that some model-based GA cannot yield better search performance than a simple operator-based GA.},

CC divides a decision variable into several sub-problems and evolves the individuals independently in each of the sub-problems. Variables with dependencies need to be optimized mutually. In this paper, we focus on Linkage Tree as a method of analyzing the dependency of decision variables. Linkage Tree calculates the dependency between decision variables from the distribution of individuals as the distance between the decision variables, and builds a tree by using hierarchical clustering. We propose an algorithm that can efficiently search for problems with dependencies between variables by introducing Linkage Tree into CC methods. We evaluated the search performance of the proposed method using benchmark functions and confirmed the performance improvement by comparing it with the conventional methods.},

To boost the performance of crossover in real-coded genetic algorithm (RCGA), in this paper we propose to exploit the search history cached so far in an online style during the iteration. Specifically, survivor individuals over past few generations are collected and stored in the archive to form the search history. We introduce a simple yet effective crossover model driven by the search history (abbreviated as SHX). In particular, the search history is clustered and each cluster is assigned a score for SHX. In essence, the proposed SHX is a data-driven method which exploits the search history to perform offspring selection after the offspring generation. Since no additional fitness evaluations are needed, SHX is favorable for the tasks with limited budget or expensive fitness evaluations. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of SHX over 4 benchmark functions. Quantitative results show that our SHX can significantly enhance the performance of RCGA, in terms of accuracy.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proved to be effective models to solve a series of challenging computer vision tasks. However, designing CNN architectures with good performance is still a challenging task. Automatic CNN architecture search algorithms have been proposed in recent years which can find competitive CNN architectures without manual intervention. But automatic search algorithms usually consume considerable computational time and resources. In addition, they only use deep blocks and ignore wide blocks of CNNs, which limits the performance of evolved CNNs. In order to address the above issues, a fast approach for automatically evolving CNN architectures based on deep and wide blocks (FAE-CNN) is proposed through genetic algorithms in this paper. In FAE-CNN, a refined fitness evaluation method based on divided datasets is designed with the purpose to speed up the running time. By introducing the Inception Block, FAE-CNN can evolve optimal CNN architectures from both deep and wide directions. Experimental results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 show that FAE-CNN can automatically design CNNs with flexible architectures and better performance in a very short running time.},

The depletion of Moore&#39;s law, the high frequencies that microprocessors already reach, or the difficulty in continuing to reduce lithography are some of the causes that make single-computer systems not suitable for many applications. In response, distributed systems emerge to overcome hardware limitations and meet the requirements of the applications. With this in mind, this paper provides an efficient multi-population GA with asynchronous migrations and parallelism at multiple levels by exploiting the capabilities of a heterogeneous four-node cluster. The procedure is evaluated from an energy-time point of view and compared to a synchronous version.

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a novel theoretically sound approach for the celebrated CMA-ES algorithm. Assuming the parameters of the multi variate normal distribution for the minimum follow a conjugate prior distribution, we can derive the optimal update at each iteration step thanks to Bayesian statistics. Update formulae are very similar to the vanilla (μ/λ) CMA-ES. We also use variance contraction and dilatation to accommodate for local and global search. As a result, this Bayesian framework provides a justification for the update of the CMA-ES algorithm and gives a new version of CMA-ES assuming normal-Inverse Wishart prior that has similar convergence speed and efficiency as the vanilla (μ/λ) CMA-ES on test functions ranging from cone, Rastrigin to Schwefel 1 and 2 functions.},

  abstract  = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used for optimization. Their use is particularly beneficial for problems where underlying objective functions and/or constraints are highly non-linear / black-box and the classical exact techniques cannot be applied. However, EAs evolve a population of solutions over a large number of generations by applying variation operators and selection schemes. The migration of population towards the optimum solution can be slow and require a large number of function evaluations. In this paper, we propose to expedite this convergence by identifying smaller sub-spaces that potentially envelope the optimum using `bump hunting&#39;, followed by intensification of offspring generation in these regions. We implement the method within a Differential Evolution (DE) framework and demonstrate the improvement over a range of benchmark test problems.},

  abstract  = {Performance of real-parameter global optimization algorithms is typically evaluated using sets of test problems. We propose a new methodology of extending these benchmarks to obtain a more balanced experimental design. This can be done by selectively removing some of the transformations originally used in the definitions of the test problems such as rotation, scaling, or translation. In this way, we obtain several variants of each problem parametrized by interpretable, high-level characteristics. These binary parameters are used as predictors in a multiple regression model explaining the algorithmic performance. Linear models allow for the attribution of strength and direction of performance changes to particular characteristics of the optimization problems and thus provide insight into the underlying mechanics of the investigated algorithms. The proposed ideas are illustrated with an application example showing the feasibility of the new benchmark. Parametrized benchmarking is a step towards obtaining multi-faceted insight into algorithmic performance and the optimization problems. The overall goal is to systematize a method of matching problems to algorithms and in this way constructively address the limitations imposed by the no free lunch theorem.},

In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called Global and Local Adaptation with Clustering Embedded Resource Allocation (GLACERA) to solve problems with relaxed conditions. We believe that continuous optimization problems are solvable as long as the local optima can serve as clues for finding the global optimum. To solve the problems more efficiently, a new clustering technique is proposed to help identify potential local optima. Then, a new multi-armed bandit technique, aiming to reach global optimum with greater probability, is presented to allocate resources for each local optimum. Finally, a new formula is proposed for balancing exploration and exploitation according to remaining number of function evaluations. We compare GLACERA with four milestone algorithms that are commonly used for continuous optimization, and show that it can solve a new class of functions while others failed, while remain competitive in solving benchmark problems of IEEE CEC2005 and IEEE CEC2013.},

A special case of NDS, which we label as NDS1, is to find all the non-dominated points in P. NDS has emerged as a critical component for multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For m ≤ 3, Θ(n log n)-time is known. For a fixed small m &amp;gt; 3, the best bound is O(n logm-2 n log log n). For larger m, the best result is an O(mn2)-time algorithm.We show that the O(mn2) running time is nearly optimal by proving an almost matching conditional lower bound: for any ∈ &amp;gt; 0, and ω(log n) ≤ m ≤ (log n)o(1), there is no O(mn2-ε)-time algorithm for NDS or NDS1 unless a popular conjecture in fine-grained complexity theory is false.

We define five objective functions representing distance, travelling time, delays, and two route-specific features such as curvature and elevation. We define one instance for this test problem and provide its true Pareto-front to analyse the problem difficulties. We apply three well-known evolutionary algorithms. Since this test benchmark can be easily transferred to real-world routing problems, we construct a routing problem from OpenStreetMap data. We evaluate the three optimisation algorithms and observe that we can provide promising results for such a real-world application. The proposed benchmark represents a scalable many-objective route planning optimisation problem enabling researchers and engineers to evaluate their navigation and routing approaches.},

Moreover, choosing a single point from a large set even with certain preference information is problematic, as it causes a large cognitive burden on the part of the decision-makers. Therefore, many-objective optimization and decision-making practitioners have been interested in effective visualization methods to enable them to filter down a large set to a few critical points for further analysis. Most existing visualization methods are borrowed from other data analytic domains and they are too generic to be effective for many-criteria decision making. In this paper, we propose an alternative visualization method, following an earlier concept, using star-coordinate plots for effectively visualizing many-objective trade-off solutions. The proposed PaletteStarViz respects some basic topological, geometric, and functional decision-making properties of high-dimensional trade-off points mapped to a &quot;two-and-a-half&quot; dimensional space.

  abstract  = {Non-dominated sorting is a procedure which is heavily used by many evolutionary multiobjective algorithms. Despite it can be done in polynomial time, it remains an asymptotical bottleneck in many of these algorithms. What is more, some algorithms for non-dominated sorting, which are fast on average, are ridiculously slow in the worst case. Here we prove that a recent algorithm, the dominance degree approach from the paper &quot;Ranking Vectors by Means of the Dominance Degree Matrix&quot; by Zhou et al., has the worst-case time complexity of Θ(M N2 + N3). The Θ(N3) term, which is unusually high for this problem, indicates that this particular algorithm can not be recommended for performance-critical applications.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, it is well-known that incorporating hypervolume-based selection mechanisms in Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) has some drawbacks. For instance, it is computationally expensive to use these MOEAs for solving many-objective problems. Further, the optimization process concentrated around the knee of the Pareto front of some Multi-objective Problems (MOPs). Here, we proposed a modified hypervolume-based selection mechanism which adopts the use of an angle distance for choosing the worst candidate solutions to compute the contribution of hypervolume. Our approach tries to spread the solutions along the Pareto front to get a trade-off between the hypervolume indicator and angle reference distance. We incorporated this modified hypervolume-based selection mechanism in a MOEA. We showed that our approach could solve MOPs with irregular Pareto shapes even with many-objective problems with an improvement on running times when compared with the typical contribution schema.},

Penalty boundary intersection (PBI) in MOEA/D is one of the most popular decomposition approaches and has attracted significant attention. In this paper, we investigate two recent improvements on PBI, i.e. adaptive penalty scheme (APS) and subproblem-based penalty scheme (SPS), and demonstrate their strengths and weaknesses. Based on the observations, we further propose a hybrid penalty sheme (HPS), which adjusts the PBI penalty factor for each subproblem in two phases, to ensure the diversity of boundary solutions and good distribution of intermediate solutions. HPS specifies a distinct penalty value for each subproblem according to its weight vector. All the penalty values of suboroblems increase with the same gradient during the first phase, and they are kept unchanged during the second phase.},

Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is a widely used local contrast enhancement algorithm that can solve this problem. There are no fixed values of CLAHE input parameters that always produce the best output images in terms of contrast enhancement for radiographic images, so to find the parameters that satisfy the optimal condition in a radiography image we use the Speed-constrained Modified Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (SMPSO). Since the output is a set of solutions (called Pareto Set), in this paper we propose to use and compare a posteriori decision methods with a multi-objective approach, in order to select the solutions of the Pareto front that are aligned with the visual criteria of an expert. Three decision making methods were used (utility function-based, distance-based and a fuzzy method). In order to validate which decision methods gave better results, they were evaluated by a medical expert, concluding that methods based on utility functions and distance obtain better quality information. The Fuzzy method was discarded because it selects solutions with a lot of distortion.},

Furthermore, these methods are limited in scope, in that, they are not capable of tackling both continuous and discrete variables for either single-cluster or multi-cluster rules. In a unique departure from the state-of-the-art, this paper presents a computationally efficient, single EA-based, AutoI method capable of simultaneously extracting single-cluster or multi-cluster rules for both continuous and discrete variable spaces. The robustness of the proposed method is evident from its successful rule extraction tasks even with small-size datasets, where existing AutoI methods fail to apply.

This approach is based on a geometric fractal decomposition which divides the search space while looking for the optimal solution. The presented approach uses bi-level optimization to separate the architecture search composed of discrete parameters from hyperparameters optimization with continuous parameters. The architecture search is conducted by a random walker aiming to generate chained-structured architectures. The best ones are selected to be fined tuned using FDA. The benchmark CIFAR-10 is used to test the approach and results are among the state of the art considering the low number of parameters and the chained-structured architecture of the network. The encouraging results are emphasized by the fact that the entire process was conducted using low computational power with only 3 GPUs.},

In the face of this scalability challenge, we propose using Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) as a meta-algorithm together with SGD for training neural models. Our training scheme, &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;opulation-based &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;volutionary &lt;u&gt;SGD&lt;/u&gt; (PESGD) combines local SGD training on each training node with a periodic evolutionary step which selects the best performing models to generate a new population of models for the next iteration.

Those sequences permit ALCS to deal with this issue, but they have never been implemented within ACS2 (Anticipatory Classifier System 2), although this is one of the most advanced ALCS. This paper introduces a novel learning classifier system, BACS, that integrates Behavioral sequences to ACS2. This integration required the adaptation of the action selection policy, the integration of an aliasing detection algorithm that let the system build behavioral classifiers, and the adaptation of the anticipatory learning process. The results obtained over a maze environment benchmark show that behavioral sequences are a promising approach to address the perceptual aliasing issue.},

The most important contributions of this work are: the generated models are based on sets (unordered collection) of rules and the rule creation mechanism employs a conflict avoidance algorithm which guarantees that all rules within a model are consistent with each other. We conducted experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and compared our results with state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of predictive performance (F-Score) and interpretability (model size), and demonstrate that our best models had comparable F-Score and smaller model sizes.},

This function is used to estimate the parameters of a classification model such that the resulting probabilities correspond or at least approximate the game equilibrium. CMA-ES is used to minimize this function. Numerical experiments are used to illustrate the potential of this approach.},

  abstract  = {Neural networks are known to misclassify a class of subtly modified images known as adversarial samples. Recently, numerous defences have been proposed against these adversarial samples; however, none have improved the robustness of neural networks consistently. Here, we propose to use adversarial samples as a function evaluation to explore for robust neural architectures that can resist such attacks. Experiments on existing neural architecture search algorithms from the literature reveal that although accurate, they are not able to find robust architectures. An essential cause for this lies in their confined search space. We were able to evolve an architecture that is intrinsically accurate on adversarial samples by creating a novel neural architecture search. Thus, the results here demonstrate that more robust architectures exist as well as opens up a new range of possibilities for the development and exploration of neural networks using neural architecture search.},

In the paper, we describe the algorithm for the mathematical equations discovery from the given observations data. The algorithm combines genetic programming with the sparse regression.This algorithm allows obtaining different forms of the resulting models. As an example, it could be used for governing analytical equation discovery as well as for partial differential equations (PDE) discovery.The main idea is to collect a bag of the building blocks (it may be simple functions or their derivatives of arbitrary order) and consequently take them from the bag to create combinations, which will represent terms of the final equation. The selected terms pass to the evolutionary algorithm, which is used to evolve the selection. The evolutionary steps are combined with the sparse regression to pick only the significant terms. As a result, we obtain a short and interpretable expression that describes the physical process that lies beyond the data.In the paper, two examples of the algorithm application are described: the PDE discovery for the metocean processes and the function discovery for the acoustics.},

Although XCSF is a promising candidate for deployment in autonomous systems, its parameter dependability imposes a significant hurdle, as a-priori parameter optimization is not feasible for complex and changing environmental conditions. One of the most important parameters is the error threshold, which can be interpreted as a target bound on the approximation error and has to be set according to the approximated function. To enable XCSF to reliably approximate functions that change during runtime, we propose the use of an error threshold, which is adapted at run-time based on the currently achieved approximation error. We show that XCSF with an adaptive error threshold achieves superior results over static thresholds in dynamic scenarios, where in general there exists no one-fits-all static threshold.},

In this work we present a distributed system that uses an efficient evolutionary algorithm to design a modular autoencoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system on the tasks of manifold learning and image denoising.

Instead of using a single type of discriminator, in the hybrid formulation, both active and passive discriminators are used. Active discriminators come to their judgments while interacting with the system under investigation, which helps improve model accuracy. Passive discriminators come to their judgments while only observing the system, allowing the reuse of data samples, which for real robots would be costly to obtain. To validate these ideas, we present a case study where a simulated embodied robot is required to calibrate its distance sensor through a process of self-modeling, and without metric information of where it resides within the environment. The results show that the hybrid formulation achieves a good level of accuracy with significantly fewer data samples from the robot. The findings suggest that the self-modeling process could be realized on a mobile physical robot with a limited time and energy budget.},

  abstract  = {In order to address scalability issues which are a challenge for Deep Learning methods, we propose Wide Learning --- a model that scales horizontally rather than vertically enabling distributed learning. This approach first trains a repertoire of architecturally diverse neural networks of low complexity in parallel. Each network in the repertoire extracts a set of features from the dataset; these are then aggregated in a second short training phase in a centralised model to solve the classification task. The repertoire is generated using a quality diversity evolutionary algorithm (MAP-Elites) which returns a set of neural networks which are diverse w.r.t. feature descriptors partially describing their architecture and optimised w.r.t. their ability to solve the task. The technique is shown to perform well on two benchmark classification problems which have been tackled in the literature with Deep Learning techniques. Additional experiments provide insight into the role that diversity plays in contributing to the performance of the repertoire. We propose that evolving neural networks by promoting architectural diversity could in future lead to better results in some domains where current approaches have fallen short.},

This paper introduces the idea of multitasking to genetic programming to improve the efficiency of solving multiple dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problems with scheduling heuristics. It is realised by the proposed evolutionary framework and knowledge transfer mechanism for genetic programming to train scheduling heuristics for different tasks simultaneously.

  abstract  = {Recent success in solving hard reinforcement learning problems can be partly credited to the use of deep neural networks, which can extract high-level features and learn compact state representations from high-dimensional inputs, such as images. However, the large networks required to learn both state representation and policy using this approach limit the effectiveness and benefits of neuroevolution methods that have proven effective at solving simpler problems in the past. One potential solution to this problem is to separate state representation and policy learning and only apply neuroevolution to the latter. We extend research following this approach by evolving small policy networks for Atari games using NEAT, that learn from compact state representations provided by the recently released Atari Annotated RAM Interface (Atari ARI). Our results show that it is possible to evolve agents that exceed expert human performance using these compact state representations, and that, for some games, successful policy networks can be evolved that contain only a few or even no hidden nodes.},

This requires finding the correct behavior among a vast number of possible behaviors without having any feedback. In these cases, an exhaustive search may be needed. However, this might not be feasible especially when optimizing artificial neural networks in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce novelty producing synaptic plasticity (NPSP), where we evolve synaptic plasticity rules to produce as many novel behaviors as possible to find the behavior that can solve the problem. We evaluate the NPSP on deceptive maze environments that require the achievement of subgoals. Our results show that the proposed NPSP produces more novel behaviors compared to Random Search and Random Walk.},

Having such a repertoire allows a system to adapt to new, unforeseen tasks. Unlabelled image data is plentiful, but it is not always known which features will be required for downstream tasks. We propose a method for divergent search in the few-shot image classification setting and evaluate with Omniglot and Mini-ImageNet. This high-dimensional behavior space includes all possible ways of partitioning the data. To manage divergent search in this space, we rely on a meta-learning framework to integrate useful features from diverse tasks into a single model. The final layer of this model is used as an index into the `archive&#39; of all past behaviors. We search for regions in the behavior space that the current archive cannot reach. As expected, divergent search is outperformed by models with a strong bias toward the evaluation tasks. But it is able to match and sometimes exceed the performance of models that have a weak bias toward the target task or none at all. This demonstrates that divergent search is a viable approach, even in high-dimensional behavior spaces.},

Recent work addressing this by endowing artificial neural networks with neuromodulated plasticity have been shown to improve performance on simple RL tasks trained using backpropagation, but have yet to scale up to larger problems. Here we study the problem of meta-learning in a challenging quadruped domain, where each leg of the quadruped has a chance of becoming unusable, requiring the agent to adapt by continuing locomotion with the remaining limbs. Results demonstrate that agents evolved using self-modifying plastic networks are more capable of adapting to complex meta-learning learning tasks, even outperforming the same network updated using gradient-based algorithms while taking less time to train.},

We evaluate the impact of environments and complexity costs on robotic controller and morphology evolution across various evolutionary robotics task scenarios. This study uses evolutionary robotics as an experimental platform to investigate the arrow of complexity hypothesis [3], previously demonstrated to hold in artificial evolutionary systems given an imposed complexity cost [2]. Specifically, we test whether energy costs imposed on evolving robot controller and morphology complexity enables the evolution of increasingly complex controller and morphological designs concomitant with increasing environment complexity. Morphological complexity was equated with possible sensor configurations for a physical counterpart Khepera III mobile robot [8], and neural complexity was equated to artificial neural network topological configurations that coupled with a robot&#39;s evolved morphology.},

  abstract  = {An important goal in reinforcement learning is to create agents that can quickly adapt to new goals but at the same time avoid situations that might cause damage to themselves or their environments. One way agents learn is through exploration mechanisms, which are needed to discover new policies. However, in deep reinforcement learning, exploration is normally done by injecting noise in the action space. While performing well in many domains, this setup has the inherent risk that the noisy actions lead agents to unsafe environment states. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Meta-Learned Instinctual Networks (MLIN) that allows agents to perform lifetime learning while avoiding hazardous states. At the core of the approach is a plastic network trained through reinforcement learning and an evolved &quot;instinctual&quot; network, which does not change during the agent&#39;s lifetime but can modulate the noisy output of the plastic network. We test our idea on a simple 2D navigation task with hazard zones, in which the agent has to learn to approach new targets during deployment. While a standard meta-trained network performs poorly in these tasks, MLIN allows agents to learn to navigate to new targets while minimizing collisions with hazard zones. These results suggest that meta-learning augmented with an instinctual network is a promising approach for safe AI.},

It is said that data preparation helps to improve the effectivity of classification models as well as to reduce the feature space. Additionally, the feature subset selection application once is very common though doing the procedure twice is less frequent and is the scenario of this paper. The results are better than in the proposal with a single meta-heuristic and the reduction in the feature space is very appealing.},

However, we think a simple improvement approach can be made to improve SUNA&#39;s efficiency in the strategic decision-making problem tested by the model itself, i.e. the multiplexer problem. In the proposed method, we try to incorporate the idea of logical gates to the hidden neurons in the model, suggesting it the solutions that solve the problem in the real world in the form of neurons. It is shown that with the simple logic gates neuron variations, SUNA can be slightly enhanced to resolve the multiplexer problem.},

  abstract  = {Redrawing congressional district boundaries for political advantage (i.e. gerrymandering) is a recognized problem in the United States. Legal cases opposing gerrymandering have been stymied by the lack of objective measures showing that a districting is unnecessarily biased relative to other viable designs, given a set of competing considerations (such as fairness, compactness, and competitiveness). As a result, there is interest in methods that can show that a candidate districting&#39;s fairness could be significantly improved without sacrificing any other considerations. We propose multi-objective evolutionary algorithms as a promising approach for identifying gerrymandering, and districting as a real-world benchmark for the field. Our contributions are (1) to design an encoding and operators appropriate to the problem, and explore enhancements such as novelty search and feasible-infeasible search, (2) to set baseline results, and (3) to release an open-source tool called Antimander, with the hope of inspiring future research aimed at solving an important political problem.},

IBN has the advantage of finding out casualty relation between the variable and offering reasonable prediction accuracy, both are in demand for medical data analysis (MDA). FS is challenging in this scenario because the choice of the feature subset would have to satisfy both objectives of accuracy and generalization for the IBN. An extensive simulation experiment was carried comparing one dozen of swarm-based FS methods by different contemporary metaheuristics. In particular, a new search method called Teng-Yue Algorithm (TYA) which means motions of &quot;gallop&quot; and &quot;leap&quot; is formulated that mimic no living creation but just the two fundamental dynamics of local intensification and global exploration in the very original metaheuristic search design. It was observed from the experimental results that TYA outperformed all other metaheuristics by pairing with correlation-based feature subset selection and IBN, with a careful tuning on the balance of the local and global searching efforts distribution. The result is encouraging as TYA is relatively simple and able to empower fast and accuracy BN inference that MDA may leverage.},

During the survival selection, our algorithm makes probabilistic decisions to determine when and to whom additional samples should be given, intending to maximally save the samples. Since the samples allotted to individuals are accumulated as long as they remain in the population, long-lasting individuals tend to have a large accumulation and thus a quite accurate evaluation. Test results with benchmark functions confirm the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Recently the building of large neuronal circuits from realistic neuron models has gained traction. This bottom-up approach relies on the accurate description of the primitive elements composing the brain such as neurons and astrocytes, that are then aggregated into larger and larger circuits. However, as of today, this data-intensive approach is slowed done by the lack of complete biological description that would be needed to build such models. In the present study, we compare the use of different optimizers in the context of building numerical neuron models presenting realistic electrical behaviours despite only having a sparse description of the original neuron behaviour. To do so, we perform single and multi-objective optimization of the neuron model parameters using as targets electrical features (e-features) extracted from voltage recording obtained through patch-clamp experiments. The purpose of the optimizers is therefore to find the optimal set of parameters for the neuron model such that it presents a firing behaviour similar to the original neurons when exposed to the same stimuli. This neuron model building approach is not new [7, 10], however, to the authors knowledge, it is the first time that multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy is used in such a highly-dimensional parameter space using e-features obtained from experimental recordings.},

When there is an imbalance in learning dataset, machine learning models become biased and learn inaccurate classifiers. To resolve such data imbalance problems, a strategy that increases the volume of data of minority classes is often used by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Furthermore, the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data oversampling has recently become more common. This research used a genetic algorithm to search and optimize the combinations of oversampling ratios based on the SMOTE and GAN techniques. The case in which the proposed method was used was compared with the cases in which a single technique was used to train either the imbalanced data or oversampled data. From the results, it was established that the classifier that learned the oversampled data with the optimized ratio using the proposed method was superior in classification performance.},

  abstract  = {When solving design optimization problems using evolutionary algorithms, the optimization process can be computationally expensive. To accelerate the optimization process, ordinary Kriging (OK) surrogate models are often used with the efficient global optimization (EGO) framework. However, in some cases the EGO framework can lead to a globally inaccurate OK surrogate model when many sample points are close to each other. One way to tackle this issue is to use a regression OK model instead of an interpolation OK model. In this paper, we propose an interpolation method which solve the issue by combining a local and a global OK model fitted to different set of the sample points. This paper describes the optimal weighting method used to combine the different Kriging models and compares the performance of the new method to interpolation and regression OK for the modified Branin test function. We find that when many sample points exist close to each other, the combined Kriging method outperform both the interpolation and the regression OK.},

  abstract  = {Selecting the relevant algorithm for a given problem is a crucial first step for achieving good optimization algorithm performance. Exploratory Landscape Analysis can help with this problem by calculating landscape features that numerically describe individual problems.To understand the problem space in single-objective numerical optimization, we recently presented a preliminary study of how Exploratory Landscape Analysis can be used to visualize different optimization benchmark problems, with the ultimate goal of visualizing problems that are similar to one another close together. In this paper, we examine how the selection of landscape features affects such a visualization, and show that proper preprocessing of landscape features is crucial for producing a good visualization. In particular, we show that only a subset of landscape features is invariant to simple transforms such as translation and scaling. Further, we examine how such an approach can be used to visually compare problems from different optimization benchmark sets.},

  abstract  = {Linkage learning is employed by many state-of-the-art evolutionary methods designed for solving problems in discrete domains. The effectiveness of these methods is dependent on linkage quality. The linkage may suffer to two different inaccuracy types. If some of the gene dependencies are not discovered, then the missing linkage takes place. Oppositely, if linkage identifies some gene dependencies that do not exist, then the false linkage takes place. To the best of our knowledge, all linkage learning techniques proposed that far predict that some genes are dependent and can commit both of the mistake types. Therefore, we propose a more direct approach. We disturb the genotype and check how these disturbances have influenced the effects of local search. We prove that the proposed Linkage Learning based on Local Optimization (3LO) will never report any false linkage, although it may still miss some true gene dependencies. 3LO is fundamentally different from other linkage learning techniques. Its main disadvantage is a high computational cost and it is not suitable for already known evolutionary methods that frequently compute linkage. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary method that employs 3LO. More details considering 3LO, linkage quality and diversity may be found in the original paper [5].},

  abstract  = {In their recent work, Lehre and Nguyen (FOGA 2019) show that the univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) needs time exponential in the parent populations size to optimize the DeceptiveLeadingBlocks (DLB) problem. They conclude from this result that univariate EDAs have difficulties with deception and epistasis.In this work, we show that this negative finding is caused by an unfortunate choice of the parameters of the UMDA. When the population sizes are chosen large enough to prevent genetic drift, then the UMDA optimizes the DLB problem with high probability with at most λ(n/2 + 2e ln n) fitness evaluations. Since an offspring population size λ of order n log n can prevent genetic drift, the UMDA can solve the DLB problem with O(n2 log n) fitness evaluations. Together with the result of Lehre and Nguyen, our result for the first time rigorously proves that running EDAs in the regime with genetic drift can lead to drastic performance losses.This extended abstract summarizes our work &quot;The Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm Copes Well with Deception and Epistasis&quot;, which appeared in the Proceedings of Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimization (EvoCOP), 2020, pp. 51--66, and won the conference&#39;s best-paper award.},

  abstract  = {Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are a successful branch of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that evolve a probabilistic model instead of a population. Analogous to genetic drift in EAs, EDAs also encounter the phenomenon that the random sampling in the model update can move the sampling frequencies to boundary values not justified by the fitness. This can result in a considerable performance loss.This work gives the first tight quantification of this effect for three EDAs and one ant colony optimizer, namely for the univariate marginal distribution algorithm, the compact genetic algorithm, population-based incremental learning, and the max-min ant system with iteration-best update. Our results allow to choose the parameters of these algorithms in such a way that within a desired runtime, no sampling frequency approaches the boundary values without a clear indication from the objective function.This paper for the Hot-off-the-Press track at GECCO 2020 summarizes the work &quot;Sharp Bounds for Genetic Drift in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms&quot; by B.

CMA-ES is already well-known as a powerful algorithm for solving continuous, non-convex, and black-box optimization problems by fitting a second-order model to the underlying objective function (similar in spirit, to the Hessian approximation used by Quasi-Newton methods in mathematical programming). The proposed algorithm utilizes an e-constraint-based ranking and a repair method to handle the violation of the constraints. The experimental results on a group of real-world optimization problems show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of constraint handling and robustness.},
