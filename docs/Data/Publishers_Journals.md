## Introduction to Publishers

### AAAI

- [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aaai.org/)

### AAAS

- [American Association for the Advancement of Science](https://www.science.org/)
- [Journals](https://www.science.org/)
- [About Us](https://www.science.org/content/page/aboutus)

Science has been at the center of important scientific discovery since its founding in 1880—with seed money from Thomas Edison. Today, Science continues to publish the very best in research across the sciences, with articles that consistently rank among the most cited in the world. In the last half century alone, Science published:

- The entire human genome for the first time

- Never-before seen images of the Martian surface

- The first studies tying AIDS to human immunodeficiency virus

A trailblazer in online publishing as well, the Science family of publications has grown to include online journals Science Translational Medicine, Science Signaling, Science Immunology, Science Robotics and the open access journal Science Advances.

Science Translational Medicine is an essential platform for peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary research driving the latest medical advances. Science Signaling offers original review articles, protocols and teaching resources for the growing field of cellular signal transduction. Science Immunology publishes basic, translational and clinical research specifically about immunology across all organisms and model systems, including humans. Science Robotics covers new developments in robotics and related fields, with a dual focus on the science of robotics as well as introducing researchers more broadly to how robots can be used to accelerate scientific study. Science Advances represents the next generation of online publishing, with rapid publication of significant, full-length research that is available free to readers.

The Science family of journals is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world’s oldest and largest general science organization. The nonprofit AAAS serves 10 million people through primary memberships and affiliations with some 262 scientific societies and academies.

A voice for science and scientists everywhere, AAAS fulfills its mission to “advance science and serve society” by communicating the value of science to the public, helping governments formulate science policy, promoting advancements in science education and diversity, and helping scientists develop their careers.

APS will provide the support needed to host the Astrobites Slack channel, provide training resources to new writers, and elevate the organization’s prominence within the physics community, all while maintaining Astrobites’ editorial independence.

“Astrobites is a real shining star in the astronomical and graduate student community, and I’m elated that APS sees that and is happy to help us grow and expand. I’m very excited to see what we accomplish together,” says former Astrobites Administrative Committee chair, Huei Sears.

The Physical Review journals have always been a welcome home to the fields of astronomy and astrophysics having published prominent results from the LIGO Collaboration, BICEP/Keck, Parker Solar Probe, HAWC, Dark Energy Survey, and others.

Physical Review journals Executive Editor Jessica Thomas says, “Astrobites makes the latest findings in astronomy accessible to undergraduate students and others who are interested in active research. Supporting this effort aligns with the APS mission to promote physics and serve the broader physics community.”

EDP Sciences was established in 1920 by a prestigious academic community of French learned societies seeking to inspire, innovate and inform others by sharing their knowledge. Members of this community included eminent scientists like Marie Curie, Paul Langevin and Louis de Broglie.

Marie Curie was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity and won two Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Paul Langevin was a French physicist who gave his name to Langevin dynamics and the Langevin equation, while Louis de Broglie gained worldwide acclaim for his ground-breaking work on quantum theory.

Since November 2019, EDP Sciences is owned by Science Press which is itself majority-owned by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). CAS is a prestigious learned society and the world’s largest research organisation. EDP Sciences has always been, and continues to be, the publishing partner of scientific communities throughout the world. EDP Sciences is guided by a Scientific Advisory Committee which is an independent body composed of scientists and influential, well-known members of the scientific community. The Committee is responsible for advising EDP Sciences on strategic matters and ensuring a permanent, formal link between the publisher and the scientific community.
