This Journal is devoted to the advancement of the science and technology of guidance, navigation, control (GN&C), flight dynamics of (crewed and uncrewed) air and space vehicles through the dissemination of original archival papers disclosing significant technical knowledge, exploratory developments, design criteria, and applications in aeronautics, astronautics, and related fields. The Journal publishes high-quality papers on flight dynamics and stability, astrodynamics, guidance, control, navigation, estimation, optimization, design and implementation of GN&C algorithms. Papers are sought which contribute to foundational development and practice in verification and validation of GN&C systems, and GN&C-based autonomy. Papers that describe aspects of the GN&C and dynamics of significant recent developments, such as a new or different aircraft or spacecraft, also are desired. The Journal seeks to publish papers that develop new theories, methodologies, and tools for aerospace applications, or demonstrate the application of recent research to practical aerospace problems with strong theoretical foundations.
