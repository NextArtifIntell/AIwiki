Over 100 years of publishing excellence

EDP Sciences was established in 1920 by a prestigious academic community of French learned societies seeking to inspire, innovate and inform others by sharing their knowledge. Members of this community included eminent scientists like Marie Curie, Paul Langevin and Louis de Broglie.

Marie Curie was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity and won two Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry. Paul Langevin was a French physicist who gave his name to Langevin dynamics and the Langevin equation, while Louis de Broglie gained worldwide acclaim for his ground-breaking work on quantum theory.

Since November 2019, EDP Sciences is owned by Science Press which is itself majority-owned by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). CAS is a prestigious learned society and the worldâ€™s largest research organisation. EDP Sciences has always been, and continues to be, the publishing partner of scientific communities throughout the world. EDP Sciences is guided by a Scientific Advisory Committee which is an independent body composed of scientists and influential, well-known members of the scientific community. The Committee is responsible for advising EDP Sciences on strategic matters and ensuring a permanent, formal link between the publisher and the scientific community.
