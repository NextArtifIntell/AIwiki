In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has become part of almost every aspect of innovation, ranging from medical research to Internet Of Things (IoT), its development from rule-based systems to deep learning has redefined research and development in many ways. To properly document the landmark development in Artificial Intelligence, this Annual Review aims to invite pioneers and experts in the fourth front of AI research to document and keeps audience updated on the story of this remarkable journey from Chess playing program in the 1950s to today underpinning a spectrum breath-taking innovations. On the other hand, this Annual Review of Artificial Intelligence also plans to serve as a forum for researchers and scientists alike to share their research results and exchange notes on future directions of Artificial Intelligence.
