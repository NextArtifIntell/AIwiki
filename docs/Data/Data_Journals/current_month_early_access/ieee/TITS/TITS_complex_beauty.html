  abstract     = {Satellite-aided airborne systems can enable data acquisition in remote areas for the intelligent transportation systems (ITS), leveraging the satellite coverage alongside the mobility and multifunctional capabilities of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs). However, due to the harsh environment, ensuring secure and timely task execution is complicated by uncertainties related to both channel conditions and eavesdropping threats. This paper proposes a two-stage optimization method to fully exploit AAVs’ flying, sensing, compressing, and transmitting capabilities for secure data acquisition under dual uncertainties. In the first stage, a deep reinforcement learning strategy is employed to optimize sensing and trajectory planning to explore the eavesdropping environment and balance computational and transmission demands. Building on the sensed information about the eavesdropping environment, the second stage focuses on minimizing task completion time through optimal resource allocation and hierarchical A* path planning, with the channel uncertainty addressed by incorporating an outage probability constraint. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce data completion time by 35.3%, validating its effectiveness in uncertain environments.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) improve vehicle connectivity, traffic efficiency, and road safety. Conversely, quick and safe vehicle authentication still poses a significant issue, especially at the handover time when switching between roadside units (RSUs), where network efficacy is influenced by computational overhead and re-authentication delays. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes DYNAMIC-TRUST. This blockchain-based authentication framework relies on the Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to avoid redundant re-authentication, minimizing computation and communication costs. Compared to conventional authentication approaches, our method decentralizes vehicle revocation, allowing RSUs to revoke compromised vehicles autonomously without relying on a trusted authority, providing resilience regardless of adversarial conditions. The proposed framework’s resistance to identity theft, replay, and Sybil attacks has been proven by formal security analysis using Scyther and the Real-Or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Also, the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is used to evaluate real-world practicality, proving improved scalability, lowered authentication latency, and greater network efficiency over various vehicular circumstances. Blockchain’s potential for enhancing vehicular network performance, trust, and security is highlighted in this study, which helps to develop smart cities and 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) infrastructures.},

  abstract     = {Bus bunching, a pervasive phenomenon in public transit systems, significantly undermines passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency. Recent studies on mitigating bus bunching have turned to model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for developing holding control strategies, demonstrating superior performance over traditional model-based approaches. However, a systematic evaluation of how different learning configurations affect the overall performance of these methods remains unexplored. To this end, this study develops an open-source framework to systematically examine the control performance of various RL approaches, including both value-based and policy-based algorithms, under different configurations using real-world bus data. Our findings reveal that: 1) simpler state representations (e.g., considering only forward and backward spacings between adjacent buses) may outperform more complex ones that additionally incorporate stop-specific information; 2) adopting actions with discrete holding time achieve comparable results to their continuous counterparts, offering practical advantages for implementation; 3) while multi-agent methods can slightly improve performance, their computational costs can outweigh benefits in certain scenarios; and 4) RL approaches demonstrate strong generalizability across diverse routes and fleet sizes, suggesting potential for widespread application with minimal retraining. These insights could guide the selection and implementation of practical RL deployment for public transit agencies.},

Firstly, considering the coupling of longitudinal and lateral dynamics, the nonlinearity of tire force, the time-varying characteristics of longitudinal velocity and road adhesion coefficient, the time-varying nonlinear models of the 8-DOF vehicle dynamics system and SbW system are established. Secondly, a dual-channel event-triggering mechanism and low-complexity prescribed performance control method is proposed, in which the communication resources of sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels and the computing resources of the controller can be saved, also, the model uncertainty and measurement error can be against by the inherent robustness of the proposed methods. Thirdly, theoretical analysis is presented to show that the full-state and tracking errors of the SbW systems can be constrained to the prescribed ranges, and all signals of the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded.

  abstract     = {This paper revisits the Reactive Dynamic User-Equilibrium (RDUE) model for dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) of macroscopic traffic flow in two-dimensional continuum space, focusing on the Eikonal equation—a crucial partial differential equation (PDE) with specific boundary conditions. Traditionally, solving Eikonal equations has relied on iterative numerical methods through the discretization of the continuum space. However, this discretization compromises the precision of numerical solutions and could lead to non-convergence issues during iterative processes. This study refers to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and develops the Distance-Informed Neural Eikonal Solver (NES-DI) for solving Reactive Dynamic User-Equilibrium models. While the previously proposed Neural Eikonal Solver (NES) performs badly in a strong heterogeneous cost field with large cost differences, NES-DI explicitly considers the influence of solid boundaries during the factorization process by incorporating accurate distance information. Numerical examples of RDUE at both the static and dynamic levels are presented to illustrate the performance and applications of the NES-DI framework. The results demonstrate that NES-DI greatly outperforms both NES and the fast sweeping method. Moreover, NES-DI overcomes the limitations of discretization, enabling predictions of solutions at arbitrary locations within the computational domain. At the dynamic level, transfer learning is employed to leverage historical solutions to solve RDUE problems more efficiently. Overall, NES-DI shows the potential of solving reactive dynamic problems with strong heterogeneity, which offers a promising alternative to discretization-reliant numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a safe learning-based eco-driving framework tailored for mixed traffic flows, which aims to optimize energy efficiency while guaranteeing system constraints during real-system operations. Even though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems. Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances, which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an average improvement of 10.88% in holistic energy efficiency compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.},

Most previous lane detection methods focus exclusively on analyzing individual images and overlook the inter-frame dynamics, while car-mounted cameras capture continuous streams amenable to leveraging intra-video context. In challenging scenes with blur, occlusion, or illumination variations, considering visible lanes from previous frames can aid current frame interpretation. To tackle above challenges, we introduce a parallel heterogeneous framework, called PHNet, for video lane detection. First, a novel router automatically analyzes multi-level features to determine the inference route of candidates with different visual cues. Then, a cross-frame attention mechanism leverages relationships between current candidates and positive embeddings from past frame to aggregate contextual cues. Unlike existing offline video lane detection methods, which face limitations in handling long video sequences and real-time video streams due to computational constraints, our proposed method operates as an online framework capable of processing clips of any length. Our method demonstrates robust lane detection through temporally association modeling and efficient online inference. The extensive experiments on public benchmark show that PHNet has superior performance versus state-of-the-art video lane detection methods.},

Most of the trials are carried out in a simulated setting, and further real-world scenarios may be required to confirm the algorithm’s efficacy. This methodology initially implements batch normalization techniques to enhance the training process of the deep neural network, subsequently utilizing the quasi-Newton method for optimization to successfully approximate the ideal answer. According to the experimental results, the QNRLO algorithm’s loss function and normalized computation rate have converged after 2,000 iterations, demonstrating the algorithm’s excellent stability and dependability. The findings demonstrate that the computational load and training time can be further optimized by appropriately adjusting certain parameters without compromising convergence performance. Furthermore, the technique incorporates system transmission time allocation into the TCPS model, hence augmenting the model’s practicality. The proposed approach markedly enhances the efficiency and stability of job offloading compared to previous algorithms, effectively addressing task offloading challenges in TCPS and exhibiting considerable applicability and reliability.},

In environments supported by autonomous driving and 6G networks, this task plays a vital role in urban surveillance and traffic management by enabling the real-time sharing of vehicle location and status information through ultra-high-speed, low-latency 6G communication. The success of a retrieval model largely depends on the quality of the extracted representations, which can be influenced by factors such as background diversity and occlusions. This study proposes a method to extract representations that remain consistent across different domains while retaining the discriminative power necessary to determine a vehicle’s spatial location, regardless of background or environmental variations. To achieve this, we introduce a framework called full (abbr). Within abbr, we leverage large-scale pre-trained foundational models to provide spatial priors of vehicles, specifically the Grounding DINO model for object detection and the SAM model for object segmentation. These modules collaborate to help the network understand the spatial context of the object, enabling the feature extractor to focus on discriminative areas while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a complementary feature alignment mechanism based on a memory bank to explore globally applicable knowledge within the learned representation of the object. These constituent elements collectively form SRP, to enhance its capability for outstanding performance in vehicle retrieval. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that SRP significantly outperforms existing models on widely recognized benchmarks.},

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize symmetry across clusters, evaluating the effectiveness of clustering based on stop location using k-means. A novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm utilizing the Double Deep Q-Network framework is proposed to identify optimal clusters, demonstrating an 8% improvement in symmetry optimization over k-means. Notably, k-means clusters still achieve an average symmetry level of 62% when accounting for geographical proximity and walking distance limits.

However, managing the operation of QCs and AGVs is complex as numerous factors affect the operational performance, such as QC interference, vehicle congestion, and limited capacity of handover points. To address the problem, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model that explicitly considers the above realistic factors. As the model is computationally inefficient even for small-scale instances, we develop a tailored two-stage algorithm, where the first stage is branch-and-bound for QC operations and the second is column generation for AGV operations.

  abstract     = {As a major use of electricity, the energy efficiency of urban railways is of great concern. To reduce the operational energy consumption of a metro line, this paper proposes a two-stage optimization model for energy-efficient train operations based on three aspects: train operation strategies at inter-stations, running time allocation within an operating cycle, and utilization of regenerative braking energy of multiple collaborative trains in the same power supply area. The first stage is based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm, which optimizes the position-speed curves at each inter-station to obtain a series of energy-saving running curves and the corresponding Pareto fronts. In the second stage, a single-objective optimization algorithm and parallel computing method are used to solve the integrated optimization model for train operations with the minimum net energy consumption as the objective function, to reduce the net energy consumption in an operating cycle. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out with data on the Beijing Yizhuang line.

  abstract     = {Reliably identifying relevant and safety-critical traffic scenarios is a central challenge in developing automated driving systems (ADSs). The development of objective measures to detect the intuitively perceived level of criticality across various scenarios remains unresolved. The major challenge lies in the evaluation of all sensitive metrics of all participants in a scenario, which goes beyond assessing individual criticality metrics or providing only non-operational definitions. To address these challenges, a modular and practice-oriented framework that assesses traffic criticality is proposed. Vehicular and environmental data can be used to objectively measure individual critical elements of traffic, which are then aggregated into a comprehensive scenario assessment. The framework is illustrated by applying it (i) to two maneuvers discussing effects of single criticality metrics and (ii) to two widely used datasets featuring highway and intersecting traffic for a statistical analysis. The assessment framework can be applied in many scenarios, ranging from identifying safety critical scenarios in existing data as a fundament for early development of ADSs to detecting safety critical emergency maneuvers in live data to trigger a deployed ADS. Fundamental to this process is the suitable selection of metrics, thresholds for critical behavior, and the system’s sensitivity in aggregating partially critical scenarios.},

TTB-GA exploits the sensitivity of time series data and effectively deceives prediction models by altering input data’s timing within realistic ranges. To enhance the efficiency of locating and querying, customized operators such as mutation and fitness are designed within the GA-based search framework.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the limitations of a distributed detection scheme combining an Autoencoder, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), emphasizing the need for a robust and adaptive defenses.

To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive feature-manipulated network (AFMNet) for accurate vehicle and pedestrian detection in infrared images. First, a refined spatial pooling module that uses one-dimensional convolution is proposed to establish local and channel feature mapping under different receptive fields so that different fine-grained features are fused. Second, the shuffle manipulation module is designed which includes slicing and shuffling to manipulate the spatial and channel features so that the information loss problem caused by conventional convolutional downsampling is overcome. Third, the adaptive connection of features at different scales using learnable parameters is proposed, and then the target features are reinforced by location and channel calibration branches. The experimental results show that AFMNet achieves the best performance in terms of average detection accuracy of 86.4%, model size of 5.3MB, and detection speed of 48FPS on GTX 2080Ti.},

  abstract     = {Despite the development of several vision-based methods over past decades, lane detection is still a challenging issue in computer vision community. Traditional research on lane detection is mainly based on inter-frame similarity. Conversely, our methodology challenges this assumption, allowing the algorithm to adapt in diverse dynamic driving scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an advanced lane detection and tracking method using robust thresholding and frame coherence. A novel two stage feature extraction methodology for lane detection is introduced. In the initial stage, adaptive thresholding is employed based on the local statistical and geometrical constraints of lane markings at the sub-image level. Subsequently, artifacts are addressed and removed using a vertical aggregation technique combined with the Hough transform at the regional level. In this lane detection framework, tracking is integrated to establish a dynamic area of interest for lane search in the subsequent frame. For robust tracking, Kalman filter parameters are adjusted based on measurement reliability. To adapt to the non-linear variations inherent in real-world driving scenarios, outcomes of inter-frame similarity analysis are compared with periodic full-frame detection and a moving average window estimator is employed within the verification protocol. The proposed method is evaluated using Caltech dataset and our dataset, which was recorded at Indian highway and urban roads. Experiment results shows that the proposed method is robust to varying illumination conditions, dense shadows, lane change scenarios, abrupt change in lane width, and occluded lanes with a whooping average detection rate of 98.37%.},

Facing complexities like 3-dimensional updating, network dynamism, and updating costs, NTN-VNs are treated as social networks. The proposed NTN-VN federated learning (NTN-VN-FL) framework asynchronously addresses challenges such as uplink and downlink SC codec updates, device decentralization, and asynchronous updating. By viewing device behaviors during updating as social behaviors with economic costs, an NTN-VN social management system ensures the proper functioning of the social network in the context of NTN-VN-FL. An economical social behavior selection mechanism, based on the reverse auction game for NTN-VN-FL, minimizes training delay and device energy costs, considering social relationships. The article also presents a two-stage Stackelberg game with the Vickrey auction rule to maximize social welfare in the auction. Simulation results highlight the superiority of NTN-VN-FL over existing potential application algorithms, effectively addressing the unique challenges of SC codec updating in NTN-VN.

  abstract     = {3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.

Compared to conventional schemes without considering the near-field beam pattern with a finite depth, in our proposed scheme, the RIS only serves one UAV, while other UAVs are within the radiation range of the concentrated signal energy by beamfocusing. Specifically, we study the polar radius and angular deviations between UAVs with a given beamfocusing gain, aiming to reveal the impact of RIS structure on beamfocusing gain. We also make a fair comparison between the proposed scheme and allocated RIS scheme, deriving the feasible reference distance. In addition, we study the feasibility for different RIS structures focusing on the beamfocusing gain, which has the potential to improve the system performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is always superior than that of the allocated RIS scheme within the feasible reference distance.},

In order to improve both planning and control efficiency while ensuring the validity of the planned trajectories for autonomous vehicles, a reinforcement learning and optimal control integrated method (RL-OCIM) for planning and control is proposed. The proposed method ensures the obstacle avoidance through incorporating lane change based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with the optimal control method (OCM). The trained PPO agent takes the structured information of the ego vehicle and the surrounding obstacles as input, and generates the trajectory terminal state for the ego vehicle. Subsequently, the continuous trajectory solving problem is transformed into an optimal control problem (OCP), resulting in the generation of a feasible trajectory that includes vehicle steering and longitudinal acceleration based on the vehicle kinematics model. In addition, to improve the efficiency of agent training, a pre-trained neural network is employed to generate trajectory feature points by taking the trajectory terminal states as input. During the agent training process, the trajectory feature points are obtained directly from the neural network after selecting an action. Experiments are conducted on a hybrid Lincoln MKZ vehicle to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RL-OCIM, which includes various driving scenarios such as static obstacle avoidance and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

Accurate and reliable detection of smart road studs and its further integration into the perception and control modules of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) undoubtedly benefit road boundary detection, localization of CAVs and augument the safety of CAVs’ driving. This work investigates real-time, accurate and reliable detection of smart road studs, which is a challenging task for CAVs because existing methods fail to achieve accurate and real-time smart road stud detection, especially in harsh road environment. To address these challenges, we first build a real-world smart road stud dataset, and then propose and validate a lightweight and efficient smart road stud detection model based on the you only look once 8th version (YOLOv8), called SRS-YOLO. First, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention module is used to improve the coarse-to-fine (C2F) module to differentiate the channel importance of feature maps and improve the detection accuracy of smart road studs. Second, a novel downsampling module (DownS) that integrates the average pooling and the max pooling is designed to reduce the number of parameters and minimize information loss during the downsampling process. Third, the loss function is replaced with the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) loss to alleviate the sensitivity to location deviations when computing the loss for small targets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRS-YOLO outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and achieves a 87.92% mean average precision at a real-time speed of 78 frames/s.

Twelve influencing factors are developed, including network centrality measures and points of interest (POI) attributes, and a CRITIC weighting method is applied to weight these variables within the Node-Place Model, ensuring an objective assessment of their relative importance. Utilizing LightGBM regression method combined with SHAP values, our model achieved an average R2 of 0.88 in annual average daily entry ridership regression and a smaller discrepancy between R2 and adjusted R2, significantly outperforming ordinary least squares (OLS, R2 = 0.42) and geographically weighted regression (GWR, R2 = 0.58). The proposed model consistently demonstrates an AIC value approximately 15% lower than alternative models across multiple years of regression tasks, highlighting its stability and superior performance. Key indicators identified include PageRank and the number of restaurants and enterprises around metro stations. Combining detailed land use data and network centrality measures with advanced machine learning techniques proves to be an effective way to enhancing ridership regression.},

  abstract     = {Powered two-wheelers exhibit complex dynamics, primarily due to their broader range of possible attitude configurations compared to four-wheelers. This is especially true when considering accident scenarios, in which the dynamics can be affected by both high-frequency events, such as in high-sides, marked by rapid variations of the characteristics signals, and low-frequency events, such as in side slips, which exhibit slower and monotonic change in the same quantities. Therefore, designing an effective automatic eCall system for this type of vehicle is particularly challenging, while at the same time, it can significantly increase safety in dangerous situations. This paper proposed a novel approach for detecting falls of two-wheeled vehicles that avoids missed detections while minimizing the number of false alarms, which would heavily undermine its usability. We show, based on extensive analysis of a wide range of experimental data, why and how the proposed approach allows us to overcome the limitations of the existing proposal, ensuring a consistent detection of the wide range of falls that can happen on two-wheelers, also providing a detailed comparison with the scientific literature.},

High-resolution loop detector data and signal state records from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) offer new opportunities for traffic signal optimization at intersections. However, additional factors such as geometry, traffic volumes, Turning-Movement Counts (TMCs), and human driving behaviors complicate this task. Existing simulators (e.g., SUMO, Vissim) are computationally intensive, while machine learning models often lack lane-specific traffic flow estimation. To address these issues, we propose two computationally efficient Attentional Graph Auto-Encoder frameworks as “Digital Twins” for urban traffic intersections. Leveraging graph representations and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), our models capture lane-level traffic flow dynamics at entry and exit points while remaining agnostic to intersection topology and lane configurations. Trained on over 40,000 hours of realistic traffic simulations with affordable GPU parallelization, our framework produces fine-grained traffic flow time series. This output supports critical applications such as estimating Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), scaling to urban freeway corridors, and integrating with signal optimization frameworks for improved traffic management.},

Secondly, a parameter-adjustable cubic function negative-determination condition is proposed, generalizing the existing condition in the literature as a special case and reducing its conservatism. Then, by combining the proposed negative-determination condition with the suitable LKF, new stability conditions are derived, enabling a more accurate determination of the allowable delay upper bound (ADUB). Furthermore, to improve computational efficiency in determining the ADUB, the suitable LKF not only provides stability conditions with lower complexity, reducing time per iteration, but also incorporates a binary search algorithm, significantly minimizing the total number of iterations required.

The inherent stochasticity and dynamic nature in both passenger demand and drivers’ decision-making pose challenges in capturing vacant taxis movements. This study proposes a novel deep clustering framework to comprehensively uncover passenger-searching strategies from extensive trajectory data. Specifically, multiple features from vacant searching trips are extracted and analogously defined as multi-channel images, where each channel corresponds to a specific feature. A novel deep image clustering approach is then proposed, integrating a feature representation module utilizing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a self-expression module for affinity learning, a spectral clustering module, and a classification module for self-supervision. An effective training procedure is also presented for the proposed deep clustering framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against benchmark methods. Based on the clustering results, common and specific passenger searching strategies are further revealed. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of individual’s contextual experience in explaining searching behavior and operational efficiency. Moreover, drivers cruising without clear searching strategy often exhibit lower performance, and some drivers may gamble with peers to increase their chances of picking up passengers. These results deliver important justifications for future studies and provide managerial implications to improve on-demand mobility.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an efficient solution to alleviate the limitations of local computing resources in vehicular networks. However, the high mobility of vehicles and the dynamic variability of network topologies make it significantly challengeable. In this work, we make a fusion of model-driven and data-driven intelligence to design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution for task offloading in urban VEC networks. First, computational models for task queue, transmission, computation, energy consumption, and expense are meticulously developed for the VEC network that integrates communication and computation. Vehicular tasks vary in type, urgency, size, and timeframe, leading to different latency requirements. Tasks may be executed locally within the vehicle, at a server after V2I offloading via cellular communications, or in a neighboring vehicle after V2V offloading via millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Each of these options incurs different levels of latency, energy consumption, and expense. Second, based on these models and the utility function that combines latency, energy consumption, and expense, an optimization problem for task offloading is formulated. This problem can be interpreted as a Markov decision process with a carefully designed reward function. Third, to address the offloading problem, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization-based task and target selection algorithm (MAPPO-TTSA). This algorithm also utilizes convolutional neural networks to extract features from large-scale states, thereby enhancing their correlation. Fourth, comprehensive training is performed on the observational data to determine the optimal parameters for predicting task offloading. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, and simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed intelligent task offloading scheme offers significant advantages in terms of average task completion delay and utility level across various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In complex traffic environments, the driving performance of the leader vehicle in a platoon can be greatly impacted by sudden and unexpected changes in vehicle acceleration rates. This phenomenon is known as unknown jerk dynamics (JDs), and it can lead to more extreme car-following behaviors (CFBs) in platoon tracking control, which may raise safety and traffic capacity issues. To tackle these concerns, this work studies cooperative platoon tracking control and intermittent optimization problems for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with unknown reaction time delays (RTDs) using a nonlinear car following model (NCFM). In a free-design but directed communication network, we assume that the leader CAV’s external inputs have unknown but bounded parameters both for the JDs and RTDs, while only a small number of nearby follower CAVs are aware of the leader CAV’s acceleration signals. To solve these issues, we consider that each follower CAV implements a distributed observer law, which provides a reference signal stated as an estimated JD of the leader CAV. Then, a distributed platoon tracking control protocol is proposed to construct cooperative tracking controllers with identical inter-vehicle constraints (ICs). This maintains the desired safety distance between the CAVs and allows each follower CAV to track its leader CAV only through local information exchange. In addition, we present a robust intermittent optimization design and a novel intermittent sampling condition that can guarantee optimally scheduled feedback gains for the cooperative platoon tracking controllers to minimize the control cost in the presence of unknown JDs and RTDs under non-identical ICs. Simulation case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. We also demonstrate the efficient development of such a distributed cooperative car-following model for the platoon’s motion (or as an intelligent speed advising system for automated or human-driven vehicles), resulting in a trip that is safe, comfortable, and energy efficient.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory prediction, as a key enabler of the intelligent transportation system, has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry in recent years. However, the variability and dynamism of traffic conditions pose significant challenges to current vehicle trajectory prediction methods, particularly in the form of domain bias. Domain bias occurs when a model trained on one traffic domain, such as one segment of a highway, underperforms when applied to another segment with different traffic patterns. To address this challenge and advance the field, we propose a new transfer learning-based collaborative vehicle trajectory prediction framework called TRACER, designed to provide reliable and accurate traffic predictions with high adaptability for cross-domain highway traffic scenarios. The core of our framework lies in an adaptive interactive extraction module and a trajectory generation module based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), further strengthened by a pre-task of intention recognition for vehicle operation types. To improve model robustness, consistency regularization is applied by injecting disturbances into the target data, and a one-dimensional Convolution (Conv1D)-based intention extraction module is integrated into the BiLSTM-based trajectory generation process, leading to notable improvements in prediction accuracy. Our framework is first trained on source domain data, followed by the transfer of a small amount of labeled data from the target domain, and the overall model is further refined using unlabeled data. By effectively mitigating domain bias, TRACER significantly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while maintaining high adaptability. The results underscore the importance of addressing domain shift challenges in trajectory prediction tasks and demonstrate the potential of domain adaptation techniques to improve the prediction accuracy of vehicle trajectories across different domains in highway scenarios.},

The system comprises a lightweight feature-enhanced YOLO network (YOLO-LFE), a multi-object tracking network called ByteTrack, and is deployed on intelligent edge devices, enabling real-time defect detection and storage of uploaded defect information through edge computing modules and cloud systems. Built upon the latest YOLOv8 architecture, a lightweight MobileNetV3 network is first introduced as the backbone feature extraction component, resulting in a noteworthy decrease in parameters and computational intricacy. Subsequently, the Enhanced Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ESPP) method built upon the human visual perception system is applied to swap out the Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fusion (SPPF) method, thereby enhancing the model’s capability to capture features from tiny entities. Finally, an enhanced progressive feature fusion network is designed to further address the semantic gap issue during subsequent fusion of primary features. Experimental results on a self-made dataset and the public RDD2022 dataset show that the proposed detection model maintains high accuracy while requiring fewer parameters and less computational resources. Compared to YOLOv8, the model reduces the number of parameters by 32.5% and decreases computational requirements by 37%. This makes it more suitable for deployment on embedded devices.

  abstract     = {Efficient and reliable motion planning is essential for robots in transportation systems. Learning-based motion planners, especially those leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), have emerged as promising approaches to accelerate motion planning. However, current GNN-based planners suffer from inevitable performance bottlenecks due to their insufficient exploitation of environmental information and the intrinsic connections within graph structures. In contrast, the human brain exhibits innate strengths in decision-making and reasoning, enabling complex inferences from sparse observations and rapid integration of new information to control behavior. Neuroscience evidence reveals the human brain translates decision-making problems into graph structures and sensory observations, leveraging spatial relational memory for sensory inference. To address these issues, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GNN-based motion planner, BrainyMP, which innovatively draws on the brain’s spatial relational memory mechanisms. Specifically, a selective sampling strategy is proposed to reduce unnecessary exploration during the construction of the random geometric graph (RGG). Additionally, a Brainy Edge Selector is designed to filter inappropriate edges, enhancing planning quality. Furthermore, the Memory-aware Predictor is proposed to improve graph pattern learning capabilities and planning efficiency by integrating subgraph structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves planning quality and efficiency in maze and robotic-arm manipulation tasks while maintaining high success rates. These results indicate that emulating human brain mechanisms holds promise for improving robotic performance.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging urban computing paradigm, vehicle crowd sensing (VCS) leverages ubiquitous vehicles as basic sensing units to achieve more efficient data collection. However, with the expansion of the sensing range, the tens of thousands of vehicles and the openness of urban road networks pose a huge challenge for real-time participant recruitment in online VCS systems. To achieve efficient city-scale VCS, this paper proposes Dec-Recruiter, a decentralized framework for online participant recruitment. Specifically, Dec-Recruiter adopts a novel decision-making mode based on virtual grid agents, where vehicles traveling in the same direction within the same grid are considered homogeneous, simplifying the recruitment of specific vehicles to the selection of the number of vehicles in each direction. Meanwhile, through policy sharing among grid agents with the same geographic features, the complexity of city-scale VCS participant recruitment is further reduced. The core of Dec-Recruiter is a multi-agent contextual double-deep Q-network algorithm, which enables grid agents with different geographic features to collaborate on network-wide sensing tasks through their asynchronous decision-making.

  abstract     = {Within the Internet of Things (IoT) for traffic monitoring, the employment of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) as relays for collecting and transmitting real-time data from traffic sensors to base stations has proven a promising approach. In UAV-assisted Data Time-Sensitive IoT (DTIoT), the Age of Information is a crucial metric assessing data freshness, measuring the elapsed time from traffic sensors to the base station. Optimizing flight trajectories of multiple UAVs to minimize AoI while adhering to energy constraints poses a significant challenge. Current research often employs deep reinforcement learning for UAV trajectory control. Nevertheless, managing multi-agent continuous trajectories in intricate DTIoT network environments faces obstacles due to sparse rewards, thus impeding the training of deep neural network-based control policies using traditional DRL techniques. In this paper, we propose a network-oriented hierarchical reinforcement learning (NO-HRL) to control the UAVs’ flight trajectory in DTIoT networks for minimizing the AoI. We devise a control policy leveraging a two-tier hierarchical DRL framework, with the upper tier determining the target and the lower tier executing it. We also introduce a decoupled sequential training approach to efficiently train the mutually dependent two-tier DRL network of NO-HRL. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in optimizing AoI for DTIoT compared to other baselines.},

  abstract     = {Flight safety incidents, such as hard landings and tail strike risks, represent critical concerns during the landing phase. Although Quick Access Recorder (QAR) systems collect extensive multivariate flight data, previous studies have faced challenges in effectively modeling the complex interdependencies between flight parameters, which has limited their ability to predict multiple safety incidents simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, named MDGNN, to capture hidden spatio-temporal dependencies and predict both hard landing and tail strike risk incidents. Specifically, we employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to extract both localized representations and long-term temporal trends from multivariate flight data, ensuring the standardization of flight parameters across varying frequencies. Additionally, we are the first to construct a dynamic graph to model temporal relationships, applying a dynamic graph neural network and a temporal convolution module to accurately capture intricate spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on 37,904 Airbus A320 flight samples demonstrate that the MDGNN model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a case study visualizing key flight parameters highlights the model’s ability to reveal the root causes of safety exceedances, offering valuable insights for flight safety analysis.},

This paper proposes a safety field (SF)-based vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception approach by quantifying the driving risk in complex traffic scenarios. Leveraging the SF theory and point cloud downsampling, we design a delay-aware early fusion framework with adaptive communication volume control. We propose a latency-compensation error (LCE) for performance evaluation considering data transmission delay. The proposed framework is tested and verified in simulated city environments and simulated and real-world datasets.

However, current preparation and adjustment of train timetables face challenges in real-time responsiveness and poor performance on large-scale instances. To alleviate these problems, we propose a unified scheduling model based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for both TTO and TTR problems with similar formulations. The key components of our approach include a state representation utilizing the Markov decision process that captures global train and station characteristics, and a policy network that extracts information from this representation to sequentially construct the train departure order. The main benefits of our framework include adaptability to different stopping plans and delay scenarios, decoupling from the problem size, and ensuring the feasibility of generated schemes. Furthermore, to improve the solution quality, we integrate the learned decision policies with a local search method, enabling the scalability of the model with little additional computation cost. Experiments on extensive TTO and TTR instances of the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway line demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach. Our DRL-based method outperforms all the heuristic rules and commercial solvers without retraining the model on various problem sizes, especially on large-scale cases under limited calculation time.},

This model features a Dual-Attention Encoder comprising the Low-Level Local Attention Module (LLLAM) and the High-Level Global Attention Module (HLGAM). Additionally, it integrates a Bidirectional Cross-scale Feature-Fusion Module (BCFM) and a decoder.

Overhead crane systems, being a crucial mode of transportation, find wide application in engineering practice. This paper proposes a compound control strategy for underactuated overhead crane systems, combining a deep reinforcement learning controller with a novel observer-based disturbance compensation algorithm. The aim is to suppress model uncertainties and external disturbances. Initially, an equivalent state variable is constructed to stabilize the overhead crane system, simplifying controller design. Subsequently, the model uncertainties and external disturbances are treated as generalized disturbances and incorporated as a new state. This state is estimated and compensated through a super-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with finite-time convergence. Lyapunov-based analysis demonstrates that the established state observer can reduce the residual estimate error to zero. Moreover, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a form of deep reinforcement learning, is employed to effectively eliminate tracking errors. The proposed scheme enables the underactuated system to achieve satisfactory performance, with adaptive control effort suited to different control states and disturbances. Simulation and hardware experiments are conducted, comparing the proposed control strategy with traditional methods, to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness.},

For this purpose, we design a convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images.

To address the challenges and overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes a Dual-control Inference Diffusion Model (DIDM), which reconstructs and inferences on specified sensor samples to achieve accurate anomaly detection. The reverse diffusion inference process is controlled by the channel condition and mask prior, combined with two loss functions for alternating training, which enables inference for samples from specified sensors at specific moments. We evaluate the model based on the static ignition test data of a certain type of LRE. The results show that DIDM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of DIDM. Furthermore, by combining the error distributions of the inference results, we can achieve a more accurate location of anomaly in the time and frequency domains, which could increase the efficiency of rocket launches and air and space transportation, and enhance the potential of the academic results for industrial applications.},

Recent advances focus on modeling a deep learning-based method to realize the driver monitoring system, which benefits from the powerful capability of data-driven feature extraction. Although the acceptable performances of driver state monitoring methods are achieved, there is still a gap between the emerged techniques and actual application scenarios. First, the human-centric visual appearances are not involved comprehensively to represent the driver states, resulting in ignoring the contextual interaction of behaviors. Second, the inherent uncertainty of driver situation is not considered, while the unreliable samples would lead to the untrustworthy results. In this paper, we focus on a vision-based driver state monitoring method, where a trustworthy driver state perception (TDSP) is proposed via human-centric contextual interaction-driven evidential vision-language fusion in VCPS. Specifically, a vision-language model-based architecture is first modified in temporal dimension to represent the visual human-centric contextual interactions, while a vision-language consistency loss is designed to mitigate the gap between visual and textual representations. Then, an evidence-based learning method is introduced to jointly conduct the classification and uncertainty estimation for driver states. Furthermore, to model the human-centric contextual interactions towards the evidence-based paradigm comprehensively, Dempster-Shafer theory-based combination rule is introduced to fuse the visual and textual representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmarks, where the superiority of TDSP is demonstrated compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The superior performance of TDSP to recognize dangerous states are 85.41% and 83.12% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 4.68% and 3.99%. Moreover, we validate the reliability of TDSP against the noisy data for VCPS. The code will be public at https://github.com/w64228013/TDSP.},

By embedding the saturation compensation function, a feedback mechanism between the saturation constraint and performance constraint is established, instead of cutting off the analysis separately, by giving the constraint boundaries the flexibility to expand and contract. Subsequently, the inherently unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties of the controlled vehicle are reconstructed online by interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems. By integrating the predefined-time differentiator into the recursive design framework, an adaptive fuzzy predefined-time formation protocol is developed to provide a streamlined solution for adjusting the settling time and facilitates engineering implementation. The stability analysis rigorously proves that all the variables are practical predefined-time bounded.

Numerous methods rely heavily on annotations, yet the low visibility of nighttime images poses difficulties for labeling. To obviate the need for nighttime annotations, unsupervised domain adaptation manifests as a viable solution. However, existing approaches primarily focus on semantic-level domain gaps, often overlooking pixel-level discrepancies caused by inherent degradations in the nighttime domain. These degradations can impair machine vision and limit detection performance. In this paper, we propose TripleA, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework tailored for nighttime VRU detection. TripleA includes triple alignment. First, it aligns daytime and nighttime images to generate synthetic nighttime images, which are then enhanced for illumination and noise. To remove noise, we introduce an illumination difference-aware denoising network, incorporating a novel pseudo-supervised attention to achieve pixel-wise noise distribution alignment. This alignment is driven by pseudo-ground truth generated through a carefully designed exchange-recombination strategy, facilitating self-supervised training of the denoising network. Additionally, we introduce degradation alignment to ensure domain-invariant degradation encoding, which enhances the network’s robustness for real-world nighttime images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for nighttime VRU detection, all without the need for annotated nighttime data.},

These applications pose challenges to onboard computation and energy resources. To address these issues, Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) has been introduced as a novel computing paradigm. Given the rapid and frequent changes in the topology of VANET networks due to the highspeed movement of vehicles, most VANET applications adopt broadcast communication, except for a few employing unicast communication. However, traditional task offloading models struggle to support broadcast applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a VANET broadcast task model to offload tasks from On-Board Units (OBUs) to Road-Side Units (RSUs) for the first time. To meet the requirement of low latency, an efficient polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is further proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the algorithm, with all instances being solved in less than 6ms, which significantly surpasses the performance of existing solvers. Moreover, the solutions obtained from the algorithm exhibit gaps below 1%, indicating their high acceptability and applicability in practical VANET applications. Furthermore, extensive numerical experiments provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of task offloading, suggesting an appropriate ratio of 6 between the number of OBUs and RSUs.},

  abstract     = {Smart intersections have the potential to improve road safety with sensing, communication, and edge computing technologies. Perception sensors installed at a smart intersection can monitor the traffic environment in real-time and send infrastructure-based warnings to nearby travelers through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. This study investigated how infrastructure-based warnings can influence driving behaviors and improve roundabout safety through a driving simulator experiment. A co-simulation platform integrating Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and Webots was developed to serve as the driving simulator. A real-world roundabout in Ann Arbor, Michigan was built in the co-simulation platform as the study area, and merging scenarios were investigated. 36 participants were recruited and asked to navigate the roundabout under three aggressiveness levels (low, medium, and high) and three collision-warning designs (no-warning, 1-second-in-advance warnings, and 2-second-in-advance warnings). Experiment results indicate that advanced warnings can significantly enhance safety by minimizing potential risks compared to scenarios without warnings. Earlier warnings enable smoother driver responses and reduce abrupt decelerations. In addition, a personalized intent prediction model was developed to predict drivers’ stop-or-go decisions when the warning was displayed. Among all tested machine learning models, the XGBoost model achieves the highest overall prediction accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Human-involved interactive environments pose significant challenges for autonomous vehicle decision-making processes due to the complexity and uncertainty of human behavior. It is crucial to develop an explainable and trustworthy decision-making system for autonomous vehicles interacting with pedestrians. Previous studies often used traditional game theory to describe interactions for its interpretability. However, it assumes complete human rationality and unlimited reasoning abilities, which is unrealistic. To solve this limitation and improve model accuracy, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the partially observable markov decision process with behavioral game theory to dynamically model AV-pedestrian interactions at the unsignalized intersection. Both the AV and the pedestrian are modeled as dynamic-belief-induced quantal cognitive hierarchy (DB-QCH) models, considering human reasoning limitations and bounded rationality in the decision-making process. In addition, a dynamic belief updating mechanism allows the AV to update its understanding of the opponent’s rationality degree in real-time based on observed behaviors and adapt its strategies accordingly. The analysis results indicate that our models effectively simulate vehicle-pedestrian interactions and our proposed AV decision-making approach performs well in safety, efficiency, and smoothness. It captures key patterns of the driving behavior operated by real human drivers in virtual reality(VR) experiments and even achieves more comfortable navigation compared to our previous VR experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Coordination at unsignalized intersections has attracted increasing attention in recent years, which aims at improving the efficiency of intersection operations, while eliminating conflicts and deadlocks for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). This paper addresses the challenging issue of systematically optimizing CAV trajectories, tackling the high computational cost for finding a good solution, especially as the number of lanes and CAVs increases. To do so, a novel systematic optimal trajectory planning model is designed to efficiently guide CAVs through intersections without conflicts and deadlocks. To tackle the computational hurdles and enable real-time applications, based on the model, we develop a Petri net-aided Iterative Trajectory Optimization (P-ITO) solution algorithm. Leveraging the unique characteristics of the problem, this algorithm first designs a Petri net-based controller for conflict and deadlock avoidance so that initial feasible solutions are generated. Then, refinement is made on the initial feasible solutions to obtain an optimal or near optimal solution by designing an iterative process. This algorithm effectively ensures solution feasibility and enhances computing efficiency by searching for an optimal solution in the feasible region. Numerical experiments for intersections with bidirectional six-lane configurations illustrate the efficacy of our model in facilitating the safe and efficient passage of all CAVs while mitigating the risk of deadlocks. The P-ITO algorithm significantly outperforms the commercial solvers in both solution quality and computational time. Furthermore, our method is versatile, applicable to diverse intersection scenarios, and capable of maintaining high computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Automatic road extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images has greatly facilitated the applications of high-precision road mapping in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. However, challenges such as occlusions from buildings, trees, and complex road shapes bring great difficulties to precise road extraction. Also, existing methods often overlook the integrity of road direction and edge, leading to unsatisfactory extraction results. To alleviate the issue, this paper has presented a direction and edge co-awareness network (DENet). Firstly, the road edge detector (RED) is introduced to extract coarse road edges with abundant directional information. By leveraging the edge enhancement blocks, the edge structures of road can be efficiently refined, achieving the extraction of intricate narrow and elongated road shapes. Secondly, we incorporate the directional spatial attention (DSA) mechanism within the dual encoders and decoders to promote the extraction and fusion of road directional information and elongated features from different orientations, thus greatly mitigating the road occlusion issue. Finally, to fully interlace potential road information, a grouped local-global feature fusion (GLFF) is specifically designed to exchange multi-scale semantic information across different channels, simultaneously emphasizing road features and suppressing irrelevant background features. Numerous experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DENet for road extraction, achieving F1 scores of 78.51% on the CHN6-CUG dataset, 79.35% on the Massachusetts road dataset, and 77.90% on the GF2-FC dataset, outperforming several existing state-of-the-art methods.

Firstly, the sensitivity field distributions of electrode pairs and CACS are established, and the optimal sensitivity layer is determined. In addition, the normalized capacitance of electrode pairs and the contribution rate required for distress imaging are analyzed. Finally, the distress images of asphalt materials are reconstructed. The relative depth, shape feature, and type of internal distress are determined. It is found that Layer 14 is the optimal sensitivity layer. Circular distress exhibits the highest normalized capacitance values, followed by square distress and triangle distress. The opposing electrode pairs demonstrate the greatest contribution to distress imaging. The redder the image, the deeper the distress, demonstrating that CACT can determine the relative depth of internal distress. The square distress image has the highest accuracy, followed by circular distress and triangle distress. The reconstructed images show that moisture distress in asphalt mixtures is reconstructed with the highest accuracy, followed by moisture distress in asphalt mastics, void distress in asphalt mastics, and void distress in asphalt mixtures.},

  abstract     = {Pavement distress, manifested as cracks, potholes, and rutting, significantly compromises road integrity and poses risks to drivers. Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by the proposed STGAN model. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.},

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently shown significant potential in addressing complex traffic dynamics, but the intricacies of partial observability and coordination in decentralized environments still remain key challenges in formulating scalable and efficient control strategies. To address these challenges, we present CoordLight, a MARL-based framework designed to improve intra-neighborhood traffic by enhancing decision-making at individual junctions (agents), as well as coordination with neighboring agents, thereby scaling up to network-level traffic optimization. Specifically, we introduce the Queue Dynamic State Encoding (QDSE), a novel state representation based on vehicle queuing models, which strengthens the agents’ capability to analyze, predict, and respond to local traffic dynamics. We further propose an advanced MARL algorithm, named Neighbor-aware Policy Optimization (NAPO). It integrates an attention mechanism that discerns the state and action dependencies among adjacent agents, aiming to facilitate more coordinated decision-making, and to improve policy learning updates through robust advantage calculation. This enables agents to identify and prioritize crucial interactions with influential neighbors, thus enhancing the targeted coordination and collaboration among agents. Through comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods over three real-world traffic datasets composed of up to 196 intersections, we empirically show that CoordLight consistently exhibits superior performance across diverse traffic networks with varying traffic flows.},

In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional indicator based on field theory to evaluate lane change risks on the highway. The driving risk field is constructed by integrating the individual and interaction features of the source vehicle and the interacting vehicle. Parameter calibration with highD trajectory data allows the risk field forces to objectively reflect the risk perception. An adaptive optimization algorithm with cumulative gradient bias correction is introduced for parameter calibration. The enhanced first-order and second-order momentum, along with the long-term memory, are developed to adaptively adjust the learning rate and prune abnormal gradients. A Gaussian mixture model is applied to cluster the calibrated two-dimensional risk indicators, generating the F-F diagram. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed driving risk field model and the gradient-based algorithm. Confidence region estimation of the lane change risk distribution further validate the objectivity and interpretability of the F-F diagram. The 95% confidence level offers valuable insights for proactive traffic safety management, and lays a foundation for developing personalized lane change strategies.

The framework’s student network comprises a customizable multi-branch residual detection network and a lightweight policy network. The former efficiently extracts multi-scale features in parallel without altering receptive fields, while the latter, depending on curriculum learning, captures task-relevant features and dynamically generates routing vectors to guide the activation or deactivation of residual blocks according to image instance complexity. The framework’s teacher network employs a soft-voting strategy to consolidate knowledge from multiple pre-trained teacher models, providing consistent guidance to the student. Within this distillation paradigm, the policy network’s routing search space is gradually refined, and the policy and detection networks are jointly fine-tuned to optimize the alignment between routing decisions and feature extraction. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that compared to early exiting and stochastic depth methods, MT-DyNN achieves higher accuracy at the same inference cost and reduces the cost by 50% and 59% at comparable accuracy levels.

Then, we develop an event-triggered communication scheme in the control center side, leading to the tolerant controller by virtue of reconstructed tracking error dynamics with an improved transmission efficiency. In addition, we perform the strict theoretical guarantee of both estimation stability and tracking stability, based on which, the estimator and controller gains in conjunction with event trigger parameters are codesigned.

However, this approach faces two limitations when applied to planning for autonomous vehicles: chaotic branch expansion in the belief tree reduces computational efficiency, and particle deprivation hinders the accurate estimation of the dynamic intentions of surrounding vehicles. To this end, an intention-guided Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with a Heuristic-based Double Progressive Widening (POMCP-HDPW) approach is proposed to facilitate efficient decision-making for autonomous vehicles. We propose an enhance resampling method of PF that accounts for the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles, maintaining particle diversity and thereby improving estimation accuracy. Additionally, we prune the action and observation spaces by leveraging human driving experience and collision risk assessment, enabling the expansion and exploration of high-value belief nodes and preventing chaotic expansion. Three different methods are employed to drive the motion of surrounding vehicles, validating the robustness of the proposed model: intelligent driving model control, offline driving using the exiD trajectories, and driver-in-the-loop validation. Notably, experimental results on the exiD dataset demonstrate a success rate of 96.88% in off-ramp scenarios.},

To further improve their intelligence, we propose a collaborative collision avoidance decision-making approach for USVs based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL). Firstly, a collision risk assessment model is established using Closest Point of Approach and Quaternion Ship Domain to guide USVs to take timely and effective collision avoidance actions. Secondly, we adopt Deep Recurrent Q-Network algorithm to overcome the challenges posed by multi-ship scenarios, and the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework is employed in it to accurately establish multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance model. Moreover, to introduce a novel collaborative collision avoidance mechanism for multiple ships, we improved the network update mechanism of DRQN: by synergistically integrating the local Q value of each agent to acquire the multi-agent joint action Q value and the network parameters are subsequently updated based on the calculated global loss. Finally, we designed various experiments in a real water to validate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that this approach has the capacity to enable the ships to make effective collision avoidance actions in accordance with navigation practices and good seamanship. Comparative analysis with Deep Q-Network (DQN), DDQN, Dueling DQN, and Artificial Potential Field underscores the superior safety and rationality of the proposed approach in collision avoidance.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have advanced autonomous driving, but their lack of transparency remains a major obstacle to real-world application. Attribution methods, which aim to explain DNN decisions, offer a potential solution. However, existing methods, primarily designed for image classification models, often suffer from performance degradation and require specialized algorithmic adjustments when applied to the diverse models in autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a universally applicable representation of traffic scenes, forming the basis for our unified attribution method. Specifically, we leverage the first-order Taylor expansion at a specific hidden layer, i.e., the product of gradients and feature maps, to represent abstract traffic scene information. This representation guides both the optimization of attribution path generation and the attribution computation, enabling consistent and effective attributions for both lane-change prediction and vision-based control models. Experiments on two distinct autonomous driving models demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in explanation accuracy and robustness, advancing the interpretability of DNN-based autonomous driving models.},

  abstract     = {Rainy weather presents significant challenges for applications relying on visual perception in intelligent transportation systems. The scarcity of real paired training data complicates single-image rain removal tasks, prompting an increasing interest in unsupervised methods capable of handling real-world rainy images without paired data. At present, most unsupervised rain removal methods are based on the CycleGAN framework; however, the combination of this framework and transformer is not satisfactory owing to most Transformers’ insufficient ability to model real rain features with global inhomogeneous distributions, which prevents them from being fully applicable to unsupervised tasks. This study devised an unsupervised rain removal network based on CycleGAN and the DerainFormer transformer. First, a deformable sparse attention mechanism was developed to improve the Transformer’s suitability for unsupervised tasks in CycleGAN architectures. Subsequently, a two-stage alternating transformer structure was designed to enhance its global non-uniform modeling capabilities for real rain images, In addition, a dual-channel parallel feed-forward network was used to establish the correlation between multiscale rain stripes. Finally, since rain removal is considered a decomposition task, a rain layer unsupervised training method for joint positional contrastive learning was proposed to separate the rain streaks effectively. We conducted several experiments on different real and synthetic rain datasets and the results confirmed that our unsupervised rain removal method performed well. The source code will be released at https://github.com/derainsipl/CycFormer.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, vehicular networks have experienced substantial growth, transforming the landscape of the transportation industry. In particular, the issue of computing task offloading in vehicular networks is critically important. The two key considerations are offloading task delay and energy consumption. Thus, a multiple access (MA) scheme is necessary in vehicular networks to facilitate more efficient computation task offloading. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is recognized as a promising candidate for multiple access in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks due to its potential to improve overall spectrum efficiency through superposition coding. Moreover, mobile edge computing (MEC) can minimize computation task delay and energy consumption by bringing computational resources closer to vehicles. Therefore, this paper examines the potential of employing mobile edge computing (MEC) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in vehicular networks to reduce overall computation offloading task delay and energy consumption. Specifically, computation models for task delay and energy consumption are presented. Additionally, considering universal frequency reuse, we analyze interference-limited scenarios and allow interference from the transmissions of other vehicles and roadside units. The optimization problems for delay and energy are formulated based on the described models. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, they are solved numerically using the Python programming language. Furthermore, analytical expressions for outage probability are provided to evaluate the typical vehicle’s outage performance. Simulation results demonstrate the delay and energy performance of the MEC-NOMA-enabled vehicular networks compared to their OMA-based counterparts. The results indicate that MEC-NOMA achieves lower delay, reduced energy consumption, and improved outage performance compared to OMA-based vehicular networks.},

The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.},

Considering potential faults for virtually coupled trains during operation, a faulty model is developed to capture measurement errors and loss of actuator effectiveness. A fault-tolerant control strategy is designed that consists of two modules, i.e., fault estimation and fault-tolerant control. The MHE method is employed in the fault estimation module to estimate faults by solving a local quadratic optimization problem based on historical data. In the fault-tolerant control module, a reconfigured train tracking control problem is constructed under the MPC framework on the premise of real-time estimation. An accelerated alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is further designed to embed with the fault-tolerant model predictive controller to calculate the control commands in a distributed manner.

However, there is currently no effective non-nominal troposphere monitoring method at both GBAS stations and aircrafts, which increases the integrity risk. This study proposes a novel approach for simultaneously modelling and monitoring ground station and aircraft non-nominal troposphere using precision point positioning (PPP) technology based on a regional reference network. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and meteorological data from the Hong Kong satellite positioning reference station network and numerical weather models from the European centre for medium-range weather forecasts are processed in all the year of 2017. A tropospheric correction (TC) model is used to correct station height-induced biases in zenith total delay (ZTD) obtained from PPP. By comparing the performance of 6 typical spatial interpolation algorithms in tropospheric delay interpolating, the universal Kriging algorithm is found to be the most suitable one which achieves a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.24 mm. The non-nominal troposphere is monitored using the constructed corrected ZTD map using universal Kriging method. A non-nominal troposphere up to 50 mm is observed, which can affect the integrity of the air navigation. Furthermore, the relationship between non-nominal troposphere and the rainfall is investigated. The study integrates widely distributed GNSS and meteorological data into a seamless non-nominal tropospheric monitoring service, enhancing the integrity of GBAS in air transportation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Learning-Enhanced Adaptive Decision-Making (LEAD) framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focusing on dynamic merging scenarios. To capture the competitive and strategic nature of vehicle interactions, we develop an interaction behavior model based on non-cooperative game theory. The behavior is modeled as a dynamic game, where each vehicle optimizes its actions using a multifactorial reward function. To optimize the behavior model parameters, maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is employed to acquire optimal matching parameters. Additionally, a behavioral decision-making framework LEAD adapted to dynamic environments is proposed. By establishing a mapping between environmental variables and behavior model parameters, it enables parameters online learning and recognition, and achieves interactive behavior probabilities of AVs. Quantitative analysis employing naturalistic driving datasets (highD and exiD) and real-vehicle test data validates LEAD’s high consistency with human decision-making. In 188 tested interaction scenarios, the average human-like similarity rate is 81.73%, with a notable 83.12% in the highD dataset. Furthermore, in 145 dynamic interactions, LEAD matches human decisions at 77.12%, with 6913 consistence instances. Moreover, in real-vehicle tests, a 72.73% similarity with 0% safety violations is obtained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our LEAD framework in enabling AVs to make informed, adaptive behavior decisions in interactive environments.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables technology that allows IoV and vehicles to connect everything. IoV has become an essential component of modern life. This exponential growth of IoV technology has introduced significant security and privacy issues, which pose potential threats to different types of attacks and cause different threats to the normal operation of vehicles. To prevent intelligent vehicle accidents and identify malicious attacks within IoV networks, various researchers have focused on machine learning (ML)-based methods to detect attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are a prominent solution for cyber attacks in IoV using ensemble learning. To achieve higher accuracy and detection rate, designing an improved detection framework using ensemble learning is a challenging task. The design of an ensemble-based IDS depends on two main challenges: selecting base classifiers and their combination methods. Therefore, in this study, we propose a hybrid ML model to detect various attacks in IoV. We have used different ML algorithms to develop an enhanced algorithm that can efficiently detect attacks in IoV networks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we have used two well-known datasets, (CIC-IDS2017) and (UNSW-NB15). The proposed algorithm shows outstanding performance from the performance results, with an average attack detection accuracy of 99.75% and 100% and an F1 score of 99.74% and 100%, respectively, for both datasets. Further performance scores, that is, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, validate the exceptional effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Portable, high-precision, low-power road infrastructure is needed to enable real-time communication of collected vehicle data with passing vehicles. Vehicle recognition and speed estimation are key challenges in this context. We propose a traffic detection device using dual-axis magneto-impedance (MI) sensors installed roadside to detect vehicles in adjacent lanes. Experiments were conducted by driving various vehicle types under a variety of complex road and traffic conditions, analyzing how different measurement conditions and driving patterns affect magnetic signatures. We identified the magnetic signatures most strongly correlated with vehicle recognition and speed estimation. We developed corresponding solutions to address issues as repeated misrecognition and the influence of non-adjacent lanes, which are frequently highlighted in related works. Ultimately, we achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 96.66% in random measurements on complex traffic conditions, reducing recognition errors related to these issues to 3.22%. Additionally, we proposed two speed estimation methods: the time-domain magnetic signature differential method and the dominant frequency method, utilizing multiple sensor nodes and a single node, respectively. Both speed estimation methods were analyzed and compared through controlled experiments, and their performance was evaluated in random measurement experiments. Both methods showed similar estimation accuracy on straight roads, with 100% and 98.8% of results falling within a ±5 km/h error range, respectively. In low-speed curved sections where multiple sensor nodes could not be deployed, we achieved speed estimation using a single sensor by analyzing frequency-domain signals. Finally, under complex traffic conditions, the device demonstrated a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of only 2.09 km/h for speed estimation.},

To address this, we propose DGWW (Dual-discriminator GAN-based WaveFusion Watermarking), a novel invisible watermarking method that balances robustness and imperceptibility. The GAN-based approach is well suited for TCPS, as it enables adaptive watermark embedding aligned with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of transportation data, effectively handling diverse noise conditions and data types. DGWW integrates a WaveFusion Encoding Module, a Dual-Focus Discriminator, and a contrastive learning-based optimization strategy to enhance watermark embedding without degrading robustness. These components leverage multi-frequency information, assess local and global impacts on image quality, and guide model optimization. Experimental results show that DGWW outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and robustness under various noise conditions, offering a robust and scalable solution for image watermarking in TCPS environments.

The proposed ARAIM expresses the integrity risk of each hypothesis as the product of the cumulative distribution functions of two Chi-squared distributions and the hypothesis occurrence probability. Based on the equivalence between the normalized solution separation and the residual Chi-square separation, an upper bound in terms of the worst Chi-squared distribution noncentrality parameter induced by GNSS faults is established for the integrity risk of each hypothesis. The log-concavity of the cumulative distribution function of Chi-squared distribution ensures that the protection level computation of the proposed ARAIM is theoretically convergent and conservative.

  abstract     = {Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communication systems are crucial for intelligent transportation applications such as traffic load control, autonomous vehicles, and collision avoidance. Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly understand the realistic V2V channel propagation conditions to develop suitable V2V communication systems and standards. However, due to high costs, most existing V2V studies focus on characterizing the vehicular channel theoretically and comparing it with simulation data or studying the empirical V2V channel in a specific scenario. In this work, we investigate the time variability of the received signal based on experimental data collected in an extensive measurement campaign at 5.9 GHz in a large set of propagation environments: urban-high traffic density, urban-low traffic density, suburban, highway, and rural environments. The time-variability of the received signal is characterized by time and frequency. The relationship between coherence time and the terminal velocity, coherence time and transmitter-receiver separation distance, and the relationship between Doppler spread and both effective velocity and separation distance, have been investigated. Furthermore, the correlation between coherence time and separation distance and effective velocity was investigated, as well as the correlation between Doppler spread and separation distance and effective velocity. The results provide a deeper understanding of the temporal variability of the channel and how it is influenced by factors such as traffic density, unique/multiple driving directions, terminal speed, separation distance, characteristics of the propagation environment, and visibility conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing vehicular communication systems and can be applied to design strategies that reduce temporal variability in received signals.},

  abstract     = {RGB-Thermal semantic segmentation provides reliable support for intelligent traffic perception systems, such as road safety monitoring and autonomous driving perception, by fusing visible and thermal imaging modalities under adverse weather conditions and low-light environments at night. However, the scarcity of multimodal data and the high cost of annotations severely limit the generalization capability of traditional models. To address the core demands of urban scene segmentation, we propose a Hierarchical Matching Guided Feature Enhancement Network (HMFENet) tailored for few-shot learning. It tackles two major challenges: 1) scale diversity of traffic objects (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) under limited labeled data, which significantly degrades segmentation accuracy; 2) information redundancy across multimodal features, which undermines the enhancement effect of the thermal modality on traffic object segmentation. HMFENet employs a hierarchical dense matching mechanism to establish multi-scale and multi-level feature alignment between query images and support samples. Additionally, it incorporates a mutual information minimization constraint to optimize cross-modal complementarity, thereby enhancing segmentation robustness in complex urban scenes. Experiments on the urban scene dataset, Tokyo Multi-Spectral-4i demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results: an improvement of 5.9% and 9.4% in mean mIoU for critical traffic objects under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively, compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the complementary effect of the thermal modality contributes to a 2.5% improvement under the 1-shot setting. The proposed method provides a feasible solution for deploying multimodal traffic perception systems with low annotation costs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Zhou-xy99/HMFENet.},

  abstract     = {In transportation cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring safety and reliability in real-time decision-making is essential for successfully deploying autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation networks. However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU$\dag$ method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate QDCNN’s —key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.},

  abstract     = {The channel characteristics of immersed tunnels play a crucial role in the design and optimization of electronic toll collection (ETC) communication systems in such environments. Due to the lack of channel characteristics for all-metal immersed tunnel environments, this paper conducts an in-depth study on channel measurement, channel modeling, and optimization of ETC systems within all-metal immersed tunnels. Using a channel measurement system based on the universal software radio peripheral (USRP), this study extracts multidimensional channel characteristic parameters from the measured data, such as path loss (PL), shadow fading (SF), K-factor (KF), root mean square delay spread (RMS DS), power angular spectrum (PAS), and azimuth angle spread (ASA). The unique characteristics of the all-metal tunnel are analyzed in comparison to tunnels made of other materials. To develop a comprehensive all-metal immersed tunnel channel model meeting the quasi-deterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) requirements, we employed ray tracing (RT) methods to supplement angle domain parameters. Subsequently, we used this channel model to aid in the design and optimization of ETC systems, addressing transaction failures and erroneous transactions within all-metal immersed tunnels by establishing optimization targets and constraints, resulting in optimal height, tilt angle, transmission power, and beamforming. The findings of this research not only enrich the channel scenarios in QuaDRiGa but also provide practical guidance for improving the performance of ETC systems.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has accelerated the adoption of Cloud and Edge Computing. The advent of sixth-generation mobile communication technology (6G) further facilitates the deployment of Cloud-Edge collaborative computing in large-scale Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Effective ITS must efficiently handle both latency-sensitive tasks (e.g., obstacle detection, traffic signal recognition) and computationally intensive tasks (e.g., path optimization, traffic flow prediction). However, existing Cloud-Edge collaborative frameworks struggle to accurately classify diverse workloads and provide efficient low-latency processing, leading to energy inefficiencies and task failures. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Deep Learning-based Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework (CECF) designed to optimize energy conservation in Cloud and Edge environments. CECF employs a DNN-based classifier to categorize workloads for processing in the Cloud or Edge. The classified tasks are managed by a dedicated Cloud scheduler (DSGA) and an Edge scheduler (EA-DFPSO), respectively. To enhance scheduling efficiency for highly variable Cloud tasks, DSGA incorporates a novel self-adaptive mutation algorithm and a random point fixed distance crossover method. Extensive evaluations using real-world workload traces demonstrate that CECF achieves up to a 8.5% improvement in system reliability and reduces energy consumption by 35.88% compared to baseline approaches.},

While trajectory prediction methods based on deep learning have achieved promising results, these data-driven models lack interpretability and transparency, making their reliable use a significant challenge. In this paper, firstly, an intention-aware spatial-temporal attention network-based trajectory prediction model is constructed, which considers the coupling of driving intention and the interaction with surrounding vehicles, extracts important feature information of vehicles in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Secondly, a vehicle trajectory prediction method via the integration of data-driven and knowledge-guided is proposed, considering both hard and soft constraints. A hard constraint of vehicle kinematics is incorporated into the intention-aware spatial-temporal attention network prediction model to generate physically feasible predicted trajectories and to make this part of the network structure have a human-understandable physical meaning. In addition, by leveraging knowledge related to traffic rules, an auxiliary loss function based on knowledge constraint penalties is designed as a soft constraint to optimize the training of the model and improve the interpretability of the training process. Finally, the proposed model is experimentally evaluated on the datasets and the prediction results are analyzed in terms of reliability and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that knowledge guidance effectively enhance the reliability and interpretability of the prediction, and improve the accuracy of long-term trajectory prediction.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for signal control, and several studies attempt to apply RL to network-wide signal control problems. Most existing methods for network-wide signal controls simply apply the pretrained model independently to the network or simply expand the observation range for the neighbors. While several recent studies have proposed cooperative signal control models using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches, they have not considered the transferability of the policy. This issue becomes more critical in treating a multi-agent signal control problem, since there exist innumerable possibilities of data distributions for the demand patterns. Hence, this research aims to develop a transferable and cooperative multi-agent traffic signal control model. As the key idea, we propose a decentralized and communication-based MARL approach that considers the spatial correlation of traffic dynamics in the model design and employs a graph representation for the state. Three experiments in simulated environments of the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea are conducted to 1) validate the model, 2) assess the policy’s transferability, and 3) evaluate the efficiency of the multi-agent cooperation. The experimental results show that the proposed model obtains a transferable policy so that it adapts to the unexperienced demand scenario. In addition, it is concluded that the joint action of the proposed RL model cooperatively rebalances the traffic demands so that it improves the efficiency of the network-wide signal controls.},

Nonetheless, it is still impeded by sparse bird’s-eye view (BEV) representation and unfavorable temporal context across frames, resulting in a sub-optimal solution to decision-making and vehicle navigation. In this work, we propose a novel Difference-guide Motion Prediction for vision-centric autonomous driving, that is DMP, where it integrates BEV map refinement with spatial-temporal relation modeling in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, a bidirectional view projection strategy is introduced for the complementary BEV feature generation via depth-consistency correction. To promote spatiotemporal context aggregation, we design a difference-guided motion approach by offset approximation to align motion-aware cues between adjacent frames, and a dual-stream pyramid module is further developed for historical information fusion and future instance segmentation during specific durations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes dataset demonstrate that it outperforms the baselines by a remarkable margin and delivers competitive motion prediction across diverse scenarios and range settings, suggesting its effectiveness and superiority.

  abstract     = {In this work, we address the problem of charging coordination between electric trucks and charging stations. The problem arises from the tension between the trucks’ nontrivial charging times and the stations’ limited charging facilities. Our goal is to reduce the trucks’ waiting times at the stations while minimizing individual trucks’ operational costs. We propose a distributed coordination framework that relies on computation and communication between the stations and the trucks, and handles uncertainties in travel times and energy consumption. Within the framework, the stations assign a limited number of charging ports to trucks according to the first-come, first-served rule. In addition, each station constructs a waiting time forecast model based on its historical data and provides its estimated waiting times to trucks upon request. When approaching a station, a truck sends its arrival time and estimated arrival-time windows to the nearby station and the distant stations, respectively. The truck then receives the estimated waiting times from these stations in response, and updates its charging plan accordingly while accounting for travel uncertainties. We performed simulation studies for 1,000 trucks traversing the Swedish road network for 40 days, using realistic traffic data with travel uncertainties. The results show that our method reduces the average waiting time of the trucks by 46.1% compared to offline charging plans computed by the trucks without coordination and update, and by 33.8% compared to the coordination scheme assuming zero waiting times at distant stations.},

This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95%, a collision avoidance rate of 95%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.},

  abstract     = {As the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) within electrified road networks (ERNs) continues to grow, the criticality of fast-charging stations (FCSs) to support this growth and alleviate range anxiety for EV users is increasingly evident. Due to the complex operating environment of FCSs, their reliable, safe operation faces significant challenges, from exposure to natural disasters, deliberate attacks, and technical failures. This leads to the need to analyze the vulnerability of FCSs within ERNs. This paper provides a mathematical framework to assess the vulnerability of the ERN to intentional attacks and identify critical FCSs within ERNs. We propose a System Optimal Dynamic Mixed Traffic Flow Assignment Model (SODTA) game-theoretical for an ERN where electric and fuel vehicles coexist. Building upon this model, an attacker-defender (AD) framework is established for assessing the vulnerability of FCSs within the ERN. We transform this AD problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) one to solve it efficiently. Two indices are proposed to evaluate the vulnerability and the reallocation of charging loads within the ERN. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the ERN in North Carolina, USA. The key findings are as follows: 1) As the EV penetration increases, the studied ERN becomes more vulnerable to attacks. 2) With limited attack resources, mitigating performance losses over time is possible through charging load redistribution. 3) Variation in overall vulnerability levels with increasing attack resources reveals distinct patterns, ranging from mitigable to unmitigable vulnerability.},

This paper presents a two-stage feature extraction process that combines feature selection and mapping; the proposed approach is tailored for the lightweight vehicle-to-everything (V2X) application scenario. Specifically, the selected features are transformed into images via Gramian angular difference field (GADF), Gramian angular summation field (GASF), and Markov transition field (MTF) mappings, as well as feature extraction implemented via a convolutional neural network (CNN). Owing to the advances provided by the proposed scheme, a lightweight feature extraction system achieves satisfactory accuracy levels above 99.10% with fewer sample data and a short training time. The effectiveness and robustness of the developed approach were validated under various driving conditions via 20 IMU sensors, Arduino, and a Raspberry Pi across 20 vehicles. Additionally, tests conducted across different deep learning models demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed preprocessing and mapping methods.},

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation has generated many ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) tasks, which require sufficient communication and computation resources for task offloading and processing. Although mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising solution, its efficiency is subject to the limited knowledge and analysis capability on the physical networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT) empowered MEC framework to strengthen the MEC task offloading efficiency in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks. Our proposed DT is constructed through a hybrid data-driven and model-driven approach to capture the realistic transportation network features. Then, DT leverages the metric of time to collision to predict vehicular safety levels and estimates the corresponding URLLC task requirements of future time slots. The prediction results are further utilized to make decisions on the URLLC resource reservation. Different from conventional studies, we consider the influence of DT’s inaccurate predictions (i.e., the prediction with error) on the resource allocations. Specifically, the inaccurate DT prediction results are considered as uncertain constraints of the resource reservation problem. A robust parameter from the robust optimization is adopted to adjust the tradeoff between the problem uncertainty and solution optimality degree. Further, we leverage the optimized resource reservation results to construct the task offloading problem. The problem is decoupled into two sub-problems of channel resource allocation and computation resource allocation, respectively. And a two-stage matching algorithm is developed to solve each sub-problem based on the resource reservation constraints. Finally, realistic road information is mapped into DT for simulations. Simulation results validate the advantages of our proposed approach by comparing with existing schemes.},

With most research focusing on corrective maintenance, remedial maintenance(such as sealing and patching) optimization is understudied. Oriented toward remedial maintenance, data-driven models often fall short due to difficulty in establishing and implementing the model under complex road conditions, while the experts’ decision lacks consistency amidst multifaceted factors. To address this gap, this paper proposes a fine-grained maintenance decision model that combines data-driven methods with expert knowledge through Reinforcement Learning from Expert Feedback (RLEF). The experts’ experience introduced in decision-making model could improve the engineering application ability of decisions. The research uses a pavement performance prediction model as the environment and applies reinforcement learning to optimize strategies in the decision model. Additionally, the model integrates multidimensional expert feedback into reward functions to better understand ambiguous decision rules. Real-world data validation demonstrates that the RLEF model can adapt to engineering scenarios and applications better as well as achieve superior cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses an optimal elliptical enclosing problem of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) under prescribed constraints, whose objective is to steer UAVs to fulfill accurate target encirclement while complying with arriving time restrictions and minimum efforts. A novel learning-based approximate optimal control policy including two-stage designs is presented. At the first stage, a steady-state robust control protocol is developed to steer UAVs to precisely travel along a predefined elliptical path based on concise filtering. At the second stage, to address specified-time constraints and gain the online optimization ability, a single-critic based enhanced learning rule is explored to generate an approximate optimal regulator that stabilizes error dynamics and minimizes value functions, wherein specified-time constraints can be handled by encoding inequality conditions as skilled barrier functions, and by making full use of historical data and current information, a finite-time learning mechanism driven by weight errors rather than Bellman errors is proposed to approximate the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with faster decaying. The distinct merit is that an improved reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is formulated to prescribe an elliptical circumnavigation with assured time requirements and optimization behaviors, which can greatly outperform non-RL alternatives in maintaining the optimal performance index while exhibiting restriction handling ability via online learning. Lyapunov stability demonstrates that involved error variables are ultimately limited and resultant controller obeys optimality.

  abstract     = {Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) is a fine-grained classification task in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Recent works address VMMR through feature encoding schemes, part-based methods or attention modules. Despite their astounding results, these techniques concentrate on the high-level semantic features. This practice cripples the feature expressive ability of the networks as the granular traits of the vehicle distilled from the early convolution layers are not embedded into the final feature representations. In this work, by contrast, a Cross-Granularity (CG) module which is responsible for the integration of macroscopic and microscopic components is proposed. By incorporating the CG module into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the resultant network i.e. CGNet reinforces the feature extraction ability by amalgamating the feature maps from different scales to render a balanced mix between local contextual information and global semantic details. To validate the proposed framework, experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets. We report competitive performance on web-nature Comprehensive Cars, Stanford Cars, Car-FG3K and surveillance-nature Comprehensive Cars datasets with 98.3%, 95.4% 86.4% and 99.1% accuracies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the CGNet to pinpoint distinctive fine-grained details via the Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique and compare it against the baseline which learns on deep features alone. The generalization ability of the CG module on other CNNs is also examined and the results suggest a high compatibility between the two.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmW) automotive radar imaging technology shows significant promise in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Super-resolution imaging methods can be employed the limited aperture length of automotive radar to improve azimuth (angular) resolution. However, automotive radar images typically exhibit large dynamic range (LDR) and large scene (LS), leading to pay extensive computational complexity and storage demands when striving for higher image quality. To tackle this challenge, a fast lq sparsity-driven imaging method with adaptive-focusing framework (FLSD-AF) for mmWave automotive radar super-resolution imaging in this article. First, in AF framework, a detect-before-imaging (DBI) is proposed to make echo data to adaptive focused on potential target area (PTR), thereby reducing the dimension of the effective data to reduce computational complexity and storage demands. Second, a subspace-phase-compensation (SPC) is proposed to reduces storage demands of the measurement matrix by addressing the imaging model mismatch in near-field under LS. Finally, a fast lq sparsity-driven (FLSD) imaging method is proposed. It employs lq-norm nonconvex penalty function to address the biased problem to improve imaging quality under LDR, meanwhile the computational complexity of the matrix operation is greatly reduced by utilizing joint Kailath-Variant (K-V) formula and Gohberg-Semencul (G-S) factorization. In summary, the proposed FLSD-AF not only substantially enhances the imaging performance, but also significantly diminishes the storage demands and computational complexity under LDR and LS. The results of simulations and experimental data all verify the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With the explosion of connected devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in the smart city, the challenge to meet the demands of urban computing is increasingly prominent. Recent advances in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications promote urban Internet-connected vehicles to become excellent candidates for computing tasks. However, due to the limited computing capacity of vehicles, conducting computation in the vehicular networks themselves is insufficient to satisfy the demands of smart city applications. Edge computing, which delivers computing tasks to edge servers (e.g., base stations, BSs, or roadside units, RSUs) with plenty of computing resources, could be a possible solution. However, the static deployment of edge servers may cause severe load unbalance among servers in both real-time communication and computation, thereby decreasing the system performance. This paper explores a two-hop vehicle-assisted edge computing network framework in which vehicles are able to offload the tasks beyond their capabilities to underloaded edge servers relaying via neighbor vehicles. According to the state of the time-varying vehicular environment and the dynamic traffic loads among RSUs, we formulate the task offloading, relay node selection, and resources allocations problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) aiming at maximizing the performance of the computation offloading capacity with the considerations of load balancing and latency constraints. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a DNN as Q action-value function approximator to solve this problem. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the system performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Hence, we are committed to exploring the use of EVs to achieve spatial and temporal energy supply redistribution via V2G and G2V. We propose a multi-type bidirectional power transfer network and minimize the system cost by determining facility siting and pricing, which can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. In lower-level, a transportation and power coupled network is constructed considering the bidirectional interaction between EVs and the grid. We propose a new user equilibrium to explain the equilibrium state under bidirectional interaction, construct the optimal power flow model under the equilibrium state, use variational inequality to solve the minimum travel cost, and obtain the locational marginal price by solving the Lagrange duality variable of the active power. In upper-level, we propose the government’s construction of multi-type charging facilities siting planning to minimize transportation system cost and facilities operation costs. For experimental analysis, we consider various interactive scenarios of EVs and the grid and use three comparative models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that considering coupled network will effectively reduce the grid load and system cost. Notably, to provide more useful inspiration, we also have made a sensitivity analysis on the change of bidirectional transfer power and service price.},

  abstract     = {Due to the difficulties in data collection or data barriers, some crash types may not have sufficient data for analysis, i.e., data scarcity in task (DST). Furthermore, as in crash severity analysis, the number of serious injury or fatality crashes is usually much smaller than that of property damage or injury crashes, there exists class imbalance issue, i.e., data scarcity in class (DSC). To tackle the DST problem, as common crash severity knowledge may hide among cross-task crashes, cross-task crash severity analysis is proposed. Intuitively, by transferring the common crash severity knowledge from source task which contains sufficient crashes to assist the modelling in target task that suffers from DST problem, more effective target task crash severity model can be obtained. Meanwhile, to address the DSC issue, the cost-sensitive learning algorithm for unbiased modelling is adopted by which unequal cost values are assigned to the crashes with different severity levels. In this paper, we develop a cost-sensitive transfer graph convolutional network, where the advanced graph convolutional network is taken as the base learner to guarantee the effectiveness of crash severity analysis. The vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-vehicle crash severity analysis in city of Seattle are taken as the target and source tasks, respectively. In comparison with eighteen state-of-the-art crash severity models, the proposed model can achieve at least 21.29%, 8.10% and 8.02% improvement in terms of overall summary score, Macro-F1 and Macro-Gmean, respectively. The significant contributing factors analysis also shows that the additional crash contributing factors can be identified, including not only common factors among cross-task data, but also new ground-truth factors of target task crash severity analysis.},

The multi-drone collaborative routing problem is crucial to find a reasonable tour over customers with flexible time-window. A multi-objective mixed-integer programming model is formulated to describe the proposed problem with simultaneously minimizing transportation costs and maximizing customer satisfaction. The model integrates dynamic energy consumption, soft time-windows, and task precedence constraints arising from the single unit capacity of drones. To tackle this problem, an adaptive-large-neighborhood-search based multi-objective algorithm (ALNSMO) is devised. CPLEX is used to verify the accuracy of the model and the quality of the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, numerous experiments and analyses are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and practicability of the proposed mode and ALNSMO.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent reconfigurable surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communications by dynamically controlling the propagation environment. Despite their potential, practical challenges such as effective integration with existing systems and efficient optimization remain critical. This paper investigates the sum capacity enhancement of NOMA-enabled uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in vehicular networks assisted IRS. In urban environments where direct links from UAV to vehicles are often obstructed by buildings or other obstacles, the IRS plays a critical role in improving signal quality by reflecting signals toward vehicles. We consider a downlink NOMA transmission scenario, where the UAV serves multiple ground vehicles, and signals are delivered through both direct and IRS-assisted links. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum capacity by simultaneously optimizing UAV power allocation and IRS passive beamforming while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio requirement for each vehicle. To address the non-convex nature and reduce the complexity of the optimization, we first transform the original problem using the first-order Taylor expansion method. Then, we employ a two-step solution based on the fixed-point iteration method for passive beamforming at the IRS and standard convex optimization for UAV power allocation. The proposed solution is compared with a benchmark scheme with direct UAV-to-vehicle communication without IRS assistance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework converges quickly and significantly outperforms the benchmarks in terms of system capacity.},

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are capable of improving the spectral efficiency and conserving energy of the wireless communications, due to the planar array architecture of which is superior beamforming gain and energy-efficient. In this paper, we study a novel design scheme where a double-RIS-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in vehicular network performs both a single target sensing and multi-user communications synchronously. Specifically, two transmit power budget minimization problems are formulated based on Cram$\acute {\boldsymbol{\mathrm{e}}}$r-Rao bound (CRB)-based framework under the known target location model, and radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-related framework under the uncertain target location model, respectively. For the former, we propose an efficient solver based on alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to obtain high-quality solutions for transmit beamforming and phase shifts. For the latter, an efficient algorithm based on penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) and second order cone programming (SOCP) approaches is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of two proposed algorithms and also show the superiority of our developed schemes over state-of-the-art benchmark ISAC schemes.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a semantic SLAM methodology for autonomous driving, integrating panoramic camera and LiDAR fusion to address pose estimation inaccuracies and lack of semantic information in dynamic environments. On the LiDAR side, panoramic semantic segmentation results are projected onto point clouds and combined with clustering for instance segmentation, classifying points into unknown-motion landmarks, static landmarks, and ground points. Precise pose estimation is then achieved using purely static and semi-static landmarks. The visual component incorporates data augmentation and instance segmentation of front-view images, leveraging SuperPoint for feature extraction. 3D dynamic landmarks are projected onto segmentation results to generate dynamic-static masks, enabling the elimination of feature points within dynamic regions. A robust visual odometry system is implemented through the ORB-SLAM2 tracking framework, enhanced by SuperGlue feature association within a multi-level tracking mechanism. At the fusion level, a decision-layer fusion algorithm integrates both odometry sources. Furthermore, pose optimization is achieved through dual loop closure detection with inputs from both LiDAR and visual sources. The proposed system was validated using the CQU01-CQU04 datasets collected on a UGV, with high-precision GNSS serving as the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves mean of average error of estimated positions, standard deviation of estimated position errors, and position error at the trajectory end of 0.446m, 0.236m, and 0.775m, respectively. With loop closure enabled, the performance metrics showed enhancement to 0.320m, 0.181m, and 0.617m. This research demonstrates that our method improves localization accuracy while constructing semantic map comprising purely static elements.},

  abstract     = {In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle’s trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers’ decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue poses a serious threat to road safety. Although most vehicles are equipped with driver fatigue monitoring models, the performance of existing models is not satisfactory due to the complexity and unclear reliability of fatigue features. To address these issues, this study proposed a multi-layer adaptive driver fatigue monitoring (MADFM) model, based on the steering wheel signals obtained from 25 participants in a driving simulator. The steering wheel signals were sequentially processed through an adaptive window partitioning algorithm based on sample entropy, feature extraction, and an adaptive outlier point removal algorithm based on local outlier factor. Finally, a multi-scale adaptive feature selection (AFS) algorithm based on global-local correlation was applied to obtain the optimal feature set Do. AFS algorithm was then validated using a random forest model and compared with existing feature selection algorithms. The results showed that after adopting the AFS algorithm, the model’s fatigue monitoring accuracy reached 93.71%, which was 10.21% higher than the algorithm without using feature selection. Compared to four common feature selection algorithms, AFS algorithm demonstrated superior performance in terms of monitoring accuracy, precision, recall and interpretability. The interpretability analysis results revealed that steering wheel angle and lateral acceleration features were the most sensitive features affecting the accuracy of the fatigue monitoring model. This model could improve the monitoring performance of driver fatigue, prompting safer driving behaviors, and reducing traffic accidents risk.},

Data quality is crucial to intention prediction under a cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system, whereas the data collection of HDVs relies on the vehicle–infrastructure cooperative perception, which is inevitably exposed to perception errors. In this paper, a robust driving intention prediction framework based on multi-stage learning is proposed in mixed traffic under the vehicle–infrastructure cooperative perception situation. To address this issue, different information sources from vehicles and traffic are considered to derive the implied vehicle dynamic interaction relation and traffic flow context. A feature extraction module is developed to respectively capture the local and global features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for reducing the impact of noise, which ensures the prominent detailed and overall descriptions of driving intention can be comprehensively acquired. Then, the deep multi-scale technique and multi-layer perceptron network are introduced to further extract deep features, and improve the model adaptability by complementary feature learning mechanism and nonlinear mapping ability. Experiment results on a real-world dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in reducing the impact of poor data quality and accurately predicting driving intention.},

Most data-driven vehicle speed prediction is based on deep learning methods, which have poor generalization capabilities when predicting across working conditions. Based on this, this paper proposes a transfer learning method for vehicle speed prediction that improves across working conditions adaptability.

  abstract     = {In current Intelligent Transportation Systems, 4-dimensional (4D) millimeter-wave radar is gradually conquering more important roles. However, the rich multipath phenomena of radar waves can cause virtual images to be mistaken for actual targets. Most existing solutions aim to identify distinguishable features within a single signal frame to differentiate virtual targets from actual ones, but they fail to fully leverage temporal evolution information. Moreover, they are often limited to simple scenarios with low-order bounces and cannot handle extreme high-order bounce cases. To address this gap, in this paper we establish a research methodology based on topology and propagation graph theory, and propose a time-varying 4D trajectory-based physical target discrimination (TPTD) method. This method can handle multipath virtual images formed by arbitrary-order bounces. Its effectiveness and superiority over advanced methods have been qualitatively and quantitatively validated through traceable simulated and measured data. We also discuss in detail the scalability of the algorithm and its potential bottlenecks. The proposed method can be applied to fields such as precise radar sensing and channel modeling, laying the foundation for integrated sensing and communication and autonomous driving.},

The main objective is to calculate an OD matrix based on available sources (e.g. link traffic counts obtained from traffic sensors) to accurately reproduce field data. A significant complication when using information obtained from traffic sensors, is that such sensors are subject to considerable disruptions impacting data quality and reliability. Despite the extensive study of efficient OD estimation, there is a considerable gap in detecting faulty measurements and identifying faulty sensors within the estimation procedure. This work presents a novel methodology for OD matrix estimation in the presence of faulty measurements. The path-based cell transmission model (CTM) is employed to capture traffic network dynamics within a specified time window, linking link densities with per-path densities and path demand. For the purposes of this work, traffic networks that operate under free-flow conditions are considered and the problem is formulated in an optimisation framework with two distinct variations: 1) no explicit formulation of potential faulty sensors and 2) explicit modelling of potential faulty sensors. Following, a fault-adaptive algorithm is constructed that identifies, isolates and corrects faults to achieve robust demand estimation. The methodology is tested on two realistic literature networks and shows great potential in terms of OD matrix estimation in the presence of faulty measurements. Simulation results underpin the advantage of the proposed approach in terms of performance in estimating quantities of interest as well as identifying the faulty sensors and their fault characteristics.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction plays a critical role in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better traffic management and trip planning. Accurate prediction not only aids city managers in optimizing traffic operations but also empowers individuals to make informed travel decisions. However, achieving precise traffic flow predictions is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in traffic data. Recent advancements in Generative AI and deep learning have shown promise in addressing these challenges, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being commonly employed for extracting spatial and temporal features. Despite their effectiveness, CNNs are limited in fully capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies and are computationally intensive when stacked to address global dependencies, leading to slower convergence rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-WaveMLP, a globally aware spatiotemporal network model for traffic flow prediction. Leveraging Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP introduces the repeatable ST-WaveBlock structure, which is based on multilayer perceptron’s (MLPs). Each ST-WaveBlock includes two key modules: The Spatiotemporal Global Attention Component (SGAC), which captures global spatial and local temporal dependencies, and the Spatiotemporal Local Attention Component (SLAC), which captures local spatial and global temporal dependencies. This design ensures strong spatiotemporal representation learning, enabling effective modelling with only 2–4 stacked blocks. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering improved convergence and prediction accuracy. Compared to existing methods, Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP improves prediction accuracy by up to 9.57% and enhances convergence speed by up to 30.6%, making it a robust solution for traffic flow prediction in modern ITS empowered by Generative AI.

  abstract     = {In recent years, vehicular communications have attached great interests in both academy and industry for its potential of promoting safety and autonomous driving. Unlike classical communication scenarios, in vehicular communications the optimal resource allocation must be accomplished in a real-time manner, in order to maximally reduce the response delay. This presents a substantial challenge for current machine learning based intelligent resource optimization methods which may be sample inefficient, especially when the problem space becomes extremely huge. In this study, we develop a fast reinforcement learning (RL) framework for the real-time resource optimization of vehicular communications, whereby the transmitting power and the accessing frequency channels need to be jointly allocated. The main concept of our new method is that it incorporates a sample efficient structured exploration mechanism in the action space, which firstly ignores the local exploitation but focuses on a randomized global exploration. Thus, our exploration-first method, in contrast to classical exploitation-first RL, can reconstruct the coarse-grained global landscape of a huge Q-table from only the few samples. This learned prior knowledge would remarkably accelerate the convergence of subsequent incremental learning process, by concentrating on the identified attentional subspace of the Q-table. As demonstrated by numerical results, our new method would reduce the time complexity or the response delay by around 10 folds. As such, our fast RL method would have the great potential to such challenging optimization problems whereby the acquisition of massive training samples is time demanding, which hence provides the great promise to the emerging vehicular networks.},

To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP), considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework’s computational efficiency, robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared against various baseline models.

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding agents is critically important for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. However, complex environments not only increase the computational cost but also introduce multimodality in the agent’s future motions, presenting significant challenges for motion prediction. Therefore, we propose FSGA, a trajectory prediction framework that constructs a relationship graph between agents and lanes in future spacetime and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to analyze the interactions between these future spacetime agents and lanes. We employ a vectorized representation method to model the traffic scene as a graph. Through this vectorized scene representation, FSGA extracts spatio-temporal features from agents’ historical trajectories, including interactions between agents, and between agents and lanes. To reduce computational costs, a lane scoring mechanism is employed, allowing the model to focus only on the lanes that have a significant impact on the current agent’s motion. To address complexity and multimodality of future trajectories, we introduce a branching tree goal prediction structure that models multiple possible motion trends by representing waypoints and endpoints at different temporal stages. Based on these predicted goals, we construct a relationship graph that captures the associations between agents and lanes in future spacetime and obtains the interactions between agents and lanes, improving trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that FSGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse1.},

  abstract     = {The increasing need for pedestrian tracking within public and commercial domains necessitates innovative solutions that respect privacy concerns. Traditional surveillance methods employing RGB video footage for the monitoring of pedestrian movements have raised significant privacy issues, attributed to their capability to easily identify individuals. This paper shifts focus towards the utilization of 3D point cloud data as a less intrusive alternative for pedestrian monitoring, which inherently minimizes the risk of individual identification. Notwithstanding, traditional tracking methodologies frequently encounter difficulties in environments characterized by high pedestrian density, where occlusions caused by individuals obscuring one another from the sensors’ perspective are commonplace. This research introduces an advanced approach leveraging 3D point cloud data to address the challenges inherent in pedestrian tracking. A particular obstacle addressed is the frequent obstruction caused by pedestrians, who may be accompanied by objects such as baby strollers and/or luggage, thus complicating their detection and tracking when positioned behind others or in close proximity to the sensors. Such scenarios significantly undermine the efficacy of pedestrian segmentation and tracking, particularly in the context of Kalman-Filter-based methodologies. To mitigate these challenges, the proposed solution incorporates a method to spatially enhance the missing segments within the framework of Kalman-Filter-based multi-object tracking. The effectiveness of this approach has been rigorously assessed through the application of 3D point cloud data derived from diverse real-world settings, including laboratory environments, shopping mall entrances, and a densely populated urban area in Kita-ku, Osaka City, during a festival event.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based traffic forecasting is generally realized on the assumption of sufficient data, which could be impractical in the regions without well-deployed mobile sensors or data-processing facilities. Recent studies have developed a solution with the cross-region transfer learning, i.e. transferring traffic knowledge from the source regions to target ones, whose traffic data and computing resources are limited. Nevertheless, relevant issues, including initialization selection and domain adaptation, have not been effectively tackled in the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting. This paper proposes the cluster-granularity spatiotemporal transfer (CGSTT), which transfers the cluster-granularity knowledge from the source region to target one for the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting, as not all source knowledge is positive to the target region. Additionally, the domain adaptation is achieved by the dual alignment consisting of the covariate alignment and label alignment of the source/target data, making the proposed CGSTT adapt to the target region efficiently. The superiority of the proposed method over ten compared baseline methods for both short-term and long-term predictions is demonstrated by the conducted experiments on four tasks, which show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving an 8.89% average improvement in forecasting accuracy. The PyTorch implementation of the CGSTT is available at https://github.com/canyangguo/CGSTT.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Phone Signaling (MPS) data record the daily traces of urban residents, offering a cost-effective means to obtain travel information for urban traffic management and planning at low cost. However, despite the vast amount of data available, there remains a lag in the development of techniques for identifying fine-grained information such as travel modes. On the one hand, the high positioning error and irregular collection frequency make the identification of fine-grained modes challenging. On the other hand, the difficulties in collecting real labeled data limit the training and evaluation of advanced models. In this paper, we present an advanced Travel Mode Identification (TMI) framework and collect real labeled MPS data for evaluation. Specifically, a fast smoothing method is proposed to enhance noise reduction in large-scale trajectories while effectively mitigating positioning errors. We propose novel point-level bus route alignment features for advanced deep-learning models to improve differentiation between motorized modes. Furthermore, a deep learning model with ensembled feature encoding modules is designed to overcome training instability due to limited data amount. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 83.06% in identifying fine-grained travel modes, including walking, riding, bus, car, and metro, with recall rates exceeding 78% for all modes except walking. We analyze the relationship between accuracy and the spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories, revealing a significant impact from the collection frequency, while showing insensitivity to distance gaps and positioning errors. This study demonstrates the potential of MPS for TMI and promotes its application in intelligent transportation systems.},

Consequently, we propose a very simple ray tracing model to analyze the multipath behavior of the channel. We also discuss the stationarity of the channel through the comparison of three state-of-the-art methods. Stationarity time values between 25 ms and 41 ms were obtained for a car moving slightly under the maximum allowed speed of 120 km/h. Taking stationarity into account, we computed the channel wideband parameters. Delay spread values of less than 10 ns were obtained when the link antennas were properly aligned. However, they can jump to more than 100 ns when a line-of-sight (LOS) component is not dominant due to the presence of discrete reflectors.},

Large-scale models have recently attracted considerable attention in advanced autonomous driving applications due to their strong capabilities in information induction the process of extracting meaningful patterns from diverse data sources, analysis, and decision-making. They have demonstrated preliminary support for autonomous driving systems. However, when a vehicle fails to promptly analyze critical information and make effective decisions within constrained time intervals, severe safety incidents may occur. To address this issue, we propose a “Cognitive Tree” framework. This framework employs a tree-like structure to assign weights to various environmental factors, thereby guiding the model to prioritize processing information with higher weights. As a result, the reasoning process becomes more focused on key factors, achieving more real-time and safer decision-making in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates multiple modules that collaboratively consider environmental information across multiple dimensions, including speed, distance, direction, and future trajectories. By assigning distinct weights to different types of information and leveraging the Cognitive Tree framework in conjunction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, our method progressively filters information, ensuring that the model remains centered on critical elements. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that, compared with traditional deep learning models and other large language model-based solutions, our framework achieves approximately a 25% reduction in collision rates.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems are at risk of data misuse. Watermarking data that needs to be opened and shared can mitigate this problem, i.e., embedding signals into generated images, which are imperceptible to humans. Regardless of the shape of the image or any potential attacks it may undergo, the watermark can be detected by algorithms when needed. However, many watermarking schemes fail to resist attacks like cropping and translation, limiting their applicability in the intelligent transportation domain. To tackle these issues, we propose a dual watermarking framework based on Zernike moments for intelligent transportation systems, where a robust watermark and a periodic watermark are embedded in different planes of the cover image. Specifically, we propose a single-circle model (SCM) where Zernike moments are locally computed based on a circle centered at the image center with a radius proportional to image size for embedding the robust watermark. Since SCM is determined by measuring its center and radius, SCM is applicable to images of various sizes and shapes. Then we employ a robust combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) watermarking algorithms to embed the periodic watermark. For watermark extraction, we propose an efficient adaptive correction mechanism (AC) to recognize attack types and automatically relocate the embedding position of the watermark. By combining the above strategies, our proposed scheme can adaptively resist various attacks (e.g., random cropping, translation), which addresses the shortcomings of most existing watermarking schemes. We test the watermark using over 300 images of different sizes and shapes, and the experimental results prove that our proposed scheme achieves stronger robustness against various distortions with better invisibility, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},
