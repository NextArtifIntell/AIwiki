  abstract     = {Recent research has shown it is possible for groups of robots to automatically “bootstrap” their own collective motion behaviors, particularly movement in a group. However, existing work has primarily provided proof of concept in regular, open arenas without obstacles. For practical applications on real robots, multiple collective motion skills are required. This article proposes a novel, multitask deep reinforcement learning algorithm and domain transfer architecture permitting multiple collective motion skills to be bootstrapped automatically and applied to real robots. The proposed approach is tested for tuning two collective motion skills for grouped movement and obstacle avoidance, without requiring a map of the environment. We show that our approach can tune obstacle avoidance parameters while maintaining high-quality swarming collective behavior when an obstacle is detected. Furthermore, learned collective motion skills can be transferred from a point mass simulation onto real mobile robots using our domain transfer architecture, without loss of quality. Transferability is comparable to that of an evolutionary algorithm run in a high-fidelity simulator.},

The proposed control method comprises two main components: the interval type-2 fuzzy control (IT2FC) technique, employing a proportional integral derivative approach, and a supervisory predictive controller. IT2FC sets are considered for a multiarea interconnected power network, followed by the implementation of a supervisory predictive control method for the entire system. It is demonstrated that the SIT2FPC method effectively addresses the challenges within the overall system. By incorporating a predictive controller as a robust supervisory control technique, the proposed method can effectively handle unexpected problems that may arise within the IT2FC units. In order to evaluate the efficiency and validity of the proposed robust SIT2FPC technique, it is applied to address the AGC problem in a four-area interconnected power grid. Also, the IEEE 39-bus power system is considered as a case study to validate the proposed AGC method. The outcomes of six different simulation scenarios clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust control method.},

This article proposes a data-driven docking predictive model that integrates variational mode decomposition (VMD), sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. First, a comprehensive simulation platform for the entire AAR docking system is established to generate reliable data. Then, to address the complex nature of AAR docking signals, VMD decomposes the data into modes with distinct natural frequencies, enhancing input accuracy. SSA optimizes the LSTM parameters, improving prediction accuracy and avoiding local minima. Based on these predictions, a docking safety evaluation network is developed to assess docking safety and prevent failures or collisions. Finally, the performance comparison with other models demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in diverse scenarios.},

The planning algorithm works in multipassages environment containing obstacles with different shapes and dimensions. The shape of the formation is determined optimally to handle nonconvex constraints like obstacle avoidance, intercollision avoidance between agents and allowable range of cable forces for minimal swing motion. The optimization algorithm also considers the response of the system dynamics and ability of controllers in tracking the optimal path and formation shape. Three types of optimization-based path planning methods are presented called simultaneously all waypoints, waypoint by waypoint (WBW), and waypoints in risk.

  abstract     = {Distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems (DHMASs) link geographically dispersed agents through networks, harnessing information technology to foster collaboration. Considering the mainstream status of wireless communication in modern multiagent systems and the differences in the performance of interagent communication devices, we believe that it is appropriate to use directed heterogeneous networks (DHNs) to model distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems. This model not only reflects the directionality of interagent communication but also reflects the complexity of communication due to performance differences, thus providing a more accurate framework for understanding and optimizing system behavior. The study of disintegration in DHNs is vital for enhancing the decision-making agility of DHMAS. We introduce Directed heterogeneous network Attack sequence inference through graph attention MAtrix Generation Embedding and reinforcement learning (DAMAGE), an algorithm that integrates graph neural networks and reinforcement learning within an inductive reasoning framework. DAMAGE is designed to optimize the generation of disintegration strategies, improving the efficiency of network breakdown processes. Our approach includes a directed network embedding technique with a graph attention matrix generation module, which enhances the utilization of imperfect network structure information. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that DAMAGE not only increases the effectiveness of network disintegration under perfect topological conditions but also maintains robustness in scenario with imperfect topological information.},

We propose a standardized workflow leveraging a common representation format based on Chakra Execution Trace, a widely used graph-based representation of distributed machine learning workloads. Such a common representation enables us to view collective communications at the same level as workload operations and decouple producer and consumer tools, enhancing interoperability and reducing engineering effort.

However, significant concerns have been raised over the fairness of such models. While various aspects of algorithmic fairness have been studied, the effect of missing data on fairness remains understudied. This is a significant problem since data in real-world settings is almost never complete, and may often suffer from systemic missingness. This article systematically evaluates how missing data, particularly when correlated with protected classes and outcome variables, affects the fairness of classifiers. Utilizing a comprehensive framework covering various missing data patterns, rates, and mitigation methods, we analyze 150 experimental dataset variants derived from real-world scenarios, and find that missing data correlated with sensitive attributes and outcomes can exacerbate disparities, even for little missingness, making it crucial to address missingness in fairness evaluations.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning techniques achieve promising performance on the circuit annotation task for the hardware assurance of integrated circuits, but are reliant on large amounts of costly, labeled training data. Recently, image synthesis techniques have been explored to mitigate this reliance. However, exiting methods often lack precise pixel-level correspondence between the input image and synthetic image. When applied to IC images, this could lead to inconsistencies in the circuit structures, which then cause changes in circuit connectivity. In this paper, we propose shape consistent image translation (SCIT) to synthesize IC images that have a high pixel-level correspondence with the input images. Our experiments show that a segmentation model trained SCIT-generated images reduces the number of circuit connection errors by 56.26% compared to the second best reported technique. Our proposed SCIT also produced synthetic IC images of the highest image quality when evaluated across three IC image datasets.},

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is widely employed to identify lung nodules. However, the large volume of imaging data it produces creates significant processing challenges for healthcare professionals, leading to diagnostic delays, uncertainty, and increased labor costs. To address these challenges, we propose a federated online learning framework that enables collaboration among multiple hospitals while complying with regulations. Our system includes three filters for lung nodule segmentation: a relabeling data balance filter, a two-stage network filter for segmentation and false positive reduction, and an interactive labeling correction filter. The system improves model robustness and mitigates biases during collaborative training. Tested in three hospitals, our framework preserved data privacy and achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%, outperforming models trained on local data.},

  abstract     = {Building the next-generation wireless systems that could support services such as the metaverse, digital twins (DTs), and holographic teleportation is challenging to achieve exclusively through incremental advances to conventional wireless technologies like metasurfaces or holographic antennas. While the 6G concept of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks promises to overcome some of the limitations of existing wireless technologies, current developments of AI-native wireless systems rely mostly on conventional AI tools such as auto-encoders and off-the-shelf artificial neural networks. However, those tools struggle to manage and cope with the complex, nontrivial scenarios faced in real-world wireless environments and the growing quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements of the aforementioned, emerging wireless use cases. In contrast, in this article, we propose to fundamentally revisit the concept of AI-native wireless systems, equipping them with the common sense necessary to transform them into artificial general intelligence (AGI)-native systems. Our envisioned AGI-native wireless systems acquire common sense by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as reasoning and analogy. These abilities in our proposed AGI-native wireless system are mainly founded on three fundamental components: a perception module, a world model, and an action-planning component. Collectively, these three fundamental components enable the four pillars of common sense that include dealing with unforeseen scenarios through horizontal generalizability, capturing intuitive physics, performing analogical reasoning, and filling in the blanks. Toward developing these components, we start by showing how the perception module can be built through abstracting real-world elements into generalizable representations. These representations are then used to create a world model, founded on principles of causality and hyperdimensional (HD) computing. Specifically, we propose a concrete definition of a world model, viewing it as an HD causal vector space that aligns with the intuitive physics of the real world—a cornerstone of common sense. In addition,we discuss how this proposed world model can enable analogical reasoning and manipulation of the abstract representations. Then, we show how the world model can drive an action-planning feature of the AGI-native network. In particular, we propose an intent-driven and objective-driven planning method that can maneuver the AGI-native network to plan its actions. These planning methods are based on brain-inspired frameworks such as integrated information theory and hierarchical abstractions that play a crucial role in enabling human-like decision-making. Next, we explain how an AGI-native network can be further exploited to enable three use cases related to human users and autonomous agent applications: 1) analogical reasoning for the next-generation DTs; 2) synchronized and resilient experiences for cognitive avatars; and 3) brain-level metaverse experiences exemplified by holographic teleportation. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations to ignite the quest for AGI-native systems. Ultimately, we envision this article as a roadmap for the next generation of wireless systems beyond 6G.},

  abstract     = {Key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation (SE), protection, and fault location) rely on the availability of models to represent the system’s behavior under different operating conditions. Power system models require knowledge of the components’ electrical parameters and the system topology. However, these data may be inaccurate for several reasons (e.g., inaccurate information of components datasheets and/or outdated topological information). The deployment of time synchronization in phasor measurement units (PMUs) and remote terminal units (RTUs) enables the collection of large datasets of synchronized measurements to infer power system models and learn associated power flow constraints. Within this context, this article presents a comprehensive review of measurement-based estimation methods for power flow models using time-synchronized measurements. It begins by exploring advancements in time dissemination technologies and the characterization of uncertainties in PMUs and instrument transformers (ITs), along with their implications for parameter estimation. This article then examines the power system parameter estimation problem, highlighting key techniques and methodologies. In the following, this article focuses on measurement models for state-independent power flow model estimation, including line parameters, admittance matrices, topology, and joint state-parameter estimation. Finally, this article discusses recent approaches for estimating state-dependent power flow models, with particular reference to linearized power flow approximations because of their large use in control applications.},

However, none of the previous works have successfully addressed two fundamental degenerate properties of singularity: nonsmoothness and imperfect inversion. This technical note proposes a prioritized output tracking control method that guarantees the ultimate boundedness and the convergence of higher priority outputs when the input-output feedback linearization becomes nonsmooth and imperfect by singularity. For that purpose, we firstly prioritize the input-output feedback linearization and discuss how two degenerate properties can occur when the system becomes singular. Then, we introduce the differential inclusion to deal with the nonsmooth internal dynamics and establish a condition using the upper Dini derivative for asymptotically stable zero dynamics. Also, we propose a strictly positive realness-based feedback gain design and find a condition related to an M-matrix in order to handle nonlinearities that appear in the imperfect feedback linearization. Finally, we combine these two results and show the ultimate boundedness and the output convergence. Additionally, we provide a motivational example with a planar four-link manipulator to illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed method.},

The states and disturbances are typically estimated with a Kalman filter. The disturbance estimates effectively provide integral control, so the quality of the disturbance model (and resulting filter) directly influences the control performance. We implement eigenvalue constraints to protect against undesirable filter behavior (unstable or marginally stable modes, high-frequency oscillations). Specifically, we consider the class of linear matrix inequality (LMI) regions for eigenvalue constraints. These LMI regions are open sets by default, so we introduce a barrier function method to create tightened, but closed, eigenvalue constraints. To solve the resulting nonlinear semidefinite program, we approximate it as a nonlinear program using a Cholesky factorization method that exploits known sparsity structures of semidefinite optimization variables and matrix inequalities. The algorithm is applied to real-world data taken from two physical systems: a low-cost benchmark temperature microcontroller suitable for classroom laboratories, and an industrial-scale chemical reactor at Eastman Chemical&#39;s plant in Kingsport, TN.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers distributed online convex optimization with time-varying constraints. In this setting, a network of agents makes decisions at each round, and then only a portion of the loss function and a coordinate block of the constraint function are privately revealed to each agent. The loss and constraint functions are convex and can vary arbitrarily across rounds. The agents collaborate to minimize static network regret and network cumulative constraint violation. A novel distributed online algorithm with a vanishing stepsize is proposed and it achieves an $\mathcal {O}(T^{\max \lbrace c,1-c\rbrace })$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c/2})$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds and $c\in (0,1)$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter. When Slater&#39;s condition holds (i.e, there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(T^{1-c})$. Moreover, if the loss functions are strongly convex, then static network regret bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$, and the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{\log (T)T})$ and $\mathcal {O}(\log (T))$ without and with Slater&#39;s condition, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to achieve tighter (network) cumulative constraint violation bounds for (distributed) online convex optimization with time-varying constraints under Slater&#39;s condition.

Our motivation is distance protection in inverter-dominated power systems, wherein small fault currents can go undetected by traditional schemes. We focus on static systems because distance protection is based on phasors. We formulate a general auxiliary signal design problem with constraints imposed by system operational requirements, and additive and multiplicative noise. We use a relaxation and duality to reformulate the problem as a semidefinite bilinear program. In the special case of additive uncertainty and no constraints, we obtain an analytical lower bound on the magnitude an auxiliary signal must have to guarantee detection.

Unfortunately, adaptive identification based on both saturated observations and the $\ell _{1}$-optimization turns out to be a challenging nonlinear problem, and has rarely been explored in the literature. Motivated by this and the need to fit with the $\ell _{1}$-based index of prediction accuracy in, e.g., judicial sentencing prediction problems, we propose a two-step weighted $\ell _{1}$-based adaptive identification algorithm. Under certain excitation conditions much weaker than the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition, we will establish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and the adaptive predictors. It is worth noting that our results do not rely on the widely used independent and identically distributed (iid) assumptions on the system signals, and thus do not exclude applications to feedback control systems. We will demonstrate the advantages of our proposed new adaptive algorithm over the existing $\ell _{2}$-based ones, through both a numerical example and a real-data-based sentencing prediction problem.},

  abstract     = {For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands—more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing “regular” ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^{2}$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.},

  abstract     = {The objective of this paper is to derive the essential invariance and contraction properties for the geometric periodic systems, which can be formulated as a category of differential inclusions, and primarily rendered in the phase coordinate, or the cycle coordinate. First, we introduce the geometric averaging method for this category of systems, and also analyze the accuracy of its averaging approximation. Specifically, we delve into the details of the geometrically periodic system through the tunnel of considering the convergence between the system and its geometrically averaging approximation. Under different corresponding conditions, the approximation on infinite time intervals can achieve certain accuracies, such that one can use the stability result of either the original system or the averaging system to deduce the stability of the other. After that, we employ the graphical stability to investigate the “pattern stability” with respect to the phase-based system. Finally, by virtue of the contraction analysis on the Finsler manifold, the idea of accentuating the periodic pattern incremental stability and convergence is nurtured in the phase-based differential inclusion system, and comes to its preliminary fruition in application to biomimetic mechanic robot control problem.},

However, real-world scenarios often involve the presence of noise due to factors such as additive white Gaussian noise channels or probabilistic quantization of transmitted data. These sources of noise have the potential to degrade the performance of decentralized optimization algorithms if not effectively addressed. In this paper, we focus on the noisy communication setting and propose an algorithm that bridges the performance gap caused by communication noise while also mitigating other challenges like data heterogeneity. We establish theoretical results of the proposed algorithm that quantify the effect of communication noise and gradient noise on the performance of the algorithm. Notably, our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate for minimizing strongly convex, smooth functions in the context of inexact communication and stochastic gradients. Finally, we illustrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared to its state-of-the-art counterparts on machine learning problems using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.},

Distinguishing from existing studies, this paper aims to explore how to reach opinion consensus on leader-follower signed social networks with both trust and distrust relationships among agents. With the help of theoretical tools including binary relation composition and products of nonnegative matrices, the inequality constraints for trust and distrust degrees are established, which ensures that trust relationships can counteract the negative effects of distrust relationships on opinion consensus. In addition, further analysis is conducted on the factors that affect the convergence rate of opinion consensus, including the longest positive distance from leader to the followers as well as the upper bound of communication delays. At last, numerical examples are provided to validate the results.},

  abstract     = {To stabilize PDE models, control laws typically require space-dependent functional gains mapped by nonlinear operators from the PDE functional coefficients. When a PDE is nonlinear and its “pseudo-coefficient” functions are state-dependent, a gain-scheduling (GS) nonlinear design is the simplest approach to the design of nonlinear feedback. The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains obtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE computations in real time may be prohibitive. The recently introduced neural operators (NO) can be trained to produce the gain functions, rapidly in real time, for each state value, without requiring a PDE solution. In this paper we introduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that the state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even for ODEs. We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear recirculation using both a “fullkernel” approach and the “gain-only” approach to gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization and demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE gain-scheduling. The code for the numerical implementation is available on Github [23]. This work was the subject of the 2023 Bode Prize Lecture by the last coauthor.},

This work focuses on developing stability-guaranteed control methods for MASs with limited data rates. Initially, a distributed optimization algorithm with dynamic quantization is considered for solving the DMPC problem. Due to the limited data rate, the optimization process suffers from inexact iterations caused by quantization noise and premature termination, leading to suboptimal solutions. In response, we propose a novel real-time DMPC framework with a quantization refinement scheme that updates the quantization parameters on-line so that both the quantization noise and the optimization suboptimality decrease asymptotically. To facilitate the stability analysis, we treat the suboptimally controlled MAS, the quantization refinement scheme, and the optimization process as three interconnected subsystems. The cyclic-small-gain theorem is used to derive sufficient conditions on the quantization parameters for guaranteeing the stability of the system under a limited data rate. Finally, the proposed algorithm and theoretical findings are demonstrated in a multi-AUV formation control example.},

Moreover, the full state of the plant is available for feedback. A multiple model online identification scheme for the plant&#39;s state and input matrices is developed that guarantees the estimated parameters converge to the underlying plant model under the assumption of persistence of excitation. Using an exact matching condition, the parameter estimates are used in a control law such that the plant&#39;s states asymptotically track the reference signal generated by a state-space reference model. The control architecture is proven to provide boundedness of all closed-loop signals and to asymptotically drive the state tracking error to zero. Numerical simulations illustrate the stability and efficacy of the proposed MMRAC scheme, even in the presence of noise.

We first show how to formulate the collaborative STL tasks as assume-guarantee contracts by leveraging the idea of prescribed performance control. The concept of contracts is used to establish our compositionality result, which allows us to guarantee the satisfaction of a global contract by the multi-agent system when all agents satisfy their local contracts. Then, a closed-form continuous-time feedback controller is designed to enforce local contracts over the agents in a distributed manner, which further guarantees global task satisfaction based on the compositionality result.

In order to avoid any unwanted behavior during the learning phase, a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller is employed, which ensures satisfaction of constraints and input-to-state stability of the closed-loop states. In addition, the proposed approach guarantees the convergence of states to the origin under certain conditions. To make the algorithm implementable online, a dual-timescale adaptation mechanism is utilized, where the weights of the output layer of the neural network are updated each time instant using a weight update law, while the inner layers are repeatedly trained in self-supervised manner by using the adaptive actions as labels for the training.

Our approach is based on that of the so-called mean subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm with a special emphasis on its use in agents capable to communicate with multi-hop neighbors. The MSR algorithm provides an effective technique for agents to achieve resilient consensus if the multi-agent network satisfies certain connectivity requirements. Our analysis highlights that for maintaining the same level of resilience against adversarial nodes, such network connectivity requirements can be relaxed by increasing the number of relay hops. In particular, we characterize tight network structures for our algorithm to succeed and propose a novel notion of graph robustness with multi-hop communication. Moreover, we analyze the multi-hop W-MSR algorithm with delays in communication since messages from multi-hop neighbors may require different numbers of time steps for their transmissions.

  abstract     = {Attack design is indispensable for analyzing potential risks of networked control systems (NCSs). However, the remote control center is usually well protected and its knowledge is difficult to be disclosed, which becomes a major obstacle in developing stealthy false data injection (FDI) attack scheme because only partial system knowledge (i.e., the system matrices of the physical plant) could be used. To meet this challenge, a novel stealthy FDI attack scheme against the sensor measurement is proposed by employing the normal and compromised self-governed filters held by malicious attackers, where the normal one is adopted to estimate the system state and the compromised one is used as the virtual attacked target. The corresponding attack strategy is obtained by maximizing the estimation error of the compromised self-governed filter. Then, the residual of the compromised system is derived to prove attack stealthiness. Next, it is derived and found that the attack impact on system estimation performance is the same as that based on full system knowledge. Furthermore, the divergence condition of NCSs under the attack is presented. Finally, all the theoretical analyses are verified by simulation results.},

  abstract     = {We establish that stabilization of a class of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large (nevertheless finite) number of components, can be achieved via employment of a backstepping-based control law, which is constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (i.e., as the number of components tends to infinity) of the PDE system. This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.},

Fundamental limits in literature are only valid for modified algebraic Riccati equations (MAREs), which are special cases of GAREs. The purpose of this paper is to derive new information on $vm$. Main results are as follows: (i) The variance margin of a control is established in direct and analytical ways and a new characterization of $vm$ is proposed via the solution to a spectral optimization problem. (ii) New analytical bounds of $vm$ are established. (iii) $vm$ is completely determined by the optimal cost of a standard homogeneous linear quadratic regulation problem with a specified initial state if the systems have no state dependent noise and have a single input. If additionally, certain eigenvalue and controllability conditions are satisfied, an analytical expression of $vm$ is available.},

  abstract     = {Feedforward control demonstrates the capacity of precision tracking in applications, typically necessitating the solution of the inverse model. For non-minimum phase systems with unstable internal dynamics, the inverse model yields unbounded inputs, impeding the implementation of the feedforward control method. Existing stable inversion leverages non-causal input and initial state transition to achieve exact tracking with an infinite time preview of the output. However, a limited preview window results in tracking errors, and the existence of the optimal transition relies on the invertibility of the Grammian matrix. Recently, a novel stable inversion based on lifting time systems has been introduced. It enables finite-time precision tracking without an infinite preview window and exhibits significant application potential, though confined to linear time-invariant systems. From the perspective of the lifted system, this paper addresses the stable inversion problem in finite time for multivariate linear periodic time-varying systems leveraging the equivalence between the linear periodic time-varying system and its lifted system. Simulation is designed to validate the effectiveness of the results.},

However, safety-critical applications are still a challenge due to lack of safety guarantees during exploration and subsequent deployment. The learning problem becomes even more difficult for complex tasks with temporal and logical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a modular deep RL architecture as a control framework to satisfy complex tasks specified using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). To enhance safety, we propose a safe “shield” to constrain RL actions within a safe set. In turn, a challenge with this strategy is that the safe filter can restrict RL exploration during training. To address this limitation, we have developed an innovative safe guiding process by integrating the properties of LTL automata with perturbations of the safe “shield”. This innovation is verified to maintain the original optimality of LTL satisfaction and enhances exploration efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves near-perfect success rates and safety guarding with a high level of confidence during the training.

To enable the players to make self-beneficial decisions in such a dynamic environment, it is assumed that the players can locally store and exchange the historical action information. Based on the stored information, a distributed strategy is established, in which each player updates its action by a dual averaging method. In order to prevent excessive storage requirements, a storage mechanism is designed so that only the information generated from a certain historical time horizon is retained. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated by the static regret, which quantifies player&#39;s loss between the actual cost and the cost with the fixed best response during its active period. It is shown that the upper bound of each player&#39;s static regret grows sub-linearly under local diminishing step-sizes, indicating that the proposed strategy performs as well as choosing the best stationary action in hindsight for the long-term players. Finally, a simulation study on energy consumption games is given to verify the effectiveness of the developed methods.},

Although the duality between controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.},

However, as the quantity of nodes in a network expands, existing investigations encounter difficulties in obtaining solutions within finite computation times due to computational complexity. For coping with this scenario, a novel event-triggered pinning quasi-synchronization approach is explored in this research for a category of switched directed networks (SDNs) with sampling measurements. By developing a time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and implementing a state-dependent switching strategy utilizing sampling measurements, sufficient conditions are formulated to assure that the synchronization errors are ultimately bounded in an exponential fashion. Different from previous relevant findings, the verification of matrix conditions in the derived synchronization criterion no longer depends on the number of nodes in networks, making it more suitable for large-scale SDNs. Ultimately, two simulation examples are incorporated to elucidate the applicability of the newly crafted synchronization methodology.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of finite horizon constrained robust optimal control for nonlinear systems subject to norm-bounded disturbances. To this end, the underlying uncertain nonlinear system is decomposed based on a first-order Taylor series expansion into a nominal system and an error (deviation) described as an uncertain linear time-varying system. This decomposition allows us to leverage system level synthesis to jointly optimize an affine error feedback, a nominal nonlinear trajectory, and, most importantly, a dynamic linearization error over-bound used to ensure robust constraint satisfaction for the nonlinear system. The proposed approach thereby results in less conservative planning compared with state-of-the-art techniques. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach to control the rotational motion of a rigid body subject to state and input constraints.},

  abstract     = {Fundamental limitations or performance trade-offs/limits are important properties and constraints of both control and filtering systems. Among various trade-off metrics, total information rate that characterizes the sensitivity trade-offs and time-averaged performance of control and filtering systems was conventionally studied by using the differential entropy rate and Kolmogorov-Bode formula. In this paper, by extending the famous I-MMSE (mutual information – minimum mean-square error) relationships to the discrete-time additive white Gaussian channels with and without feedback, a new paradigm is introduced to estimate and analyze total information rate as a control and filtering trade-off metric. Under this framework, we explore the trade-off properties of total information rate for a variety of the discrete-time control and filtering systems, e.g., LTI, LTV, and nonlinear, and propose an alternative approach to investigate total information rate via optimal estimation.},

Furthermore, an ADMM algorithm is designed to solve the $\ell _{0}$ optimization problem, and a subsequence convergence result is proved under reasonable assumptions.

From the viewpoint of attackers, the attack design strategy against aperiodic sampled-data control systems is proposed. The strategy ensures that the detection signal at sampling instants consistently remains zero, allowing the designed zero-dynamics attack to achieve stealthiness. From the perspective of defenders, asynchronous sampling-and-holding countermeasure by introducing time-gap is presented. This countermeasure effectively disrupts the stealthiness of zero-dynamics attack, realizing the attack detection and enhancing the system security. It is demonstrated that for each sampling interval, there is at least one time-gap caused by asynchronous sampling-and-holding that allows attack signal to be detected. Finally, the automatic voltage regulator system and the inverted pendulum system are taken to verify the stealthiness of the attack design strategy and the effectiveness of the asynchronous-based countermeasure.},

In particular, many works require to restrict the class of LTI systems to those satisfying the relation $p\ell =n$. In this note, we show how to address the general MIMO case (for which $p\ell \geq n$ in general) by constructing an alternative non-minimal state vector from data. Different from the existing literature, our method guarantees the satisfaction of certain rank conditions when the system is persistently excited, thereby facilitating the direct data-driven dynamic output-feedback control of MIMO systems by applying methods that were originally developed for the input-state data setting.},

This suggests the emergence of bifurcations in population games admitting multiple strict Nash equilibria, as observed in numerous examples. We then characterize a novel class of monotone separable population games for which globally asymptotically stable logit equilibria are proved to exist for every noise level. The considered class of monotone separable games finds applications, e.g., in routing games on series compositions of networks with parallel routes when there are multiple populations of users that differ in the reward function.},

Both algorithms invoke random reshuffling (RR) update for each agent, inherit favorable characteristics of RR for minimizing smooth nonconvex objective functions, and improve the performance of previous distributed random reshuffling methods both theoretically and empirically. Specifically, both GT-RR and ED-RR achieve the convergence rate of $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)^{1/3}m^{1/3}T^{2/3}])$ in driving the (minimum) expected squared norm of the gradient to zero, where $T$ denotes the number of epochs, $m$ is the sample size for each agent, and $(1-\lambda)$ represents the spectral gap of the mixing matrix. When the objective functions further satisfy the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we show GT-RR and ED-RR both achieve $\mathcal {O}(1/[(1-\lambda)mT^{2}])$ convergence rate in terms of the averaged expected differences between the agents&#39; function values and the global minimum value. Notably, both results are comparable to the convergence rates of centralized RR methods (up to constant factors depending on the network topology) and outperform those of previous distributed random reshuffling algorithms.},

Second, we map the expansion points to the constraint boundary and propose the second method, which minimizes the loss to the greatest extent, referred to as weak loss convexification. Both methods are incorporated into a suboptimal MPC framework, guaranteeing recursive feasibility and stability, even when SCP is stopped early.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a sliding-mode controller design for safety against DoS attacks in networked switched systems. Firstly, we analyze the impact of the time delays induced by signal quantization and DoS attacks on the switching signals, control laws, and measurement data. We then design an integral sliding surface associated with the switching modes such that, when system uncertainties, disturbances, and the frequency and duration of DoS attacks are suitably bounded, input-to-state practical stability is guaranteed. Moreover, a reaching law is designed such that the trajectories of the networked switched system reach the sliding surface in finite time. The practicality and applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with numerical simulations on a networked continuous stirred tank reactor system.},

A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties especially in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. These two-part articles finish programming a nonlinear fully connected neural network (FCNN) with a three-layer structure using BCRNs endowed with mass action kinetics. In part I, we divide the FCNN into Assignment, Feedforward propagation, Judgment, Learning, and Clear-out modules. Each module is programmed using BCRNs by setting species concentrations to carry information related to all kinds of computations and operations, with the equilibria of some species to represent the computation results and information processing results. The newly formed biochemical neural network exhibits the potential to work independently in vivo. Additionally, our construction addresses a critical design gap by integrating two essential modules: the biochemical assignment module that enables iterative input of training samples, and the biochemical judgment module responsible for determining the termination of the training process. We further confirm theoretically that the BCRN system achieves FCNN functionality with exponential convergence to all target computational results. Finally, the performance of this construction is evaluated numerically on binary classification problems.},

We use a modified SIRS model to track how the epidemic progresses in response to the agents&#39; strategic choices. By employing perturbed best response evolutionary dynamics to model the population&#39;s strategic behavior, we extend previous related work so as to allow for noise in the agents&#39; perceptions of the rewards and intrinsic costs of the available strategies. Central to our approach is the use of system-theoretic methods and passivity concepts to obtain a Lyapunov function, ensuring the global asymptotic stability of an endemic equilibrium with minimized infection prevalence under budget constraints. We leverage the Lyapunov function to analyze how the epidemic&#39;s spread rate is influenced by the time scale of the payoff mechanism&#39;s dynamics. Additionally, we derive anytime upper bounds on both the infectious fraction of the population and the instantaneous cost a social planner must incur to control the spread, allowing us to quantify the trade-off between peak infection prevalence and the corresponding cost.

Based on that, when the decay rate parameters for Lyapunov functions are known, the reachable set bounding region can be determined by solving vertex constraints in linear matrix inequality (LMI) forms. In cases where the decay rates are unknown, a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm and a Boundary Intersection (BI) algorithm are proposed to provide a tractable solution for parameter searching, and to achieve lower conservatism in the reachable set bounding regions. The effectiveness of our polynomial-based approach is illustrated through simulations using a single-mesh gear system. Moreover, the efficiency of the two algorithms can be assessed by contrasting the conservatism reduced in measurements of bounding regions.},

To this end, this paper presents a novel symbiotic control framework that offers the strengths of fixed-gain control and adaptive learning architectures. Specifically, this framework synergistically integrates these architectures to mitigate the effects of uncertainties in a more predictable manner as compared to adaptive learning alone and it does not require any knowledge on such uncertainties. Both parametric and nonparametric uncertainties are considered, where we utilize neural networks to approximate the unknown uncertainty basis for the latter case. Counterintuitively, the proposed framework has the ability to achieve a desired level of closed-loop system behavior even with an insufficient number of neurons (e.g., when the neural network approximation error is large) or in the face of injudiciously selected adaptive learning parameters (e.g., high leakage term parameters).},

  abstract     = {The successive convex approximation (SCA) methods stand out as the viable option for nonlinear optimization-based control, as it effectively addresses the challenges posed by nonlinear (potentially non-convex) optimization problems by transforming them into a sequence of strongly convex subproblems. However, the current SCA algorithm exhibits a slow convergence rate, resulting in a relatively poor performance within a limited sample time. In this paper, the process of SCA is retreated as solving a fixed point nonlinear equation. By analyzing the derivative properties of this nonlinear equation, we introduce a Newton-based accelerated SCA (ASCA) algorithm designed to enhance the local convergence rate while inheriting all favorable characteristics of the SCA methods. Specifically, our algorithm offers the following benefits: (i) It is capable of effectively tackling nonlinear optimization-based control problems; (ii) It permits flexible termination with all generated intermediate solutions being feasible for the original nonlinear problem; and (iii) It guarantees convergence with locally superlinear convergence rate to the stationary point of the original nonlinear problem. Finally, we conduct experiments in a multi-agent collision avoidance scenario to show its validity.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the multi-group consensus problem with signed networks, where a set of agents with positive-weight edges is treated as a group, and the edges among groups are negative weights. Based on group homomorphism theory, each group can be mapped as a virtual node, called the group representative node. Consequently, the signed networks can be represented by the homomorphic mapping graph with only negative weight edges. The definition of structural balance has been extended, eliminating the requirement for a structurally balanced network to have an even number of negative edges. As a result, a signed network with negative cycles is also considered structurally balanced. Then, multi-group symmetry consensus conditions are derived based on the characteristics of the Laplacian matrix associated with the homomorphic mapping graph. It can be concluded that average consensus and bipartite consensus are special cases of multi-group symmetric consensus. Each group in the signed networks is assigned different consensus parameters, thereby achieving asymmetric consensus, which together with symmetric consensus forms multi-group consensus control.},

  abstract     = {Signal temporal logic (STL) is a powerful formalism for specifying various temporal properties in dynamical systems. However, existing methods, such as mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming, often struggle to efficiently solve control problems with complex, long-horizon STL specifications. This study introduces STLCCP, a novel convex optimization-based framework that leverages key structural properties of STL: monotonicity of the robustness function, its hierarchical tree structure, and correspondence between convexity/concavity in optimizations and conjunctiveness/disjunctiveness in specifications. The framework begins with a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, transforming the problem into an equivalent difference of convex (DC) programs. This is then solved sequentially as a convex quadratic program using an improved version of the convex-concave procedure (CCP). To further enhance efficiency, we develop a smooth approximation of the robustness function using a function termed the mellowmin function, specifically tailored to the proposed framework. Numerical experiments on motion planning benchmarks demonstrate that STLCCP can efficiently handle complex scenarios over long horizons, outperforming existing methods.},

Then, the stability of the switched linear system is analyzed theoretically. The exponential stability of one single subsystem is shown with the existence of the artificial perturbation in the actual control input. We also elucidate the uniformly bounded growth of the system trajectory over the switching interval.

  abstract = {Machine learning models for speech emotion recognition (SER) can be trained for different tasks and are usually evaluated based on a few available datasets per task. Tasks could include arousal, valence, dominance, emotional categories, or tone of voice. Those models are mainly evaluated in terms of correlation or recall, and always show some errors in their predictions. The errors manifest themselves in model behaviour, which can be very different along different dimensions even if the same recall or correlation is achieved by the model. This paper introduces a testing framework to investigate behaviour of speech emotion recognition models, by requiring different metrics to reach a certain threshold in order to pass a test. The test metrics can be grouped in terms of correctness, fairness, and robustness. It also provides a method for automatically specifying test thresholds for fairness tests, based on the datasets used, and recommendations on how to select the remaining test thresholds. We evaluated a xLSTM-based and nine transformer-based acoustic foundation models against a convolutional baseline model, testing their performance on arousal, valence, dominance, and emotional category classification. The test results highlight, that models with high correlation or recall might rely on shortcuts – such as text sentiment –, and differ in terms of fairness.},

Recent investigations demonstrated that the robot&#39;s inner speech improves people&#39;s trust and brings the robot closer to human cognition. Through inner speech, the robot overtly talks to itself and reasons about the context and inner processes. Based on Damasio&#39;s theory, emotions emerge from implementing the dynamic interplay between bodily sensations and emotional cognitive processes. Integrating such a theory with self-talking capability and deploying the resulting model on a real robot makes such a robot able to experience emotions. Experiments demonstrate that people interacting with robots equipped with the proposed model recognise the robot&#39;s emotional experiences, supporting a more empathetic and emotionally connected relationship.},

Currently, the detection of stress severity relies on self-assessment scales, while machine learning or deep learning-based approaches primarily focus on classification. This study proposes an approach using pulse signals containing emotional cues and deep learning to automatically detect the severity of stress in college students. Firstly, pulse signals of 177 college students were collected using photoplethysmography (PPG) during they watched five virtual reality (VR) emotional scenes, including calm, sadness, happiness, fear, and tension. Pulse rate variability (PRV) and discrete PPG (dPPG) were extracted from these signals as input for detecting stress severity. Then, the proposed stress detection framework, 1DCNN-BiLSTM + Cross-Attention + XGBoost, was employed to detect stress severity, incorporating an emotional Cross-Attention mechanism. The impact of induced emotions on stress severity detection performance was examined. The results indicated that stress severity detection in emotional scenes outperformed in calm. Furthermore, the detection performance that integrates multiple emotions surpassed single emotions. The fusion of PRV and dPPG signals yielded the best detection performance. This study provides an end-to-end automated approach for detecting stress severity in college students.},

However, a quantitative measure of the perceived sense of control (SoC) in interacting with artificial systems is still an unmet need. This work introduces a ground-breaking approach that will profoundly impact the way of evaluating the SoC in human-robot interaction. We investigated the human behaviour during human-robot interactions by examining the Hand Blink Reflex (HBR). The HBR is an innate defensive reflex elicited by the electrical stimulation of the median nerve and can be measured using EMG recordings from the orbicularis oculi muscles. We recorded HBR in twenty subjects during different experimental conditions considering a robotic arm entering the defensive peripersonal space (DPPS) at near or far proximities to the face and under different control modalities: autonomous robot movement, human control limited to starting or stopping the robot, and human fully controlling the speed of the robot. According to predictions, the HBR amplitude is modulated by the proximity of the robotic arm to the DPPS. Crucially, the more the human confidence in the robot control, the lower the HBR amplitude. This novel method quantifies human confidence in robot control, potentially advancing human-robot collaboration by enhancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying perceived control and safety in shared workspaces. Results can be further exploited for comparing the effectiveness of robot control interfaces and algorithms},

However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty, we adopt stochastic embedding sourced from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. It helps capture the probabilities of emotions and facilitates diverse inferences. Additionally, we adaptively assign uncertainty-sensitive scores as the fusion weights for individuals&#39; faces within a group. Moreover, we developed an image enhancement module to evaluate and filter samples, strengthening the model&#39;s data-level robustness against uncertainties. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene components, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.},

Autonomic dynamics have been hypothesized to be involved in perceptual awareness and establishment and maintenance of the sense of a bodily self at a neural level. We hypothesized that the autonomic activity measured from cardiac dynamics could differentiate between social touch and self-touch. In our study, we used a newly developed method to analyze the temporal dynamics of cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic activities during an ecologically valid affective touch experiment. We revealed that different types of touch conditions-social-touch, self-touch, and a control object-touch-resulted in a decrease in sympathetic activity. This decrease was more pronounced during social touch, as compared to the other conditions. Moreover, we quantified an increase in parasympathetic activity specifically during social touch, further distinguishing it from self-touch. Importantly, by combining the sympathetic and parasympathetic indices, we successfully differentiated social touch from the other experimental conditions, indicating that social touch exhibited the most substantial changes in cardiac autonomic indices. These findings may have important clinical implications as they provide insights into the neurophysiology of touch, relevant for aberrant affective touch processing in specific psychiatric disorders and for the comprehension of nociceptive touch.},

  abstract = {Because of the ambiguous and subjective property of the facial expression, the label noise is widely existing in the FER dataset. For this problem, in the training phase, current methods often directly predict whether the label is noised or not, aiming to reduce the contribution of the noised data. However, we argue that this kind of method suffers from the low reliability of such noise data decision operation. It makes that some mistakenly abounded clean data are not utilized sufficiently and some mistakenly kept noised data disturbing the model learning. In this paper, we propose a more reliable noise-label suppression method called ReSup. First, instead of directly predicting noised or not, ReSup makes the noise data decision by modeling the distribution of noise and clean labels simultaneously according to the disagreement between the prediction and the target. Specifically, to achieve optimal distribution modeling, ReSup models the similarity distribution of all samples. To further enhance the reliability of our noise decision results, ReSup uses two networks to jointly achieve noise suppression. Specifically, ReSup utilize the property that two networks are less likely to make the same mistakes, making two networks swap decisions and tending to trust decisions with high agreement. Extensive experiments on popular datasets shows the effectiveness of ReSup.},

  abstract = {With the increasing use of interactive applications, the importance of Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) is growing. Current research in the ERC domain mainly emphasizes the extraction of contextual information. However, challenges arise due to multi-turn conversation scenarios and the natural transformation of emotions, particularly in identifying subtle emotion transfers. Moreover, emotions exhibit nonlinear characteristics in semantic spaces, leading to potential confusion when discerning similar semantic emotions in the Euclidean semantic space. To address these issues, this study proposes a Poincaré-based dual-strategy emotion tracker for emotion recognition in conversation (PeTracker), which introduces the hyperbolic space representation in the ERC domain. Based on the spatial properties of the hyperbolic space representation to capture the nonlinear relationships among features, PeTracker encompasses two learning strategies. Poincaré emotional geometry curriculum learning (PGCL) and Poincaré emotional stratification contrastive learning (PSCL). In PGCL, the similarity of emotion labels is effectively discerned using the Poincaré distance, quantifying emotion transfer distances and facilitating the identification of subtle emotion transfers in utterance. In PSCL, PeTracker extracts and adapts multi-level features, mapping them to the Poincaré ball space to build emotion prototype-based contrastive learning. This process enhances the model&#39;s ability to distinguish between similar emotion labels. while alleviating potential label confusion issues. Experimental results on three general datasets demonstrate that PeTracker achieves optimal or near-optimal performance. Furthermore, the study investigates the role and impact of the Poincaré ball in differentiating similar emotions.},

  abstract = {Theories of Constructed Emotion and Grounded Cognition suggest that our sensorimotor experiences underpin the formation of emotions. This study explores this premise by examining how movements of a computer cursor can reflect moods of participants. We conducted an experiment where participants engaged in a simple choice-reaching task, with their mouse-cursor movements tracked pixel by pixel. Mood assessments were conducted using the PANAS-X scale before and after the task. Through Intersubject Representational Similarity Analysis, we investigated the correlation between the patterns of mouse movements and self-reported moods. Our findings reveal a significant association between negative emotions, such as fear and hostility, and certain movement patterns, e.g., randomness and deviations from a direct path. Furthermore, our machine learning-based Representational Similarity Analysis (ML-RSA) underscores the value of second-order similarity measures, revealing meaningful alignments between sensorimotor behaviors and emotional states across distinct measurement domains. These findings highlight the potential of cursor-tracking as a tool for exploring the interplay between emotion and action.},

  abstract = {Negative emotion recognition during manipulation task plays crucial role in human-machine interaction, where diverse cognitive variables coexist and influence each other. However, traditional emotion experiments often overemphasize emotion induction while overlooking other practical cognitive tasks, which leads participants to suffer from simplistic emotional experiences and ultimately compromises the real-world applicability of the emotional data collected. To incorporate critical cognitive variables into emotion elicitation, we utilize joystick-based real-time emotion annotation to encourage subjects to continuously feel emotional intensity, to advisedly decide when to manipulate the joystick, and to physically operate it. Consequently, at least two essential cognitive variables—decision-making and action—are integrated into emotion perception. Following this, we develop a novel negative emotion dataset called CRED, which includes a variety of physiological data, particularly Electroencephalograph (EEG). To assess the stability of emotional EEG patterns, we employ strict statistical analysis and a dual-branch transformer (DBT) with the gradient-based attribution method on the proposed CRED. Additionally, two well-known public datasets (SEED, and SEED-V) are used to verify the DBT. Compared to traditional methods, DBT improves classification accuracy by approximately 5% on CRED and by around 2% on the public datasets. The experimental results indicate that the occipital lobe plays a crucial role in the discrimination of negative emotions; the critical frequency bands vary between the five emotions in the CRED. Specifically, the low-delta rhythm is associated with anger, while fear is influenced by both theta and alpha rhythms; disgust is found to be significant in the theta rhythm; and for neutral emotions, both low-delta and alpha rhythms are identified as crucial. In summary, our findings demonstrate the existence of stable emotional EEG patterns when additional cognitive variables are involved. The CRED and the source codes will be released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/peiyu999/CRED.},

Inspired by young children&#39;s needs, this architecture includes three drives: learning, interaction, and recharging, each with varying dependence on the human partner. We aimed to assess how experimentally changing the importance of these drives within a fixed architecture affects interaction dynamics with human partners (acting as caregivers) and their understanding of the robot&#39;s needs. By adjusting the learning and interaction drives, we created two robot profiles: Playful, which prioritizes environmental exploration and playfulness to reduce boredom, and Social, which focuses on social interaction through touch and visual contact to increase comfort. Our findings show that changing the importance of these drives produces distinct behaviors and human perceptions. Robot behaviors matched their profiles, and participants adapted their responses accordingly. Participants identified and attributed distinct traits to each robot without knowing the specific profiles. Despite variability among human partners, the robots, especially the playful one, were generally well understood by most participants.},

To address these limitations, we design a novel AU recognition framework guided by AU labeling rules. Specifically, we first leverage AU labeling rules from the Facial Action Coding System to separate facial judgment areas and define the explicit correspondence between AUs and the judgment areas. A region feature extraction component is utilized to extract representations for the judgment areas. Then, AU-specific representations are mapped from their corresponding judgment areas. AU relations are further encoded to enhance the AU representation learning based on Transformer encoder. After that, we introduce a region relation learning component to encode the relations among judgment areas to further guide the region representation learning through Transformer encoder and the proposed auxiliary task. Finally, the encoded AU and region patterns are jointly fed into the AU predicting component to perform AU recognition based on Transformer decoder. The designed Transformer encoder-decoder framework can fully leverage both relations among AU representations and facial cues. Experimental results on three public databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with that of current state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Elderly individuals often suffer from underlying medical conditions, resulting in a significant decline in quality of life and a heightened susceptibility to depression. Presently, AI screening tools based on behavioral indicators offer an objective and effective approach to diagnosing depression. However, current AI depression screening tools are primarily tailored to adolescents and adults, exhibiting shortcomings in their applicability and accuracy for elderly individuals with underlying medical conditions. To address the above issues, firstly, this paper constructs a depression dataset for elderly people with underlying diseases by using semi-structured interviews. Secondly, based on cognitive science insights, it is recognized that personality factors significantly influence behavioral expressions and also determine the attitudes of elderly individuals toward current life circumstances/health issues. Therefore, besides annotating depression severity, the Big Five-10 personality scale was utilized to annotate participant personalities. Finally, a late fusion-based multi-task learning framework was proposed, and the effects of introducing gait information and personality annotation on the performance of depression assessment were investigated. The experimental findings affirm the importance of integrating gait information and personality assessment in improving depression detection effectiveness. This study provides valuable foundational resources, as well as beneficial references and insights, for the research on depression in the elderly.},

  abstract = {With the increasing availability of computational and data resources, numerous powerful pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged for natural language processing tasks. However, how to inject nonverbal modalities into PLMs to handle multimodal information remains a practical problem. In this paper, we explore the application of PLM on multimodal sentiment analysis from a different perspective. Unlike many recent methods that develop multimodal fusion layers that are sequential to attention layers, we investigate the effectiveness of cross-modal additive attention that is parallel to attention layers, which takes the language modality as dominant modality. Moreover, we devise a gating mechanism to control the flow of nonverbal information by estimating its discriminative level. In this way, we can prevent noisy multimodal information from damaging the performance of pre-trained language model. In our framework, nonverbal modalities serve as auxiliary roles to provide the model with additional information and improve the understanding of multimodal human language. Additionally, cross-modal margin and matching losses are proposed to align the distributions of various modalities and simultaneously retain modality-specific information, which to some extent address the shortcoming of contrastive learning loss. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {Deep learning-based methods have shown substantial promise in visual depression severity estimation. Nonetheless, their effectiveness is limited by the scarce availability of labeled depression data, potentially leading to overfitting during representation learning. One feasible approach to address this issue is to incorporate, in the training objective, regularization that considers the unique characteristics of depression data. Typical regularization includes the similarity ranking through ordered consistency between visual features and their target scores. However, previous ranking methods are limited to using only samples within a mini-batch, resulting in a decreased regularization effect in depression representation learning. To address this limitation, we propose MemRank, a global similarity ranking method that operates not only on mini-batch samples but also on a well-designed feature memory, which stores smoothed and dynamically updated feature prototypes at diverse levels of depression during training. Furthermore, we show that incorporating the feature memory in the regression loss enhances the stability of training a deep regressor, leading to improved depression predictions. Empirically and analytically, we show that our MemRank outperforms alternative ranking methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets.

  abstract     = {Intelligent optimization of a solar power tower heliostat field (SPTHF) is critical for harnessing solar energy in various scenarios. However, existing SPTHF optimization methods are typically based on specific geometric layout constraints and assume that each heliostat has the same size and height. As a result, these methods are not flexible or practical in many real-world SPTHF application scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel flexible SPTHF (FSPTHF) model that is more practical and involves fewer assumptions. This model enables the use of different layouts and simultaneous optimization of the parameters of each heliostat. As an FSPTHF can involve hundreds or even thousands of heliostats, optimizing the parameters of all heliostats results in a challenging large-scale optimization problem. To efficiently solve this problem, this paper proposes a matrix-based differential evolution algorithm, called HMDE, for large-scale heliostat design. The HMDE uses a matrix-based encoding and representation method to improve optimization accuracy and convergence speed, incorporating two novel designs. First, a dual elite-based mutation method is proposed to enhance the convergence speed of HMDE by learning from multiple elite individuals. Second, a multi-level crossover method is proposed to improve the optimization accuracy and convergence speed by integrating element-level and vector-level crossover based on matrix representation. Extensive experiments were conducted on 30 problem instances based on real-world data with three different layouts and problem dimensions up to 12,000, where state-of-the-art algorithms were used for comparison. The experimental results show that the proposed HMDE can effectively solve large-scale FSPTHF optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate fault classification and location are critical to ensure the reliability and resilience of large-scale power distribution systems (PDSs). The existing data-driven works in this area struggle to capture essential space-time correlations of PDS measurements and often rely on deterministic and shallow neural architectures. Furthermore, they encounter challenges like over-smoothing and the inability to capture deep correlations. To overcome these limitations, a novel deep space-time generative graph convolutional autoencoder (SGGCA) is proposed. First, the PDS is modeled as a space-time graph where the nodes and edges show the bus measurements and line impedance values, respectively. The proposed SGGCA’s encoder captures deep correlations of the space-time graph using a new graph convolution with early connections and identity transformations to mitigate the over-smoothing. Our encoder encompasses a new recurrent method to adjust graph convolution parameters without relying on node embeddings on the temporal dimension. Additionally, it incorporates generative modeling by capturing the probability distribution function of the latent representation through a conditional normalizing flow model. The extracted generative space-time features are enhanced by a multi-head attention mechanism to better capture task-relevant characteristics of the PDS measurements. The extracted features are fed to sparse decoders to classify and locate the faults in the PDS. The feature sparsity of decoders ensures a high generalization capacity and avoids overfitting. The proposed method is evaluated on the IEEE 69-bus and 123-bus systems. It achieves substantial improvements in fault classification accuracy by 3.33% and 6.26% and enhances fault location accuracy by 6.33% and 5.73% for the respective PDSs compared to state-of-the-art models.},

Then, C2RS develops a relation semantic encoding module based on the distributions of knowledge graph triples to extract the semantic information of relations for comprehensive relation representation. Finally, we encode the candidate triples with a triple encoder, and identify the correct entities through a scoring function to complete the multimodal knowledge graph.

  abstract     = {Wind flow can be highly unpredictable and suffer substantial fluctuations in speed and direction due to the shape and height of hills, mountains, and valleys, making accurate wind speed (WS) forecasting essential in complex terrain. Hourly WS data at 50 meters above ground, from MERRA-2, NASA (2015–2021), collected from five Indian wind stations for plain and complex terrain. This paper presents a novel and adaptive model for short-term WS forecasting. The paper’s key contributions are as follows: (a) The Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) is utilised to minimise the dimension of the set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), hence reducing training time; (b) The sample entropy (SampEn) was used to calculate the complexity of the reduced set of IMFs. Since a particular Deep Learning (DL) model-feature-combination was selected based on complexity, the proposed method is adaptive; (c) A novel bidirectional feature- LSTM framework for complicated IMFs has been suggested, resulting in improved forecasting accuracy; (d) The proposed model shows 55.94% superior forecasting performance compared to the persistence, hybrid, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)-based DL models. It has achieved the lowest prediction variance between simple and complex terrain at 0.70%, ensuring robust forecasting performance. Dimension reduction of IMF’s and complexity-based model-feature selection helps reduce the training time by 68.77%, additionally forecasting quality is improved by 58.58% on average. These benefits highlight the model’s adaptability, effectiveness, and resilience in addressing WS forecasting challenges on complex terrain.},

  abstract     = {In this work, a novel neural network architecture called MalaNet is proposed for the detection and diagnosis of malaria, an infectious disease that poses a major global health challenge. The proposed neural network architecture is inspired by small-world network principles, which generally involve the introduction of new links. A small-world neural network is realized by establishing new connections, thereby reducing the average path length and increasing clustering coefficient. These characteristics are known to enhance interconnectivity and improve feature propagation within the network. In the context of malaria diagnosis, these characteristics of MalaNet can enhance detection accuracy and enable better generalization in scenarios with limited data availability. Broadly, two variants of MalaNet are proposed in this work. First, a small-world-inspired Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN) is developed for symptom and categorical feature-based diagnosis, providing an accessible solution when blood smear images are unavailable. Subsequently, a small-world-inspired Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed for precise and automated diagnosis when blood smear images are available. Both variants of MalaNet are rigorously validated using the National Institute of Health Malaria dataset, a clinical dataset from Federal Polytechnic Ilaro Medical Centre, Nigeria, and the APTOS dataset. Comparative results against several state-of-the-art neural network models in the literature demonstrate MalaNet’s superior performance, generalization capability, and computational efficiency. The small-world neural network architecture proposed in this work enhances feature learning, diagnostic accuracy, and adaptability in limited-data and resource-constrained settings, motivating its application in disease diagnosis where timely and accurate results are critical.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made remarkable strides; however, they remain susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly to image perturbations that humans can easily recognize. This weakness, often termed as ‘attacks,’ underscores the limited robustness of CNNs and the need for research into fortifying their resistance against such manipulations. This study introduces a novel Non-Uniform Illumination (NUI) attack technique, where images are subtly altered using varying NUI masks. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely-accepted datasets including CIFAR10, TinyImageNet, CalTech256 and NWPU-RESISC45 focusing on image classification with 12 different NUI masks. The resilience of VGG, ResNet, MobilenetV3-small, InceptionV3 and efficientNet b0 models against NUI attacks are evaluated. Our results show a substantial decline in the CNN models’ classification accuracy when subjected to NUI attacks, due to changes in the image pixel value distribution, indicating their vulnerability under non-uniform illumination. To mitigate this, a defense strategy is proposed, including NUI-attacked images, generated through the new NUI transformation, into the training set. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in CNN model performance when confronted with perturbed images affected by NUI attacks. This strategy seeks to bolster CNN models’ resilience against NUI attacks. A comparative study with other attack techniques shows the effectiveness of the NUI attack and defense technique.11The code is available at https://github.com/Akshayjain97/Non-Uniform_Illumination},

In ordinal regression, many works have incorporated ordinality into models and loss functions by promoting unimodality of the probability output. However, current approaches are based on heuristics, particularly non-parametric ones, which are still insufficiently explored in the literature. We analyze the set of unimodal distributions in the probability simplex, establishing fundamental properties and giving new perspectives to understand the ordinal regression problem. Two contributions are then proposed to incorporate the preference for unimodal distributions into the predictive model: 1) UnimodalNet, a new architecture that by construction ensures the output is a unimodal distribution, and 2) Wasserstein Regularization, a new loss term that relies on the notion of projection in a set to promote unimodality. Experiments show that the new architecture achieves top performance, while the proposed new loss term is very competitive while maintaining high unimodality.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on a significant yet challenging task: out-of-distribution detection (OOD detection), which aims to distinguish and reject test samples with semantic shifts, so as to prevent models trained on in-distribution (ID) data from producing unreliable predictions. Although previous works have had decent success, they are ineffective for real-world challenging applications since these methods regard all unlabeled data as OOD data and ignore the case that different datasets have different label granularity. For example, “cat” on CIFAR-10 and “tabby cat” on Tiny-ImageNet share the same semantics but have different labels due to various label granularity. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Hierarchical Graph Cut network (AHGC) to deeply explore the semantic relationship between different images. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical KNN graph to evaluate the similarities between different images based on the cosine similarity. Based on the linkage and density information of the graph, we cut the graph into multiple subgraphs to integrate these semantics-similar samples. If the labeled percentage in a subgraph is larger than a threshold, we will assign the label with the highest percentage to unlabeled images. To further improve the model generalization, we augment each image into two augmentation versions, and maximize the similarity between the two versions. Finally, we leverage the similarity score for OOD detection. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) illustrate that in representative cases, AHGC outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods by 81.24% on CIFAR-100 and by 40.47% on CIFAR-10 in terms of “FPR95”.},

Among the various types of cancer, cervical cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers in the female population. In most cases, doctors and practitioners can typically only identify cervical cancer in its latter stages. Planning cancer therapy and increasing patient survival rates become very difficult as the disease progresses. As a result, diagnosing cervical cancer in its initial stages has become imperative to arrange proper therapy and surgery. In this paper, we present a survey of automatic computerized methods for diagnosing cervical abnormalities based on microscopic imaging modalities. The present survey was conducted by defining a novel taxonomy of the surveyed techniques based on the approaches they used. We also discuss the challenges and sub-challenges associated with an automatic cervical cancer diagnosis based on microscopic imaging modalities. Additionally, surveys on various public and private datasets used by the research community for developing new methods are presented. In this paper, the performances of published papers are compared.

The convergence analysis that employs a Lyapunov-like approach is performed on the proposed learning algorithm, providing conditions to ensure the convergence of the model learning. Additionally, an automated learning rate scheduler is proposed based on the convergence conditions to prevent divergence and eliminate the need for manual tuning of the initial learning rate. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies on the node classification problem. The results reveal that the proposed method outperforms gradient descent-based optimizers by achieving consistent training accuracies within a variation of 0.1% across various initial learning rates, without requiring manual tuning.},

This paper introduces a methodology for preemptively identifying ‘unknown-unknown’ errors in AAS that arise due to unpredictable human interactions and complex real-world usage scenarios, potentially leading to critical safety incidents through unsafe shifts in operational data distributions. We posit that AAS functioning in human-in-the-loop and human-in-the-plant modes must adhere to established physical laws, even when unknown-unknown errors occur. Our approach employs constructing physics-guided models from operational data, coupled with conformal inference for assessing structural breaks in the underlying model caused by violations of physical laws, thereby facilitating early detection of such errors before unsafe shifts in operational data distribution occur. Validation across diverse contexts–zero-day vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles, hardware failures in artificial pancreas systems, and design deficiencies in aircraft in Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation Systems (MCAS)–demonstrates our framework’s efficacy in preempting unsafe data distribution shifts due to unknown-unknowns. This methodology not only advances unknown-unknown error detection in AAS but also sets a new benchmark for integrating physics-guided models and machine learning to ensure system safety.},

To address this limitation, this paper develops a framework for learning from triplet similarities (three instances belonging to the same class) and unlabeled data points, denoted as TSU. This framework not only showcases the feasibility of constructing a TSU classifier but also serves as an inspiration to explore the broader challenge of addressing N-tuple similarities (N ≥ 2) and unlabeled data points. To tackle this more generalized problem, the present paper develop an advancing weakly-supervision framework of learning from N-tuple similarities (N instances belong to the same class) and unlabeled data points, named NSU. This framework provides a solid foundation for handling diverse similarity scenarios. Based on these findings, we propose empirical risk minimization estimators for both TSU and NSU classification. The estimation error bounds are also established for the proposed methods. Finally, experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Sources of overfitting in deep neural net (DNN) classifiers include: i) large class imbalances; ii) insufficient training set diversity; and iii) over-training. Recently, it was shown that backdoor data-poisoning also induces overfitting, with unusually large maximum classification margins (MMs) to the attacker’s target class. This is enabled by (unbounded) ReLU activation functions, which allow large signals to propagate in the DNN. Thus, an effective post-training backdoor mitigation approach (with no knowledge of the training set and no knowledge or control of the training process) was proposed, informed by a small, clean (poisoning-free) data set and choosing saturation levels on neural activations to limit the DNN’s MMs. Here, we show that non-malicious sources of overfitting also exhibit unusually large MMs. Thus, we propose novel post-training MM-based regularization that substantially mitigates non-malicious overfitting due to class imbalances and overtraining. Whereas backdoor mitigation and other adversarial learning defenses often trade off a classifier’s accuracy to achieve robustness against attacks, our approach, inspired by ideas from adversarial learning, helps the classifier’s generalization accuracy: as shown for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our approach improves both the accuracy for rare categories as well as overall. Moreover, unlike other overfitting mitigation methods, it does so with no knowledge of class imbalances, no knowledge of the training set, and without control of the training process.},

These limitations hinder applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality. Hence, point cloud completion is crucial for generating reliable 3D object representations. Existing methods often struggle to capture structural patterns effectively, which leads to low-quality reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Centroid Transformer (CenFormer), a novel transformer-based network for point cloud completion. CenFormer introduces two distinct types of centroids, namely Preserved and Dispersed, to facilitate fine-grained reconstruction. The proposed design includes three innovations: i) a Centroid Generation Block to aggregate features for preserved centroids, ii) a Centroid Dispersion Block to predict offsets for dispersed centroids, and iii) a Fine-grained Point Generation Block to refine local patterns around centroids. These components jointly enable the network to effectively capture local structural details and strategically target missing regions for fine-grained 3D shape reconstruction. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that CenFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visualization results and quantitative metrics.},

  abstract     = {Many existing metric learning methods are based on fixed similarity constraints. However, the quality of fixed similarity constraints is usually hard to guarantee, and inflexible constraints also limit the performance of metric learning. Moreover, when new training samples are acquired, retraining the model is usually inefficient for many classical metric learning methods. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Broad Metric Learning (DynBML) method to overcome the above limitations. DynBML trains a broad network with dynamic similarity constraints between samples and their target points to learn a discriminative data transformation with high representation ability. To overcome the weaknesses of fixed constraints, DynBML dynamically updates the target points to produce new constraints during the learning process. A Force-Directed Reference Points Generation (FD-RPG) algorithm is designed to generate reference points from the currently learned space, which encourage the new target points to be more discriminative. A new objective function is proposed to simultaneously learn the new target points and train the data transformation with the guidance of the reference points. Additionally, to avoid retraining the model from scratch when new data arrive, the incremental learning scheme of DynBML (I-DynBML) is developed, which efficiently updates the trained model of DynBML by generating and satisfying new constraints of new input. DynBML is evaluated on ten datasets to demonstrate its superiority. Experiment results show that the dynamic constraints constructed in DynBML improve the learning performance. The effectiveness and efficiency of the incremental learning scheme of DynBML are also verified.},

However, these existing methods heavily rely on intricate modifications to the attention mechanisms within the transformer blocks while using a generic patch embedding. As a result, it often leads to complex architectural designs requiring additional computation resources. In this work, we aim to explore the efficacy of incorporating shadow information within the early processing stage. Accordingly, we propose a transformer-based framework with a novel patch embedding that is tailored for shadow removal, dubbed ShadowMask-Former. Specifically, we present a simple and effective mask-augmented patch embedding to integrate shadow information and promote the model’s emphasis on acquiring knowledge for shadow regions. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method against state-of-the-art approaches while using fewer model parameters.

  abstract     = {The rapid data surge from the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider introduces critical computational challenges requiring novel approaches for efficient data processing in particle physics. Quantum machine learning, with its capability to leverage the extensive Hilbert space of quantum hardware, offers a promising solution. However, current quantum graph neural networks (GNNs) lack robustness to noise and are often constrained by fixed symmetry groups, limiting adaptability in complex particle interaction modeling. This paper demonstrates that replacing the classical Lorentz Group Equivariant Block modules in LorentzNet with a dressed quantum circuit significantly enhances performance despite using ≈5.5 times fewer parameters. Additionally, quantum circuits effectively replace MLPs by inherently preserving symmetries, with Lorentz symmetry integration ensuring robust handling of relativistic invariance. Our Lorentz-Equivariant Quantum Graph Neural Network (Lorentz-EQGNN) achieved 74.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 87.38% on the Quark-Gluon jet tagging dataset, outperforming the classical and quantum GNNs with a reduced architecture using only 4 qubits. On the Electron-Photon dataset, Lorentz-EQGNN reached 67.00% test accuracy and an AUC of 68.20%, demonstrating competitive results with just 800 training samples. Evaluation of our model on generic MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets confirmed Lorentz-EQGNN’s efficiency, achieving 88.10% and 74.80% test accuracy, respectively. Ablation studies validated the impact of quantum components on performance, with notable improvements in background rejection rates over classical counterparts. These results highlight Lorentz-EQGNN’s potential for immediate applications in noise-resilient jet tagging, event classification, and broader data-scarce HEP tasks.},

  abstract     = {An absorber is a block of material employed to absorb a portion of the energy of an incident particle. Research on absorbers is rapidly expanding as a result of their prospective applications in several fields, including wireless communications and military purposes. However, conventional absorbers have dense size and design complexity that make them unsuitable for a multitude of practical applications. Metamaterial-based absorbers (MMAs) have garnered significant attention with respect to their low density, narrow layers, and high absorption capacity. In this paper, we introduce a new ultra-thin trilayered Ni–MgF2–Ni metamaterial absorber structure, which is designed using machine learning. It has a balanced and symmetrical layout with a metal-dielectric-metal arrangement and a high-temperature endurance. Its resonator design is defined by mathematical deduction from the Conference matrix. The performance of MMA has been evaluated at wavelengths ranging from 250 nm to 1150 nm, as well as in various modes-TM, TE, and TEM. The results demonstrate that the proposed MMA has exceptional absorption capacities, with an overall absorption of 96.18% within the test range. It offers excellent mean absorption percentages of 99% in the optical region (350 to 750 nm), 95.23% in the ultraviolet (UV) range, and 94.38% in the near-infrared (NIR) range. Furthermore, MMA exhibits an absorption efficiency of 99.99% at a particular wavelength of 424.93 nm. In this work, various machine learning techniques have been applied to predict the absorption of the proposed MMA design. The XGBoost meta-learner-based Stacking ensemble machine learning technique achieves the highest prediction efficiency. Finally, the explainable AI technique with the LIME framework has been used to analyze the predictions of applied machine learning models.},

Subsequently, the algorithm is enhanced, and two distributed algorithms are designed separately. Both of these two algorithms have a fixed convergence time and certain robustness. Additionally, this paper utilizes the penalty function approach to handle time-varying optimization problems with inequality constraints, thereby making the algorithm more widely applicable.

Next, we design a contribution-aware metric, which accurately quantifies the negative impact of malicious clients on the global calculating their historical contribution ratio.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning. Specifically, vertical FL (vFL) allows various devices in multi-agent systems to collectively train models on vertically partitioned data while safeguarding sensitive information. Recent research on vFL privacy analysis primarily explores passive settings where attackers adhere to the FL protocol. This perspective may underestimate the threats posed by vFL, as practical adversaries can deviate from the protocol to enhance their attack capabilities. In response, this work proposes two novel active data reconstruction attacks to compromise data privacy. Each attack induces gradient manipulation during the training phase to breach data privacy. Including an Active Inversion Network (AIN), our first attack exploits a subset of known data in the training set to make passive parties train an auto-encoder (AE) to reconstruct their private data. The second attack introduces an Active Generative Network (AGN) that relies only on the data distribution to train a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) for private feature reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both attacks in three real-world datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, and USCensus. Additionally, we provide valuable insights and guidelines for enhancing the security of vFL systems through the application of calibrated noise via Local Differential Privacy (LDP).},

However, most existing unsupervised and semi-supervised DNMF approaches not only suffer from the noisy data seriously, but also fail to enhance the decomposition quality of DNMF obviously by using the obtained supervisory information. To overcome these drawbacks, a robust semi-supervised DNMF method, called the correntropy based semi-supervised DNMF with constraint propagation (CSDCP), is proposed in this paper for learning a compact and meaningful data representation from the original data. Particularly, instead of adopting the traditional Frobenius norm, CSDCP employs the nonlinear and local similarity measure (e.g., correntropy) as the loss function in DNMF to enhance the robustness of DNMF for the noisy data. In addition, the hypergraph based constraint propagation (HCP) algorithm is adopted in CSDCP to exploit the limited supervisory information fully for capturing good data representation. Moreover, algorithm analysis of CSDCP is presented in this paper, including convergence analysis, robustness analysis supervised information analysis, and computational complexity. Extensive experimental results have illustrated that, in comparison to the most related DNMF approaches, CSDCP usually has better clustering results on six nonnegative datasets in clustering tasks.},

A key advantage of our approach is that we can relate the subsampling selection problem to that of finding an optimal approximate design under a convex criterion, where analytical tools for finding and studying them are already available. Consequently, the J–optimal subsampling method comes with theoretical results and theory-based algorithms for finding them. Simulation results and real data analysis show our proposed methods outperform current subsampling methods and the proposed algorithms can also adapt efficiently to select an optimal subsample from streaming data.},

To address this, a growing area of research, known as self-knowledge distillation (Self-KD), aims to enhance the performance of a neural network by leveraging its own latent knowledge. Despite its potential, existing Self-KD methods often struggle to effectively extract and utilize the model&#39;s dark knowledge. In this work, we identify a consistency problem between feature layer and output layer, and propose a novel Self-KD approach called Residual Learning for Self-Knowledge Distillation (RSKD). Our method addresses this issue by enabling the last feature layer of the student model learn the residual gap between the outputs of the pseudo-teacher and the student. Additionally, we extend RSKD by allowing each intermediate feature layer of the student model to learn the residual gap between the corresponding deeper features of the pseudo-teacher and the student.

The signed graph model has been used in many real applications, such as protein complex discovery and social network analysis. Finding cohesive subgraphs in signed graphs is a fundamental problem. A $k$-plex is a common model for cohesive subgraphs in which every vertex is adjacent to all but at most $k$ vertices within the subgraph. In this paper, we propose the model of size-constrained antagonistic $k$-plex in a signed graph. The proposed model guarantees that the resulting subgraph is a $k$-plex and can be divided into two sub-$k$-plexes, both of which have positive inner edges and negative outer edges. This paper aims to identify all maximal antagonistic $k$-plexes in a signed graph. Through rigorous analysis, we show that the problem is NP-Hardness. We propose a novel framework for maximal antagonistic $k$-plexes utilizing set enumeration. Efficiency is improved through pivot pruning and early termination based on the color bound. Preprocessing techniques based on degree and dichromatic graphs effectively narrow the search space before enumeration. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate our algorithm&#39;s efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability.},

However, these methods are highly dependent on labelled data, which is scarce and costly to annotate in reality. To address this problem, we propose a framework called Weakly Supervised Enhanced Concept Prerequisite Relation Learning (WSECPRL). Specifically, we first generate an enhanced concept pseudo-relation graph without labeled data using the pre-trained language model and the large knowledge base as auxiliary information. Second, we propose an improved variational graph auto-encoder model to correctly determine the concept prerequisite relations. We incorporate a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance the representation learning capability of weakly supervised learning. The model reconstructs a directed graph into multiple undirected graphs by splitting the adjacency matrix and determines the direction of the concept prerequisite relation based on the strength of the dependency relation between concepts. Finally, experimental results on several publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, with WSECPRL outperforming existing baseline models in terms of F1 scores and AUC.},

However, they suffer from the challenge of error propagation and lack of interaction between different thoughts. In this paper, we propose Neural Network-based Prompting (NetPrompt), a novel network-structured prompting strategy for event extraction. The core idea behind NetPrompt is to imitate the excellent information integration capabilities of neural network structures. Specifically, we first decompose the event extraction problem into diverse intermediate subtasks, and each subtask is represented as a node in different layers of the network, the output of the nodes in the preceding layer is fed into the subsequent layer. Secondly, we propose pruning strategies to adapt the reasoning overhead to different problems. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on two widely used event extraction benchmarks to evaluate NetPrompt. The results demonstrated that NetPrompt significantly improved the event extraction performance compared to previous methods.},

To crack this hard nut, we propose CAS-DGNN, a novel comprehensive architecture search method for deep GNNs. It encompasses four kinds of search spaces that are the composition of aggregate and update operators, different types of aggregate operators, residual connections, and hyper-parameters. To meet the needs of such a complex situation, a phased and hybrid search strategy is proposed to accommodate the diverse characteristics of different search spaces. Specifically, we divide the search process into four phases, utilizing evolutionary algorithms and Bayesian optimization. Meanwhile, we design two distinct search methods for residual connections (All-connected search and Initial Residual search) to streamline the search space, which enhances the scalability of CAS-DGNN. The experimental results show that CAS-DGNN achieves higher accuracy with competitive search costs across ten public datasets compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {Computing trajectory similarity is a fundamental task in trajectory analysis. Traditional heuristic methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity, which limits their scalability to large datasets. Recently, Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) has been extensively studied to address this limitation. However, most existing TRL algorithms face two key challenges. First, they prioritize spatial similarity while neglecting the intricate spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectories, particularly temporal regularities. Second, these methods are often constrained by predefined single spatial or temporal scales, which can significantly impact performance, since the measurement of trajectory similarity depends on spatial and temporal resolution. To address these issues, we propose MSST, a Multi-Scale Self-supervised Trajectory Representation Learning framework. MSST simultaneously processes spatial and temporal information by generating 3D spatial-temporal tokens, thereby capturing spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories more effectively. Further, MSST explore the multi-scale characteristics of trajectories. Finally, self-supervised contrastive learning is employed to enhance the consistency between the trajectory representations from different views. Experimental results on three real-world datasets for similarity trajectory computation provide insight into the design properties of our approach and demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing TRL methods. MSST significantly surpasses all state-of-the-art competitors in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness.},

  abstract = {Glaucoma is a chronic and irreversible eye disease. Early detection and treatment can effectively prevent severe consequences. Deep transfer learning is widely used in fundus imaging analysis to remedy the shortage of training data of glaucoma. The model trained on the source domain may struggle to predict glaucoma in the target domain due to distribution differences. Several limitations cannot be ignored: (1) Image matching: enhancing global and local image consistency through bidirectional matching; (2) Hierarchical transfer: developing a strategy for transferring different hierarchical features. To this end, we propose a novel Matched Hierarchical Transfer Network (MHT-Net) to achieve automatic glaucoma detection. We initially create a fundus structure detector to match global and local images using intermediate layers of a pre-trained diagnostic model with source domain data. Next, a hierarchical transfer network is implemented, sharing parameters for general features and using a domain discriminator for specific features. By integrating adversarial and classification losses, the model acquires domain-invariant features, facilitating precise and seamless transfer of fundus information from source to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, outperforming existing glaucoma detection methods. These advantages endow our algorithm as a promising efficient assisted tool in the glaucoma screening.},

  abstract = {Multiplex Graph Contrastive Learning (MGCL) has attracted significant attention. However, existing MGCL methods often struggle with suboptimal graph structures and fail to fully capture intricate interdependencies across multiplex views. To address these issues, we propose a novel self-supervised framework, Multiplex Graph Refinement with progressive fusion (MGRefine), for multiplex graph contrastive representation learning. Specifically, MGRefine introduces a multi-view learning module to extract a structural guidance matrix by exploring the underlying relationships between nodes. Then, a progressive fusion module is employed to progressively enhance and fuse representations from different views, capturing and leveraging nuanced interdependencies and comprehensive information across the multiplex graphs. The fused representation is then used to construct a consensus guidance matrix. A self-enhanced refinement module continuously refines the multiplex graphs using these guidance matrices while providing effective supervision signals. MGRefine achieves mutual reinforcement between graph structures and representations, ensuring continuous optimization of the model throughout the learning process in a self-enhanced manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGRefine outperforms state-of-the-art methods and also verify the effectiveness of MGRefine across various downstream tasks on several benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Recently, numerous studies have integrated self-supervised contrastive learning with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address the data sparsity and popularity bias to enhance recommendation performance. While such studies have made breakthroughs in accuracy metric, they often neglect non-accuracy objectives such as diversity, novelty and percentage of long-tail items, which greatly reduces the user experience in real-world applications. To this end, we propose a novel graph collaborative filtering model named Multi-Objective Graph Contrastive Learning for recommendation (MOGCL), designed to provide more comprehensive recommendations by considering multiple objectives. Specifically, MOGCL comprises three modules: a multi-objective embedding generation module, an embedding fusion module and a transfer learning module. In the multi-objective embedding generation module, we employ two GCN encoders with different goal orientations to generate node embeddings targeting accuracy and non-accuracy objectives, respectively. These embeddings are then effectively fused with complementary weights in the embedding fusion module. In the transfer learning module, we suggest an auxiliary self-supervised task to promote the maximization of the mutual information of the two sets of embeddings, so that the obtained final embeddings are more stable and comprehensive. The experimental results on three real-world datasets show that MOGCL achieves optimal trade-offs between multiple objectives comparing to the state-of-the-arts.},

However, traditional methods&#39; graph structure node learning and discrete neural architecture are not sensitive to issues such as sudden changes, time variance, and irregular sampling often found in real-world data. To address these challenges, we propose a method called Adaptive Graph structure Learning neural Rough Differential Equations (AGLRDE).

Then we employ a spatio-temporal encoderdecoder based on Neural Rough Differential Equations (Neural RDE) to model spatio-temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a path reconstruction loss to constrain the path generation stage. We conduct experiments on six benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Researching spelling errors in this scenario is practical and valuable. However, there is currently no research that has truly proposed a model suitable for this scenario. Considering this concern, this paper proposes a model IPCK-IME, which incorporates confused phraseological knowledge based on the pinyin input method. The model integrates its own phonetic features with external similarity knowledge to guide the model to output more correct characters. Furthermore, to mitigate the influence of spelling errors on the semantics of sentences, a Gaussian bias is introduced into the self-attention network of the model. This approach aims to reduces the focus on typos and improve attention to local context. Empirical evidence indicates that our method surpasses existing models in correcting spelling errors generated by the pinyin input method.

However, existing scalers and schedulers are constrained by static thresholds, scaling latency, and single-dimensional optimization, making them difficult to agilely respond to dynamic workloads of functions with different characteristics. This paper proposes a game theory-based scaler and a dual-layer optimization scheduler to enhance the resource management and task allocation capabilities of serverless systems. In the scaler, we introduce the Hawkes process to quantify the “temperature” of function as an indicator of their instantaneous invocation rate. By combining dynamic thresholds and continuous monitoring, this scaler enables that scaling operations no longer lag behind changes of function instances and can even warm up beforehand. For scheduler, we refer to bin-packing strategies to optimize the distribution of containers and reduce resource fragmentation. A new concept of “CPU starvation degree” is introduced to denote the degree of CPU contention during function execution, ensuring that function requests are efficiently scheduled. Experimental analysis on ServerlessBench and Alibaba clusterdata indicates that compared to classical and state-of-the-art scalers and schedulers, the proposed scaler and scheduler achieve at least a 149% improvement in the Quality-Price Ratio, which represents the trade-off between performance and cost.},

  abstract     = {In the realm of video understanding tasks, Video Transformer models (VidT) have recently exhibited impressive accuracy improvements in numerous edge devices. However, their deployment poses significant computational challenges for hardware. To address this, pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce computation and memory requirements by eliminating unimportant elements from the attention matrix. Unfortunately, existing pruning algorithms face a limitation in that they only optimize one of the two key modules on VidT’s critical path: linear projection or self-attention. Regrettably, due to the variation in battery power in edge devices, the video resolution they generate will also change, which causes both linear projection and self-attention stages to potentially become bottlenecks, the existing approaches lack generality. Accordingly, we establish a Run-Through Sparse Attention (RTSA) framework that simultaneously sparsifies and accelerates two stages. On the algorithm side, unlike current methodologies conducting sparse linear projection by exploring redundancy within each frame, we extract extra redundancy naturally existing between frames. Moreover, for sparse self-attention, as existing pruning algorithms often provide either too coarse-grained or fine-grained sparsity patterns, these algorithms face limitations in simultaneously achieving high sparsity, low accuracy loss, and high speedup, resulting in either compromised accuracy or reduced efficiency. Thus, we prune the attention matrix at a medium granularity—sub-vector. The sub-vectors are generated by isolating each column of the attention matrix. On the hardware side, we observe that the use of distinct computational units for sparse linear projection and self-attention results in pipeline imbalances because of the bottleneck transformation between the two stages. To effectively eliminate pipeline stall, we design a RTSA architecture that supports sequential execution of both sparse linear projection and self-attention. To achieve this, we devised an atomic vector-scalar product computation underpinning all calculations in parse linear projection and self-attention, as well as evolving a spatial array architecture with augmented processing elements (PEs) tailored for the vector-scalar product. Experiments on VidT models show that RTSA can save 2.71× to 5.32× ideal computation with &amp;lt; 1% accuracy loss, achieving 105×, 56.8×, 3.59×, and 3.31× speedup compared to CPU, GPU, as well as the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators ViTCoD and HeatViT.},

However, in a more practical setting such as security level 2 of FIPS 140-3 or ISO/IEC 19790 standards, the microcontroller is required to be safeguarded by an opaque anti-tampering cover. This raises an interesting problem: Can we still launch EM attacks against microcontrollers running cryptographic implementations even when equipped with the cover? This paper proposes an improved deep-learningbased profiled attack against NIST KEM standard Kyber. Our key observation is that the distance between the probe and the microcontroller results in attenuation of signal strength. Moreover, the cover restricts the proximity of the probe, thereby limiting the signal-to-noise ratio. We propose an Adaptive Slimmed Pyramid Network (ASPN) model to instantiate a distinguisher in a plaintext-checking oracle-based SCA, which is generic and easy to implement. The proposed ASPN approach significantly enhances the feature extraction process by employing a pyramid network structure, while simultaneously avoiding the inclusion of excessive parameters. Real-world experiments demonstrate that our proposed distinguishers achieve an accuracy above 99% with an 18 mm cover and higher than 89% accuracy even with a 24 mm cover.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, sharding technology has been frequently applied in blockchain systems to increase scalability. However, when new shards are added, the system may result in significant overhead in terms of computing and networking since the data allocation approach is incompatible with dynamic changes in shards. Currently, S-Store, the state-of-the-art sharding solution built on the account model, has a high re-computing latency when growing shard numbers and an unbalanced sharded data distribution after growth. To address these issues, this paper presents Tangram, an efficient and balanced dynamic storage extension approach for sharding blockchain systems. Tangram reduces system extension overhead and latency while ensuring a balanced shard distribution. In implementing Tangram, we tackle three main technical challenges as follows. (1) Designing a novel state tree structure for the storage and maintenance of sharding state data. We introduce the Jump Merkle Tree (JMT) based on the Merkle Tree, which integrates node migration and orderliness. (2) Presenting a protocol to be compatible with dynamic shard scenarios. We devise a shard addition protocol to improve system extension availability and decrease shard extension delay. (3) Proposing an approach to guarantee system longevity after extension. We first devise algorithms for the state tree to eradicate invalid states after system expansion. Furthermore, we introduce a shard reduction protocol to enhance system storage extension support in complex scenarios, such as cleaning up inactive states to avoid bloating the state tree. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Tangram. Experiment results demonstrate that Tangram outperforms existing solutions, showing reduced latency and superior data balance. When compared to the state-of-the-art sharding storage solution, Tangram decreases the transaction execute time by up to 87.84%, the state data migration by more than approximately 74%, and achieves up to 7.63x improvement in the standard deviation of sharding data balance.},

Our analysis reveals that maintaining the facing side of the real-world scene in a stable environment provides sufficient information for virtual object placement and rendering. To address this, we introduce a lightweight quadtree structure, representing 2D scenes through semantic segmentation and geometry, as an alternative to 3D point clouds. Additionally, we propose a novel correction method to handle potential shifts in virtual object placement during view synchronization among users.

Owing to their suboptimal performance on general-purpose platforms, various domain-specific accelerators that explore and utilize the model sparsity have been developed. Instead, we conduct a quantitative analysis of Transformers. (Transformers can be categorized into three types: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder. This paper focuses on Encoder-Only Transformers.) to identify key inefficiencies and adopt dataflow optimization to address them. These inefficiencies arise from 1) diverse matrix multiplication, 2) multi-phase non-linear operations and their dependencies, and 3) heavy memory requirements. We introduce a novel dataflow design to support decoupling with latency hiding, effectively reducing the dependencies and addressing the performance bottlenecks of nonlinear operations. To enable fully fused attention computation, we propose practical tiling and mapping strategies to sustain high throughput and notably decrease memory requirements from O(N2H) to O(N). A hybrid buffer-level reuse strategy is also introduced to enhance utilization and diminish off-chip access. Based on these optimizations, we propose a novel systolic array design, named DESA, with three innovations: 1) A reconfigurable vector processing unit (VPU) and immediate processing units (IPUs) that can be seamlessly fused within the systolic array to support various normalization, post-processing, and transposition operations with efficient latency hiding. 2) A hybrid stationary systolic array that improves the compute and memory efficiency for matrix multiplications with diverse operational intensity and characteristics. 3) A novel tile fusion processing that efficiently addresses the low utilization issue in the conventional systolic array during the data setup and offloading. Across various benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that DESA archives 5.0× ~ 8.3× energy saving over 3090 GPU and 25.6× ~ 88.4× than Intel 6226R CPU.

  abstract     = {Blockchain offers distinct advantages in terms of data credibility and provenance certification, and its fusion with Internet of Things (IoT) technology holds great promise. Nevertheless, IoT environments are marked by extensive node networks and intricate communication patterns, especially the sensing environment. The conventional blockchain consensus mechanism, hampered by its heavy reliance on computing resources and communication bandwidth, faces difficulties in ensuring seamless data exchange among IoT edge servers. The issues encountered by state-of-the-art Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus include: (i) high communication complexity between nodes; and (ii) the detrimental impact of Byzantine behavior on system performance. To overcome the above problems, we propose the lightweight blockchain consensus called AntB, firstly introducing the concept of sampling into the consensus and significantly reducing the number of participating consensus nodes from N to n, which lowers the consensus complexity to 2 · O(n) + O(N). We design a dynamic reputation mechanism so that Byzantine nodes cannot control the sampling set to affect the activity of the consensus in the long term. When implementing AntB, we address three significant technical challenges: (i) to determine the optimal sample size, we propose a sampling calculation method based on statistical confidence intervals, where the sample size is primarily determined by the chosen confidence level and margin of error; (ii) to prevent Byzantine behavior, we devise a weighted random sampling mechanism utilizing reputation coefficients based on edge servers’ behaviors; and (iii) to maintain consensus activity and consistency after sampling, we propose the consensus mechanism for partial sampling and global verification to avert potential issues. We implement AntB and conduct performance evaluations in a server with 32 cores and 64GB of memory. The evaluation results indicate that, the more nodes participating in the process of consensus, the better the performance of AntB will be. Especially, compared to HotStuff, AntB has a 24.94% higher success rate and Transactions Per Second (TPS) can improve by 102.10% when the number of nodes is 300.},

  abstract     = {The operator library is the fundamental infrastructure of deep learning acceleration hardware. Automatically generating the library and tuning its performance is promising because the manual development by well-trained and skillful programmers is costly in terms of both time and money. Tensor hardware has the best computing efficiency for deep learning applications, but the operator library programs are hard to tune because the tensor hardware primitives have many limitations. Otherwise, the performance is difficult to be fully explored. The recent advancement in LLM exacerbates this problem because the size of input data is not fixed. Therefore, mapping the computing tasks of operators to tensor hardware units is a significant challenge when the shape of the input tensor is unknown before the runtime. We propose DSAT, a deep learning operator performance autotuning technique for changeable-sized input data on tensor hardware. To match the input tensor’s undetermined shape, we choose a group of abstract computing units as the basic building blocks of operators for changeable-sized input tensor shapes. We design a group of programming tuning rules to construct a large exploration space of the variant implementation of the operator programs. Based on these rules, we construct an intermediate representation of computing and memory access to describe the computing process and use it to map the abstract computing units to tensor primitives. To speed up the tuning process, we narrow down the optimization space by predicting the actual hardware resource requirement and providing an optimized cost model for performance prediction.

  abstract     = {Attacks based on side-channel analysis (SCA) pose a severe security threat to modern computing platforms, further exacerbated on IoT devices by their pervasiveness and handling of private and critical data. Designing SCA-resistant computing platforms requires a significant additional effort in the early stages of the IoT devices’ life cycle, which is severely constrained by strict time-to-market deadlines and tight budgets. This manuscript introduces a hardware-software framework meant for SCA research on FPGA targets. It delivers an IoT-class system-on-chip (SoC) that includes a RISC-V CPU, provides observability and controllability through an ad-hoc debug infrastructure to facilitate SCA attacks and evaluate the platform’s security, and streamlines the deployment of SCA countermeasures through dedicated hardware and software features such as a DFS actuator and FreeRTOS support. The open-source release of the framework includes the SoC, the scripts to configure the computing platform, compile a target application, and assess the SCA security, as well as a suite of state-of-the-art attacks and countermeasures. The goal is to foster its adoption and novel developments in the field, empowering designers and researchers to focus on studying SCA countermeasures and attacks while relying on a sound and stable hardware-software platform as the foundation for their research.},

  abstract     = {The growth of cloud computing has led to the widespread use of location-based services, such as spatial keyword queries, which return spatial data points within a given range that have the highest similarity in keyword sets to the user&#39;s. As the volume of spatial data increases, providers commonly outsource data to powerful cloud servers. Because cloud servers are untrustworthy, privacy-preserving keyword query schemes have been proposed. However, existing schemes consider only location queries or exact keyword matching. To address these issues, we propose the Privacy-Preserving Spatial Keyword Similarity Query Scheme (PPSKSQ), designed to search for spatial data points with the highest similarity while protecting the privacy of outsourced data, query requests, and results. First, we design two sub-protocols based on improved symmetric homomorphic encryption (iSHE): iSHE-SC for secure size comparison and iSHE-SIP for secure inner product computation. Then, we encode range information and integrate it with a quadtree to construct a novel index structure. Additionally, we use the Jaccard to measure similarity in conjunction with the iSHE-SC protocol, transforming similarity comparison into a matrix trace operation. Finally, rigorous security analysis and extensive simulation experiments confirm the flexibility, efficiency, and scalability of our scheme.},

To avoid attacks from unreliable service providers and requesters, Industrial Demilitarized Zone (IDMZ) is introduced in conjunction with firewalls to provide new communication modes between edge servers and industrial devices. As the number of tasks being offloaded to the edge side increases, optimal task offloading to balance the risk and the communication overhead with limited demilitarized buffer size becomes a challenge. Therefore, this paper establishes a mathematical model for secure task offloading in the Industrial Internet-of-Things considering dense communication with different communication modes. Then, a Parallel Gbest-centric differential evolution (P-G-DE) is designed to solve this task offloading problem with a heuristic-embedded initialization strategy, a modified Gbest-centric differential evolutionary operator and a circular-rotated parallelization scheme. The experimental results verify that the proposed method is capable of providing a high-quality solution with a lower risk and a shorter execution time in seconds, compared to six state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.},

This protocol securely computes the intersection of the designated party&#39;s set with the union of the sets of all other parties, which can be applied to scenarios such as contact tracing. MPSI-U leverages cloud servers to alleviate the computational burden placed on users, while guaranteeing privacy and security simultaneously for all involved parties with the threshold BGN cryptographic system. Furthermore, a comprehensive formal security analysis of the protocol was conducted under the semi-honest model to prove its resilience against potential security threats. Based on our performance analysis, MPSI-U exhibits favorable characteristics in terms of communication and computation overhead. This enhances the versatility of MPSI-U, rendering it a valuable solution that can be widely applied across various domains and scenarios.},

  abstract     = {The explosive growth in training data and model sizes has spurred the adoption of distributed deep learning (DL) in heterogeneous computing clusters. Efficiently scheduling distributed training jobs in such heterogeneous environments while ensuring they meet user-specified deadlines remains a critical challenge. While most existing works focus on reducing job completion time in homogeneous clusters, they pay little attention to meeting job deadlines in heterogeneous clusters. To address this issue, we propose Dancer (Deadline-Aware dyNamiC GPU allocation approach for Efficient Resource utilization), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts not only the number but the type of GPUs assigned to each job throughout its training lifecycle. Dancer aims to maximize the number of jobs meeting their deadlines in heterogeneous GPU clusters. It decouples job placement from resource allocation and formulates the scheduling optimization problem for maximizing the number of deadline-meeting jobs as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. To solve this ILP problem in real-time, we propose an online algorithm with a competitive ratio guarantee, leveraging primal-dual and dynamic programming techniques. Extensive trace-driven simulations based on real-world DL workloads demonstrate that Dancer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, improving the deadline satisfactory ratio up to 58.9%-74.2%.},

To address this problem, we propose a federated sensor-cloud architecture involving multiple SCSPs for provisioning high-quality Se-aaS. Moreover, for ensuring trust in such a distributed architecture, we propose the use of consortium blockchain to keep track of the activities of each SCSP and to automate several functionalities through Smart Contracts. Additionally, to ensure profitability and end-user satisfaction, we propose a composite scheme, named BRAIN, comprising of two parts. First, we define miner&#39;s score to select an optimal subset of SCSPs as miners periodically. Second, we propose a modified multiple-leaders-multiple-followers Stackelberg game-theoretic approach to decide the association of an optimal subset of SCSPs to each service. Thereafter, we evaluate the performance of BRAIN by comparing with three existing benchmark schemes through simulations. Simulation results depict that BRAIN outperforms existing schemes in terms of profits and resource consumption of SCSPs, and price charged from end-users.},

For example, in the critical domain of medical vaccine trials, where public health outcomes hinge on the analysis of sensitive patient data, the imperative to safeguard privacy has never been more pronounced. Traditional encryption methods, though effective at protecting data, often expose vulnerabilities during decryption and lack the ability to support granular data access and computation. One-way re-encryption schemes further impede the agility of data sharing, which is indispensable for the collaborative efforts of research institutions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel bidirectional re-encryption scheme for inner-product functional encryption (IPFE). Our scheme secures data while allowing computation and sharing in an encrypted state, preserving patient privacy without hindering research. By harnessing inner-product functional encryption, our approach allows authorized researchers to extract valuable insights from encrypted data, significantly enhancing privacy protections. Our scheme&#39;s security is predicated on the $l$-ABDHE (augmented bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent) assumption, ensuring robustness against chosen plaintext attacks within the standard model. This foundation not only secures the data but also yields compact ciphertext length, minimizing storage demands. We introduce a protocol specifically designed for medical vaccine trials, which leverages our bidirectional IB-IPFRE (Identity-Based Inner-Product Functional Re-Encryption) scheme. This protocol enhances data security, supports collaborative research, and maintains patient privacy. Its application in vaccine trials demonstrates the scheme&#39;s effectiveness in protecting sensitive information while enabling critical research insights.},

  abstract     = {The adoption of container-based cloud computing services has been prevalent, especially with the introduction of Kubernetes, which enables the automated deployment, scaling, and administration of applications in containers, hence boosting the popularity of containers. As a result, researchers have placed greater emphasis on container runtime security, notably investigating the efficacy of traditional techniques such as Capabilities, Seccomp, and Linux security modules in guaranteeing container security. However, due to the limitations imposed by the container environment, the results have been unsatisfactory. In addition, eBPF-based solutions face the problem of being unable to quickly load policies and affect real-time operations when faced with newer kernel vulnerabilities. This paper investigates the limitations of existing container security mechanisms. Additionally, it examines the specific constraints of these mechanisms in Kubernetes environments. The paper classifies container monitoring and obligatory access control into three distinct categories: system call access control, LSM hook access control, and kernel function access control. Therefore, we propose a technique for regulating container access with a variety of granularity levels. This technique is executed using eBPF and is tightly integrated with Kubernetes to collect relevant meta-information. In addition, we suggest implementing a consolidated routing method and employing function tail call chaining to overcome the limitation of eBPF in enforcing mandatory access control for containers. Lastly, we conducted a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness of the system&#39;s security using CVE-2022-0492 and to benchmark the system that had BPFGuard enabled. The results indicate that the average performance loss increased merely by 2.16%, demonstrating that there are no adverse effects on the container services. This suggests that greater security can be achieved at a minimal cost.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing number of devices, the demand for data computation is growing rapidly. In edge-cloud collaborative computing, tasks can be scheduled to servers as interdependent subtasks, enhancing performance through parallel computing. A task is executed in an executor, which must first initialize the runtime environment in a process called task startup. However, most existing research neglects the reuse of executors, leading to considerable delays during task startup. To address this issue, we model the edge-cloud collaborative task scheduling scenario considering executor reuse, task startup, and dependency relationships. We then formulate the dependent task scheduling problem with task startup. To meet real-time demands in edge-cloud collaborative computing, we propose ReflexPilot, an online task scheduling architecture featuring executor management. Building on this architecture, we introduce OTSA-PPO, a task scheduling algorithm based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and EMA, an advanced executor allocation algorithm. Under constraints of computational and communication resources, ReflexPilot leverages OTSA-PPO for online scheduling of dependent tasks based on current states, while EMA pre-creates and reuses executors to reduce the average task completion time. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ReflexPilot significantly reduces the average task completion time by 31% to 71% compared with existing baselines.},

In many cases, these tests result in highly variable observation models. A near-ubiquitous approach is to repeat many observations for each test independently, resulting in a distribution over the outcomes from each test given to each subject. Latent variable models (LVMs), if employed, are only added after data collection. In this paper, we explore the usage of LVMs to enable learning across many correlated variables simultaneously. We extend LVMs to the setting where observed data for each subject are a series of observations from many different distributions, rather than simple vectors to be reconstructed. By embedding test battery results for individuals in a latent space that is trained jointly across a population, we can leverage correlations both between disparate test data for a single participant and between multiple participants. We then propose an active learning framework that leverages this model to conduct more efficient cognitive test batteries. We validate our approach by demonstrating with real-time data acquisition that it performs comparably to conventional methods in making item-level predictions with fewer test items.},

To the best of our knowledge, this topic has yet to be well studied, which could potentially benefit lots of valuable cognitive applications such as autistic children diagnosis and criminal deception detection. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient cross-emotion anomaly detection approach via semanticinconsistency reasoning and hybrid contrastive learning (SIR-HCL), which is the first attempt to detect the anomalous emotional pairs across the audio-visual emotions. First, the proposed framework utilizes dual-branch network to obtain the deep emotional features in each modality, and then employs the shared residual block to derive the semantically compatible features. Subsequently, an efficient hybrid contrastive learning approach is designed to enlarge the semantic-inconsistency among abnormal emotional pair with different affective classes, while enhancing the semantic-consistency and increasing the feature correlation between normal emotional pair from the same affective class. At the same time, an efficient bidirectional learning scheme is employed to significantly improve the data utilization and a two-component Beta Mixture Model is adaptively utilized to reason the anomalous emotion pairs. Extensive experiments evaluated on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed SIR-HCL method can well detect the anomalous emotional pairs across audio-visual emotional data, and brings substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art competing methods.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies on neurosteered hearing aids employed a neural decoder to reconstruct the speech stimulus from EEG signals to establish the attended sound source. However, this approach presents several limitations, such as the need for clean speech stimuli—which are often unavailable in real-world scenarios—and long processing windows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel EEG-based neurosteered speaker extraction (ENSE) mechanism that performs a joint action of speech separation and direct attention classification without the need for explicit speech stimulus reconstruction. Specifically, a typical speech separation model is first pretrained on a large speech corpus. We then train a speech-EEG match detector to perform direct attention classification by detecting which of the separated speech stimuli, or which of the speakers, induces the observed EEG signals. Experimental results show that ENSE effectively identifies and extracts the attended speech while suppressing unattended ones in a mixture. With time-domain speech separation and direct attention classification, ENSE offers a low-latency solution that marks an important step towards practical neurosteered hearing prostheses.},

  abstract     = {A desirable property of generalist robots is the ability to both bootstrap diverse skills and solve new long-horizon tasks in open-ended environments without human intervention. Recent advancements have shown that large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast-scale semantic knowledge about the world to enable long-horizon robot planning. However, they are typically restricted to reasoning high-level instructions and lack world grounding, which makes it difficult for them to coordinately bootstrap and acquire new skills in unstructured environments. To this end, we propose AutoSkill, a hierarchical system that empowers the physical robot to automatically learn to cope with new long-horizon tasks by growing an open-ended skill library without hand-crafted rewards. AutoSkill consists of two key components: 1) an in-context skill chain generation and new skill bootstrapping guided by LLMs that inform the robot of discrete and interpretable skill instructions for skill retrieval and augmentation within the skill library, and 2) a zero-shot language-modulated reward scheme in conjunction with a meta prompter facilitates online new skill acquisition via expert-free supervision aligned with proposed skill directives. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and realistic environments demonstrate AutoSkill’s superiority over other LLM-based planners as well as hierarchical methods in expediting online learning for novel manipulation tasks.},

This study analyzed EEG data from 13 PD patients with FoG and 13 healthy controls (HCs) during a pedaling task. 8 key brain regions were selected to measure power density and connectivity across different frequency bands and time windows. Using graph theory, the study examined neural changes between FoG patients and HCs, focusing on metrics: clustering coefficient, degree, nodal efficiency, and global efficiency. FoG patients had decreased δ and θ activity in the Precentral-L and Frontal-Mid-L regions and increased β activity in the Precentral-R and Postcentral regions during motor initiation (0–400ms post-cue). FoG patients also exhibited decreased connectivity in the bilateral Frontal-Mid, Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), Postcentral, and Precentral regions in the δ and θ bands during motor initiation. During motor execution (0-1s post-cue), fewer significant connections were observed in the α band in these regions. Furthermore, FoG patients also had a decreased clustering coefficient in δ, θ, and α bands during motor initiation and in the θ band during motor execution in regions like SMA-L, Frontal-Mid-R, and Postcentral-R. The nodal efficiency increased in the regions of Precentral-R and Postcentral-R (δ band), Postcentral-L (θ band) for motor initiation, and Precentral-L (θ band) for motor execution. FoG in PD is characterized by the changes of brain functional network, including the decrease of δ and θ activities and the increase of β activity in some brain regions during gait initiation and the abnormal network reorganization. These findings may help to understand the neural mechanisms of FoG in Parkinson’s disease and could guide future brain stimulation studies.},

Over time, extensive research in neuroscience and psychology has established the CM as a widely accepted model. In this work, we introduce a new goal-directed cognitive map (GDCM) model that takes a non-traditional approach to spatial mapping for robot navigation and path planning. Unlike conventional models, GDCM does not require complete environmental exploration to construct a graph for navigation purposes. Inspired by biological navigation strategies, such as the use of landmarks, Euclidean distance, random motion, and reward-driven behavior. The GDCM can navigate complex, static environments efficiently without needing to explore the entire workspace. The model utilizes known cell types (head direction, speed, border, grid, and place cells) that constitute the cognitive map, arranged in a unique configuration. Each cell model is designed to emulate its biological counterpart in a simple, computationally efficient way. Through simulation-based comparisons, this innovative cognitive map graph-building approach demonstrates more efficient navigation than traditional models that require full exploration. Furthermore, GDCM consistently outperforms several established path planning and navigation algorithms by finding better paths.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal emotion recognition is gaining significant attention for ability to fuse complementary information from diverse physiological and behavioral signals, which benefits the understanding of emotional disorders. However, challenges arise in multi-modal fusion due to uncertainties inherent in different modalities, such as complex signal coupling and modality heterogeneity. Furthermore, the feature distribution drift in inter-subject emotion recognition hinders the generalization ability of the method and significantly degrades performance on new individuals. To address above issues, we propose a cross-subject multi-modal emotion robust recognition framework that effectively extracts subject-independent intrinsic emotional identification information from heterogeneous multi-modal emotion data. Firstly, we develop a multi-channel network with self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to capture modality-specific and complementary features among different modalities, respectively. Secondly, we incorporate contrastive loss into the multi-channel attention network to enhance feature extraction across different channels, thereby facilitating the disentanglement of emotion-specific information. Moreover, a self-expression learning-based network layer is devised to enhance feature discriminability and subject alignment. It aligns samples in a discriminative space using block diagonal matrices and maps multiple individuals to a shared subspace using a block off-diagonal matrix. Finally, attention is used to merge multi-channel features, and MLP is employed for classification. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion datasets confirm that our proposed approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art in terms of emotion recognition accuracy, with particularly significant gains observed in the challenging cross-subject multi-modal recognition scenarios.},

Most previous studies on detecting artificial intelligence-generated fake videos only utilize visual modality or audio modality. While some methods exploit audio and visual modalities to detect forged videos, they have not been comprehensively evaluated on multimodal datasets of deepfake videos involving acoustic and visual manipulations, and are mostly based on convolutional neural networks with low detection accuracy. Considering that human cognition instinctively integrates multisensory information including audio and visual cues to perceive and interpret content and the success of transformer in various fields, this study introduces the audio-visual transformer-based ensemble network (AVTENet). This innovative framework tackles the complexities of deepfake technology by integrating both acoustic and visual manipulations to enhance the accuracy of video forgery detection. Specifically, the proposed model integrates several purely transformer-based variants that capture video, audio, and audio-visual salient cues to reach a consensus in prediction. For evaluation, we use the recently released benchmark multimodal audio-video FakeAVCeleb dataset. For a detailed analysis, we evaluate AVTENet, its variants, and several existing methods on multiple test sets of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Testset-I and Testset-II of the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We also compare AVTENet against humans in detecting video forgery. The results show that AVTENet significantly outperforms humans.},

The spike-based and event-driven computation inherent in the spiking neural network (SNN) provides an energy-saving solution for AER object recognition. However, SNN with spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule has not achieved satisfying AER object recognition performance. This work proposes an SNN-based encoder-decoder model to improve the recognition performance of AER objects. An STDP-based locally connected spiking neural network (LC-SNN) is proposed as an encoder to extract rich spatiotemporal features from AER event flows more flexibly. After the encoder extracts and learns primary features, we propose a fully connected spiking neural network (FC-SNN) based on the reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) learning rule as a decoder to learn higher-level features for classification. In addition, we improved the winner-take-all (WTA) mechanisms and R-STDP learning rule in the decoder based on the reward and punish decision, enabling the network to perform better. The experiments are performed on the N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, and the DVS Gesture datasets, improving the accuracy of the best existing plasticity-based SNN by 0.19%, 0.27% and 1.35%, respectively.},

In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.},

This paper proposes a distributed identification algorithm for local subsystems to identify their parameter matrices under local observation with a guarantee of convergence. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of local identification. We prove that by injecting an independent random signal to the local subsystem, which is easy to implement, using a simple least-squares method to identify local systems can achieve convergent identification for a certain probability. Meanwhile, we give the minimal level of variance of the injected signal that can still guarantee the convergence of the identification. Next, we add the designed input as a vector of Gaussian noises with decreasing variance to a known controller, proving that it can converge to the original controller. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

One should expect that this structure can be similarly exploited for other important tasks like differentiation. Differentiating through optimization programs has in fact attracted much interest and led to numerous applications, from optimization-based layers in machine learning models to complex design problems formulated as bilevel programs. However, existing differentiation methodologies rarely leverage problem structure. In this work, we propose an efficient framework for computing gradients of constraint-coupled optimization problems. Gradients are decomposed into local components—computed in a distributed manner—and a coupling term—handled by a central coordinator. This centralized framework achieves significant computational gains, especially for large systems, and we provide sufficient conditions to ensure its validity. Building on this, we develop a decentralized algorithm—eliminating the need for a central coordinator–by leveraging the exponential decay of sensitivities in graph-structured problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the decentralized scheme allows for accurate and efficient estimation of important emissions metrics on large dynamic power system models.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a distributed algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium in a class of non-cooperative convex games with partial-decision information. Our method employs a distributed projected gradient play approach alongside consensus dynamics, with individual agents minimizing their local costs through gradient steps and local information exchange with neighbors via a time-varying directed communication network. Addressing time-varying directed graphs presents significant challenges. Existing methods often circumvent this by focusing on static graphs or specific types of directed graphs or by requiring the stepsizes to scale with the Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors. In contrast, we establish novel results that provide a contraction property for the mixing terms associated with time-varying row-stochastic weight matrices. Our approach explicitly expresses the contraction coefficient based on the characteristics of the weight matrices and graph connectivity structures, rather than implicitly through the second-largest singular value of the weight matrix as in prior studies. The established results facilitate proving geometric convergence of the proposed algorithm and advance convergence analysis for distributed algorithms in time-varying directed communication networks. Numerical results on a Nash-Cournot game demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

For the heterogeneous agents involving nonlinear underactuated coupled dynamics and limited communication capabilities, a unified event-triggered data-driven control method is proposed including a distributed event-triggered observer for interaction data recovery under DoS attacks and robust controllers to achieve distributed formation. The control policies and disturbances including couplings and external disturbances are modeled as performance optimizers and adversarial players in the zero-sum game. Robust optimal policies are obtained by developing off-policy reinforcement learning without information on system dynamical parameters. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under DoS attacks, and Zeno behavior for all agents can be excluded. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is validated by presenting two simulation examples of a distributed heterogeneous formation.},

The objective is to make dynamic AUVs encircle a given target with specific radius and velocity. The network topology among all AUVs is modeled by a directed graph containing a spanning tree, and the target is only known to one AUV. Estimator-based approaches with the backstepping technique are proposed for cases with or without communication. First, in communication-based networks, AUVs are allowed to transmit information via communication devices. A dynamic control law consisting of a distributed estimator is proposed. By analyzing with perturbed system method, the multi-vehicle system achieves global exponential stability instead of asymptotic stability. Second, in communication-denied networks, AUVs depend only on the relative measurements from the onboard sensors. A dynamic control law consisting of a decentralized estimator is proposed. By small-gain analysis, the global asymptotic stability for the multi-vehicle system is established. To demonstrate effectiveness, simulation results are presented.},

This partial information is used to estimate the gradient values at each moment. The overall closed-loop system is an interconnected system involving the module of optimal coordinators and the heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems with different timescales and thus is studied by using singular perturbation theory.

To tackle such a problem, the model-based distributed control scheme is developed via distributed continuous observer design. Subsequently, the data-driven distributed control scheme is proposed, which comprises a compensation term, an optimal feedback term, and a feedforward term. Specifically, a new kind of distributed adaptive continuous observers is first constructed based on the adaptive control theory to estimate the leader&#39;s state, output, and plant matrices, the off-policy learning method is then employed to seek the optimal control gain and identify the unknown system dynamics, thereby facilitating the construction of the control protocols. It is proved that the multi-agent system driven by the designed control laws can achieve output consensus tracking.

To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed- feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed- feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.},

We first formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), then propose an efficient polynomial time relaxation-adjustment-rounding algorithm for solving the problem. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment step, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal points of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries in the solution. We establish mathematically that our algorithm yields solutions that are near optimal for a finite number of loads and with its sub-optimality independent of the number of loads. Consequently, the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in a per-load cost sense when the number of loads increases. Despite the gap between the MICP and its convex relaxation, we establish that the solution of the proposed algorithm can be decentralized by marginal prices of the convex relaxation. We also develop and analyze variants of the proposed algorithm for settings with uncertainty and with time-varying realistic load shapes. Finally, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm in a case study for the non-preemptive scheduling of electric vehicles charging loads.},

In general, safety (i.e., collision avoidance) could be guaranteed by the use of a control barrier function (CBF) as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, the existence of conflicting safety constraints from multiple agents could lead to a feasibility problem (i.e., the absence of a feasible control command) in distributed optimal flocking control algorithms. To deal with this issue, we propose two effective feasibility enhancement approaches. First, we develop a high-order CBF associated with the collision risk to alleviate the burden of distributed safety constraints on agents with a high risk of collision. Second, to enhance feasibility, a relaxation method is used to enlarge the allowable control space of agents. In particular, to decrease the number of optimization variables in the relaxation method, a selective strategy is adopted. This involves applying the relaxation method only to specific CBF based on the decision variable related to the overlap of admissible control spaces among agents. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority and validity of the proposed optimal flocking algorithm compared with existing approaches.},

The leaders perform trajectory scaling in order to cope with velocity limits of the single robots. Once the trajectories for the centroid and the formation are estimated, each agent can compute its own reference trajectory and a local control loop is designed to track it. An approach to map the velocity constraints of each agent to the velocity limits at the task level is developed. Then, a trajectory scaling algorithm is adopted to ensure velocity constraints fulfillment. The stability and performance properties are rigorously analyzed under two different assumptions about the planned trajectories.

The divergence caused by nonconvexity is handled by utilizing a momentum-based system, and the distributed computation of nonlinearly-coupled optimization information as well as the distributed comparison of global function values is dealt with by introducing estimation state variables. Then, combined with time-base generators, the proposed multi-agent system is proven to be stable at a local optimal solution within a predefined time.

The proposed approach integrates heterogeneous graph convolutional networks with a trainable hypergraph aggregation model to capture complex, high-order interactions. To overcome the challenge of labeled data scarcity, HHG-Bot employs a meta-learning paradigm that enhances the model’s generalization capability across different bot types.

  abstract     = {User trajectories are denser and highly dynamic in mobile crowdsensing (MCS) system, rendering traditional privacy budget allocation schemes insufficient. Additionally, the protection of semantic location privacy is often neglected in these schemes, making them vulnerable to inference attacks. To address these deficiencies, a user trajectory privacy protection strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this article. First, a differential privacy-based user trajectory privacy protection algorithm (DP-upps) is designed to protect the privacy by perturbing the extracted trajectory feature points. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based privacy budget allocation algorithm (DRL-pbas) is introduced. The privacy budget is dynamically adjusted by deep reinforcement learning option to continuously adapt to environmental changes and maximize benefits. After that, a DRL-pbas based user privacy protection strategy (DRL-UPPS) is proposed, integrating semantic location privacy protection. This approach combines the previous two algorithms, allowing the privacy budget to be allocated in a way that effectively balances the protection of physical and semantic location privacy and data quality. Ultimately, a large number of simulation experiments are conducted based on real datasets. The experiments demonstrate that DRL-UPPS can effectively balance privacy protection and data quality, resisting the privacy attacks. Compared with other strategies, DRL-UPPS improves comprehensive privacy protection capability by approximately 10% and data utility by approximately 8%.},

  abstract     = {The level of service (LOS) serves as a crucial metric in assessing the efficiency of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Precise forecasting of LOS is vital to improving the service quality provided by ITSs. However, within a transportation network, the LOS at each node typically exhibits spatial and temporal correlations due to the complex dynamics of traffic patterns. This poses a significant difficulty in accurately predicting traffic LOS. In this article, we propose a deep learning model, namely spatiotemporal cross-attention neural network (STCANN), to predict the LOS of a transportation network. On the one hand, the spatiotemporal dependencies between network nodes are captured through a set of stacked spatial and temporal cross-attention modules. On the other hand, the nonlinear interactions between traffic flow and speed are also resolved using a deliberate cross-attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we conduct experiments on two public datasets available from California highways. The results demonstrate that the proposed STCANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy. The findings show that the incorporation of the cross-attention mechanism into the spatiotemporal neural network architecture shows great promise in improving the accuracy and reliability of LOS prediction.},

However, most existing graph embedding methods focus on extracting node-level embeddings, while ignoring these evolutions. Therefore, these methods inadequately consider the impact of trends on the overall graph. Moreover, there are a large number of nodes in temporal graphs, which make it difficult to generate effective graph embeddings directly by aggregating dynamic node embeddings. In this study, we propose a novel temporal attention network for learning graph-level embedding learning called GraphTAN. Specifically, the proposed model employs pooling attention to select crucial nodes and filter out noisy ones for each snapshot, thereby enhancing the quality of aggregated graph embeddings. Furthermore, we design a graph-level temporal attention mechanism to effectively extract temporal graph embeddings, capturing trends and patterns across snapshots. The proposed model is evaluated on three downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTAN captures both the topology structure and fine-grained trend effectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods with big margins on multiple tasks over several real networks.},

Further, a key opinion leader (KOL) indicator system model is proposed to quantify the key opinion leaders’ metrics, and an information forwarding model that collaborates with the KOL indicator system and public opinion orientation is established to simulate information spread in real social networks. The results show that the information forwarding model performs excellently in predicting the spread of public opinion, and the cluster social network model aligns well with the topological structure of real social networks. Without considering positive and negative interventions, the optimal intervention period is when the total spread time proportion is $15\%\leq \tau\leq 32\%$. During this period, enhancing or suppressing information spread can achieve the best results. Additionally, it was discovered during the experiments that higher activity levels among opinion leaders might be more important than greater influence for information spread, often affecting the entire public opinion spread process.},

However, the diversity of carriers and technologies has led to a huge gap between the training scenarios and actual scenarios of detection methods. This makes it difficult for supervision-based detection frameworks to identify new malware variants and complicates threat response. We propose a novel method that integrates frequency domain techniques with feature alignment to enhance variant malware detection, reducing distribution differences between labeled (source) and new (target) samples. By converting malware into grayscale images and applying discrete cosine transform (DCT) for improved feature extraction, followed by feature extraction via a deep residual network from both domains, our model systematically aligns features. This alignment is achieved through a tailored domain adaptation technique involving the minimization of classification and domain alignment losses, which ensures the consistent learning of features across varied domains. Such rigorous alignment not only enhances detection accuracy for both known and variant malware but also supports simultaneous detection across significant distribution differences. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models under consistent and inconsistent domain distributions. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves accuracy by an average of 1.4% on the BIG2015 dataset, 3.2% on the MDA dataset, 2.75% on the Malimg dataset, and also achieves the best performance on the MaleVis dataset, with similar gains in precision, recall, and F1-score across all datasets.},

Prior efforts in disaster event management have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these efforts encounter difficulties when focusing on specific events and dealing with class-imbalance domain adaptation (CDA), often leading to modifications in data distribution. This article introduces a solution named class-imbalanced adversarial neural network (CADNN) to address UDA challenges in emergency events across diverse domains. First, an adversarial domain adaptation model is developed to achieve cross-domain feature representation. Second, unlike existing methods that rely on data augmentation, a cross-domain interpolation model is designed to generate aligned pairwise samples. This ensures that the generated samples preserve the original data distribution by preserving the sample centroid. Third, the sample interpolation is integrated with the adversarial domain adaptation model, optimizing the overall loss function to enhance generalization performance. Experimental results on four open-source datasets demonstrate that CADNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in recognizing emergency event information.},

There are now a good number of studies that focus on identifying hateful and offensive content in social media posts. The social media content is often analyzed through automated algorithmic approaches, with respect to being unsuitable or harmful for different groups such as women and children. There is, however, a noticeable gap in the exploration of positive content, particularly in the case of multimodal content such as GIFs. Therefore, the present work attempted to address this gap by introducing a high-quality annotated dataset of animated GIFs. The dataset provides for two subtasks: 1) subtask 1 involves binary classification, determining whether a GIF provides emotional support; and 2) subtask 2 involves multiclass classification, wherein the GIFs are categorized into three different emotional support categories. The data annotation quality is assessed using Fleiss&#39; kappa. Various unimodal models, utilizing text-only and image-only approaches, are implemented. Additionally, an effective multimodal approach is proposed that combines visual and textual information for detecting emotional support in animated GIFs. Both sequence and frame-level visual features are extracted from animated GIFs and utilized for classification tasks. The proposed multimodal long-term spatiotemporal model employs a weighted late fusion technique. The results obtained show that the proposed multimodal model outperformed the implemented unimodal models for both subtasks. The proposed LTST model achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.8304 and 0.7180 for subtask 1 and subtask 2, respectively.

  abstract     = {Personalized decentralized federated learning (PDFL) has emerged recently to address the problem of single point of failure and data heterogeneity in traditional centralized federated learning. However, existing works on PDFL still have two challenges that urgently need to be solved. First, model updates exposed by point-to-point communication during collaborative training in PDFL may disclose sensitive information about clients. Second, the distributed structure makes PDFL vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can disrupt the network by introducing poisoned data or faulty behaviors. In this article, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Byzantine-resilient approach to effectively address the dual challenges of privacy and security in PDFL. In particular, each client is required to build a unique critical parameter index set by evaluating the importance of its model parameters and broadcasting it to neighbors. To improve Byzantine resilience, we propose a novel weight allocation scheme based on the critical parameter index set for clients to alleviate the negative impact of Byzantine neighbors in the model aggregation. To enhance privacy protection while boosting personalization, we combine with model decoupling and execute a clipping-robust personalized local training for each client to achieve user-level differential privacy. We finally conduct exhaustive experiments on FEMNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and various settings. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to five state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed method achieves excellent performance with user-level differential privacy guarantee in PDFL and implements additionally superior Byzantine robustness in adversarial settings.},

  abstract     = {The bullwhip effect, driven by uncertain customer demands, often causes the supply chain network operation to deviate from the stationary level, i.e., the instability nonlinear operational dynamics. This article proposes a fuzzy-based bull-whip effect mitigation strategy to stabilize supply chain network operations, thereby assisting risk decision-making. First, a new fuzzy control model of the bullwhip effect is proposed. Compared with the existing benchmark models, the proposed model has two potential advantages. 1) It is more general to quantify operational and behavioral causes simultaneously rather than only one. 2) Proactively incorporating operational experience into the feedback has the potential to enhance control performance against bullwhip effect. Then, the studied system can be deemed as a closed-loop control system. Furthermore, a series of criteria are provided for the existence of fuzzy control strategies to stabilize the closed-loop system with the bullwhip effect reduction. Finally, simulations verify the advantages and effectiveness of proposed strategies.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the ownership of shared social images has attracted increasingly serious privacy violation concerns, thus the protection of these images is particularly important. Further, due to the increasing value of deep learning (DL) models in social media platforms, there is an urgent demand to protect their copyright and prevent privacy leakage. Currently, relatively limited research has been carried out in the field of ownership protection for deep neural network (DNN) and, at the same time, related social images. This article presents a robust copyright protection system and method for the DNN model and related social images to verify ownership. Initially, split-way training of our model was established, based on cover and encoded secret images, to reduce or eradicate privacy leakage. Then, the sender sends only encoded vector information instead of raw data to adversarial-based embedding and extraction networks. Next, we embed a secret mark in DL embedding and extraction models, using interpolation-based watermarking to verify the ownership of suspicious models if any piracy or infringements occur. Last, the intended receiver extracts the hidden information using the extraction networks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed system is more robust and secure against attacks than state-of-the-art methods, making it beneficial for social media and other practical applications. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average peak signal-to-noise noise ratio, normalized correlation, number of pixel change rate, and unified average change intensity, with improvements of 47.25%, 43.25%, 17.89%, and 14.23%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The limitations of acquisition equipment often result in scene image data of limited size, posing a challenge for comprehensive analysis of social image datasets. Advances in generative models have introduced image outpainting techniques that expand the size of acquired social scene images, thereby enhancing the value of social image data. Stable diffusion (SD), which benefits from the guidance of caption prompts, shows excellent performance in image outpainting. However, its heavy reliance on manual prompts leads to a significant drawback: a decrease in the quality of generated images without prompts. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel self-prompt diffusion model for image outpainting that extrapolates images based on the semantics of the source image, thereby removing the dependence on manual prompts. Specifically, we design a prompt autoencoder that uses an autoregressive transformer to map prompt embeddings into their semantic space, facilitating the construction of a semantic decoder. The semantic decoder and prompt embeddings are then cooptimized within the proposed prompt embedding network, allowing the mapping of image features to the stable diffusion prompt embeddings. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent generative capabilities of diffusion models, we introduce a seam line regeneration mechanism to address the common problem of seam lines when splicing input and generated images. Comparative experiments on the Places2 and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on visual quality metrics and is adaptable to the stable diffusion model without additional fine-tuning.},

In this case, tasks are exclusively handled by the administrative ES, resulting in only marginal improvements in service quality, such as energy consumption and task delay. To fully exploit the advantages of edge computing, this article investigates the cooperation among ESs within CPSS and proposes a cooperative algorithm, named MATORA, to exploit a further performance gain by calculating the task offloading and resource allocation decisions. First, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a time-varying mixed integer nonlinear programming problem; then, we utilize the multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to learn the action policy. Second, the MATORA novelly builds reputation model for each ES to obtain insightful knowledge based on service quality, enhancing the training efficiency of MADRL. Thirdly, we simulate a digital twin-based virtual system to monitor the physical network, in which a risk-free, centralized training environment is provided for the multiagent algorithm.

  abstract     = {With the increasingly rapid aging of the global population, the population of middle-aged and older people with disabilities has been increasing, and thus disability has gradually been highlighted as an important issue for the middle-aged and elderly population. In this article, a 1-D convolutional neural network (1DCNN) model incorporating the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), i.e., the 1DCBAMCNN model, is designed and applied to the risk assessment of disability in the elderly. The 1DCNN effectively captures both local and global features within the data through convolutional operations. By directly analyzing tabular data related to disabilities in the elderly, it circumvents the information loss and increased computational complexity associated with dimensionality transformation. Additionally, the CBAM, which comprises channel attention and spatial attention modules, facilitates fine-grained feature selection and weighting of the input data. The integration of these two components not only leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of the 1DCNN but also utilizes the attention mechanism of CBAM to delve deeper into the abstract characteristics of the data, significantly enhancing the model&#39;s sensitivity to data features and effectively improving predictive performance. The model proposed in this article (1DCBAMCNN) experiments using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) dataset, and the model is compared with deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), artificial neural network, and long short-term memory, as well as with the CNN model that incorporates the squeeze-and-excitation module, the efficient channel attention module, and the self-attention, respectively. The experimental results show that 1DCBAMCNN has better prediction results on the test set compared to other models, with accuracy and F1 score reaching 92.46% and 80.25%, respectively. The 1DCBAMCNN model presented in this article can more effectively predict disabilities within the elderly population, providing a basis for diagnosis and treatment.},

Recently, graph structure learning (GSL) have been used to model the complex relationships between candidates and experts in both professional fields and avoidance strategies. Most existing GSL models aim to learn the structure of homogeneous graph. However, they cannot learn the structure of heterogeneous graph (HG) because they ignore the complex relation attributes in HG. To fill this gap, we propose a relation enhanced heterogeneous graph structure learning (RE-HGSL) model that refines HG structure and learns node and relation representations simultaneously for expert selection in academic evaluation. The main idea of RE-HGSL is refining the HG structure by reconstructing edges through the similarity of relation triplet &lt;head node, relation, tail node&gt;. Specifically, we first set relation representation vector for each kind of relation to capture multiple relation attributes and learn node and relation representations to preserve multiple semantic information. Then, we construct multiple feature graphs where the edges are constructed according to the similarity of the relation triplet. Finally, the refined graph structure is generated by aggregating the original graph and the feature graphs, which maintains not only the part of original vital structure but also the refined edges.},

However, insufficient consideration of both inter- and intra-layer weights in existing research has limited the effectiveness of node identification methods. To address this gap, we propose a novel algorithm, coupling weighted intra-layer and inter-layer influence factors (CWIIIF), which accurately identifies nodes that exert significant influence in multilayer networks. The algorithm integrates weighted intra- and inter-layer influence factors, taking into account the unique properties of multilayer network structures. First, we define a set of layer weight influence parameters, including active nodes, active paths, and communication intersections between layers, to determine the weight of each network layer. We then calculate the intra-layer influence of each node using a combination of K-shell and betweenness centrality methods. Finally, we introduce a set of coupled equations that convert the intra-layer influence vectors into scalar values by incorporating the weights of each layer, producing a final influence score for each node. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted four comparative experiments across nine real-world and one synthetic multilayer networks. The results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms nine classical and state-of-the-art methods for identifying influential nodes.},

We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links.We found: 1) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9% compared to baselines with competitive area under curve (AUC); 2) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets; and 3) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.},

However, GAN struggle with minority data that have few instances and lack accurate statistical characteristics. To mitigate this problem, a hierarchical oversampling based on Cohen’s criterion (HiOC) is proposed for extremely imbalanced data with missing information. The main idea of HiOC is to use Cohen’s criterion to design a primary rebalancing rate by considering data size, distribution, and feature information comprehensively. Then, HiOC including two stages to achieve the data balance. In the first stage, to enhance the data variety, especially for instances on the borderline as well as make a delicate imputation for missing information, a progressive oversampling method in the framework of fuzzy information decomposition (FID) is proposed. The progressive FID (PFID) introduces a small bias to expand the prediction region’s bounds and fulfills imputation step by step using newly sampled data. In the second stage, to greatly keep the original data distribution, an information granularity (IG) incorporated fuzzy c-means clustering strategy is developed. Afterward, a GAN based onMahalanobis distance performs over-sampling in each cluster to achieve ultimate data balance with unbiased evaluation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to several real datasets, demonstrating higher classification accuracy compared with existing algorithms, thus proving the applicability of the research results in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Crowd simulation plays a crucial role in the prevention and management of public safety events in cities. However, the inherent complexity and diverse nature of human behaviors present substantial challenges in developing realistic and precise simulation models. Traditional rule-based physical models are limited by their reliance on fixed physical formulas and parameters, which hinders their ability to effectively handle the complex tasks associated with crowd simulation. Although deep learning methods have emerged as a promising solution, existing approaches largely emphasize pedestrian trajectory generation while struggling with interpretability and real-time dynamic simulation requirements. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel data-driven crowd simulation framework that integrates physics-informed machine learning (PIML) with navigation potential fields. Our approach takes advantage of the strengths of both physical models and PIML. Specifically, we design an innovative physics-informed spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (PI-STGCN) as a data-driven module. Leveraging PI-STGCN, pedestrian movement trends can be accurately predicted in real-time during the simulation. Additionally, we construct a physical model of navigation potential fields based on flow field theory to guide pedestrian movements, thereby reinforcing physical constraints during the simulation. In our framework, navigation potential fields are dynamically computed and updated based on the movement trends predicted by the PI-STGCN, while the updated crowd dynamics, guided by these fields, subsequently feed back into the PI-STGCN. Comparative experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world datasets across five scenes demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing rule-based methods in both accuracy and fidelity. The similarity between the simulated and actual pedestrian trajectories improves by 10.8%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits enhanced adaptability and superior interpretability compared with methods that rely solely on deep learning for trajectory generation.},

  abstract     = {In deep contrastive graph clustering, many methods tend to adopt a singular enhancement strategy, focusing either on structural or attribute augmentation. This limited approach constrains the model’s ability to integrate multidimensional information, resulting in an imbalance in information utilization. Furthermore, the randomness involved in the selection of negative samples may lead to blurred distinctions between positive and negative samples. Therefore, we introduce a graph attention-based dual enhancement multiview clustering (GA-DE-MVC). The GA-DE-MVC first encodes structure and attributes through attention mechanisms and fully connected layers to achieve dual enhancement of structure and attributes. Then, it selects the farthest sample as the negative sample based on the Euclidean distance between cluster centers, to alleviate the randomness in negative sample selection, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness between positive and negative samples.The experimental results on six datasets surpass existing algorithms, verifying the effectiveness of the GA-DE-MVC algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Research indicates significant differences in the voice and facial expressions of individuals with depression compared to healthy individuals. Consequently, many studies have begun using audio-visual data for automatic depression detection (ADD). Despite significant progress, numerous challenges remain. During feature extraction, many studies fail to capture crucial spatiotemporal information for depression diagnosis, leading to decreased feature quality. In the modality fusion stage, many methods assume that the semantic information of different modalities is temporally aligned, which is not the case. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a linear spatiotemporal detector (LSTD) to model spatiotemporal information through detection and ensemble, enhancing feature quality. To tackle the second challenge, a cross-modal temporal aligner (CMTA) is proposed, using cross-modal attention for alignment before modality fusion to promote thorough fusion. LSTD and CMTA form the proposed spatiotemporal information modeling and modal alignment (SIMMA) framework. Extensive experiments on five depression datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2017, AVEC2019, and CMDep) demonstrate that our method outperforms previous studies in effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Information diffusion prediction plays a pivotal role in the analysis of information propagation across social networks. Many existing methods rely on learning social homophily solely from users’ social connections as a single diffusion dependency to drive information diffusion. Moreover, these approaches often capture temporal influence from cascades within discrete time intervals, which might be inadequate in describing complex diffusion processes and can limit prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach with augmented diffusion dependency and multigranularity temporal influence (ADDMT) for information diffusion prediction. Our method strategically leverages the interactive regularity implicit in historical diffusion cascades. This information is integrated with social homophily through a cross-graph convolution network (GCN) to augment the diffusion dependency among users. Furthermore, we introduce multiple overlapping sliding windows to partition diffusion cascades. Adjacent cascade slices exhibit 50% overlap, enhancing semantic and structural coherence. In addition, we employ the combination of hypergraph convolution networks (HGCNs) and temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture multigranularity temporal influence within cascades. This design enables our model to further discern evolutionary trends and ephemeral fluctuations in users’ preferences across time intervals. The experimental results, obtained from comprehensive evaluations on four realistic datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. In particular, our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models, as evidenced by improved metrics such as Hits@K and MAP@K. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of ADDMT in predicting information diffusion in social networks.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a model using a minimal number of samples and subsequently apply this model to recognize unseen classes. Recently, metric-based methods mainly focus on exploring the relationship between the support set and the query set through attention mechanism in solving FSL problems. However, these methods typically employ unidirectional computation when calculating the attention relationship between support and query. This unidirectional approach not only limits the depth and breadth of knowledge acquisition but may also lead to mismatched patches between support and query, thereby affecting the overall performance of the model. In this article, we propose a bidirectional patch-aware attention network for few-shot learning (BPAN) to address this issue. First, we extract subimages via grid cropping and feed them into the learned feature extractor to obtain patch features. Moreover, self-attention is used to assign different weights to patch features and reconstruct them. Then, PFCAM is proposed to mutually explore the patch feature relationship between the support set and the support set, further reconstruct the patch features, and aggregate multiple patch features of each image into one feature through a learnable parameter matrix for the purpose of prediction. Finally, the template for each class is constructed to extend the results of PFCAM to the few-shot classification scenario. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that BPAN achieves superior performance.},

Current natural language processing (NLP) techniques use models trained on datasets to detect rumors. However, these datasets often contain inherent biases, which, as has been demonstrated in other NLP tasks, can negatively impact the accuracy of the results. This study confirms the presence of significant bias in rumor detection datasets. Given the intertwined and complex nature of bias and rumors, both of which play a crucial role in assessing the trustworthiness of online content, the article argues that improving detection models should not only focus on performance but also prioritize detecting biased rumors. Addressing this dual challenge is essential to prevent rumor creators from exploiting biases to enhance the spread of false information. To tackle this issue at the data level, this study proposes integrating bias attributes into the training datasets, thereby improving the ability of models to identify biased rumors. Through experiments conducted across multiple rumor detection models, the approach has been shown to enhance the detection of biased rumors in both Chinese and English datasets without compromising overall detection accuracy. This method might be helpful in reducing the spread of biased rumors online, contributing to a healthier information ecosystem.},

Key findings include the identification of dynamic patterns such as stationarity, inertia, and polarization tendencies in journal performance over time. The experiments further demonstrate the robustness of journal dynamics against moderate external disturbances, such as self-citation behavior, and highlight a gradual weakening of volatility in journal citation indices.

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, motion prediction is vital for anticipating the behaviors of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users, enabling the system to make accurate decisions and plan driving paths effectively. Current motion prediction models typically utilize an encoder–decoder architecture, and many methods focus on the decoder’s design because the decoder is directly responsible for generating future trajectories. However, this often leads to neglecting the encoder’s capability to represent input information, resulting in a failure to provide the decoder with accurate and semantic prior features, which impacts the overall prediction accuracy. Contrastive learning, as an effective approach for enhancing feature representation through cross-modal alignment, demonstrates strong generalization and reduced reliance on labeled data. Therefore, we propose a motion prediction network named DMotion that leverages contrastive learning to align trajectory features with numeric signals and textual descriptions, improving the model’s representational capacity and enriching contextual priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use textual descriptions as a modality to enhance motion prediction accuracy. We sparsify dense agent attribute labels, such as historical distance and angular variation, to enable these prior features learned by the model through contrastive learning. By investigating the impact of numeric and textual supervision signals on contrastive learning effectiveness, textual supervision achieves superior results compared with numeric signals, benefiting from richer input information and more robust extraction capabilities of the text model.We further apply the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method to fine-tune the text encoder, improving model performance and preventing catastrophic forgetting with only 0.1M additional trainable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that DMotion shows competitive performance on the Waymo motion prediction and interaction prediction challenges. Additionally, the contrast learning module of DMotion does not introduce additional parameters or computational overhead during inference, maintaining the efficiency of the original encoder-decoder model.},

Then, it becomes crucial to take proactive measures to identify the misinformation spreaders to mitigate their impact and influence over society. Existing approaches primarily focus on identifying spreaders by analyzing features such as writing style, content, user profiles, and engagement statistics. However, since fake or deceiving content is frequently crafted to closely resemble authentic information, traditional techniques alone prove insufficient to effectively identify either fake content or its spreaders. In this context, this work introduces a deep-learning model tailored for detecting misinformation spreaders in social media. Our model not only incorporates content-based features but also integrates patterns of social interactions and information propagation structures. By considering the multifaceted nature of misinformation spread, our approach provides a more holistic and accurate means of identifying its spreaders.

To recover the value function and the target control gain, an error metric is elaborately constructed, and a quasi-Newton algorithm is adopted to minimize it. Furthermore, three DIRL algorithms, including model-based, model-free off-policy, and model-free on-policy algorithms, are proposed. The latter two rely on the expert’s demonstration data or the online observed data, requiring no prior knowledge of the system dynamics and value function.

  abstract     = {The main objective of this study is to develop an intelligent, resilient event-triggered control method for fractional-order multiagent networked systems (FOMANSs) using reinforcement learning (RL) to address challenges resulting from unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. First, the challenge of unknown system dynamics within their environment must be addressed to achieve desired system stability in the face of unknown dynamics or to optimize consensus in FOMANSs. To address this problem, an adaptive learning law is implemented to handle unknown nonlinear dynamics, parameterized by a neural network, which establishes weights for a fuzzy logic system utilized in cooperative tracking protocols. A novel distributed control policy facilitates signal sharing through RL among agents, reducing error variables through learning. Moreover, this study combines an RL algorithm with the sliding mode control strategy to optimize the parameterization of the distributed control protocol, thereby eliminating its constraints on initial conditions. Second, realizing that DoS attacks typically make the actuator signal inaccessible for distributed control protocols, an innovative intelligent dual-event-triggered control strategy is formulated to reduce the effects of DoS attacks. By coordinating nested event triggers across various channels, the distributed control input is protected from incorrect signals from DoS attacks, thus ensuring its resilience. To address this problem, an intelligent security dual-event-triggered control protocol guarantees Mittag–Leffler stability of the closed-loop system and ensures effective sliding motion conditions. This distributed control protocol ensures robust tracking of control tasks and mitigates “Zeno behavior” during event triggering. The proposed control strategy is validated using a single-link flexible-joint robotic manipulator system.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates a noncooperative game of multiagent systems in incomplete information scenarios. To cooperatively seek the Nash equilibrium (NE), each agent aims to minimize its own cost function by interacting with its neighbors over undirected communication networks. While existing distributed NE seeking methods alleviate the computational burden, they also entail higher communication costs. To reduce communication frequency and bandwidth, we propose a class of distributed edge-based NE seeking methods by leveraging the advantages of event-triggered mechanisms and quantization techniques. In the proposed framework, a buffer is equipped on every communication channel, thereby reducing the workload of both agents at either end. It is shown that the convergence error can be made arbitrarily small by tuning a constant threshold, and it can asymptotically converge to zero by setting an exponentially decaying threshold or a dynamic threshold. Moreover, in the case of unawareness of any global information, we further provide a fully distributed event-triggered quantized algorithm, by which the convergence error is ultimately uniformly bounded. Finally, two numerical examples are utilized to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Motivated by the ability of projective synchronization (PS) to adjust the chaotic system trajectory, this research aims to use PS to reduce the chaos in PMSG system. For better control in the time estimation of PS and the robustness of systems, an adaptive predefined-time robust zeroing neural dynamic controller (APTRZNDC) for the PS between PMSG systems is proposed. In the process, an adaptive parameter determined by the system error is designed with the demand for higher convergence factor in the case of large error. In addition, a nonlinear activation function contributed to the predefined-time synchronization is created, making the upper bound of synchronization time independent of system initial states and parameters, except for a single predefined parameter. Moreover, essential theorems for the predefined-time PS and robustness under the APTRZNDC are supplied and validated. And better robustness of PMSG system with the APTRZNDC is demonstrated when compared with other controllers. Furthermore, the APTRZNDC is applied in secure communication via the PS of PMSG systems, which guarantees both the timeliness of signals and the immunity of communication.},

Based on the behavioral systems theory, the proposed data-driven control framework does not require knowledge of the causality of the latent variables. The stability of the controlled system is ensured by utilizing the concept of trajectory-based dissipativity.

For better control performance, dynamic parameters of the human-LLE coupling system are estimated. A control scheme combining robust model predictive control (MPC) and disturbance observer is then designed to manipulate the system against dynamics uncertainty and disturbance during trajectory tracking. In the validation experiments, the nominal model of robust MPC is discretized into quadratic programming problems and solved online by the neuro-dynamics optimization.

Despite significant advancements in various fields, existing general foundation models face challenges in industry when dealing with the data of specialized modalities, the tasks of varying-scenario with multiple processes, and the requirements of trustworthy output, which makes industrial foundation model (IFM) a necessity. This article proposes a system architecture of termed IFMsys, including model training, model adaptation, and model application. Specifically, in model training, a base model is constructed by pretraining on multimodal industrial data and fine-tuning with fundamental industrial mechanisms. In model adaptation, the base model is developed into a series of task-oriented and domain-specific IFMs through fine-tuning with representative tasks and domain knowledge. In model application, an industrial agent-centric collaboration system and a comprehensive application framework of IFM are proposed to enhance the industrial product lifecycle applications. In addition, a prototype system of the IFM, namely, MetaIndux, is delivered, with application examples presented in typical industrial tasks.

This challenge becomes more pronounced when considering more general types of event-triggering mechanisms. Compared with existing methods, this article proposes a different idea with three innovative features: 1) the proposed event-triggering mechanism does not require the calculation of virtual control signals at the sensor side before transmitting them to the controller side; 2) the output triggering is considered directly, and there is no need to design separate controllers for the two communication scenarios without and with event-triggering, thereby avoiding the effect of errors caused by processing substitutions; and 3) it necessitates the online update of only one parameter estimator, avoiding the issue of over-parameterization.

In this study, the sample weight information is first introduced into neighborhood rough sets, and a novel weighted neighborhood rough set model is consequently constructed. Then, considering the lack of sample weight information in practical data, a margin-based weight optimization function is designed, based on which a gradient descent algorithm is provided to adaptively learn sample weights through maximizing sample margins. Finally, an average granule margin measure is put forward for feature selection, and a forward-adding heuristic algorithm is developed to generate an optimal feature subset. The proposed method constructs the weighted neighborhood rough sets using sample weights for the first time and is able to yield compact feature subsets with a large margin.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the resilient distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) control problem for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) that suffers from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in the communication network. Different from the existing works on NE seeking in noncooperative games, it is the first trial to consider the resilient distributed NE control problem for nonlinear MASs under DoS attacks. To overcome the challenges caused by the considered problem, a new layered NE control method is developed, which consists of a resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm, two-stage cascade filters, and a resilient adaptive controller. Specifically, the resilient distributed NE seeking algorithm is proposed to ensure that the actions in this algorithm converge to the NE even under DoS attacks. Then, the improved actions with smooth characteristics are designed by introducing novel two-stage cascade filters. By using newly designed actions and their derivatives, a resilient adaptive controller is proposed to ensure that the output of MASs converges to the NE. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Unlike the previous researches that address (or avoid) the problem of limited network resources by designing different scheduling protocols, this study focuses on further reducing and optimizing the bandwidth utilization by introducing a bit rate constraint model. Thus, an encoding-decoding mechanism under the constrained bit rates is proposed based on the quantization method. In order to analyze the H∞ performance of the LRP and design an appropriate controller, the LRP is transformed into a shift-varying two-dimensional (2-D) Fornasini-Marchesini model. Sufficient conditions in recursive linear matrix inequalities are proposed to ensure that the extended system achieves a bounded H∞ performance over a finite horizon within the 2-D framework. Furthermore, a component-based strategy for allocating the bit rates is provided to expand the quantization region under the constraint of bit rates. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a distributed pinning control strategy aimed at achieving global stabilization of Markovian jump Boolean control networks. The strategy relies on network matrix information to choose controlled nodes and adopts the algebraic state space representation approach for designing pinning controllers. Initially, a sufficient criterion is established to verify the global stability of a given Markovian jump Boolean network (MJBN) with probability one at a specific state within finite time. To stabilize an unstable MJBN at a predetermined state, the selection of pinned nodes involves removing the minimal number of entries, ensuring that the network matrix transforms into a strictly lower (or upper) triangular form. For each pinned node, two types of state feedback controllers are developed: 1) mode-dependent and 2) mode-independent, with a focus on designing a minimally updating controller. The choice of controller type is determined by the feasibility condition of the mode-dependent pinning controller, which is articulated through the solvability of matrix equations. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by studying the T cell large granular lymphocyte survival signaling network consisting of 54 genes and 6 stimuli.},

  abstract     = {Safety guarantee is an important topic when training real-world tasks with reinforcement learning (RL). During online environmental exploration, any constraint violation can lead to significant property damage and risks to personnel. Existing safe RL methods either exclusively address safety concerns after reaching optimality or incorporate a certain degree of tolerance for constraint violations during training. This article proposes a feasible policy iteration framework that can guarantee absolute safety during online exploration, i.e., constraint violations never happen in real-world interactions. The key to maintaining absolute safety lies in confining the environmental exploration at each step always within the feasible region of the current policy. This feasible region is described by a newly defined constraint decay function with uncertainty, ensuring the forward invariance of the feasible region under the worst case. Within the proposed framework, the feasible region maintains its monotonic expanding property and converges to its maximum extent, even though only local samples are available, i.e., the agent only has access to samples within the feasible region. Meanwhile, the trained policy also improves monotonically within its corresponding feasible region if one can use different updating rules inside and outside the feasible region. Finally, practical algorithms are designed with the actor–critic-scenery architecture, consisting of three modules: 1) safe exploration; 2) model error estimation; and 3) network update. Experimental results indicate that our algorithms achieve performance comparable to baselines while maintaining zero constraint violation throughout the entire training process. In contrast, the baseline algorithm typically requires thousands of constraint violations to achieve the same performance. These findings suggest a substantial potential for applying feasible policy iteration in real-world tasks, enabling the online evolution of intricate systems.},

Specifically, a drive network consisting of isolated nodes that satisfy specific conditions is constructed, and the network containing an unknown topology is defined as the response network. Through the design of appropriate controllers and update laws, the drive network and the response network achieve synchronization, while the estimation matrix accurately identifies the unknown topology matrix. Our method is proven to be a generalized form of the existing LIC-free identification methods.

  abstract     = {Visual understanding of 3-D objects is essential for robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality. However, existing methods struggle to perform this task efficiently and accurately in an end-to-end manner. We propose a single-shot method based on the state space model (SSM) to predict the full 3-D information (pose, size, shape) of multiple 3-D objects from a single RGB-D image in an end-to-end manner. Our method first encodes long-range semantic information from RGB and depth images separately and then combines them into an integrated latent representation that is processed by a modified SSM to infer the full 3-D information in two separate task heads within a unified model. A heatmap/detection head predicts object centers, and a 3-D information head predicts a matrix detailing the pose, size and latent code of shape for each detected object. We also propose a shape autoencoder based on the SSM, which learns canonical shape codes derived from a large database of 3-D point cloud shapes. The end-to-end framework, modified SSM block and SSM-based shape autoencoder form major contributions of this work. Our design includes different scan strategies tailored to different input data representations, such as RGB-D images and point clouds. Extensive evaluations on the REAL275, CAMERA25, and Wild6D datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the large-scale Wild6D dataset, our model significantly outperforms the nearest competitor, achieving 2.6% and 5.1% improvements on the IOU-50 and 5∘10 cm metrics, respectively.},

LSCMOPs pose great challenges to algorithms due to the need to optimize multiple conflicting objectives and satisfy multiple constraints in a large search space. To better address such problems, this article proposes a dynamic subspace search-based evolutionary algorithm for solving LSCMOPs. The main idea is to initially allow the population to search in a low-dimensional subspace to increase convergence, then the searched subspace is gradually expanded to encourage the population to further search the full decision space. Specifically, the contribution of each decision variable to the evolution is first calculated using the proposed decision variable analysis method. Then, a probability-based offspring generation strategy is developed to encourage the population to preferentially search in a low-dimensional subspace composed of decision variables with high contribution degrees, thus speeding up the early convergence. With the continuous progress of evolution, the subspace is gradually expanded to ensure that the population can better explore the entire space. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a variety of test problems with 100–1000 decision variables. Experimental results on four test suits and three real-world instances show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in solving LSCMOPs.},

Furthermore, such methods, often are not suitable for performing feature selection due to their high complexity, especially when the dimensionality of the data is high. To address the above issues, a novel method, termed as unsupervised feature selection for high-order embedding learning and sparse learning (UFSHS), is proposed to select useful features. More concretely, UFSHS first takes advantage of the high-order similarity of the original input to construct an optimal similarity graph that accurately reveals the essential geometric structure of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, it constructs a unified framework, integrating high-order embedding learning and sparse learning, to learn an appropriate projection matrix with row sparsity, which helps to select an optimal subset of features. Moreover, we design a novel alternative optimization method that provides different optimization strategies according to the relationship between the number of instances and the dimensionality, respectively, which significantly reduces the computational complexity of the model. Even more amazingly, the proposed optimization strategy is shown to be applicable to ridge regression, broad learning systems and fuzzy systems. Extensive experiments are conducted on nine public datasets to illustrate the superiority and efficiency of our UFSHS.},

However, recent research indicates that GCL is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, while existing robust GCL methods against adversarial attacks are inefficient and lack scalability due to the significant computational expenses of explicit adversarial attacks on the graph structure. To address the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose an efficient and robust GCL via multiadversarial views training framework, called ERMAV. Specifically, the ERMAV generates two adversarial views by attacking both node attributes and latent representations on randomly sampled subgraphs. The method conducts explicit adversarial attacks on node attributes by attacking node attributes and implicit adversarial attacks on the graph structure by attacking latent representations, which avoids the costly computation of explicit graph structure attacks. Moreover, two efficient attack methods are developed to construct adversarial perturbations, which can dynamically generate different adversarial views to enhance sample diversity in the training phase. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments of node classification on seven real-world datasets are conducted. Experimental results show that our ERMAV outperforms state-of-the-art GCL methods on the original graphs and is consistently more robust than existing robust GCL methods on a variety of attacked graphs. This demonstrates the strong robustness and great potential of our ERMAV in real-world applications.},

Existing test problems, which are often manually configured and lack scalability, can result in biased and nongeneralizable algorithm performance. In light of the above, we first introduce four concepts for characterizing STO problems (STOPs) in this study and present an important feature, namely similarity distribution, to quantitatively delineate the relationship between the optimal solutions of source and target tasks. Subsequently, we present general design guidelines for STOPs and introduce a problem generator that demonstrates strong scalability. Specifically, the similarity distribution of a problem can be easily customized through a novel inverse generation strategy, allowing for a continuous spectrum that captures the diverse similarity relationships present in real-world scenarios. Lastly, a benchmark suite comprising 12 STOPs, characterized by a range of customized similarity relationships, has been developed using the proposed generator and will serve as a platform for examining various STO algorithms. For instance, biased transferability representation, irregular mapping learning behaviors, and performance improvements unrelated to search experience are significant empirical findings that previous benchmarks failed to reveal, yet can be effectively identified through our test problems.

Due to the existing challenge of instantaneous disturbance about occurrence time being unknown, the impulsive-based switching network structure is put forward to tackle the impact of external instantaneous disturbance on MASs. Then, a novel hybrid event-triggered and impulsive control protocol is developed to guarantee that nonlinear MASs can resist DoS attacks and achieve the consensus control objective. Contrasted with the methods of continuous control, the developed hybrid event-triggered and impulsive control protocol using the discontinuous sampled state has certain merits saving control resources. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the stability of the closed-loop system is proven, and the Zeno behavior can be excluded successfully. An example is supplied to elicit the availability of the presented methodology.},

  abstract     = {Achieving prescribed-time synchronization with output-feedback measurements in general linear multiagent systems is challenging, as it necessitates the simultaneous achievement of state synchronization and observer estimation within a prescribed time. This article focuses on general linear dynamics and aims to solve the prescribed-time bipartite synchronization (PT-BS) problem over cooperative-antagonistic networks. First, a couple of time-varying Riccati equations (TVREs) is introduced, which transforms the prescribed-time synchronization problem into a dynamic parameter design issue. By using the solutions of TVREs to design output feedback gains, a class of time-varying-gain prescribed-time observers and observer-based protocols are proposed. Then, since the proposed PT-BS observers require knowledge of some global information (i.e., the minimum eigenvalue of the topology-relevant Laplacian matrix), two adaptive strategies are presented to solve the output-feedback PT-BS problems in a fully distributed manner: an edge-based adaptive strategy and a node-based adaptive strategy. It successfully achieves state synchronization, observer estimation, and adaptive gain convergence within the prescribed settling time. Finally, a simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Due to their unique structure and powerful capability to handle uncertainty and partial reliability of information, Z-numbers have achieved significant success in various fields. Zadeh previously asserted that a Z-number can be regarded as a summary of probability distributions. Researchers have proposed various methods for determining the underlying probability distributions from a given Z-number. Conversely, can a Z-number be used to summarize a set of probability distributions? This problem remains unexplored. In this article, we propose a nonlinear model, termed Maximum Expected Minimum Entropy (MEME), for generating a Z-number from a set of probability distributions. Through this model, Z-numbers can be generated directly from data without requiring expert knowledge. Additionally, we applied the MEME model to classification problems, introducing a novel if–then rule form, termed Z-valuation if–then rules. These rules replace the deterministic consequent part of a fuzzy rule with an uncertain Z-valuation, thereby further summarizing the uncertain information in the rule’s consequent. Based on the Z-valuation rules, we propose a Z-valuation rule-based (ZVRB) classification system, which aims to enhance decision-making processes in scenarios where uncertainty plays a key role. To validate the effectiveness of the ZVRB classification system, we conducted two experiments comparing it with both classic and advanced nonfuzzy classifiers as well as fuzzy classification systems. The results show that the ZVRB model is superior to the other comparative classifiers in terms of classification performance.},

To tackle these issues, a mechanism for generating smooth, safe reference signals is first devised. Additionally, we propose a novel approach that utilizes improved prescribed performance functions to confine tracking errors within predetermined constant bounds in finite time, while avoiding potential singularity issues arising from abrupt changes in the reference signal. Furthermore, a decentralized adaptive learning error-constrained control strategy is proposed, employing neural networks to approximate complex uncertainties with an asymptotic dynamic surface control method. Stability analysis confirms that the proposed control scheme guarantees the asymptotic stability of the system and ensures safe tracking within conflicted irregular output constraints, even in the presence of input saturation.

  abstract     = {Rhythm is an inherent aspect of human behavior, present from infancy and embedded in cultural practices. At the core of rhythm perception lies meter anticipation, a spontaneous process in the human brain that typically occurs before actual beats. This anticipation can be framed as a time series prediction problem. From the perspective of human embodied system behavior, although many models have been developed for time series prediction, most prioritize accuracy over biological realism, contrasting with the natural imprecision of human internal clocks. Neuroscientific evidence, such as infants’ natural meter synchronization, underscores the need for biologically plausible models. Therefore, we propose a neuron oscillator-based dynamic system that simulates human behavior during meter perception. The model introduces two tunable parameters for local and global adjustments, fine-tuning the oscillation combinations to emulate human-like rhythmic behavior. The experiments are conducted under three common scenarios encountered during human-machine interaction, demonstrating that the proposed model can exhibit human-like reactions. Additionally, experiments involving human-machine and interhuman interactions show that the model successfully replicates real-world rhythmic behavior, advancing toward more natural and synchronized human-machine rhythm interaction.},

This article introduces a novel single-motor, altering bi-directional transfer soft exosuit based on impedance optimization and adaptive neural control, which provides assistance to the lower limbs using Bowden cables. This innovative soft exosuit integrates control barrier functions into the impedance optimization, allowing multiple safety constraints to be considered simultaneously, enabling the system to adaptively learn the impedance of the human ankle joint by analyzing the measured interaction forces at the ankle joint, so that the updated reference trajectories comply with safety requirements. To effectively track the updated reference trajectories, we have introduced an adaptive neural controller based on the integral barrier Lyapunov function. This controller is designed to perform the control task under strict safety constraints. The stability of this control approach is meticulously demonstrated through extensive Lyapunov analysis. In contrast to traditional soft exosuits designed purely for assistance, the key advantage of this technology is its ability to adapt to different terrains while ensuring the safety of human movement during assistance. Through experimental testing, we obtain average tracking errors of 0.0062, 0.0062, and 0.0063 rad for flat, grass, and gravel surfaces, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Therefore, this study proposed a dynamic hierarchical convolutional attention network (DH-CAN) that comprehensively learned discriminative information from both global and local spatial domains, as well as from time-frequency domains in EEG signals. Specifically, a multiscale convolutional block was designed to dynamically capture time-frequency information. The channels of EEG signals were mapped to different brain regions based on motor imagery neural activity patterns. The spatial features, both global and local, were then hierarchically extracted to fully exploit the discriminative information. Furthermore, regional connectivity was established using a graph attention network, incorporating it into the local spatial features. Particularly, this study shared network parameters between symmetrical brain regions to better capture asymmetrical motor imagery patterns. Finally, the learned multilevel features were integrated through a high-level fusion layer. Extensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrated that the proposed model performed excellently across multiple evaluation metrics, exceeding existing benchmark methods. These findings suggested that the proposed model offered a novel perspective for EEG decoding research.},

To tackle this issue, this article proposes an adaptive attention-modulated graph network (AdamGraph) to enhance the subject adaptability of EEG emotion recognition against connection variability and representation variability. Specifically, an attention-modulated graph connection module is proposed to explicitly capture the individual important relationships among channels adaptively. Through modulating the attention matrix of individual functional connections using spatial connections based on prior knowledge, the attention-modulated weights can be learned to construct individual connections adaptively, thereby mitigating individual differences. Besides, a deep node-graph representation learning module is designed to extract long-range interaction characteristics among channels and alleviate the over-smoothing problem of representations. Furthermore, a graph domain co-regularized learning module is imposed to tackle the individual distribution discrepancies in connection and representations across different domains.

Consequently, it achieves a streamlined structure, facilitating direct determination of the optimal policy. Subsequently, the stability of each iteration of the algorithm is formally established, along with the derivation of a unique condition for the Q-function matrix. Additionally, to address the challenge of obtaining a stable policy when the initial policy is unstable, an innovative data-driven algorithm is introduced that effectively computes the initial stable gains, ensuring convergence to stability throughout the learning process.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the variable convergence rate stability problem for nonlinear impulsive stochastic systems (NISSs). To solve the issue, a novel methodology of sliding mode surface design is presented by combining the definition of interval stability with the T–S fuzzy technique. A pioneering class of sliding mode controllers is constructed in accordance with the characteristics of the designed sliding mode surfaces and the sigmoid function. These controllers can intelligently adjust the convergence rate of the system according to practical requirements, thereby addressing the limitation of fixed convergence rate in existing results. Moreover, the proposed controllers can effectively suppress jitter and analyze the effects of different sigmoid functions on jitter suppression. Sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the states of the NISSs reach the designed surfaces in finite time and to achieve variable convergence rate stability. The excellent performance of the proposed theoretical strategy in achieving adjustable rate convergence of the system is demonstrated through a simulation of the ball-beam system.},

Nonetheless, when performing computations in the analog domain, novel challenges are introduced in terms of arithmetic precision and stochasticity, due to non-ideal circuit and device behaviour. Moreover, these non-idealities have a temporal dimension, resulting in a degrading application accuracy over time. Facing these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named LionHeart, to obtain hybrid analog-digital mappings to execute Deep Learning (DL) inference workloads using heterogeneous accelerators. The accuracy-constrained mappings derived by LionHeart showcase, across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and one transformer-based network, high accuracy and potential for speedup. The results of the full system simulations highlight runtime reductions and energy efficiency gains that exceed 6×, with a user-defined accuracy threshold for a fully digital floating point implementation.},

This paradigm shift exploits hidden natural computing properties, to develop miniaturized wet-computing devices that can be deployed in harsh environments, and to explore designs of novel energy-efficient systems. In parallel, we witness the emergence of AI hardware, including neuromorphic processors with the aim of improving computational capacity. This study brings together the concept of biocomputing and neuromorphic systems by focusing on the bacterial gene regulatory networks and their transformation into Gene Regulatory Neural Networks (GRNNs). We explore the intrinsic properties of gene regulations, map this to a gene-perceptron function, and propose an application-specific sub-GRNN search algorithm that maps the network structure to match a computing problem. Focusing on the model organism Escherichia coli, the base-GRNN is initially extracted and validated for accuracy. Subsequently, a comprehensive feasibility analysis of the derived GRNN confirms its computational prowess in classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of performing a well-known digit classification task as a use case. Our analysis and simulation experiments show promising results in the offloading of computation tasks to GRNN in bacterial cells, advancing wet-neuromorphic computing using natural cells.},

Under the control framework, adaptive ELM-based control strategies are proposed to suppress the influence of the uncertainties and disturbances layer-by-layer, combining with the minimum learning parameter (MLP) technique which is employed to reduce the calculation complexity of ELM parameters. The significance of this study is that general model/input uncertainties, matched and mismatched disturbances can be effectively compensated within a limited time, so that bounded trajectory tracking of the robotic manipulator can be achieved avoiding the complexity explosion issue. The time-constrained stability of the closed-loop robotic error systems is proved through Lyapunov stability theory.

  abstract     = {The emergence of Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs) poses a significant challenge to software systems, resulting in performance degradation and increased error rates in resourceintensive systems. Consequently, numerous ARB prediction methods have been developed to mitigate these issues. However, in scenarios where training data is limited, the effectiveness of ARB prediction is often suboptimal. To address this problem, CrossProject Aging-Related Bug Prediction (CPARBP) is proposed, which utilizes data from other projects (i.e., source projects) to train a model aimed at predicting potential ARBs in a target project. However, the use of source-project data raises privacy concerns and discourages companies from sharing their data. Therefore, we propose a method called Cross-Project AgingRelated Bug Prediction based on Negative Database (NegCPARBP) for privacy protection. NegCPARBP first converts the feature vector of a software file into a binary string. Secondly, the corresponding Negative DataBase (NDB) is generated based on this binary string, containing data that is significantly more expressive from the original feature vector. Furthermore, to ensure more accurate prediction of ARB-prone and ARB-free files based on privacy-protected data (i.e., maintain the data utility), we propose a novel negative database generation algorithm that captures more information about important features, using information gain as a measure. Finally, NegCPARBP extracts a new feature vector from the NDB to represent the original feature vector, facilitating data sharing and ARB prediction objectives. Experimental results on Linux, MySQL, and NetBSD datasets demonstrate that NegCPARBP achieves a high defense against attacks (privacy protection performance reaching 0.97) and better data utility compared to existing privacy protection methods.},

Owing to the underactuation of USV dynamic systems and the presence of various time-varying surface disturbances, attaining rapid and accurate position control along with maneuverability poses a significant challenge to USVs. Therefore, when an USV maneuvers around a target in a confined search area with obstacles, it is essential for the guidance law to consider collision risks and environmental disturbances. This paper proposes a modified Lyapunov vector field with heading deviation compensation to circle the target in complex search regions. The vector field is designed to increase the radial velocity of the USV and accelerate convergence towards the target circle during the pursuit phase. By combining the proposed Lyapunov vector field with a boundary vector field, the USV can swiftly avoid boundaries and dynamic obstacles and then continue circling the target. The proposed computing architecture extends the application scope of the target circumnavigation to practical water surface environments, which is validated by extensive simulations and rigorous experiments.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computers have the potential to solve a number of hard problems that are believed to be almost impossible to solve by classical computers. This observation has sparked a surge of research to apply quantum algorithms against the cryptographic systems to evaluate its quantum resistance. In assessing the security strength of the cryptographic algorithms against the upcoming quantum threats, it is crucial to precisely estimate the quantum resource requirement (generally in terms of circuit depth and quantum bit count). The National Institute of Standards and Technology by the US government specified five quantum security levels so that the relative quantum strength of a given cipher can be compared to the standard ones. There have been some progress in the NIST-specified quantum security levels for the odd levels (i.e., 1, 3 and 5), following the work of Jaques et al. (Eurocrypt&#39;20). However, levels 2 and 4, which correspond to the quantum collision finding attacks for the SHA-2 and SHA-3 hash functions, quantum attack complexities are arguably not well-studied. This is where our article fits in. In this article, we present novel techniques for optimizing the quantum circuit implementations for SHA-2 and SHA-3 algorithms in all the categories specified by NIST. After that, we evaluate the quantum circuits of target cryptographic hash functions for quantum collision search. Finally, we define the quantum attack complexity for levels 2 and 4, and comment on the security strength of the extended level. We present new concepts to optimize the quantum circuits at the component level and the architecture level.},

Additionally, we address the challenges of requiring a large number of negative samples and the difficulty of selecting high-quality negative samples in traditional contrastive learning methods. For feature learning, we design a Feature Enhancement Coding (FEC) module to analyze the interactions and correlations between nonlinear features, enhancing the quality of feature representations. In the metric stage, we propose a centered hypersphere projection metric to map feature vectors onto the hypersphere, improving the comparison between the support and query sets. Experimental results on four few-shot classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method, while simple in design, outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We present the evaluation results obtained from measurement and modeling implementations. The measurement infrastructure was composed of 15 large and 15 extra-large VMs. The modeling approach used Markov Decision Processes (MDP). On the measurement testbed, we implemented three different levels of software rejuvenation granularity to achieve software resiliency. We have discovered two threats to resiliency in this environment. The first threat to resiliency was a memory leak that was part of the underlying open-source infrastructure in each VM. The second threat to resiliency was the result of the contention for resources in the physical host, which is dependent on the number and size of VMs deployed to the physical host. In the MDP modeling approach, we evaluated four strategies for assigning tasks to VMs with different configurations and different levels of parallelism. Using the large cluster under study, we compared our approach of using software aging and rejuvenation with the state-of-the-art approach of using a network of VMs deployed to a private cloud without software aging detection and rejuvenation. In summary, we show that in a private cloud with non-elastic resource allocation in the physical hosts, careful performance engineering needs to be performed to optimize the trade-offs between the number of VMs allocated and the total memory allocated to each VM.},

Our study redefines the general utility of the platform as an amalgamation of utilities on both the workers&#39; and tasks&#39; sides, incorporating the preference lists of each worker or task based on their respective utility scores for the other party. SoSTA incorporates Multi Skill-oriented Stable Worker Task Mapping (Multi-SoS-WTM) algorithm for contributions with multiple skills per worker. SoSTA is rational, non-wasteful, fair, and hence stable. SoSTA outperformed other approaches in the simulations of the MeetUp dataset.

However, existing anti-counterfeiting and authentication technologies for porcelain are often unreliable and costly. This paper proposes a physical unclonable functions (PUF) design based on crack physical feature extraction for the anti-counterfeiting and authentication of Gold-Wire porcelain. The proposed method generates PUF information by extracting inherent physical deviations in the surface cracks of Gold-Wire porcelain. First, a standard crack extraction process is established using digital image processing to obtain crack information from the porcelain surface. Then, a physical feature extraction model based on the chain code encoding technique and the Delaunay triangulation technique is used to derive the physical feature values from the cracks. Subsequently, a PUF encoding algorithm is designed to convert these physical feature values into a PUF response. Finally, the security and reliability of the designed PUF are evaluated, and a PUF-based porcelain authentication protocol is developed. Experimental results show that the proposed PUF exhibits 50.16% uniqueness and 98.85% reliability, and the PUF data successfully passed the NIST randomness test, demonstrating that the proposed technology can effectively achieve low-cost, high-reliability anti-counterfeiting for commercial porcelain.},

However, naive implementations on embedded devices are vulnerable to side-channel attacks (SCAs) with full key recovery possible through power and electromagnetic leakage analysis. This paper presents two protection schemes, masking and shuffling, for the baseline Radix-2 multi-path delay commutator (R2MDC) number theoretic transform (NTT) architecture. The proposed masking NTT scheme introduces a random number to protect the secret key during the decryption phase and leverages the linear property of arithmetic transform in NTT polynomial multiplication. By adjusting the comparing decoding threshold, the masking method greatly reduces the ratio of $t-test$ value exceeding the threshold of unprotected NTT scheme from 77.38% to 3.91%. An ingenious shuffling transform process is also proposed to disturb the calculation sequence of butterfly transformation, adapting to the high-throughput architecture of R2MDC-NTT. This shuffling NTT scheme does not require operations to remove shuffle or additional operation cycles, reducing the leakage ratio to 13.49% with minimal extra hardware resources and wide applicability. The proposed masking and shuffling techniques effectively suppress side-channel leakage, improving the security of hardware architecture while maintaining a balance between overall performance and additional hardware resources.},

  abstract     = {Ontology is a kernel technique of the semantic web, which defines concepts, properties, and their relationships to establish a shared understanding of domain knowledge. Ontology matching identifies semantically similar entities across different ontologies, which uses similarity features to measure their similarity from different perspectives. However, due to the complexity of the entity heterogeneity, no single similarity feature is universally effective. In recent years, genetic algorithms have proven effective in constructing similarity features for ontology matching, but their potential is limited by the reliance on default classification strategies, empirical determination of the number of high-level features, the requirement for manually selecting, combining these features, and tuning the associated combination parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a multi-layer hybrid genetic programming approach to automatically construct high-level similarity features. This approach includes three novel components. First, a new multi-layer individual representation is designed, which faciliates the algorithm to adaptively explore the search space of constructing high-level similarity features. Second, to enhance the search effectiveness, a new initialization method and a mutation operator are developed, which use a weight-based strategy to adaptively select and construct a more diverse set of similarity features. Third, a compact genetic algorithm-based optimizer is designed to refine the tree structures of elite individuals. The experimental results on the ontology alignment evaluation initiative’s benchmark show that our algorithm can generate high-quality ontology matching results across various matching tasks, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art ontology matching methods.},

  abstract     = {Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have exhibited promising results across many domains and applications. However, uncertainty in fitness and behaviour estimations of solutions remains a major challenge when QD is used in complex real-world applications. While several approaches have been proposed to improve the performance in uncertain applications, many fail to address a key challenge: determining how to prioritise solutions that perform consistently under uncertainty, in other words, solutions that are reproducible. Most prior methods improve fitness and reproducibility jointly, ignoring the possibility that they could be contradictory objectives. For example, in robotics, solutions may reliably walk at 90% of the maximum velocity in uncertain environments, while solutions that walk faster are also more prone to falling over. As this is a trade-off, neither one of these two solutions is “better&quot; than the other. Thus, algorithms cannot intrinsically select one solution over the other, but can only enforce given preferences over these two contradictory objectives. In this paper, we formalise this problem as the performance-reproducibility trade-off for uncertain QD. We propose two new a-priori QD algorithms that find efficient solutions for given preferences over the trade-offs. We also propose an a-posteriori QD algorithm for when these preferences cannot be defined in advance. Our results show that our approaches successfully find solutions that satisfy given preferences. Importantly, by simply accounting for this trade-off, our approaches perform better than existing uncertain QD methods. This suggests that considering the performance-reproducibility trade-off unlocks important stepping stones that are usually missed when only performance is optimised.},

Surprisingly though, up to date and in contrast to the UMDA and many other heuristics, we lack a rigorous runtime analysis of the cGA on the LEADINGONES benchmark–one of the most studied theory benchmarks in the domain of evolutionary computation. We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a formal runtime analysis of the cGA on LEADINGONES. For the cGA’s single parameter–called the hypothetical population size–at least polylogarithmically larger than the problem size, we prove that the cGA samples the optimum of LEADINGONES with high probability within a number of function evaluations quasi-linear in the problem size and linear in the hypothetical population size. For the best hypothetical population size, our result matches, up to polylogarithmic factors, the typical quadratic runtime that many randomized search heuristics exhibit on LEADINGONES. Our analysis exhibits some noteworthy differences in the working principles of the two algorithms which were not visible in previous works.},

Despite their utility, these algorithms often confront challenges when navigating complex search spaces, impeding a comprehensive exploration of potential solutions. Solely depending on the algorithm’s exploration abilities falls short of fully harnessing the rich information contained within search spaces. To unlock the full potential of solution spaces, we introduce a deep learning method for the reconstruction of the search path. Specifically, discrete data sampled by evolutionary operators during the exploration process are collected, and a uniquely designed fully connected neural network is employed to reconstruct the exploration paths. The neural network’s robust fitting capability facilitates the transformation of initially discrete sampled information into a continuous form. By capitalizing on the reconstructed solution space information, the algorithm excels in identifying superior solutions. We refer to this method of deep learning-based search path reconstruction evolution strategy algorithm (DLES). The effectiveness of DLES is validated across multiple datasets, including CEC 2014, CEC 2018, CEC 2022 and BBOB. Experimental results, compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms, affirm the superiority of the DLES algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Recently, transfer learning-based dynamic multiobjective optimization algorithms (TL-DMOAs) have been shown to be very promising in solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs). However, it is difficult for them to model knowledge capable of delineating the Pareto optimal solutions (POSs) found in each historical environment, because the POSs’ distribution cannot be adequately reflected. Besides, existing TL-DMOAs normally focus on acquiring knowledge from historical environments, but neglect correlations behind them for excavating potential knowledge, restricting the performance in generating high-quality initial populations (HIPs). To address these issues, herein a DMOA with multisource and hidden source-based knowledge transfer (DMOA-MHKT) is proposed. First, we design a knowledge extraction strategy by introducing mean shift, a nonparametric clustering method, to cluster the historical POSs. As clusters’ representatives, the cluster centers are considered to represent environmental knowledge, because they can adequately reflect the POSs’ distribution. Second, the most similar historical environment through environmental match and the last one are selected as two explicit sources. In the former source the POSs’ cluster centers are treated as its knowledge. By contrast, based on the POSs’ cluster centers and knee points in the latter source, a scoring method is designed to generate environmental knowledge by depicting the dynamics between two continuous environments. Third, after aligning knowledge of the explicit sources, a hidden source is learned by excavating correlations and potential knowledge behind them, facilitating the generalization enhancement in generating HIPs. The experimental results especially performance comparisons with seven state-of-the-art DMOAs demonstrate that DMOA-MHKT brings significant improvements in solving DMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML)-based optimization frameworks emerge as a promising technique for solving large-scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs), as they can capture the mapping between problem structures and optimal solutions to expedite their solution process. However, existing solution frameworks often suffer from high model computation costs, incomplete problem reduction, and reliance on large-scale solvers, leading to performance bottlenecks in ultra-large-scale problems with complex constraints. To address these issues, this paper proposes Light-EvoOPT, a Lightweight Evolutionary Optimization Framework for Ultra-Large-Scale Mixed Integer Linear Programs, which can be divided into four stages: (1) Problem Formulation for problem division to reduce model computational costs, (2) Model-based Initial Solution Prediction for predicting and constructing the initial solution using a small-scale training dataset, (3) Problem Reduction for both variable and constraint reduction, and (4) Evolutionary Optimization for current solution improvement employing a lightweight optimizer. Experiments on four benchmark datasets with tens of millions of variables and constraints and a real-world problem show that the proposed framework based on the sole use of a lightweight optimizer, trained on only one-thousandth of the scale of ultra-large-scale problems, is able to outperform state-of-the-art ML-based frameworks and advanced solvers (e.g. Gurobi) within a specified computational time, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed ML-based evolutionary optimization framework for ultra-large-scale MILPs.},

  abstract     = {The fragment reconstruction problem aims to assemble the original object from a collection of fragmented pieces. Traditional manual reconstruction techniques heavily rely on expert knowledge and can potentially damage fragile fragments, necessitating the development of automated reconstruction methods. Current reconstruction algorithms often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, compromising both accuracy and efficiency as the number of fragments increases. These algorithms primarily rely on fragment content, limiting their adaptability and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel reconstruction method grounded in a cooperative coevolutionary (CC) optimization framework. This approach encompasses both the formalization of the fragment reconstruction problem and the development of a tailored algorithm to solve it. Notably, our modeling approach is content-independent, relying solely on the edge shapes of the fragments. With this modeling approach, the solution itself represents the reconstruction process of the fragments. To encode candidate solutions efficiently, we employ a tree structure. This encoding scheme renders traditional CC processes and genetic algorithm operators, such as crossover and mutation, inapplicable. Therefore, this paper proposes a tree-structured CC genetic algorithm (T-CCGA) specifically tailored to our reconstruction task. We aim to overcome the limitations of current reconstruction algorithms and pave the way for more accurate and efficient fragment reconstruction methods. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted a series of comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that T-CCGA achieves promising outcomes in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and robustness.},

However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS has a generalization bias to produce as many crisp rules as possible. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS significantly outperformed LCSs with popular rule representations in test classification accuracy on up to 17 of the 25 datasets tested.},

The algorithm employs an interval-based MOEA/D as its foundational framework. Upon encountering environmental changes, prediction models for the midpoints and widths of intervals are developed using multi-task learning combined with a self-evolving fuzzy system. These models generate a predicted Pareto front (PF) in the objective space. Subsequently, inverse mappings of the objective functions at the new time are established to identify solutions that correspond to the predicted PF in the decision space. Finally, these solutions are expanded to form an initial population at the new time. Testing on eighteen benchmark optimization problems and an uncertain scheduling of underwater wireless sensor networks, the proposed algorithm demonstrates both competitiveness and superiority when compared to five state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract     = {To solve dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs), the optimization algorithms are required to track the movement of the Pareto set after the environmental changes effectively. Many prediction-based dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have been proposed to address this challenge by utilizing environmental information for population reinitialization. However, when environmental changes are complex, irregular, and severe, the solutions and information during the evolution process often contain noise, making it difficult for prediction-based DMOEAs to accurately predict and reinitialize the population. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (DM-DMOEA) which uses a diffusion model based prediction strategy. In DM-DMOEA, to improve the prediction accuracy, the diffusion model is introduced to extract the relationships of high-quality solutions and reinitialize the population, and a PS estimation method is employed to integrate both historical and new environmental information, providing a set of high-quality solutions for diffusion model training. To speed up the response time, a variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to map the decision space to a latent space, which can reduce the diffusion model size and accelerate the diffusion process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DM-DMOEA on DMOPs, comprehensive experiments are conducted on several benchmarks and a practical problem. The results show that the DM-DMOEA outperforms other four state-of-the-art DMOEAs in most cases.},

These changes challenge most existing algorithms to quickly cross infeasible regions and accurately track the changing Pareto optimal set (POS) and Pareto optimal front (POF). To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-centers based prediction strategy, termed FCP, for solving DCMOPs more effectively. First, we introduce a penalty function to cluster the historical optimal solutions, thereby obtaining multi-centers of these solutions. These centers can roughly represent the distribution of different clusters in POS. Then, we predict cluster centers of the new environment’s POS by calculating the distance of centers from the preceding two environments. The prediction strategy can handle the change of POS caused by constraints thereby improving the accuracy of prediction. Finally, a proposed population generator calculates the distances between new centers and utilizes information from these centers to predict a well-distributed initial population. Comprehensive studies on widely used benchmark problems demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is very competitive in dealing with DCMOPs compared with seven state-of-the-art algorithms. Meanwhile, to validate the proposed prediction strategy, it is embedded into the static constraints handling techniques from other DCMOEAs to solving DCMOPs and the experimental results indicate that FCP is superior in generating initial population.},

  abstract     = {Solving multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) is a challenging task which needs locating multiple global optimal solutions simultaneously with high accuracy. Current popular niching-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving MMOPs usually divide the population into several separate species to search for different optimal solutions. However, achieving effective information exchange between species to enhance the performance of overall algorithm remains a challenge in current niching-based EAs, which will directly affect the efficiency of the multimodal optimization algorithm. In this paper, the process of the different species locating peaks in MMOPs is regarded as an evolutionary multitask (EMT) optimization problem and an EMT framework with bi-knowledge transfer for MMOPs is proposed. An explicit knowledge transfer (E-KT) strategy is designed to transfer the optimal individual of the species with the fastest convergence speed to other species, thereby facilitating the acceleration their convergence. Moreover, in order to further improve the information exchange between species, a species center-based implicit knowledge transfer (I-SCKT) strategy is designed to improve the diversity of the population. The performance of MTBKTMMOP is tested on the widely used CEC’2013 benchmark and five practical flexible job shop problems. The experimental results of MTBKTMMOP are compared with 9 state-of-the-art MMOPs algorithms and show that our MTBKTMMOP is superior to all of them. Besides, the experimental results also show that the MTBKTMMOP achieves breakthroughs in handling with a large number of optimal solutions or high-dimensional MMOPs, which provides a new and effective method for dealing with MMOPs.},

However, the new optimal solution, found by re-optimizing the problem, may be quite different from the CI solution implicating large costs, major changes, and laborious efforts, causing an apathy for its adoption. For such scenarios, we propose a concept of an “innovation path” (IP), containing a sequence of transitional solutions from the existing to the new target solution with gradual and controlled change from one to the next. To discover such intermediate solutions of the IP, we propose a bi-objective formulation with dynamic step-constraints as an IP Problem (IPP), such that a finite set of Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting IPP become the desired intermediate IP solutions. Due to required gradual discovery of IP solutions, the IP-seeking task happens to be a non-trivial task. We demonstrate the working of the proposed approach on a number of single, two-objective, and many-objective test and engineering problems. The paper concludes with a number of extensions of this study, but the results of this study clearly indicate the usefulness of the proposed approach to other practical problems.},

However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113× compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

At the same time, kernel-based clustering is a well-developed topic of research. These methods can efficiently group non-linear clusters through transformations in the data space. The research involving co-clustering and kernel function is still in the initial stage. In this paper, we proposed the first kernel-based algorithms that can learn the width hyperparameter of the Gaussian kernel automatically for hard and fuzzy co-clustering. The main advantages of the proposed methods are that there is no need for a previous additional step to tune the width hyperparameter, and we consider width hyperparameters that are the same for all clusters, varying only with respect to objects or variables (global methods), or they can also vary across clusters (local methods). As a consequence, our methods can rescale the objects and variables separately, according to their distribution, and in the local case, also according to the distribution in each variable cluster and object cluster, respectively. Experiments conducted over 14 real data sets, and compared with traditional clustering methods and previous state-of-the-art co-clustering algorithms, showed the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Biselection (feature and sample selection) enhances the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models when handling large-scale data. Fuzzy rough sets, an uncertainty mathematics model known for its excellent interpretability, are widely used in machine learning, particularly for feature selection. While the consistent matrix has significantly improved the computational efficiency and scalability of feature selection, like most fuzzy rough set-based methods, it focuses only on feature selection and seldom incorporates sample selection. This feature-centric approach can limit classification performance, particularly in noisy and large-scale datasets where both features and samples require judicious selection. To overcome these limitations, this article explores the integration of sample selection with feature selection. First, we introduce a $\beta$-consistent granulation method to generate more accurate and concise fuzzy information granules, reducing the impact of noisy samples. In addition, a novel membership function is employed to distinguish noise while simultaneously evaluating both features and samples. As a result, a biselection algorithm with linear computation complexity is proposed to select high-quality features and samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to eleven representative algorithms, our proposed method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9.66% and a 933-fold increase in efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Industrial time series prediction is highly important for the predictive maintenance of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the field of time series prediction. However, time series data from complex industrial scenarios often contain substantial uncertainty. This makes it difficult for deterministic deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions. Moreover, existing static methods often fail to meet the real-time requirements of industrial environments. To address the challenges, this study introduces fuzzy learning into deep learning models to overcome the drawbacks of fixed model representations. Therefore, we propose a fuzzy dynamic transformer (FDformer) that can adaptively adjust network depth according to the complexity of individual samples. Subsequently, we design a fuzzy feature extraction mechanism to capture feature information within the fuzzy membership degree, enabling the feature-level fusion of the fuzzy representation with the dynamic depth representation. Finally, we propose a training method for dynamically allocating loss weights, emphasizing the contribution of various samples to different exits, thereby improving the performance of time-series dynamic networks. Experiments on multiple datasets indicate that FDformer achieves minimal computational costs and excellent prediction accuracy across multiple datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The objective is to leverage data mining methodologies to pinpoint anomalies within datasets, thereby revealing crucial and enlightening information. Herein, we introduce a groundbreaking outlier detection methodology, ODMGIS, that seamlessly integrates multi-granularity representation and information set concepts to devise the multi-granularity information set (MGIS) model. This model adeptly characterizes the distribution patterns of data points. Firstly, we employ entropy function and their complementary function as measurement tools to accurately quantify the inherent uncertainty in data with different distributions, and considers the sum of the two as a comprehensive representation of the overall uncertainty of the information source. Subsequently, an outlier score model is constructed based on MGIS, which can deeply characterize the degree of outlierness of samples, thereby effectively identifying abnormal points in the dataset. During validation, ODMGIS was rigorously tested on practical datasets from medicine and bioinformatics, and its performance was benchmarked against both traditional and the state-of-the-art algorithms, showcasing substantial benefits.

Subsequently, with the help of the prescribed-time scaling function and the barrier function, the problem of deferred output constraint is reformulated as a boundedness problem of the new variable. By introducing several useful lemmas, the designed controller can ensure that the closed-loop signals are bounded in the presence of actuator fault in the system. In addition, through the designed fuzzy control algorithm, it can strictly guarantee that the system output converges within the ideal range after the settling time.

This paper proposes a method for high-dimensional data regression using a Hierarchical Fuzzy Topological System (HFTS). The HFTS adopts a modular design, where each layer consists of an independent fuzzy logic system, enabling flexible operation based on feature distribution and output requirements. It utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based hierarchical feature classification approach to group high-dimensional data, mapping features into nodes and establishing edges based on similarity. This process creates a topological structure that facilitates high-density feature representation through neighborhood aggregation. HFTS introduces a cross-layer rule-sharing mechanism and an interpolation expansion algorithm to smooth fuzzy rules, thereby reducing interaction complexity. Additionally, an adaptive weight adjustment strategy dynamically optimizes feature importance, enhancing both robustness and predictive accuracy. When applied to eleven KEEL regression datasets, HFTS demonstrates superior accuracy, effectively addressing high-dimensional interactions while maintaining a balance between interpretability and performance},

To deal with the difficulty where the attack-induced topologies may destabilize the NE seeking performance, a novel prescribed-time function together with a resetting mechanism is delicately designed. Then, a PT-FDNES with adaptive gains is developed by incorporating the resetting mechanism to search for the NE independent of any global information. Subsequently, a novel PT fuzzy adaptive tracking control law is designed in the celebrated backstepping structure.

Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers.

First, we introduce the granular-ball twin support vector machine (GBTWSVM) classifier, which incorporates GBC with the TWSVM framework. By replacing traditional point-wise inputs with granular-ball representations, we derive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBTWSVM classifier by solving a quadratic programming problem. Afterwards, we develop the granular-ball fuzzy twin support vector machine (GBFTSVM) classifier, where the membership and non-membership functions of granular-balls are defined using Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS), enabling a more nuanced differentiation of the contributions of granular-balls from distinct regions within the input space. By incorporating these functions into the FTSVM framework, we derive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBFTSVM classifier through the solution of a quadratic programming problem. Finally, we present algorithms for the GBTWSVM and GBFTSVM classifiers and evaluate their performance on 21 benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior scalability, computational efficiency, and robustness of the proposed classifiers in pattern recognition, highlighting their potential as advanced tools for noise-tolerant classification.},

The effectiveness of LSSM is demonstrated by extending the CRITIC technique for decision—making, allowing for the determination of criteria weights even when information is incomplete or uncertain. We further validate the proposed measures using Spearman&#39;s correlation coefficient to analyze ranking stability and context sensitivity, facilitating their selection for specific decision scenarios. Finally, we apply the developed measures to optimize electric vehicle charging infrastructure in a large—scale problem, showcasing their practical applicability.},

A fractional exponent (FE), represented by an exponential function with a fractional parameter, is introduced to define looped FEs (LFEs) $\mathbf {\mathsf {(1-e^{-\hat{\alpha }(\epsilon _{1}(t))})}}$ and $\mathbf {\mathsf {(1-e^{-\hat{\alpha }(\epsilon _{2}(t))})}}$ where $\mathbf {\epsilon _{1}(\mathsf {t})= \mathsf {{t}-{t_{k}}},}$ $\mathbf {\epsilon _{2}(\mathsf {t})= \mathsf {{t_{k+1}}-{t}},}$ $\mathbf {\hat{\alpha } \in (0,1)}$. These LFEs are utilized to construct a novel FEBLLF and to partition the sampling interval into four distinct sampling subintervals, providing detailed information about the state within each subinterval. Subsequently, the sampling-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained as linear matrix inequalities to ensure the SS of the T-S fuzzy Markovian jump systems with $\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$ performance level $\gamma$ and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results, a nonlinear mass-spring system is assessed. Additionally, comparative examples are discussed to illustrate the better conservative results of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Manipulability optimization plays a crucial role in the motion control of omni-directional mobile redundant manipulator (OMRM), since it can reduce the risk of the OMRM to enter into singular postures. However, manipulability is a nonlinear nonconvex function with respect to the joint variables, and thus its efficient optimization is a challenge. In addition, existing manipulability optimization methods rarely consider obstacle avoidance. To solve these limitations, a time-varying quadratic programming problem (TVQP)-based manipulability-optimized obstacle avoidance (MOOA) scheme is proposed, which no longer approximates obstacles as a single point and avoids singularity in the motion control process. To address the problem that the traditional neural network with fixed convergence parameters is not accurate enough for system disturbance or external noise, this paper proposes an anti-noise disturbance fuzzy neural dynamics (AND-FND) model. The model adapts the fuzzy parameters and convergence rate based on error fluctuations, enhancing both robustness and adaptability. Notably, the AND-FND model utilizes membership functions and rules to describe controller parameter variations due to external disturbances and operational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the AND-FND model possesses global convergence and strong robustness. Numerical results and physical experiments demonstrate the practicability and advantages of the proposed method compared to the existing techniques.},

However, many existing online streaming feature selection studies do not effectively leverage the correlation and hidden information in the label space. The measures used in streaming feature selection often face challenges such as computational complexity and insufficient information exploitation. To address these issues, we propose an online streaming feature selection method based on label enhancement and fuzzy synergistic discrimination information. Firstly, we define a novel label enhancement method based on label correlation, which does not require any prior knowledge of feature space. Secondly, we propose a new measure to evaluate the discriminative ability of multiple feature subsets for labels in fuzzy environment, called fuzzy synergistic discrimination information. It is bounded and has many interesting properties. The fuzzy synergistic discrimination information is computed directly based on fuzzy similarity relations, so the calculation is relatively simple. Thirdly, based on label enhancement and proposed fuzzy synergistic discrimination information, we construct a three-stage online multi-label streaming feature selection method, including online significance analysis, online relevance analysis and online redundancy analysis. Finally, comparative experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The influences of different feature sequences and these components on the algorithm&#39;s performance are further analyzed.},

Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often require extensive annotations and high computational costs, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a Fuzzy Optimization Feature Fusion Model (FOFFM) based on Vision Transformer, designed to enhance FGVC accuracy and efficiency. FOFFM addresses challenges such as information loss during image-to-token mapping and high category similarity by optimizing classification token capabilities and leveraging Contrastive Loss. By enhancing resource efficiency and reducing redundant computations, FOFFM contributes to lower energy consumption and operational costs, directly supporting sustainable manufacturing practices. Experimental results on the NABirds dataset demonstrate FOFFM&#39;s competitive performance with a streamlined, resource-efficient end-to-end training process. Unlike other methods, such as TransFG, FOFFM reduces computational complexity while maintaining robust accuracy, making it highly suitable for practical applications in sustainable manufacturing, particularly in optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact. This work provides valuable insights for manufacturing data analysis and contributes to advancing FGVC in sustainable manufacturing contexts.},

However, traditional virtual fixtures with constant stiffness are inadequate for scenarios where robots need to leave the constraints to perform tasks. To address this, we propose an adaptive virtual fixture based on the motion refinement tube, which dynamically adjusts the guiding force according to the distribution of trajectories. To prevent tube deformation in the Cartesian space due to the neglect of off-diagonal elements of covariance matrices, the refinement tube radii and nonlinear stiffness terms are computed in local coordinate systems based on the decomposed covariance matrix. An energy-tank-based passivity controller is designed to ensure system stability when employing the virtual fixture with state-dependent stiffness terms. In the validation tests with 18 participants, the proposed method showed improvements in task efficiency (18.69% increase) and collision avoidance (97.87% reduction) for a typical pick-and-place task with scattered materials. It also provided better subjective experiences of the users than traditional virtual fixtures. Meanwhile, compared with the method that neglects off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, the proposed method exhibited a 4.28% efficiency improvement and a 40.42% decrease in collision occurrences.},

Brain responses of participants (N=30) were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) while they perceived artificially generated images of faces and were instructed to look for a particular semantic feature, such as “smile” or “young”. A supervised adversarial autoencoder was trained to disentangle semantic image features by using EEG data as a supervision signal. The model was subsequently conditioned to generate images matching users&#39; intentions without additional human input. The approach was evaluated in a validation study comparing brain-conditioned models to manually conditioned and randomly conditioned alternatives. Human assessors scored the saliency of images generated from different models according to the target visual features (e.g., which face image is more “smiling” or more “young”).

The questionnaire cannot however capture real-time fluctuations of the factors for an objective quantification. Additionally, each of the factors is associated with distinct activities and can be influenced by individual characteristics and/or task contexts. Such HMS adaptation should thus consider the objective quantification of each factor. So far, the quantification remains largely unexplored, while existing studies reveal a potential use of an electroencephalography (EEG) in measuring the CWL levels (e.g., high, medium, and low). Herein, we presented a pioneering study to propose EEG features for quantifying the factors. The pertinence of the features was demonstrated by their strong correlations with the scores of the factors across three distinct cases of visuomotor tasks.

The experiments were conducted on a motorized two-wheeler simulator in a randomized order in four situations: 1) normal, 2) distraction, 3) time pressure, and 4) distraction under time pressure. Naturalistic riding data was also collected to validate the results in normal riding conditions. First, seven latent classes were developed to understand the variation in speed of the rider along the road stretch as the rider approached or departed away from the speed hump. Further, using the spring-mass block theory, the riders&#39; speed was considered to be the combination of constant base speed and varying simple harmonic motion speed. The spring-mass block theory was validated by developing univariate Bayesian regression models. Finally, the impact of inadequate marking and driving assistance systems such as advanced warning, individual vehicle attributes, lifestyle, and road crash history on the speed profile has been quantified using linear mixed effect models. Furthermore, the speed profile equations were validated using field data. The results revealed that unmarked speed humps were less detectable as the riders responded seven meters late to inadequately visible speed humps compared to marked speed humps. The advanced warning helped in smoothening the speed profile of the rider, which is crucial in avoiding crashes due to the speed hump. Overall, this study can further help in improving the adaptability of the advanced driver assistance systems and evidence-based policy making of speed hump placement to minimize road crashes.},

Our goal is to harness the power of combining deep learning and software visualization to automatically capture and aggregate high-level features that are not inherently linked, thereby revealing hidden maliciousness of Android app behaviors. To thoroughly comprehend the details of apps, we visualize app behaviors from three related but distinct views of behavioral sensitivities, operational contexts and supported environments. We then extract high-order semantics based on the views accordingly. To exploit semantic complementarity of the views, we design a deep neural network based model for fusing the visualized features from local to global based on their contributions to downstream tasks. A comprehensive comparison with six baseline techniques is performed on datasets of more than 51K apps in three real-world typical scenarios, including overall threats, app evolution and zero-day malware. The experimental results show that the overall effectiveness of LensDroid is better than the baseline techniques. We also validate the complementarity of the views and demonstrate that the multi-view fusion in LensDroid enhances Android malware detection.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread use of machine learning (ML), privacy concerns during neural network inference are attracting growing attention. Secure two-party neural network (2PC-NN) inference is the privacy-preserving inference method, which allows client to obtain the inference result without disclosing client’s input to the server. The server’s model parameters are also confidential to the client. However, current 2PC-NN inference schemes still have large overhead, especially for non-linear functions. In this paper, we present Swift, a fast secure 2PC-NN inference scheme based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and secret sharing (SS). FHE protects the input and model parameters in linear functions, while SS is integrated to protect the non-linear functions. Concretely, Swift integrates FHE and SS to design secure and efficient non-linear protocols used for ReLU and max pooling. To further optimize performance, Swift employs FHE with computation-friendly coefficient encoding for fast execution of linear functions, and SIMD encoding for non-linear functions. Swift constructs efficient encoding conversion protocol between the coefficient-encoded ciphertext and the SIMD-encoded ciphertext. Finally, Swift achieves secure neural network inference framework for MNIST dataset. Compared with Cheetah (USENIX 2022), the execution time of ReLU, max pooling, secure inference under a WAN setting improves 7.4×, 13.3×, 1.9×, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In high-stakes process industries, the Basic Process Control System (BPCS) relies on conventional control to enhance productivity, while the Safety Instrumented System (SIS) uses safety functions to maintain safety. Compared to the BPCS, attackers targeting the SIS can modify safety function activation conditions to trigger them prematurely or to evade the activation of the safety function. While various attack detection methods focus on the BPCS, they often overlook the SIS. This can lead to undetected safety breaches, significantly increasing the risk of catastrophic fault. Recent methods face three key limitations that hinder their practical application to SIS. First, both attackers and engineers can exploit the hot update mechanism of SIS to add or modify control logic. However, current methods lack verification for the newly added or modified logic. Second, current methods are unable to assess the rationality of dangerous value ranges. Third, these methods struggle to distinguish between faults and attacks, making it difficult to determine the appropriate time to activate the SIS’s safety function. To overcome these limitations, we propose SecureSIS, a method for securing SIS safety functions by leveraging the safety attributes of the SIS and incorporating information from the BPCS. The core of SecureSIS includes: 1) using the safety attributes of the SIS to verify automatically extracted candidate control logic detection rules; 2) utilizing information from the BPCS to verify automatically extracted candidate value range detection rules; and 3) distinguishing between safety function attacks and industrial process faults with validated rules and integration of process data from BPCS. Our scheme was evaluated using a Tricon SIS controller deployed on a gas pipeline network platform. The results indicate that SecureSIS achieved 97.3% accuracy in detecting data injection attacks and a detection accuracy of 96.0% for control logic modification attacks. Compared with the other representative detection approaches, our scheme has better detection performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the powerful feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), deep image hashing has extensive applications in the fields such as image authentication, copy detection and content retrieval, making its security a critical concern. Among various security metrics, collision resistance serves as a crucial indicator of deep image hashing methods. Research on collision attacks not only reveals the potential vulnerabilities of deep image hashing but also can promote the development of more robust and secure hashing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel generative collision attack scheme, which achieves several advantages over existing attack schemes based on adversarial examples. Our scheme requires no additional perturbations added to the image, and can simultaneously generate multiple hash collision images of different classes specified by the attacker. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative collision attack scheme effective across various deep image hashing methods. Specifically, our attack framework consists of three parts, i.e., a Hash-to-Noise Network (HTNN), a pretrained BigGAN generator and a conditional discriminator. The designed HTNN embeds the hash code of the target image and the attacker-specified generation class information into a “noise” vector. By optimizing various hash distance loss functions between the generated and target images, this “noise” guides the generator to directly generate images that meet the collision requirement. At the same time, the discriminator ensures that the generated images are visually realistic. Extensive experimental results verify that our scheme can effectively generate multiple high-quality images with attacker-specified classes, achieving the high success rate of hash collision attack and the applicability across state-of-the-art deep hashing methods.},

As most current works focus on privacy during the training and inference tasks in machine learning, implementing privacy preservation in preprocessing is a powerful complement. In this paper, we present an efficient and privacy-preserving feature selection protocol based on secure multiparty computation (MPC). We customize a novel method called approximate fixed-point representation to reduce the bitwidth of the sample distribution probability, thereby decreasing communication overhead. We optimize the comparison protocol by reducing the high-order bits of values according to the characteristics of the datasets and design the feature score calculation protocol together with several other MPC-based sub-protocols. We also construct an efficient feature selection workflow to obtain the reduced feature matrix, which avoids the numerous calls of secure comparison and equality test protocols in loops. Experiments on several real-world datasets show that the improved comparison protocol achieves a 29%-53% improvement in runtime and a 6%-32% reduction in communication compared to the general comparison protocol. The optimized feature selection workflow exhibits an upper performance bound, achieving a 38% improvement in runtime compared to prior work. Besides, we implement secure logistic regression training based on the selection features, where the accuracy has improved by an average of 8% compared to training on raw features.},

Hence, anomalous communication behaviors may often indicate cyber attacks taking place in these systems. As a result, identifying anomalous communication links can help us to activate appropriate response mechanisms to ensure the integrity and security of such networked systems. In this study, we propose an approach to detect anomalous communication links in dynamically evolving networked systems. Furthermore, we employ the External Direct Sum of Vector Spaces (EDSoVS) to enable edge/dyad representation learning from node representations. We then use the dyad representations as features to train an SVM model and detect future anomalous links. We evaluate our approach on a synthetic dataset representing a real-world communication network provided by the MITRE Corporation and twelve real-world datasets provided by Cisco. Our empirical results show that the accuracy rates of the proposed model vary between 70.54% to 95.79%, while the F1 score is between 78.22% and 95.97%.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed a spurt progress in steganography, which poses challenges for steganalysis. However, previous steganalysis methods attach equal attention to various feature information, while key feature information in detection is ubiquitously ignored, and the detection time-space cost is burdened consequently. To alleviate this predicament, this paper proposes an enhanced image steganalysis via opposition-based evolutionary algorithm (EIS-OBEA), which can guide steganalysis showing more solicitude for key feature information and reduce detection time overhead. Specifically, evolutionary algorithm is introduced into enhanced steganalysis. To elevate searching ability for steganalysis key feature submodels, Tent map is applied in enhanced steganalysis population initialization because of its great randomness. Secondly, considering that opposition-based learning can dynamically adjust searching space of enhanced steganalysis population, opposition-based learning via lens imaging strategy is proposed to help enhanced steganalysis escape from local optimal solutions. Then, to reasonably evaluate the detection contribution of steganalysis key feature submodels, the pearson correlation coefficient for steganalysis is designed. On this basis, fitness function is devised to select superior individuals and obtain steganalysis key feature submodels after iteration. It is noted that EIS-OBEA can optimize steganalysis training samples into quite small-size data, so that computational cost can be significantly reduced when maintaining or even improving detection accuracy. Extensive experimental results substantiate that compared with the state-of-the-art peer algorithms, EIS-OBEA not only achieves highly competitive or even better detection performance, but also meliorates steganalysis time-space cost to a large extent.},

  abstract     = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) allows two mutually distrusting parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing any additional information, and has found numerous applications. A part of applications require labeled PSI in the unbalanced setting, where a server holds a label for each item in a set that is much larger than the set held by a client, and the client obtains the intersection and the corresponding labels. In this paper, we present a new concretely efficient labeled PSI protocol in the unbalanced setting, without using computation-heavy homomorphic encryption. Our protocol is based on Distributed Point Function (DPF) with hardware acceleration from fixed-key AES-NI, and has communication complexity linear in the size of a small set of the client and sublinear in the size of a large set of the server. Our protocol exploits two Oblivious Pesudorandom Function (OPRF) protocols, based on Diffle-Hellman PRFs or block ciphers, to achieve a trade-off between computation and communication. Our implementation demonstrates that our protocol outperforms the previous labeled and unbalanced PSI protocols. In particular, for two sets with respective 224 and 1 items, where each item has a 32-byte label, our protocol takes 1.19 seconds for an end-to-end performance, resulting in 26× improvement compared to the state-of-the-art protocol by Cong et al.

To address these challenges, we propose two enhancements. The first enhancement optimizes quantization distortion in existing frameworks to minimize KL divergence, thereby enhancing theoretical security. The second redesigns the sampling mechanism via distribution coupling to amplify steganographic capacity, achieving this without incurring substantial computational overhead. Experimental validation on text generation task confirms our enhancements substantially outperform previous implementations, demonstrating notable capacity improvements, marked security enhancements, and efficiency gains on consumer-grade hardware. Cross-task comparisons with popular provably secure steganography further establish the proposed enhancements as achieving superior security-capacity-efficiency tradeoffs across diverse generative scenarios, advancing the practical deployment of provably secure steganography systems.},

Usually, shadow models are trained without taking into account the target model; we argue that utilizing the predictions of the target model can guide the training process of the shadow model. To improve the efficiency of shadow model-based membership inference attacks, we propose GLiRA, a knowledge distillation-guided approach to membership inference attacks.

To restrict user access from untrusted devices, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been proposed to authenticate users and devices simultaneously. However, when integrating BYOD policy into MEC authentication to improve security, issues of efficient binding and user-device conditional anonymity have not been well supported. To address these issues, we propose Bring Your Device Group (BYDG) policy by constructing efficient and privacy-preserving user-device authentication. Our core idea is to use key sequences generated by PUFs-based key derivation functions (KDFs) to not only construct efficient binding relationships, but also achieve conditional anonymity for device groups. Specifically, a flexible and secure binding method is first developed by leveraging Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to bind user with device groups. Each device’s CRT modulus is derived from the key sequence to construct many-to-many user-device binding relationships, which are managed in the form of on-chain Pedersen Commitment. Moreover, we design an identity anonymizing and tracing method for device groups. The key sequence is regarded as traceable device pseudo-identities, and then inserted into the cuckoo filter to reduce the on-chain storage overhead and mitigate malicious login attempts with low costs. Based on above two methods, the combination of Pedersen Commitment and Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge is used to achieve user-device authentication with conditional anonymity. The security analysis was presented to demonstrate important security properties. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented to conduct performance evaluation and comparative analysis.},

Importantly, our findings indicate that these sufficient de-anonymization conditions are tight and are the same as in the distribution-aware setting, avoiding asymptotic performance loss due to unknown distributions.

  abstract     = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems. Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian and tactical. Specifically, in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) sustained denial raises safety critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection, localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) UAV with a single antenna and a commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone. Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on spectral correlation techniques.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning, hailed as a privacy-preserving collaboration paradigm, has garnered significant attention in research circles. Typically, it involves multiple clients collaborating to integrate multi-party knowledge, facilitating the learning of a shared global model with decentralized local data. Despite the popularity of federated learning, the surge in approaches addressing various realistic challenges has highlighted a critical issue. The aggregated model may struggle to capture diverse domain knowledge across participants, leading to limited performance in cross-client domain scenarios. Furthermore, the incorporation of knowledge from participating parties can hinder generalization on out-of-client distributions. To comprehensively address this challenge, we dissect federated generalization into two dimensions: the participating domain and the unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel solution incorporating domain-specialized and invariant experts. These experts are designed to faithfully represent individual domain characteristics and different domain universality. Additionally, we introduce a pioneering test-time expert aggregation strategy that utilizes prediction consistency metrics to aggregate different experts, specifically tailored for handling agnostic testing distributions. Empirical results validate that our proposed methodology significantly enhances federated performance on both cross-client and out-of-client generalization under different scenarios and with various related methods. A comprehensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed modules.},

  abstract     = {The technique of hiding secret messages within seemingly harmless covertext to evade examination by censors with rigorous security proofs is known as provably secure steganography (PSS). PSS evolves from symmetric key steganography to public-key steganography, functioning without the requirement of a pre-shared key and enabling the extension to multi-party covert communication and identity verification mechanisms. Recently, a public-key steganography method based on elliptic curves was proposed, which uses point compression to eliminate the algebraic structure of curve points. However, this method has strict requirements on the curve parameters and is only available on half of the points. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a more general elliptic curve public key steganography method based on admissible encoding. By applying the tensor square function to the known well-distributed encoding, we construct admissible encoding, which can create the pseudo-random public-key encryption function. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed provable secure public-key steganography method can be deployed on all types of curves and utilize all points on the curve.},

  abstract     = {Data confidentiality, a fundamental security element for dependable cloud storage, has been drawing widespread concern. Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) has emerged as a promising approach for privacy protection while enabling efficient retrieval of encrypted data. One of the typical applications of PEKS is searching sensitive electronic medical records (EMR) in healthcare clouds. However, many traditional countermeasures fall short of balancing privacy protection with search efficiency, and they often fail to support multi-user EMR sharing. To resolve these challenges, we propose a novel lightweight multi-user public-key authenticated encryption scheme with keyword search (LM-PAEKS). Our design effectively counters the inside keyword guessing attack (IKGA) while maintaining the sizes of ciphertext and trapdoor constant in multi-user scenarios. The novelty of our approach relies on introducing a dedicated receiver server that skillfully transforms the complex many-to-many relationship between senders and receivers into a streamlined one-to-one relationship. This transformation prevents the sizes of ciphertext and trapdoor from scaling linearly with the number of participants. Our approach ensures ciphertext indistinguishability and trapdoor privacy while avoiding bilinear pairing operations on the client side. Comparative performance analysis demonstrates that LM-PAEKS features significant computational efficiency while meeting higher security requirements, positioning it as a robust alternative to existing solutions.},

However, while the vulnerabilities of fixed-scale SR have been assessed, the robustness of continuous representation-based arbitrary-scale SR against adversarial attacks remains an area warranting further exploration. The elaborately designed adversarial attacks for fixedscale SR are scale-dependent, which will cause time-consuming and memory-consuming problems when applied to arbitraryscale SR. To address this concern, we propose a simple yet effective “scale-invariant” SR adversarial attack method with good transferability, termed SIAGT. Specifically, we propose to construct resource-saving attacks by exploiting finite discrete points of continuous representation. In addition, we formulate a coordinate-dependent loss to enhance the cross-model transferability of the attack. The attack can significantly deteriorate the SR images while introducing imperceptible distortion to the targeted low-resolution (LR) images. Experiments carried out on three popular LIIF-based SR approaches and four classical SR datasets show remarkable attack performance and transferability of SIAGT.},

Specifically, during the sensor deployment phase, we employ quality-guaranteed Monte Carlo propagation simulations coupled with a greedy strategy to achieve maximum coverage with minimal sensors. In the source detection phase, for the structurally incomplete network snapshots, we first attempt edge reconnection from the sensor with the earliest timestamp, followed by posterior maximization Bayesian estimation for source identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SDSA and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/cheng-le/SDSA.},

  abstract     = {One-Time Passwords (OTPs) play a crucial role in Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by adding an additional layer of security. OTPs effectively mitigate the risk of static passwords being intercepted and reused. Nevertheless, both academic schemes and industrial solutions still encounter security threats stemming from server/device compromises and OTP factor forgery. Chain-based asymmetric OTP schemes are a promising approach to addressing server compromise but still face threats from device compromise and pre-generated chain leakage. We emphasize that since devices directly store the OTP seed, OTP authentication is essentially equivalent to verifying device possession. This means that in existing OTP schemes, OTP forgery and device compromise remain prevalent and difficult to overcome. In this work, we propose a brand new scheme to address OTP factor forgery and server/device compromises. For the first time, our scheme constructs a tightly coupled architecture between the password factor and the OTP factor. The OTP seed is derived from a password and a device-stored salt, preventing OTP seed extraction and OTP forgery even in the event of a device compromise. Through the integration of “honeywords” with the tightly coupled OTP architecture, the server stores decoy OTP seeds generated by decoy passwords, providing resistance against server compromises and partial password guessing from devices. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our OTP schemes. The computational overhead is correlated with the number of honeywords, and with the recommended set size of 20, the total verification overhead is approximately 0.24ms. Additionally, we propose formal security properties and application metrics, and rigorously prove our scheme’s resistance against server/device compromise attacks and guessing attacks. Our scheme is the first to achieve comprehensive OTP security with low overhead.},

The ESs are crafted to encompass four critical factors: intra-dataset distance distribution, inter-sample distance within the target dataset, differential distance analysis, and inference withholding ratio.

Using MIBench, we conducted a thorough comparative analysis of 15 state-of-the-art MI attacks across 588 ESs, seven widely adopted datasets, and seven representative model architectures.

However, the existing flow spectrum cannot adapt to the open-world scenarios and behaviorbased detection for unknown cyber threats. To address these challenges, we propose a new flow spectrum construction scheme, named unFlowS, to effectively represent network flows and assist analysts to understand the behaviors of network traffic. unFlowSNet, an unsupervised flow-based detection model we designed as the core of our scheme, can transform network flows into spectral lines. It makes unFlowS possible to detect unknown cyber threats. We further build spectral vectors for spectral lines generated by network flow sets, enabling the visualization of network behaviors within a period of time and automatic behavior-based detection. Experimental results demonstrated that unFlowS-Net can achieve better performance than state-of-the-art methods on unsupervised flow-based detection. Based on spectral vectors, not only can it intuitively display the network behavior characteristic of the target host, but also automatically detect suspicious network behaviors.},

To eliminate the need for additional models and improve performance, we propose a joint augmentation and part learning (JAPL) framework that obtains clothing change positive pairs in an unsupervised fashion by synergistically combining augmentation-based invariant learning (AugIL) and part-based invariant learning (ParIL). AugIL first constructs clothing change pseudo-positive pairs and then encourages the model to focus on clothing-invariant information by enhancing feature consistency between the pseudo-positive pairs. ParIL beneficially encourages high similarity between inter-cluster clothing change positive pair using part images and a prediction sharpening loss. PartIL also introduces a soft consistency loss that promotes clothing-invariant feature learning by encouraging consistency of class vectors between the real features actually used for CC-ReID and the part features. Experimental results on multiple ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed JAPL not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also achieves competitive performance compared to some supervised CC-ReID methods.},

Similarly, on the Wi-Fi dataset, KDM achieves an impressive 88.94% accuracy in low-sample (5-shot) scenarios. The codes are available at https://github.com/tengmouren/KDM2SEI.},

Concerned about stricter attack scenarios, recent studies have tried employing generative networks to synthesize data for training substitute models. Nevertheless, these approaches concurrently encounter challenges associated with unstable training and diminished attack efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel query-efficient data-free black-box adversarial attack method. To mitigate unstable training, for the first time, we directly manipulate the intermediate-layer feature of a generator without relying on any substitute models. Specifically, a label noise-based generation module is created to enhance the intraclass patterns by incorporating partial historical information during the learning process. Additionally, we present a feature-disturbed diversity generation method to augment the inter-class distance. Meanwhile, we propose an adaptive intra-class attack strategy to heighten attack capability within a limited query budget. In this strategy, entropy-based distance is utilized to characterize the relative information from model outputs, while positive classes and negative samples are used to enhance low attack efficiency. The comprehensive experiments conducted on six datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to six state-of-the-art data-free black-box competitors in both label-only and probability-only attack scenarios. Intriguingly, our method can realize the highest attack success rate on the online Microsoft Azure model under an extremely low query budget. Additionally, the proposed approach not only achieves more stable training but also significantly reduces the query count for a more balanced data generation. Furthermore, our method can maintain the best performance under the existing defense models and a limited query budget.},

The integration of large-scale antenna arrays (LSAA) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance PLS. However, LSAA requires a dedicated radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna element, and IRS comprises hundreds of reflecting micro-antennas, leading to increased hardware costs and power consumption. To address this, cost-effective solutions like constant modulus analog beamforming (CMAB) have gained attention. This paper investigates PLS in IRS-assisted communication systems with a focus on jointly designing the CMAB at the transmitter and phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. The resulting secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is non-convex. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose two algorithms: (1) the time-efficient Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm, which reformulates the fractional problem into a series of quadratic programs using the Dinkelbach method and solves them via block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM), and (2) the product manifold conjugate gradient descent (PMCGD) algorithm, which provides a better solution at the cost of slightly higher computational time by transforming the problem into an unconstrained optimization on a Riemannian product manifold and solving it using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and highlight their distinct advantages.},

  abstract     = {As the sole NIST-standardized quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanism, CRYSTALS-Kyber demands rigorous scrutiny of its side-channel countermeasures. However, there is a lack of research on side-channel security for the message decoding module in masked CRYSTALS-Kyber. In this paper, we seek to address this gap. First, we conduct a side-channel security evaluation of the first-order masked message decoding function in mkm4 of CRYSTALS-Kyber, finding that an incremental storage vulnerability still exists. Then, we implement a practical experiment in the Cortex-M4 CPU using the sum-of-squared difference method, with the accuracy of the message recovery reaching 90.6% and the secret key recovery achieving 77.2%. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze that any order of masking strategy cannot effectively protect the message decoding function, except by increasing the attack difficulty to a limited extent. We also provide our idea for solving this problem by emulating the data behavior of the dual-rail pre-charge logic circuit at the software level, which can effectively ensure the implementation security of CRYSTALS-Kyber.},

  abstract     = {Remote data integrity auditing enables a client to efficiently ensure the integrity of entire data stored in untrusted servers via auditing. Yet, existing solutions generally emphasize on various metrics (such as minimal storage, fast update, metadata privacy), but not audit performance (e.g., low audit time, small proof size). To this end, a label-aggregating remote data integrity auditing scheme (LARDA) was proposed in ESORICS ’22, which is the state-of-the-art work in terms of proof size and storage cost. However, LARDA needs a trusted third party (TTP) for performing data auditing for all data owners, which introduces a single point of failure since the audit process routinely needs to interact with the TTP. To address this issue, we introduce a new concept called threshold label-aggregating data auditing and propose two novel schemes. Our first solution is based on Pedersen secret sharing technique, which can significantly alleviate the key escrow problem of LARDA. Our second solution is an efficient batch verifying scheme for multiple TTP’s secret key shares, utilizing the KZG (Kate, Zaverucha and Goldberg) secret sharing technique. This scheme can maintain the size of commitment for TTP’s secret key constant rather than a linear factor with the number of TTPs. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the scalability of our schemes. In particular, our second scheme improves the verification time for TTP’s secret key shares in constant, only requiring two pairings and one exponentiation in group with an average of 7.39 ms, regardless of the number of TTPs increasing. For our first scheme, the verification procedure requires 2t exponentiations in group (where t is the threshold value), ranging from 2.37 ms (t = 2) to 26.85 ms (t = 35).},

Most existing schemes only consider the scenario where user models have the same weight in model aggregation. However, users often hold different numbers of training samples in practice. This makes the model convergence speed of existing schemes very slow. To solve this problem, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning scheme with secure weighted aggregation. It is able to allocate appropriate user weights based on the user’s local data size with privacy protection. In addition, it is impossible for the cloud server to obtain the user’s original model parameters and local data size in the proposed scheme. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation to combine the model parameters and local data size into a set of ciphertexts. The cloud server can smoothly perform weighted aggregation based on these ciphertexts. Leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we convert the local data size into a series of verification values. This enables the user to verify the correctness of results returned from the server. We provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed scheme, demonstrating its effectiveness, privacy, and verifiability. We perform extensive experiments on the MNIST dataset. Experimental results demonstrate its model performance, computation overhead, and communication overhead.},

Key-value data, as a popular NoSQL structure, requires simultaneous frequency and mean estimations of each key, which poses a challenge to traditional LDP-based collection methods. Despite many schemes proposed for the privacy protection of key-value data, they inadequately solve the condensed perturbation for keys and the advanced combination of privacy budgets, leading to suboptimal estimation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an efficient key-value collection scheme (COKV) with tight privacy budget composition. In our scheme, we first design a padding and sampling protocol for key-value data to avoid privacy budget splitting. Second, to enhance the utility of key perturbation, we design a key perturbation primitive and optimize the perturbation range to improve computational efficiency. After that, we propose a key-value association perturbation algorithm whose value perturbation strategy guarantees the output expectation equals the original value. Finally, we demonstrate that through a tight privacy budget composition, COKV can provide higher data utility under the same privacy level. Theoretical analysis shows that COKV possesses lower frequency and mean estimations variance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets also indicate that COKV outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for secure key-value data collection.},

  abstract     = {Privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) based on Differential Privacy (DP) protects clients’ data by adding DP noise to samples’ gradients and has emerged as a de facto standard for data privacy in FL. However, the accuracy of global models in DP-based FL may be reduced significantly when rogue clients occur who deviate from the preset DP-based FL approaches and selfishly inject excessive DP noise beyond expectations, thereby applying a smaller privacy budget in the DP mechanism to ensure a higher level of security. Existing DP-based FL fails to prevent such attacks as they are imperceptible. Under the DP-based FL system and random Gaussian noise, the local model parameters of the rogue clients and the honest clients have identical distributions. In particular, the rogue local models show a low performance, but directly filtering out lower-performance local models compromises the generalizability of global models, as local models trained on scarce data also behave with low performance in the early epoch. In this paper, we propose ReFL, a novel privacy-preserving FL system that enforces DP and avoids the accuracy reduction of global models caused by excessive DP noise of rogue clients. Based on the observation that rogue local models with excessive DP noise and honest local models trained on scarce data have different performance patterns in long-term training epochs, we propose a long-term contribution incentives scheme to evaluate clients’ reputations and identify rogue clients. Furthermore, we design a reputation-based aggregation to avoid the damage of rogue clients’ models on the global model accuracy, based on the incentive reputation. Extensive experiments demonstrate ReFL guarantees the global model accuracy performance 0.77% - 81.71% higher than existing DP-based FL methods in the presence of rogue clients.},

A POR scheme with public verifiability further enhances usability by allowing users to delegate the auditing task to a third party, making it highly desirable for a wide range of applications. However, most existing publicly verifiable POR schemes derive their security from the computational hardness of discrete logarithm or factoring, making them vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although it is possible to construct quantum-resistant POR schemes with public verifiability upon hash trees or general lattices, the resulting schemes often exhibit performance limitations when compared to existing constructions, thereby limiting their deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we address this gap by constructing a new publicly verifiable POR scheme on structured lattices. We show that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the Ring-LWE and Ring-SIS assumptions. We provide an implementation of our scheme and our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our scheme is comparable to that of well-known constructions based on pairing and RSA.},

Nevertheless, under the dishonest-majority setting with malicious adversaries, prior secure inference works are still costly in terms of communication and run-time. Additionally, existing outsourcing frameworks impose a substantial client-side design, which leads to obstacles in resource-constrained devices. To address the above challenges, we propose MD-SONIC, an online efficient and maliciously-secure framework for outsourcing NN inference with a dishonest majority. We first construct communication-efficient n-party protocols for the basic primitives such as fixed-point multiplication and most significant bit extraction by combining mask-sharing and TinyOT-sharing with SPDZ2k seamlessly. Then, we build fast secure blocks for the widely used NN operators, including matrix multiplication, ReLU, and Maxpool, on top of our basic primitives. To enable an arbitrary number of users to outsource the secure inference task to n computing servers, we propose a lightweight-client and fast Σ paradigm named SPIN, stemming from zero-knowledge proofs. Our SPIN can be instantiated into a set of efficient outsourcing protocols over multiple algebraic structures (e.g., finite field and ring). We also conduct extensive evaluations of MD-SONIC on various neural networks. Compared to the work by Damgård et al.

To address this, we investigate X-ray prohibited item detection under labor-efficient point supervision and develop an intra-inter objectness learning network (I2OL-Net). I2OL-Net consists of two key modules: an intra-modality objectness learning (intra-OL) module and an inter-modality objectness learning (inter-OL) module. The intra-OL module designs a local focus Gaussian masking block and a global random Gaussian masking block to collaboratively learn the objectness in X-ray images. Meanwhile, the inter-OL module introduces the wavelet decomposition-based adversarial learning block and the objectness block, effectively reducing the modality discrepancy between natural images and X-ray images and transferring the objectness knowledge learned from natural images with box annotations to X-ray images. Based on the above, I2OL-Net greatly alleviates the severe problem of part domination caused by large intra-class variations in X-ray images. Experimental results on four X-ray datasets show that I2OL-Net can achieve superior performance with a significant reduction of annotation cost, thus enhancing its accessibility and practicality.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in applying artificial intelligence to IDS. However, existing research often assumes that training and testing data are static and identically distributed, whereas in reality, data drift is inevitable. Moreover, to enhance model versatility and detection performance, models have become increasingly complex, posing challenges to real-time deployment. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive network intrusion detection system named A-NIDS, consisting of a main task and two bypass tasks. The main task is to develop a fully connected and shallow network with strong detection performance and real-time capability. The first bypass task is a clustering model that helps the main task detect data drift in an unsupervised manner. The second bypass task is a generation model to generate old data to address catastrophic forgetting in new model iterations and the storage cost issue caused by accumulating old data. We conduct extensive experiments on the CICIDS-2017 and CSE-CICIDS-2018 datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of A-NIDS on new and old data. Furthermore, our detection module achieves a detection latency of 5 microseconds, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications.

  abstract     = {The reentrancy vulnerability is one of the most notorious vulnerabilities of smart contracts. It enables attackers to hijack the control flow of a smart contract by invoking a function as the entry point and then re-invoking a function as the reentry point before the execution of the entry point ends. Although several approaches have been proposed to detect this vulnerability, they still face two main limitations. Firstly, existing approaches oversimplify the rules for identifying entry and reentry points, and many even neglect reentry point identification during vulnerability detection. Secondly, most existing approaches overlook the flow of state variables that are not promptly updated, a critical aspect of the reentrancy vulnerability. To address the limitations mentioned above, this article proposes a novel static analysis framework for reentry vulnerability detection. We formulate the reentrancy vulnerability detection as entry and reentry point identification with the state variable flow tracking. Based on the insight that most smart contracts are implemented following various technical standards, we utilize static analysis with standard-based rules to identify potential entry and reentry points. This is achieved by detecting the presence of hijackable and exploitable operations inside the smart contract. Meanwhile, we also conduct state variable flow tracking by the static taint analysis. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we construct three different datasets. ThenWe compare our approach with eight state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detectors, and our tool outperforms these baselines in detecting more vulnerable samples with fewer false positive samples. Meanwhile, our approach achieves a relatively shorter detection time with better detection results, striking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) has emerged as a vital technique for enhancing Physical Layer Authentication (PLA) in New Radio (NR) networks. Unlike cryptographic methods, RFF leverages device-specific signal impairments to uniquely identify transmitters. Deep Learning (DL) advances have improved PLA, though challenges persist due to communication channel dynamics and device state changes. In this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates 5G NR protocol-specific structures and channel knowledge via SRS-based CSI to generate relative RFF features. Through a tailored frame design and carefully engineered processing pipeline, we achieve cross-domain stability and improved robustness against time-varying conditions. By applying regularization techniques (e.g., mixup) during training, our method further mitigates model overfitting and domain bias. Simulation and real-world SDR experiments, using data from 9 ADALM-PLUTO devices, validate the approach’s effectiveness. The proposed system attains recognition accuracies of 99.878%, 93.376%, 86.325%, and 66.558% in intra-domain, cross-channel, cross-time, and cross-scenario tests, respectively, highlighting its potential to substantially enhance physical layer security in NR-based networks.},

  abstract     = {With the prevalence of online social networks (OSNs), much personal information is collected and maintained by trusted service providers for third-party queries and analyses. Existing works regarding differentially private social network data publication overlook the fact that different users exhibit distinct privacy preferences or sensitivity inclinations. Neglecting these individual nuances may lead to privacy mechanisms that are overly conservative or inadequately protective. Furthermore, the injection of excessive noise into OSN data perceived by users as non-personal or less sensitive can incur additional privacy costs, resulting in lower service quality. This paper introduces a fine-grained, sensitivity-aware personalized edge differential privacy model (SPEDP) for OSNs. Specifically, SPEDP enables each OSN user to individually define the sensitivity level of their social connections, facilitating user-friendly personalized privacy settings. We design a privacy-aware mechanism that operates within a trusted service provider, capable of establishing privacy protection levels based on user-perceived sensitivity settings. Additionally, we propose a sensitivity-aware sampling mechanism to implement SPEDP. To further optimize the privacy mechanism, we explore a privacy threshold optimization strategy aimed at minimizing privacy budget waste. Finally, the personalized privacy protections and utility improvements achieved by the SPEDP mechanism are rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and comprehensive comparative experiments on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Hand-based multimodal biometrics has garnered significant attention in information security and identity authentication. However, prevalent multimodal recognition techniques often extract the discriminant features from different modalities separately, ignoring the structural consistency between various modalities of the same class. Moreover, these methods generally focus on specific-scenarios, where recognition performance will be compromised when faced with different databases or multiple application scenarios. To solve these limitations, we present an innovative Dual-Cohesion Metric Learning (DCML) framework embedded in noise decomposition for few-shot hand multimodal biometrics. This approach comprehensively exploits multimodal features from both intra-modal and inter-modal structural consistency to improve its robustness across multiple applications. Specifically, DCML imposes a dual-cohesion mechanism to pull in the cross-modal distance of the same label and the within-class distance for each modal, while concurrently pushing away the between-class distance in the projected space. Furthermore, in the procedure of feature learning, the proposed DCML incorporates the low-rank constraint to mitigate the interference of noise in the raw data and enforces a sparsity constraint to extract more salient and compact features. Notably, our DCML can be flexibly extended to other multimodal biometrics. Extensive experimental results on six multimodal datasets demonstrated that our DCML outperforms the latest approaches in multiple multimodal recognition scenarios and has strong generalization ability even when the training samples are small.},

  abstract     = {A privacy model is a privacy condition, dependent on a parameter, that guarantees an upper bound on the risk of reidentification disclosure and maybe also on the risk of attribute disclosure by an adversary. A privacy model is composable if the privacy guarantees of the model are preserved, possibly to a limited extent, after repeated independent application of the privacy model. From the opposite perspective, a privacy model is not composable if multiple independent data releases, each of them satisfying the requirements of the privacy model, may result in a privacy breach. Current privacy models are broadly classified into syntactic ones (such as k-anonymity and l-diversity) and semantic ones, which essentially refer to ε-differential privacy (ε-DP) and variations thereof. While ε-DP and its variants offer strong composability properties, syntactic notions are not composable unless data releases are conducted by a single, centralized data holder that uses specialized notions such as m-invariance and τ-safety. In this work, we propose m-uncoordinated-syntactic-privacy (m-USP), the first syntactic notion with composability properties for the independent publication of nondisjoint data, in other words, without a centralized data holder. Theoretical results are formally proven, and experimental results demonstrate that the risk to individuals does not increase significantly, in contrast to non-composable methods, that are susceptible to attribute disclosure. In most cases, the utility degradation caused by the extra protection is less than 5% and decreases as the value of m increases.},

As a pioneering work, the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) is proved more transferable in black-box attacks than its multi-small-step extension, i.e., iterative-FGSM, particularly being restricted by a limited number of iterations. This paper revisits their early, representative successor MI-FGSM as a baseline, i.e., iterative-FGSM with momentum, and introduces an innovative boosting idea different from either FGSM-inspired algorithms or other mainstream methods. For one thing, during gradient backpropogation of MI-FGSM, the proposed approach merely requires amending the chain rule with respect to adversarial images using the counterpart original images. For another, a credible analysis has revealed that such a naively boosted MI-FGSM essentially performs a special kind of intermediate-layer attacks. In specific, the notable finding in the paper is a new principle of adversarial transferability guided by the relative feature importance, emphasizing the significance of semantically non-critical information for the first time in the literature, although originally thought to be weak in large. Experimental results on various leading victim models, both undefended and defended, demonstrate that the new approach incorporating robust gradients has indeed attained stronger adversarial transferability than state-of-the-art works.

This study proposes an advanced domain incremental learning (DIL) framework for SEI, named Adaptive Domain-Incremental Learning with Knowledge Replay and Domain Alignment (ADIRA). ADIRA employs knowledge replay and distillation strategies, along with adaptive coefficients, to balance the model’s performance in recognizing signals across both new and old domains. To address the variations in signal data feature distributions across different domains, we introduce a domain alignment strategy based on adversarial training. This approach integrates embedding distillation loss with supervised contrastive loss, significantly enhancing the model’s adaptability to domain changes. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that ADIRA achieves performance only 0.42% and 1.71% lower than joint training, with replay samples constituting just 1.1% and 1.5% of the training set, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.},

To address this, we propose a parallel pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) scheme that ensures constellations are regularly superimposed at the legitimate receiver while appearing chaotic to the eavesdropper. Consequently, the eavesdropper experiences a consistently high bit/symbol error rate, whereas the legitimate receiver maintains a very low error rate. Furthermore, we extend the parallel PAM scheme to both the in-phase and quadrature components of the signal, forming a heterogeneous quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) scheme. This enhances transmission efficiency while preserving security. We analyze the bit/symbol error rates at both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, deriving a lower bound for the eavesdropper’s error rate.

  abstract     = {Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) has gained widespread attention for ensuring the security and integrity of data communication. While existing PKI mainly supports digital signatures, it is lacking in crucial anonymity, leading to the leakage of a signer’s identity information. To alleviate the issue, ring signatures are a suitable choice to provide anonymity as they allow users to create their own rings without the need for an administrator. Unfortunately, the utilization of ring signatures in PKI may present compatibility challenges within the system. Thus, proposing a general mechanism to convert a standardized Σ-based signature to a ring signature is far-reaching. In this paper, we propose a general construction for converting Σ-based signatures into ring signatures. To achieve this, we first introduce a Σ-based general model, providing a general transformation to convert existing Σ-based signatures into a Σ-protocol form. Subsequently, we incorporate our redesigned one-out-of-many relation within our general model and proceed to devise ring signatures leveraging on one-out-of-many proofs. Furthermore, to reduce the signature size, we employ the Bullet-proofs folding technique, enabling the attainment of logarithmic size ring signatures. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our general construction, we present four prominent signatures as case studies. Ultimately, we conduct a rigorous security analysis and benchmark experimental evaluation. The signing and verification times are 0.44 to 0.97 times and 0.27 to 0.91 times compared to other state-of-the-art schemes, respectively. Additionally, we exhibit the lowest signature size to date.},

It has several valuable applications, for instance, wireless sensor networks. Identity-based chameleon hash (IB-CH), as an alternative building block to construct OO-IBS, has been explored in numerous literatures. Nevertheless, there still exist two major issues. (1) Nearly all of the previous IB-CH schemes with weak collision-resistance (W-CollRes) are with random oracles, which may lead to security risks in practicality. The only IB-CH scheme in the standard model suffers from the large size of public parameters and inefficient setup process. (2) The only IB-CH scheme without key exposure also relies on random oracles. In this paper, we propose two novel IB-CH schemes in the standard model. The first scheme is adaptive identity, W-CollRes secure and efficient, significantly reducing the computation costs of all algorithms and the size of public parameters compared with the existing scheme in the standard model. The second scheme is the first IB-CH achieving key exposure freeness without random oracles. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the good performance of our proposed schemes. Furthermore, we apply our schemes to optimizing the existing generic OO-IBS construction. The optimized generic constructions reduce computational overhead by 50.0% in the online phase and enable the hash value/signature tuple generated in the offline phase to be reusable, respectively.},

The resulting schemes are theoretically helpful for private key security but inconvenient for individual users as their implementation requires distributed computing and networking system with broadcasting channels. To address the private key security issue of PKC schemes for individual users, this paper proposes the concept and general construction of sequentially threshold PKC under a communication model consisting of a computing device and several offline storages where broadcasting channels are not required. To illustrate the new paradigm, we design and realize a sequentially threshold Schnorr signature scheme STSS. The security proofs for STSS indicate its effectiveness of achieving unforeability under traditional attacks as well as security incidents caused by human faults and system failures. The experiments on FIPS recommended curves P-256, P-384, and P-521 show that STSS is comparable with the original Schnorr scheme in terms of time consumed for generating a signature. The construction of sequentially threshold ElGamal decrtyption scheme is also presented. Finally, we illustrate the application of STSS in the Blockchain ecosystem.},

However, current VFL solutions are limited in their ability to perform inference on non-overlapping samples, and data stored on clients is often subject to loss due to various unavoidable factors. This leads to incomplete client data, where client missing features (MF) are frequently overlooked in VFL. The main aim of this paper is to propose a VFL framework to handle missing features (MFVFL), which is a tensor decomposition network-based approach that can effectively learn intra- and inter-client feature information from client data with missing features to improve VFL performance. In the proposed MFVFL method each client imputes missing values and encodes features to learn intra-feature information, and the server collects the uploaded feature embeddings as input to our developed low-rank tensor decomposition network to learn inter-feature information. Finally, the server aggregates the representations from tensor decomposition to train a global classifier. In the paper, we theoretically guarantee the convergence of MFVFL. In addition, differential privacy (DP) for data privacy protection is always used, and the proposed framework (MFVFL-DP) can deal with such degraded data by using a tensor robust PCA to alleviate the impact of noise while preserving data privacy. We conduct extensive experiments on six datasets of different sample sizes and feature dimensions, and demonstrate that MFVFL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially under high missing ratios. The experimental results also show that MFVFL-DP possesses excellent denoising capabilities and illustrate that the noisy effect by the DP mechanism can be alleviated.},

Downstream tasks built on top of those pre-trained encoders can achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance. The pre-trained encoders by SSL, however, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks as demonstrated by existing studies. Numerous backdoor mitigation techniques are designed for downstream task models. However, their effectiveness is impaired and limited when adapted to pre-trained encoders, due to the lack of label information when pre-training. To address backdoor attacks against pretrained encoders, in this paper, we innovatively propose a mutual information guided backdoor mitigation technique, named MIMIC(Mutual Information guided backdoor MItigation for pre-trained enCoders). MIMIC uses the potentially backdoored encoder as the teacher network and applies knowledge distillation to create a clean student encoder from it. Different from existing knowledge distillation approaches, MIMIC initializes the student with random weights, inheriting no backdoors from teacher nets. Then MIMIC leverages mutual information between each layer and extracted features to locate where benign knowledge lies in the teacher net, with which distillation is deployed to clone clean features from teacher to student. We craft the distillation loss with two aspects, including clone loss and attention loss, aiming to mitigate backdoors and maintain encoder performance at the same time. Our evaluation conducted on two backdoor attacks in SSL demonstrates that MIMIC can significantly reduce the attack success rate by only utilizing. ≤ 5% of clean pre-training data that is accessible to the defender, surpassing seven state-of-the-art backdoor mitigation techniques. The source code of MIMIC is available at https://github.com/wssun/MIMIC.},

In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way.We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data x as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data x + τ . Importantly, the trigger τ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as models with trigger activation. We are surprised to find that these models exhibit certain robustness against TAEs. Through the consideration of first-order gradients, we provide a theoretical analysis of this robustness. Moreover, through the joint optimization of the learnable trigger and the model, we achieve improved robustness to transferable attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse datasets, evaluating a variety of attacking methods, underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.},

The statistical distribution of the relative amount of perturbation is derived from simple assumptions, outlining the key factor that drives its typical values: The higher the intrinsic dimensionality, the more vulnerable is the nearest neighbors search.

These challenges are particularly pressing in today’s information-driven society, where such emissions pose substantial security risks. To address this issue, this paper focuses on spread spectrum clocking (SSC) schemes employed in information visualization devices (IVDs), offering an in-depth analysis of the diverse characteristics of EM leakage and highlighting their associated risks. To convey our contributions, we introduce a novel model based on a modified Fourier series that accurately captures SSC-induced EM waves, enhancing the understanding of emissions from SSC-based devices. Additionally, we propose complete coherent demodulation (CCD), an advancement of the periodic nonuniform sampling (PNS) framework that resolves byproduct-phase terms. Our work further integrates parameterized demodulation with singular value decomposition (PD-SVD) to refine the analysis of modulated instantaneous frequency terms within EM leakage observed over significant distances. These contributions advance security assessments and strengthen electromagnetic resilience.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving systems (ADS) on autonomous vehicles (AV), in recent years, there have been many attacks targeting AVs and ADSes. Meanwhile, recent studies are trying to improve the safety and security of AVs from different perspectives, and they mainly focus on the spoofing attacks against the sensors and the injection attacks against the vehicle chassis and actuators. However, direct attacks on ADSes (i.e., communication hijacking and malicious codes) remain inadequately addressed, and even worse, such attacks can let the AVs make unsafe driving decisions rapidly. In this paper, we introduce DSAD, a driving state-aware anomaly detection framework designed to enhance AV safety and security by identifying ADS attacks, such as communication hijacking and malicious codes, through chassis states. First, DSAD models ADS operations (i.e., driving states) as a two-layer state machine, utilizing real-time chassis data to infer driving states and detect anomalies in ADS outputs. This reduces false positives and negatives by aligning detection with the diverse operational modes of AVs. To achieve this, we develop a prototype system, DSAD, which incorporates a Detection Policy Update mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection policies based on the vehicle’s driving states, such as lane changing and obstacle avoidance. Second, DSAD considers both collision avoidance and control stability, addressing potential conflicts through hard and soft requirements. Furthermore, DSAD integrates a Fault Handling module compatible with existing autonomous driving fault handling mechanisms, ensuring timely response to detected anomalies. We develop a prototype anomaly detection system called DSAD and deploy it on four ADSes. We evaluate DSAD using various attack scenarios, and the results show that DSAD can identify over 90% of attacks on ADS.},

The proposed model records coalition formation information as transactions in the blockchain to protect the VNF information from being tampered with by attackers.Coalition formation for SFC provisioning consists of two steps: VNF node identity verification and the decision to join the coalition. To address the issue of unreliability in SFC deployment due to attacks, we propose a cooperative SFC provisioning algorithm based on security-aware coalition formation to identify trustworthy VNFs for SFC. Moreover, to handle the instability of SFC provisioning caused by DDoS attacks, we present an SFC reprovisioning algorithm based on the stochastic evolutionary coalition game with reward machines (SECGRM) under the constraint of VNF service times. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms effectively combat malicious attacks and significantly reduce cooperative SFC provisioning latency compared with existing leading approaches.},

However, it is important to consider the potential risks of theft. Although various techniques have been developed to protect the intellectual property of deep models, there is still room for improvement in terms of efficiency, comprehensiveness, and generalization. Compared with the intrusiveness of watermarking methods, fingerprinting methods do not affect the training process of the source model. Consequently, this paper proposes a fingerprinting method to address the paucity of attempts in fingerprinting methods for model protection. Our method consists of two efficient algorithms for generating fingerprinting samples, where the first one possesses the advantage of efficiency, while the second one is better in terms of robustness. The first algorithm takes a comprehensive approach to modeling the fingerprint of the deep model. The generated samples are distributed within the stable region and near the decision boundary of the model, taking into account both the duality and the conviction factors. Then, a heuristic sample perturbation algorithm is introduced, which generates a fingerprint with solid stability and generalization across multiple domains. The two algorithms proposed in this paper have been shown to be capable of withstanding attacks on intellectual property removal, detection, and evasion. They also show some advantages in terms of efficiency. In addition, the proposed method is the first to apply fingerprinting techniques in a cross-domain context.},

The predominant countermeasures are Deepfake detectors based on deep learning (DL). However, due to the opaque nature of DL-model, they struggle to offer understandable explanations for their predictive decisions, which undermines their reliability and effectiveness in real-world applications. Existing mainstream DL-oriented interpretation approaches, the feature attribution methods, struggle to work on Deepfake detectors due to issues of low interpretation fidelity, poor intelligibility, and limited applicability across different types of detectors. This paper addresses these critical challenges by proposing the Deepfake Detector Lens (DDL), a novel framework designed to enhance the interpretability of diverse architectural Deepfake detectors, encompassing those based on image, frequency domain, and video. DDL employs a heuristic algorithm to enhance interpretation efficacy and incorporates image segmentation and face parsing techniques to bridge the gap between the machine-generated interpretation saliency map and human understanding. Comprehensive evaluations of DDL demonstrate its superiority over existing feature attribution methods in terms of fidelity, intelligibility, and applicability. The proposed DDL significantly advances the interpretability of Deepfake detection technology, offering a more reliable and understandable tool for combating AI-generated face forgeries.},

However, extensive research has shown that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can lead them to confidently output incorrect results with high confidence scores. Existing adversarial attack methods often focus solely on temporal characteristics of signals while neglecting frequency domain information, resulting in adversarial examples with poor transferability and inadequate performance in the black-box scenario. An adversarial attack method based on frequency domain feature enhanced and integral gradient (FEIG) for AMC task is proposed in this paper. The approach utilizes techniques such as translation interpolation and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform to enhance the frequency domain information of original examples, thereby constructing enhanced baseline examples. Subsequently, these generated enhanced baseline examples are used as new inputs for gradient integration to obtain adversarial examples. Compared to traditional methods, the generated adversarial examples exhibit stronger transferability. Furthermore, in order to improve the defense performance of the model, an enhanced hybrid adversarial training (EH-AT) framework is proposed in this paper. The original clean example and the adversarial example generated by the proposed attack method are trained with joint loss constraints, which greatly enhances the robustness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FEIG attack method and the EH-AT framework.},

This paper introduces a dynamic state estimation (DSE) technique to supervise the operation of pilot protection scheme.

The method employs network physical laws, sampled value measurements, and an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) technique to enhance the cybersecurity aspects of the pilot protection scheme.

Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources. Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization. However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances. This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy. Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness. Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration. First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity. Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, announcing and managing service requests is paramount for obtaining suitable quotes and partnering with the right outsourcing service providers. To achieve this, enterprises can employ digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and security of these service requests. However, the irrevocable nature of traditional digital signatures poses challenges, particularly when canceling the service requests is necessary. A withdrawable signature scheme provides a novel property for signers to initially create “withdrawable” signatures, which they can later confirm into additional conventional signatures. Withdrawable signatures can be regarded as withdrawn when the signer has not confirmed them yet. This property provided by the withdrawable signature mechanism can then be adopted as a solution to this problem, allowing the enterprise to retract announced signatures on service requests. However, to meet the demands in the outsourcing system, existing approaches on withdrawable signatures require further development since it only allows signers in outsourcing systems to confirm withdrawable signatures on service requests. This limitation prevents enterprises from accepting quotes for service requests simply by confirming the withdrawable signature. This paper focuses on this problem by applying withdrawable signature to the outsourcing framework, identifying the limitations of existing withdrawable signature schemes, and proposing solutions. We demonstrate how a revisit of withdrawable signature can lead to flexible outsourcing systems that ensure the cancellation of announced service requests. Additionally, we provide a performance evaluation demonstrating that our revised withdrawable signature scheme achieves acceptable efficiency and security within the outsourcing system.},

  abstract     = {Multi-party computation (MPC) has garnered growing research and industry attention, with many protocols adhering to the preprocessing model to prioritize online performance via offline-generated, data-independent correlated randomness (or correlation for short). However, existing studies have predominantly focused on the online phase, and the equally critical offline phase remains overlooked. This oversight can lead to significant yet unaddressed challenges in both security and efficiency. To address these challenges, we start from the pseudorandom correlation generator (PCG) notion by Boyle et al. (CRYPTO&#39;19, FOCS&#39;20) and propose a programmable, verifiable, and efficient PCG construction using dedicated, small security hardware. Our technique, termed HPCG, bridges cryptography and hardware worlds for both strong security and high performance. It enables parties to generate virtually unbounded target correlations and verify their well-formedness at a low cost. Compared to existing cryptographic PCGs, HPCG restrainedly relies on minimal hardware trust, while advancing: 1) support for versatile correlations; 2) well-formedness enforcement for any correlation regardless of its form; and 3) reduced offline costs further. In contrast to prior hardware-based MPC solutions, HPCG 1) minimizes the trusted computing base; 2) eliminates single-vendor trust assumptions; and 3) avoids hosting sensitive user inputs directly on security chips. Furthermore, although HPCG operates solely in the offline phase and requires no direct access to user inputs, it enables performant online MPC protocols by efficiently generating some new, highly customized correlations. Our results demonstrate that HPCG outperforms prior preprocessing techniques in performance, security, simplicity, or a combination thereof.},

In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. “poisoned”) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results. In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution (PoSX) for IoT/embedded devices’ software. To realize the PoSX concept, we design SLAPP: a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. SLAPP leverages commodity security features of embedded devices – in particular ARM TrustZone-M security extensions – to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases SLAPP’s security and low overhead.},

To address this problem, we propose a novel concept called keyed-verification anonymous credentials with disposable delegation (KVAC-DD) in the multi-verifier setting. Next, we extend KVAC-DD to build an efficient ASSO system, dubbed DkvSSO. The construction of DkvSSO can be instantiated in efficient prime-order groups, avoiding costly operations required in previous ASSO systems.

  abstract     = {Aiming to provide people with great convenience and comfort, smart home systems have been deployed in thousands of homes. In this paper, we focus on handling the security and privacy issues in such a promising system by customizing a new cryptographic primitive to provide the following security guarantees: (1) fine-grained, privacy-preserving authorization for smart home users and integrity protection of communication contents; (2) flexible self-sovereign permission delegation; (3) forward security of previous messages. To our knowledge, no previous system has been designed to consider these three security and privacy requirements simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, we put forward the first-ever efficient cryptographic primitive called the Forward-secure Hierarchical Delegable Signature (FS-HDS) scheme for smart homes. Specifically, we first propose a new primitive, efficient Hierarchical Delegable Signature (HDS) scheme, which is capable of supporting partial delegation capability while realizing privacy-preserving authorization and integrity guarantee. Then, we present an FS-HDS for smart homes with the efficient HDS as the underlying building block, which not only inherits all the desirable features of HDS but also ensures that the past content integrity is not affected even if the current secret key is compromised. We provide comprehensively strict security proofs to prove the security of our proposed solutions. Its performance is also validated via experimental simulations to showcase its practicability and effectiveness.},

These limitations include susceptibility to adaptive attacks, adverse impact on benign samples, high time consumption for conducting a complete defense cycle, etc. To bridge the gap, developing more advanced plug-and-play countermeasures is urgently needed to safeguard these applications. Specifically, this paper first proposes a novel method named Gaussian-augmented GAN-based Adversarial Purification (GA-GAP). Unlike previous methods, GA-GAP enhances the density of the training data in low-robustness regions by using random Gaussian noise. Moreover, GA-GAP incorporates a pre-trained deep learning classifier into the training architecture and integrates its classification loss into the training loss function. Then, following the development of GA-GAP, this paper innovatively proposes a dual-function defense framework named Adversarial Detection on Purification (ADoP) to mitigate adversarial examples further. In ADoP, purification and detection complement each other, achieving the effect of 1 + 1 &gt; 2, which can more efficiently avoid adaptive attacks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ADoP outperforms other countermeasures in multiple aspects. These aspects include superior generalization capability in purifying and detecting various adversarial examples, less adverse impact on benign samples, and practical time consumption for conducting a complete defense cycle.},

However, several schemes that aim to attack robust aggregation rules and reducing the model accuracy have been proposed recently. These schemes do not maintain the sign statistics of gradients unchanged during attacks. Therefore, the sign statistics-based scheme SignGuard can resist most existing attacks. To defeat SignGuard and most existing cosine or distance-based aggregation schemes, we propose an enhanced model poisoning attack, ScaleSign. Specifically, ScaleSign uses a scaling attack and a sign modification component to obtain malicious gradients with higher cosine similarity and modify the sign statistics of malicious gradients, respectively. In addition, these two components have the least impact on the magnitudes of gradients. Then, we propose MSGuard, a Multi-Strategy Byzantine-robust scheme based on cosine mechanisms, symbol statistics, and spectral methods. Formal analysis proves that malicious gradients generated by ScaleSign have a closer cosine similarity than honest gradients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScaleSign can attack most of the existing Byzantine-robust rules, especially achieving a success rate of up to 98.23% for attacks on SignGuard. MSGuard can defend against most existing attacks including ScaleSign. Specifically, in the face of ScaleSign attack, the accuracy of MSGuard improves by up to 41.78% compared to SignGuard.},

Current effort is mainly devoted to the investigation of detecting and mitigating DLAAs, while, for a holistic cyber-resiliency-enhancement process, the last but not least cyber recovery from DLAAs (CRDA) has not been paid enough attention yet. Considering the interconnection among electricity, transportation, and cyber networks, this paper presents the first exploration of the CRDA, where two essential sub-tasks are formulated: i) Optimal design of repair crew routes to remove installed malware and ii) Robust adjustment of system operation to eliminate the mitigation costs with stability guarantee. Towards this end, linear stability constraints are established by utilising a sensitivity-based eigenvalue estimation method, where the eigenvalue sensitivity information is appropriately ordered and strategically selected to guarantee the estimation accuracy. Moreover, to assure the CRDA solution’s robustness to the adversary’s follow-up movement, the worst-case attack strategies in all attack scenarios during the recovery process are integrated. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is subsequently developed for the CRDA with the primary objective to restore the secure but cost-inefficient mitigation operation mode to the cost-efficient one and secondarily to repair compromised IoT home appliances. Case studies are performed in IEEE power system cases to validate the eigenvalue estimation’s accuracy, the CRDA solution’s effectiveness and robustness, as well as the proposed CRDA’s extensibility.},

Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead. The method’s robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility.},

Its design rationale is to leverage the model update contributions of all data points, including ones outside of the source and target classes, to construct an Amplifier set, in which we falsify the data labels before the FL training process, as a means to boost attacks. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and compatibility of BoTPA on various targeted poisoning attacks. Under data poisoning attacks, our evaluations reveal that BoTPA can achieve a median Relative Increase in Attack Success Rate (RI-ASR) between 15.3% and 36.9% across all possible source-target class combinations, with varying percentages of malicious clients, compared to its baseline. In the context of model poisoning, BoTPA attains RI-ASRs ranging from 13.3% to 94.7% in the presence of the Krum and Multi-Krum defenses, from 2.6% to 49.2% under the Median defense, and from 2.9% to 63.5% under the Flame defense.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the development of embodied intelligence. By providing a few contextual demonstrations (such as rationales and solution examples) developers can utilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate complex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets, which will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents. However, this paper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and introduces a novel method called Contextual Backdoor Attack. By poisoning just a few contextual demonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of a black-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent defects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can activate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters specific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM’s contextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize poisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts, reporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in a two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable context-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality activation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program defects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack by developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional visual reasoning. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential impact of our approach by successfully attacking real-world autonomous driving systems. The contextual backdoor threat introduced in this study poses serious risks for millions of downstream embodied agents, given that most publicly available LLMs are third-party-provided. This paper aims to raise awareness of this critical threat. Our code and demos are available at https://contextual-backdoor.github.io/.},

State-of-the-art methods for unlearning use historical data from FL clients, such as gradients or locally trained models. However, studies have revealed significant information leakage in this setting, with the possibility of reconstructing a user’s local data from their uploaded information. Addressing this, we propose Starfish, a privacy-preserving federated unlearning scheme using Two-Party Computation (2PC) techniques and shared historical client data between two non-colluding servers. Starfish builds upon existing FU methods to ensure privacy in unlearning processes. To enhance the efficiency of privacy-preserving FU evaluations, we suggest 2PC-friendly alternatives for certain FU algorithm operations. We also implement strategies to reduce costs associated with 2PC operations and lessen cumulative approximation errors. Moreover, we establish a theoretical bound for the difference between the unlearned global model via Starfish and a global model retrained from scratch for certified client removal. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that Starfish achieves effective unlearning with reasonable efficiency, maintaining privacy and security in FL systems.},

However, exiting PSA protocols mainly focus on two-party scenarios and cannot be directly adapted to the multi-client delegated computing scenarios required for vertical federated learning. Besides, these studies fail to address the need for protocol robustness in practical federated Learning network environments. Therefore, we aim to design an efficient and reliable PSA protocol in multi-client vertical federated learning. In this work, we present the first practical PSA protocol for vertical federated learning, allowing multi-clients to efficiently identify common samples without revealing additional information. Toward this direction, our PSA protocol first explores the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to create a lightweight delegated Private Set Intersection (PSI) scheme, enabling efficient sample intersection among multiple clients. To achieve the reliability of the PSA protocol, we devise a multi-client vector aggregation algorithm that securely delegates the server to calculate the sample intersection. Building on this foundation, we develop an efficient Threshold-based Private Sample Alignment (T-PSA) protocol that allows multiple clients to determine the intersection of their input samples only if the intersection size surpasses a specific threshold. We implement a prototype and conduct a thorough security analysis. Comprehensive evaluation results confirm the efficiency and practicality of our design.},

Conventional approaches hinge on spatiotemporal modeling, necessitating the gathering of positional information for each camera and trajectory data between every camera pair for the training phase. To mitigate these stringent requirements, our proposed methodology employs solely temporal information for modeling. Specifically, we introduce an Implicit Trajectory Encoding scheme, dubbed Temporal Rotary Position Embedding (T-RoPE), which integrates the temporal aspects of within-camera tracklets directly into their visual representations, thereby shaping a novel feature space. Our analysis reveals that, within this refined feature space, the challenge of inter-camera trajectory extraction can be effectively addressed by delineating a linear trajectory manifold. The visual characteristics gleaned from each candidate trajectory are utilized to compare and rank against the query feature, culminating in the ultimate trajectory retrieval outcome. To validate our method, we collected a new pedestrian trajectory dataset from a multi-storey shopping mall, namely the Mall Trajectory Dataset. Extensive experimentation across diverse datasets has demonstrated the versatility of our T-RoPE module as a plug-and-play enhancement to various network architectures, significantly enhancing the precision of pedestrian trajectory retrieval tasks.

Recent advancements have shown that aligning each attribute with its corresponding visual region significantly improves zero-shot learning performance. However, the crude semantic proxies used in these methods fail to capture the varied appearances of each attribute, and are also easily confused by the presence of semantically redundant backgrounds, leading to suboptimal alignment. To combat these issues, we introduce a novel Alignment-Enhanced Network (AENet), designed to denoise the visual features and dynamically perceive semantic information, thus enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Our approach comprises two key innovations. (1) A visual denoising encoder, employing a class-agnostic mask to filter out semantically redundant visual information, thus producing refined visual features adaptable to unseen classes. (2) A dynamic semantic generator that crafts content-aware semantic proxies adaptively, steered by visual features, enabling AENet to discriminate fine-grained variations in visual contents. Additionally, we integrate a cross-fusion module to ensure comprehensive interaction between the denoised visual features and the generated dynamic semantic proxies, further facilitating visual-semantic alignment. Through extensive experiments across three datasets, the proposed method demonstrates that it narrows down the visual-semantic gap and sets a new benchmark in this setting.},

  abstract     = {Semantic segmentation methods enhance robust and reliable understanding under adverse illumination conditions by integrating complementary information from visible and thermal infrared (RGB-T) images. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various feature fusion modules between different modalities, overlooking that feature learning is the critical aspect of scene understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel module-free Multiplex Interactive Learning Network (MiLNet) for RGB-T semantic segmentation, which adeptly integrates multi-model, multi-modal, and multi-level feature learning, fully exploiting the potential of multiplex feature interaction. Specifically, robust knowledge is transferred from the vision foundation model to our task-specific model to enhance its segmentation performance. In the task-specific model, an asymmetric simulated learning strategy is introduced to facilitate mutual learning of geometric and semantic information between high- and low-level features across modalities. Additionally, an inverse hierarchical fusion strategy based on feature learning pairs is adopted and further refined using multilabel and multiscale supervision. Experimental results on the MFNet and PST900 datasets demonstrate that MiLNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mIoU. As a limitation, the model’s performance under few-sample conditions could be improved further. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/Jinfu-pku/MiLNet.},

  abstract     = {Existing Unbiased Scene Graph Generation (USGG) methods only focus on addressing the predicate-level imbalance that high-frequency classes dominate predictions of rare ones, while overlooking the concept-level imbalance. Actually, even if predicates themselves are balanced, there is still a significant concept-imbalance within them due to the long-tailed distribution of contexts (i.e., subject-object combinations). This concept-level imbalance poses a more pervasive and challenging issue compared to the predicate-level imbalance since subject-object pairs are inherently complex in combinations. To address the issue, we propose Multi-Concept Learning (MCL), a novel concept-level balanced learning framework orthogonal to existing SGG methods. MCL first quantifies the concept-level imbalance across predicates in terms of different amounts of concepts, representing as multiple concept-prototypes within the same class. Then, to achieve balanced learning across different concepts (i.e., concept-prototypes), we introduce the Concept-based Balanced Memory (CBM), which guides SGG models in generating balanced representations for concept-prototypes. Furthermore, the Concept Regularization (CR) technique is proposed to effectively help models in aligning relation features to their corresponding concept-prototypes, thereby generating concept-level compact and predicate-level distinctive representations for robust relation recognition. Finally, we introduce a novel metric, mean Context Recall (mCR@K), as a complement to mean Recall (mR@K), to evaluate the model’s performance across concepts (determined by contexts) within the same predicate. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our model-agnostic strategy in enhancing the performance of benchmark models on both VG-SGG and OI-SGG datasets, leading to new state-of-the-art achievements in two key aspects: predicate-level unbiased relation recognition and concept-level compositional generability.

To address these issues, we first report an oral disease segmentation network termed Oralformer, which enables to tackle multiple oral diseases. Specifically, we use a parallel design to combine local-window self-attention (LWSA) with channel-wise convolution (CWC), modeling cross-window connections to enlarge the receptive fields while maintaining linear complexity. Meanwhile, we connect these two branches with bi-directional interactions to form a basic parallel Transformer block namely LC-block. We insert the LC-block as the main building block in a U-shape encoder-decoder architecture to form Oralformer. Second, we introduce an uncertainty-driven self-adaptive loss function which can reinforce the network’s attention on the lesion’s edge regions that are easily confused, thus improving the segmentation accuracy of these regions. Third, we construct a large-scale oral disease segmentation (ODS) dataset containing 2602 image pairs. It covers three common oral diseases (including dental plaque, calculus and caries) and all age groups, which we hope will advance the field. Extensive experiments on six challenging datasets show that our Oralformer achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, and presents advantages in terms of generalizability and real-time segmentation efficiency (35fps).

  abstract     = {Despite the impressive performance of current vision-based facial action unit (AU) detection approaches, they are heavily susceptible to the variations across different domains and the cross-domain AU detection methods are under-explored. In response to this challenge, we propose a decoupled doubly contrastive adaptation (D2CA) approach to learn a purified AU representation that is semantically aligned for the source and target domains. Specifically, we decompose latent representations into AU-relevant and AU-irrelevant components, with the objective of exclusively facilitating adaptation within the AU-relevant subspace. To achieve the feature decoupling, D2CA is trained to disentangle AU and domain factors by assessing the quality of synthesized faces in cross-domain scenarios when either AU or domain attributes are modified. To further strengthen feature decoupling, particularly in scenarios with limited AU data diversity, D2CA employs a doubly contrastive learning mechanism comprising image and feature-level contrastive learning to ensure the quality of synthesized faces and mitigate feature ambiguities. This new framework leads to an automatically learned, dedicated separation of AU-relevant and domain-relevant factors, and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the cross-domain facial image synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of D2CA in successfully decoupling AU and domain factors, yielding visually pleasing cross-domain synthesized facial images. Meanwhile, D2CA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain AU detection approaches, achieving an average F1 score improvement of 6%-14% across various cross-domain scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Contemporary deep face recognition techniques predominantly utilize the Softmax loss function, designed based on the similarities between sample features and class prototypes. These similarities can be categorized into four types: in-sample target similarity, in-sample non-target similarity, out-sample target similarity, and out-sample non-target similarity. When a sample feature from a specific class is designated as the anchor, the similarity between this sample and any class prototype is referred to as in-sample similarity. In contrast, the similarity between samples from other classes and any class prototype is known as out-sample similarity. The terms target and non-target indicate whether the sample and the class prototype used for similarity calculation belong to the same identity or not. The conventional Softmax loss function promotes higher in-sample target similarity than in-sample non-target similarity. However, it overlooks the relation between in-sample and out-sample similarity. In this paper, we propose Global Cross-Entropy loss (GCE), which promotes 1) greater in-sample target similarity over both the in-sample and out-sample non-target similarity, and 2) smaller in-sample non-target similarity to both in-sample and out-sample target similarity. In addition, we propose to establish a bilateral margin penalty for both in-sample target and non-target similarity, so that the discrimination and generalization of the deep face model are improved. To bridge the gap between training and testing of face recognition, we adapt the GCE loss into a pairwise framework by randomly replacing some class prototypes with sample features. We designate the model trained with the proposed Global Cross-Entropy loss as GFace. Extensive experiments on several public face benchmarks, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, IJB-C, IJB-B, MFR-Ongoing, and MegaFace, demonstrate the superiority of GFace over other methods. Additionally, GFace exhibits robust performance in general visual recognition task.},

To address this issue, this paper revisits the physiological structure of the eyeball and introduces a set of geometric assumptions, such as “the normal vector of the iris center approximates the gaze direction”. Building on these assumptions, we propose an Iris Geometric Transformation Guided Gaze estimation (IGTG-Gaze) module, which establishes an explicit geometric parameter sharing mechanism to link gaze direction and sparse iris landmark coordinates directly. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IGTG-Gaze seamlessly integrates into various deep neural networks, flexibly extends from sparse iris landmarks to dense eye mesh, and consistently achieves leading performance in both within- and cross-dataset evaluations, all while maintaining end-to-end optimization. These advantages highlight IGTG-Gaze as a practical and effective approach for enhancing deep gaze representation from appearance.},

  abstract     = {Monocular 3D object detection has garnered significant attention for its outstanding cost effectiveness compared with multi-sensor systems. However, previous work mainly acquires object 3D properties in a heuristic way, with less emphasis on the cues between objects. Inspired by the mechanisms of monocular vision, we propose MoVis, an innovative 3D object detection framework that skillfully combines object hierarchy and color sequence cues. Specifically, a decoupled Spatial Relationship Encoder (SRE) is designed to effectively feed back the high-level encoding results with object hierarchical relationships to low-level features. This method not only effectively reduces the computational overhead of multi-scale coding, but also significantly improves the detection accuracy of occluded objects by incorporating the hierarchical relationship between objects into multi-scale features. Moreover, to obtain more precise object depth information, an Object-level Depth Modulator (ODM) based on the concept of conditional random fields is designed, which employs color sequences. Ultimately, the results of the SRE and ODM are efficiently fused by our Spatial Context Processor (SCP) to accurately perceive the 3D attributes of the objects. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Rope3D benchmarks show that MoVis achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our MoVis represents a progressive approach that emulates how human monocular vision utilizes monocular cues to perceive 3D scenes.},

  abstract     = {Nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) factorization of incomplete tensors is a powerful technique for finding meaningful and physically interpretable latent factor matrices to achieve nonnegative tensor completion. However, most existing nonnegative CP models rely on manually predefined tensor ranks, which introduces uncertainty and leads the models to overfit or underfit. Although the presence of CP models within the probabilistic framework can estimate rank better, they lack the ability to learn nonnegative factors from incomplete data. In addition, existing approaches tend to focus on point estimation and ignore estimating uncertainty. To address these issues within a unified framework, we propose a fully Bayesian treatment of nonnegative tensor completion with automatic rank determination. Benefitting from the Bayesian framework and the hierarchical sparsity-inducing priors, the model can provide uncertainty estimates of nonnegative latent factors and effectively obtain low-rank structures from incomplete tensors. Additionally, the proposed model can mitigate problems of parameter selection and overfitting. For model learning, we develop two fully Bayesian inference methods for posterior estimation and propose a hybrid computing strategy that reduces the time overhead for large-scale data significantly. Extensive simulations on synthetic data demonstrate that our model can recover missing data with high precision and automatically estimate CP rank from incomplete tensors. Moreover, results from real-world applications demonstrate that our model is superior to state-of-the-art methods in image and video inpainting.

Despite the remarkable success, existing methods adopt static convolution to encode spatial-temporal information, which lacks flexibility in aggregating information in large-scale remote sensing scenes, as they often contain heterogeneous features (e.g., diverse textures). In this paper, we propose a spatial feature diversity enhancement module (SDE) and channel diversity exploration module (CDE), which explore the diverse representation of different local patterns while aggregating the global response with compactly channel-wise embedding representation. Specifically, SDE introduces multiple learnable filters to extract representative spatial variants and encodes them to generate a dynamic kernel for enriched spatial representation. To explore the diversity in the channel dimension, CDE exploits the discrete cosine transform to transform the feature into the frequency domain. This enriches the channel representation while mitigating massive frequency loss caused by pooling operation. Based on SDE and CDE, we further devise a multi-axis feature diversity enhancement (MADE) module to harmonize the spatial, channel, and pixel-wise features for diverse feature fusion. These elaborate strategies form a novel network for satellite VSR, termed MADNet, which achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art method BasicVSR++ in terms of average PSNR by 0.14 dB on various video satellites, including JiLin-1, Carbonite-2, SkySat-1, and UrtheCast.

This approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables effective domain adaptive hash learning.

Humans possess the ability to describe various scenes using natural language to help others infer the location by recognizing or recalling the rich semantic information in these descriptions. Harnessing language presents a potential solution for robust localization. Thus, this study introduces a new task, Language-driven Localization, and proposes a novel localization framework, LangLoc, which determines the user’s position and orientation through textual descriptions. Given the diversity of natural language descriptions, we first design a Spatial Description Generator (SDG), foundational to LangLoc, which extracts and combines the position and attribute information of objects within a scene to generate uniformly formatted textual descriptions. SDG eliminates the ambiguity of language, detailing the spatial layout and object relations of the scene, providing a reliable basis for localization. With generated descriptions, LangLoc effortlessly achieves language-only localization using text encoder and pose regressor. Furthermore, LangLoc can add one image to text input, achieving mutual optimization and feature adaptive fusion across modalities through two modality-specific encoders, cross-modal fusion, and multimodal joint learning strategies. This enhances the framework’s capability to handle complex scenes, achieving more accurate localization. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar, 4-Seasons, and Virtual Gallery datasets demonstrate LangLoc’s effectiveness in both language-only and visual-language localization across various outdoor and indoor scenarios. Notably, LangLoc achieves noticeable performance gains when using both text and image inputs in challenging conditions such as overexposure, low lighting, and occlusions, showcasing its superior robustness.},

To that end, we propose a novel test-time prompt learning method of VLMs, called Task-to-Instance PromPt LEarning (TIPPLE), which adopts a two-stage training strategy to leverage both task- and instance-level knowledge. Specifically, we reformulate the effective online pseudo-labeling paradigm along with two tailored components: an auxiliary text classification task and a diversity regularization term, to serve the task-oriented prompt learning. After that, the learned task-level prompt is further combined with a tunable residual for each test sample to integrate with instance-level knowledge. We demonstrate the superior performance of TIPPLE on 15 downstream datasets, e.g., the average improvement of 1.87% over the state-of-the-art method, using ViT-B/16 visual backbone. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/zhiheLu/TIPPLE.},

  abstract     = {Existing pose-invariant face recognition mainly focuses on frontal or profile, whereas high-pitch angle face recognition, prevalent under surveillance videos, has yet to be investigated. More importantly, tilted faces significantly differ from frontal or profile faces in the potential feature space due to self-occlusion, thus seriously affecting key feature extraction for face recognition. In this paper, we asymptotically reshape challenging high-pitch angle faces into a series of small-angle approximate frontal faces and exploit a statistical approach to learn texture features to ensure accurate facial component generation. In particular, we design a statistical texture-guided GAN for tilted face frontalization (STG-GAN) consisting of three main components. First, the face encoder extracts shallow features, followed by the face statistical texture modeling module that learns multi-scale face texture features based on the statistical distributions of the shallow features. Then, the face decoder performs feature deformation guided by the face statistical texture features while highlighting the pose-invariant face discriminative information. With the addition of multi-scale content loss, identity loss and adversarial loss, we further develop a pose contrastive loss of potential spatial features to constrain pose consistency and make its face frontalization process more reliable. On this basis, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy, using STG-GAN to progressively synthesize faces with small pitch angles in multiple stages to achieve frontalization gradually. A unified end-to-end training across multiple stages facilitates the generation of numerous intermediate results to achieve a reasonable approximation of the ground truth. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple-face datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised non-rigid point cloud shape correspondence underpins a multitude of 3D vision tasks, yet itself is non-trivial given the exponential complexity stemming from inter-point degree-of-freedom, i.e., pose transformations. Based on the assumption of local rigidity, one solution for reducing complexity is to decompose the overall shape into independent local regions using Local Reference Frames (LRFs) that are equivariant to SE(3) transformations. However, the focus solely on local structure neglects global geometric contexts, resulting in less distinctive LRFs that lack crucial semantic information necessary for effective matching. Furthermore, such complexity introduces out-of-distribution geometric contexts during inference, thus complicating generalization. To this end, we introduce 1) EquiShape, a novel structure tailored to learn pair-wise LRFs with global structural cues for both spatial and semantic consistency, and 2) LRF-Refine, an optimization strategy generally applicable to LRF-based methods, aimed at addressing the generalization challenges. Specifically, for EquiShape, we employ cross-talk within separate equivariant graph neural networks (Cross-GVP) to build long-range dependencies to compensate for the lack of semantic information in local structure modeling, deducing pair-wise independent SE(3)-equivariant LRF vectors for each point. For LRF-Refine, the optimization adjusts LRFs within specific contexts and knowledge, enhancing the geometric and semantic generalizability of point features. Our overall framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/2019EPWL/EquiShape.},

To address these issues, we propose the Deep Spatial-Frequency Unfolding Reconstruction Network (DSFURNet), which explores and utilizes knowledge in the frequency domain for event-based video reconstruction. Specifically, we construct a variational model and propose three regularization terms: a brightness regularization term approximated by Fourier amplitudes, a structural regularization term approximated by Fourier phases, and an initialization regularization term that converts event representations into initial video frames. Then, we design corresponding spatial-frequency domain approximation operators for each regularization term. Benefiting from the global nature of computations in the frequency domain, the designed approximation operators can integrate local spatial and global frequency information at a lower computational cost. Furthermore, we combine the learned knowledge of the three regularization terms and unfold the optimization algorithm into an iterative deep network. Through this approach, the pixel-level initialization regularization constraint and the Fourier-domain brightness and structural regularization constraints can continuously play a role during the testing process, achieving a gradual improvement in the quality of the reconstructed video frames. Compared to existing methods, our network significantly reduces the number of network parameters while improving evaluation metrics.},

We demonstrate that, given a starting base mesh, a target subdivision surface and a desired maximum number of zerotree passes, our system produces an elegant and visually attractive lossy-to-lossless mesh geometry reconstruction with no further user intervention. Moreover, lossless coefficient encoding with our approach requires nearly the same bitrate as the default displacement coding methods in V-DMC. Yet, our approach provides several quality resolution levels embedded in the same bitstream, while the current V-DMC solutions encode a single quality level only. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a zerotree-based method has been proposed and demonstrated to work for the compression of dynamic time-varying meshes, and the first time that an embedded quality-scalable approach has been used in the V-DMC framework.},

  abstract     = {Auroral image classification has long been a focus of research in auroral physics. However, current methods for automatic auroral classification typically assume that only one type of aurora is present in an auroral image. This oversight neglects the complex transition states and coexistence of multiple types during the auroral evolution process, thus limiting the exploration of the intricate semantics of auroral images. To fully exploit the physical information embedded in auroral images, this paper proposes a multi-label auroral classification method, termed MLAC, which integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architectures. Firstly, we introduce a multi-scale feature fusion framework that enables the model to capture both fine-grained features and high-level information in auroral images, resulting in a more comprehensive representation of auroral features. Secondly, we propose a lightweight multi-head self-attention mechanism that captures long-range dependencies between pixels during the multiscale feature fusion process, which is crucial for distinguishing subtle differences between auroral types. Furthermore, we design a residual focused multilayer perceptron module that integrates large kernel depth-wise convolution with an improved multilayer perceptron. This integration enhances the model’s ability to represent complex spatial structure, thus improving local feature extraction and global contextual understanding. The proposed method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 88.20% on the auroral observation data collected at the Yellow River Station from 2003 to 2008. This performance significantly surpasses that of the most advanced multi-label classification models while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Moreover, our method also outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label methods in both computational efficiency and classification accuracy on two publicly available multi-label image datasets: WIDER-Attribute and VOC2007. These results demonstrate that our method skillfully leverages the robust feature extraction capability of CNNs for local features and the superior global information processing capability of Transformer.},

  abstract     = {Video Wire Inpainting (VWI) is a prominent application in video inpainting, aimed at flawlessly removing wires in films or TV series, offering significant time and labor savings compared to manual frame-by-frame removal. However, wire removal poses greater challenges due to the wires being longer and slimmer than objects typically targeted in general video inpainting tasks, and often intersecting with people and background objects irregularly, which adds complexity to the inpainting process. Recognizing the limitations posed by existing video wire datasets, which are characterized by their small size, poor quality, and limited variety of scenes, we introduce a new VWI dataset with a novel mask generation strategy, namelyWire Removal Video Dataset 2 (WRV2) and Pseudo-Wire-Shaped (PWS) Masks. WRV2 dataset comprises over 4,000 videos with an average length of 80 frames, designed to facilitate the development and efficacy of inpainting models. Building upon this, our research proposes the Redundancy-Aware Transformer (Raformer) method that addresses the unique challenges of wire removal in video inpainting. Unlike conventional approaches that indiscriminately process all frame patches, Raformer employs a novel strategy to selectively bypass redundant parts, such as static background segments devoid of valuable information for inpainting. At the core of Raformer is the Redundancy-Aware Attention (RAA) module, which isolates and accentuates essential content through a coarse-grained, window-based attention mechanism. This is complemented by a Soft Feature Alignment (SFA) module, which refines these features and achieves end-to-end feature alignment. Extensive experiments on both the traditional video inpainting datasets and our proposed WRV2 dataset demonstrate that Raformer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose FRNet, a simple yet powerful method aimed at restoring the contextual information of range image pixels using corresponding frustum LiDAR points. First, a frustum feature encoder module is used to extract per-point features within the frustum region, which preserves scene consistency and is critical for point-level predictions. Next, a frustum-point fusion module is introduced to update perpoint features hierarchically, enabling each point to extract more surrounding information through the frustum features. Finally, a head fusion module is used to fuse features at different levels for final semantic predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on four popular LiDAR segmentation benchmarks under various task setups demonstrate the superiority of FRNet. Notably, FRNet achieves 73.3% and 82.5% mIoU scores on the testing sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes. While achieving competitive performance, FRNet operates 5 times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. Such high efficiency opens up new possibilities for more scalable LiDAR segmentation.

  abstract     = {Dense pixel-wise labeling of large-scale remote sensing images (RSI) is very time-consuming, while sparse labels (i.e., points, scribbles, or blocks) can be an efficient way to reduce labeling costs. Most existing sparse label-based methods adopt only one type of label for image segmentation, which cannot reflect the complex land covers in the RSI for training the model, thus leading to inferior segmentation performance. We observe that land covers with different shapes and complexity can be optimally represented by different sparse labels. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel sparse labeling framework, termed Hybrid Sparse Labeling (HSLabeling), for large-scale RSI segmentation. Our HSLabeling can adaptively select the optimal hybrid sparse labels for different land covers, according to labeling cost and segmentation contribution of different sparse labels. Specifically, we first propose a label segmentation contribution information estimation module that estimates the information of different sparse labels according to the diversity and shape of land covers. After that, we propose an Optimal Hybrid Labeling Strategy (OHLS) to assign optimal types of labels for different land covers. In the OHLS, label assignment is formulated as an optimization problem that trades off label segmentation contribution information and labeling cost. We employ the greedy algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem and adaptively assign labels for varied land covers. Extensive experiments on three large-scale RSI datasets have demonstrated that our HSLabeling achieves almost fully supervised performance with extremely low labeling costs. In addition, compared with the single type sparse label, HSLabeling can also utilize much lower labeling costs to obtain the same performance.

Traditional calibration methods rely on the spatial extraction of feature points to establish spatial 3D information as the optimization objective. However, these methods suffer from reduced extraction accuracy under defocus conditions, which causes degradation of calibration performance. To extend calibration volume without compromising accuracy in defocused scenarios, we propose a per-pixel calibration based on multi-view 3D reconstruction errors. It utilizes 3D reconstruction errors among different binocular setups as an optimization objective. We first analyze multi-view 3D reconstruction error distributions under the poor-accuracy optical model by employing a multi-view microscopic 3D measurement system using telecentric lenses. Subsequently, the 3D proportion model is proposed for implementing our error-based per-pixel calibration, derived as a spatial linear expression directly correlated with the 3D reconstruction error distribution. The experimental results confirm the robust convergence of our method with multiple binocular setups. Near the focus volume, the multi-view 3D reconstruction error remains approximately 8 μm (less than 0.5 camera pixel pitch), with absolute accuracy maintained within 0.5% of the measurement range. Beyond tenfold depth of field, the multi-view 3D reconstruction error increases to around 30 μm (still less than 2 camera pixel pitches), while absolute accuracy remains within 1% of the measurement range.

Off-the-shelf video object detection methods typically aggregate multiframe features at one stroke to alleviate appearance degradation. However, these existing methods do not take supervision knowledge into consideration and thus still suffer from insufficient feature aggregation, resulting in the false detection problem. In this paper, we take a different perspective on feature aggregation, and propose a dynamic graph contrastive network (DGC-Net) for video object detection, including three improvements against existing methods. First, we design a frame-level graph contrastive module to aggregate frame features, enabling our DGC-Net to fully exploit discriminative contextual feature representations to facilitate video object detection. Second, we develop a proposal-level graph contrastive module to aggregate proposal features, making our DGC-Net sufficiently learn discriminative semantic feature representations. Third, we present a graph transformer to dynamically adjust the graph structure by pruning the useless nodes and edges, which contributes to improving accuracy and efficiency as it can eliminate the geometric-semantic ambiguity and reduce the graph scale. Furthermore, inherited from the framework of DGC-Net, we develop DGC-Net Lite to perform real-time video object detection with a much faster inference speed. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate that our DGC-Net outperforms the performance of current state-of-the-art methods.

However, these methods assume the task space is invariant and neglect the gradual change between tasks, resulting in sub-optimal gradient projection and a compromise of the continual learning capacity. To tackle this problem, we propose to embed each task subspace into a non-Euclidean manifold, which can naturally capture the change of tasks since the manifold is intrinsically non-static compared to the Euclidean space. Subsequently, we analytically derive the accumulated projection between any two subspaces on the manifold along the geodesic path by integrating an infinite number of intermediate subspaces. Building upon this derivation, we propose a novel geodesic-aligned gradient projection (GAGP) method that harnesses the accumulated projection to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The proposed method utilizes the geometric structure information on the task manifold by capturing the gradual change between the new and the old tasks. Empirical studies on image classification demonstrate that the proposed method alleviates catastrophic forgetting and achieves on-par or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Facial Aesthetics Enhancement (FAE) aims to improve facial attractiveness by adjusting the structure and appearance of a facial image while preserving its identity as much as possible. Most existing methods adopted deep feature-based or score-based guidance for generation models to conduct FAE. Although these methods achieved promising results, they potentially produced excessively beautified results with lower identity consistency or insufficiently improved facial attractiveness. To enhance facial aesthetics with less loss of identity, we propose the Nearest Neighbor Structure Guidance based on Diffusion (NNSG-Diffusion), a diffusion-based FAE method that beautifies a 2D facial image with 3D structure guidance. Specifically, we propose to extract FAE guidance from a nearest neighbor reference face. To allow for less change of facial structures in the FAE process, a 3D face model is recovered by referring to both the matched 2D reference face and the 2D input face, so that the depth and contour guidance can be extracted from the 3D face model. Then the depth and contour clues can provide effective guidance to Stable Diffusion with ControlNet for FAE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is superior to previous relevant methods in enhancing facial aesthetics while preserving facial identity.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain few-shot learning aims to achieve swift generalization between a source domain and a target domain using a limited number of images. Current research predominantly relies on generalized feature embeddings, employing metric classifiers in Euclidean space for classification. However, due to existing disparities among different data domains, attaining generalized features in the embedding becomes challenging. Additionally, the rise in data domains leads to high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. To address the above problems, we introduce a cross-domain few-shot learning method named Hyperbolic Insights with Knowledge Distillation (HIKD). By integrating knowledge distillation, it enhances the model’s generalization performance, thereby significantly improving task performance. Hyperbolic space, in comparison to Euclidean space, offers a larger capacity and supports the learning of hierarchical structures among images, which can aid generalized learning across different data domains. So we map the Euclidean space features to the hyperbolic space via hyperbolic embedding and utilize hyperbolic fitting distillation method in the meta-training phase to obtain multi-domain unified generalization representation. In the meta-testing phase, accounting for biases between the source and target domains, we present a hyperbolic adaptive module to adjust embedded features and eliminate inter-domain gap. Experiments on the Meta-Dataset demonstrate that HIKD outperforms state-of-the-arts methods with the average accuracy of 80.6%.},

  abstract     = {The fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) and multi-spectral image (MSI) is an effective mean to improve the inherent defect of low spatial resolution of HSI. However, existing fusion methods usually rigidly upgrade the spatial resolution of HSI to that of matching MSI under the ideal assumption that multi-source images are accurately registered. In real scenes where multi-source images are difficult to be perfectly registered and the spatial resolution requirements are dynamically different, these fusion algorithms is difficult to be effectively deployed. To this end, we construct the spatial-spectral consistent arbitrary scale observation model (S2cAsOM) to model the dependence between the unregistered HSI and MSI and the ideal arbitrary resolution HSI. Furthermore, an optimization algorithm is designed to solve S2cAsOM, and a deep interpretable arbitrary resolution fusion network (IR&amp;ArF) is proposed to simulate the optimization process, which achieves the model-data dual-driven arbitrary resolution fusion of unregistered HSI and MSI. IR&amp;ArF breaks the dependence of traditional fusion methods on the accuracy of image registration in a robust way, and can flexibly cope with the dynamic requirements of diverse applications for the spatial resolution of HSI, which improves the application ability of HSI fusion in real scenes.

The Gaussian model with mean and scale parameters has been widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness.

To balance the compression performance and complexity, we extend the Gaussian model to the generalized Gaussian family for more flexible latent distribution modeling, introducing only one additional shape parameter β than the Gaussian model. To enhance the performance of the generalized Gaussian model by alleviating the train-test mismatch, we propose improved training methods, including β-dependent lower bounds for scale parameters and gradient rectification. Our proposed generalized Gaussian model, coupled with the improved training methods, is demonstrated to outperform the Gaussian and Gaussian mixture models on a variety of learned image compression networks.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in expanding the application of generative models from generation tasks to semantic segmentation. These approaches utilize generative models either for generating annotated data or extracting features to facilitate semantic segmentation. This typically involves generating a considerable amount of synthetic data or requiring additional mask annotations. To this end, we uncover the potential of generative text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as highly efficient open-vocabulary semantic segmenters, and introduce a novel training-free approach named DiffSegmenter. The insight is that to generate realistic objects that are semantically faithful to the input text, both the complete object shapes and the corresponding semantics are implicitly learned by diffusion models. We discover that the object shapes are characterized by the self-attention maps while the semantics are indicated through the cross-attention maps produced by the denoising U-Net, forming the basis of our segmentation results. Additionally, we carefully design effective textual prompts and a category filtering mechanism to further enhance the segmentation results. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed DiffSegmenter achieves impressive results for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.},

Existing GCL methods can hardly simultaneously handle two issues since it requires models to avoid from lying into the spurious correlation trap of GCL. From a causal perspective, we formalize a structural causality model of GCL and conclude that spurious correlation exists not only between confounders and input, but also within multiple causal variables. Inspired by frequency transformation techniques which harbor intricate patterns of image comprehension, we propose a plug-and-play module: the Dual-Domain Division Multiplex (D3M) unit, which intervenes confounders and multiple causal factors over frequency and spatial domains with a two-stage pseudo causal intervention strategy. Typically, D3M consists of a frequency division multiplexer (FDM) module and a spatial division multiplexer (SDM) module, each of which prioritizes target-relevant causal features by dividing and multiplexing features over frequency domain and spatial domain, respectively. As a lightweight and model-agonistic unit, D3M can be seamlessly integrated into most current GCL methods. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets demonstrate that D3M significantly enhances accuracy and diminishes catastrophic forgetting compared to current methods.

  abstract     = {Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is a non-invasive technique that allows for the imaging of micro-vessels in vivo, at depth and with a resolution on the order of ten microns. ULM is based on the sub-resolution localization of individual microbubbles injected in the bloodstream. Mapping the whole angioarchitecture requires the accumulation of microbubbles trajectories from thousands of frames, typically acquired over a few minutes. ULM acquisition times can be reduced by increasing the microbubble concentration, but requires more advanced algorithms to detect them individually. Several deep learning approaches have been proposed for this task, but they remain limited to 2D imaging, in part due to the associated large memory requirements. Herein, we propose the use of sparse tensor neural networks to enable deep learning-based 3D ULM by improving memory scalability with increased dimensionality. We study several approaches to efficiently convert ultrasound data into a sparse format and study the impact of the associated loss of information. When applied in 2D, the sparse formulation reduces the memory requirements by a factor 2 at the cost of a small reduction of performance when compared against dense networks. In 3D, the proposed approach reduces memory requirements by two order of magnitude while largely outperforming conventional ULM in high concentration settings. We show that Sparse Tensor Neural Networks in 3D ULM allow for the same benefits as dense deep learning based method in 2D ULM i.e. the use of higher concentration in silico and reduced acquisition time.},

In this work, we propose a physics-guided approach for object detection in adverse environments, which gives a straightforward solution that injects the physical priors into the detector, enabling it to detect poorly visible objects. The physical priors, derived from the imaging mechanism and image property, include environment prior and frequency prior. The environment prior is generated from the physical model, e.g., the atmospheric model, which reflects the density of environmental noise. The frequency prior is explored based on an observation that the amplitude spectrum could highlight object regions from the background. The proposed two priors are complementary in principle. Furthermore, we present a physics-guided loss that incorporates a novel weight item, which is estimated by applying the membership function on physical priors and could capture the extent of degradation. By backpropagating the physics-guided loss, physics knowledge is injected into the detector to aid in locating degraded objects. We conduct experiments in synthetic foggy environment, real foggy environment, and real underwater scenario.

This vulnerability poses significant risks, particularly in security-sensitive applications. To address this critical gap, we introduce DD-RobustBench, a novel and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the adversarial robustness of distilled datasets. Our benchmark is the most extensive of its kind and integrates a variety of dataset distillation techniques, including recent advancements such as TESLA, DREAM, SRe2L, and D4M, which have shown promise in enhancing model performance. DD-RobustBench also rigorously tests these datasets against a diverse array of adversarial attack methods to ensure broad applicability. Our evaluations cover a wide spectrum of datasets, including but not limited to, the widely used ImageNet-1K. This allows us to assess the robustness of distilled datasets in scenarios mirroring real-world applications. Furthermore, our detailed quantitative analysis investigates how different components involved in the distillation process, such as data augmentation, downsampling, and clustering, affect dataset robustness. Our findings provide critical insights into which techniques enhance or weaken the resilience of distilled datasets against adversarial threats, offering valuable guidelines for developing more robust distillation methods in the future. Through DD-RobustBench, we aim not only to benchmark but also to push the boundaries of dataset distillation research by highlighting areas for improvement and suggesting pathways for future innovations in creating datasets that are not only compact and efficient but also secure and resilient to adversarial challenges.

In comparison, vision transformers demonstrate superior robustness in complex environments, leveraging their versatile modeling capabilities to process diverse data structures with greater precision. In this paper, we delve into the potential of vision transformers in unsupervised Re-ID, proposing a Transformer-based perception-assisted framework (PAT). Considering Re-ID is a typical fine-grained task, existing unsupervised Re-ID methods relying on pseudo-labels generated by clustering algorithms provide only category-level discriminative supervision, with limited attention to local details. Therefore, we propose a novel target-aware mask alignment (TMA) strategy that provides additional supervision signals by leveraging low-level visual cues. Specifically, we employ pseudo-labels to guide the fine-grained alignment of features with local pixel information from critical discriminative regions. This method establishes a mutual learning mechanism via a shared Transformer, effectively balancing discriminative learning and detailed understanding. Furthermore, we propose a perceptual fusion feature augmentation (PFA) method to optimize instance-level discriminative learning. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple Re-ID datasets, demonstrating superior performance and robustness in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques.

  abstract     = {Salient and small lesions (e.g., microaneurysms on fundus) both play significant roles in real-world disease diagnosis under medical image examinations. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved promising medical image classification performance, they often have limitations in capturing both salient and small lesion information, restricting performance improvement in imbalanced medical image classification. Recently, with the advent of DNN-based style transfer in medical image generation, the roles of clinical styles have attracted great interest, as they are crucial indicators of lesions. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel Adaptive Dual-Axis Style-based Recalibration (ADSR) module, leveraging the potential of clinical styles to guide DNNs in effectively learning salient and small lesion information from a dual-axis perspective. ADSR first emphasizes salient lesion information via global style-based adaptation, then captures small lesion information with pixel-wise style-based fusion. We construct an ADSR-Net for imbalanced medical image classification by stacking multiple ADSR modules. Additionally, DNNs typically adopt cross-entropy loss for parameter optimization, which ignores the impacts of class-wise predicted probability distributions. To address this, we introduce a new Class-wise Statistics Loss (CWS) combined with CE to further boost imbalanced medical image classification results. Extensive experiments on five imbalanced medical image datasets demonstrate not only the superiority of ADSR-Net and CWS over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also their improved confidence calibration results. For example, ADSR-Net with the proposed loss significantly outperforms CABNet50 by 21.39% and 27.82% in F1 and B-ACC while reducing 3.31% and 4.57% in ECE and BS on ISIC2018.},

  abstract     = {Semantic instance completion aims to recover the complete 3D shapes of foreground objects together with their labels from a partial 2.5D scan of a scene. Previous works have relied on full supervision, which requires ground-truth annotations, in the form of bounding boxes and complete 3D objects. This has greatly limited their real-world application because the acquisition of ground-truth data is very costly and time-consuming. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Weakly-Supervised Semantic Instance Completion Network (WSSIC-Net), which learns real-world partial point cloud object completion without requiring the ground truth of complete 3D objects. Instead, WSSIC-Net leverages 3D ground-truth bounding boxes, partial objects of a raw scene, and unpaired synthetic 3D point clouds. More specifically, a 3D detector is used to encode partial point clouds into proposal features, which are then fed into two branches. The first branch uses fully supervised box prediction based on proposal features. The second branch, hereinafter called instance completion, leverages the proposal features as partial object features to achieve weakly-supervised instance completion. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) completes the partial features of the 2.5D foreground objects of real-world scenes using only unpaired but semantically-consistent complete synthetic point clouds. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the fully-supervised 3D detection and the weakly-supervised instance completion complement one another. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the ScanNet v2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed “weakly-supervised” approach consistently achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art “fully supervised” methods.},

  abstract     = {Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has demonstrated exceptional performance in low-light enhancement task. However, the dependency on paired training datas has left the generality of DDPM in low-light enhancement largely untapped. Therefore, this paper proposes a mutually reinforcing learning framework of decoupled degradation and diffusion enhancement, named MRLIE, which leverages style guidance from unpaired low-light images to generate pseudo-image pairs that are consistent with the target domain, thereby optimizing the latter diffusion enhancement network in a supervised manner. During the degradation process, the diffusion loss of fixed enhancement network serves as a evaluation metric for structure consistency and is combined with adversarial style loss to form the optimization objective for degradation network. Such loss design ensures that scene structure information is retained during the degradation process. During the enhancement process, the degradation network with frozen parameters continuously generates pseudo-paired low-/normal-light image pairs as training datas, thus the diffusion enhancement network could be progressively optimized. On the whole, the two processes are interdependent and could achieve cooperative improvement in terms of degradation realism and enhancement quality through iterative optimization. Additionally, we propose the Retinex-based decoupled degradation strategy for simulating the complex degradation in real low-light imaging, which ensures the color correction and noise suppression capabilities of latter diffusion enhancement network. Extensive experiments show that MRLIE can achieve promising results and better generality across various datasets.},

  abstract     = {Local feature detection and description play an important role in many computer vision tasks, which are designed to detect and describe keypoints in any scene and any downstream task. Data-driven local feature learning methods need to rely on pixel-level correspondence for training. However, a vast number of existing approaches ignored the semantic information on which humans rely to describe image pixels. In addition, it is not feasible to enhance generic scene keypoints detection and description simply by using traditional common semantic segmentation models because they can only recognize a limited number of coarse-grained object classes. In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a foundation model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning. SAMFeat learns additional semantic information brought by SAM and thus is inspired by higher performance even with limited training samples. To do so, first, we construct an auxiliary task of Attention-weighted Semantic Relation Distillation (ASRD), which adaptively distillates feature relations with category-agnostic semantic information learned by the SAM encoder into a local feature learning network, to improve local feature description using semantic discrimination. Second, we develop a technique called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning Based on Semantic Grouping (WSC), which utilizes semantic groupings derived from SAM as weakly supervised signals, to optimize the metric space of local descriptors. Third, we design an Edge Attention Guidance (EAG) to further improve the accuracy of local feature detection and description by prompting the network to pay more attention to the edge region guided by SAM. SAMFeat’s performance on various tasks, such as image matching on HPatches, and long-term visual localization on Aachen Day-Night showcases its superiority over previous local features. The release code is available at https://github.com/vignywang/SAMFeat.},

The main contribution of this paper is the development of a parametric expression that is in perfect agreement with the inverse function of the Marton exponent. This representation has two layers. The inner layer is convex optimization and can be computed efficiently. The outer layer, on the other hand, is a non-convex optimization with respect to two parameters. We give a method for computing the Marton exponent based on this representation.},

To that end, at each time point we are allowed to update a finite-state machine with S states, using a possibly randomized but time-invariant rule, where each state of the machine is assigned an entropy estimate. Our goal is to characterize the minimax memory complexity S* of this problem, which is the minimal number of states for which the estimation task is feasible with probability at least 1 − δ asymptotically, uniformly in p. Specifically, we show that there exist universal constants C1 and C2 such that S* ≤ C1 · n(log n)4/ε2δ for ε not too small, and S* ≥ C2 · max{n, log n/ε} for ε not too large. The upper bound is proved using approximate counting to estimate the logarithm of p, and a finite memory bias estimation machine to estimate the expectation operation. The lower bound is proved via a reduction of entropy estimation to uniformity testing. We also apply these results to derive bounds on the memory complexity of mutual information estimation.},

In this context, it is essential to specify conditions for these bent concatenations so that f do (not) belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class M#. In this article, we resolve this question completely by providing the algebraic characterization of M-subspaces for the concatenation of the form f = f1||f2 and f = f1||f2||f3||f4, which allows us to estimate ind(f), the linearity index of f, and consequently to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions so that f is outside M#. Based on these conditions, we propose several explicit and generic design methods of specifying bent functions outside M# in the special case when f = g||h||g||(h+1), where g and h are bent functions. Moreover, we show that it is possible to even decrease the linearity index of f = g||h||g||(h+1), compared to ind(g) and ind(h), if the largest dimension of a common M-subspace of g and h is small enough (less than minfind(g); ind(h)}–1). This also induces iterative methods of constructing bent functions outsideM# with (controllable) low linearity index. Finally, we derive a lower bound on the 2-rank of f and show that this concatenation method can generate bent functions that are provably outside M# ∪ PS#ap. In difference to the approach of Weng et al. (Finite Fields Appl. vol. 13 (4), 2007) that uses the direct sum and a bent function g outside M#, our method employs g, h ϵ M# for the same purpose.},

  abstract     = {In multi-source status update systems, sources need to be scheduled appropriately to maintain timely communication between each of the sources and the monitor. A cyclic schedule is an age-agnostic schedule in which the sources are served according to a fixed finite transmission pattern, which upon completion, repeats itself. Such a scheme has a low O(1) runtime complexity, which is desirable in large networks. This paper’s focus is on designing transmission patterns so as to be used in massive scale networking scenarios involving a very large number of sources, e.g., up to thousands of IoT sources, with service time requirements and weights being heterogeneous in nature. The goal is to minimize the weighted sum age of information (AoI), called weighted AoI, when transmitting users’ packets over a channel susceptible to heterogeneous packet errors. The main tool we use is a stochastic modeling framework using either Markov chains (MC) or moment generating functions (MGF), by which we obtain the weighted AoI for a given transmission pattern, which is not straightforward in the presence of packet drops. Using this framework, we provide a lower bound on the weighted AoI for the particular case of two sources, and also an algorithm to attain this lower bound. Then, by using the same framework, we design a cyclic scheduler for general number of sources with reasonable complexity using convex optimization and well-established packet spreading algorithms, and comparatively evaluate the proposed algorithm and existing age-agnostic scheduling schemes for general number of sources (resp. two sources) when the lower bound is not available (resp. when it is available). We present extensive numerical results also involving comparisons with age-aware scheduling to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Most existing studies focus on discrete-valued sequences, where each data sample takes values in a finite set. To account for practical scenarios where data sequences usually take real values and the number of outlying sequence is unknown, we study outlier hypothesis testing for continuous sequences when there might exist multiple outliers, and both the nominal and anomalous distributions are unknown. Specifically, we propose distribution free tests and prove that the probabilities of misclassification error, false reject and false alarm decay exponentially fast for three different test designs: fixed-length test, sequential test, and two-phase test. In a fixed-length test, one fixes the sample size of each observed sequence; in a sequential test, one takes a sample sequentially from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision can be made; in a two-phase test, one adapts the sample size from two different fixed values. Remarkably, the two-phase test achieves a good balance between test design complexity and theoretical performance.},

It has been long known (Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine x even if ≈ 1/3 of Alice’s bits are flipped adversarially. This improves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not possible for error fractions exceeding 1/4. In the corresponding setting of erasures rather than bit flips, feedback improves the error resilience from 1/2 − ε to 1 − ε for any ε &gt; 0. The original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice knows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the limited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small number of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired ε &gt; 0, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a 1/3 − ε fraction of bit flips (respectively a 1 − ε fraction of erasures) relying only on Oε (log k) bits of feedback from Bob sent in a fixed Oε (1) number of rounds. We complement this with a matching lower bound showing that Ω(log k) bits of feedback are necessary to recover from an error fraction exceeding 1/4 (respectively 1/2 for erasures), and for schemes resilient to a 1/3−ε fraction of bit flips (respectively a 1 − ε fraction of erasures), the number of rounds must grow as ε → 0.},

This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean (k, z)-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when k is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for (k, z)-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of Θ(nd) for terminal embedding, where n represents the dataset size. Our technical approach leverages new geometric insights for principal angles and discrepancy methods, which may hold independent interest.},

In this paper, by using the simplicial complexes of Fmq with one single maximal element, we construct four families of linear codes over the ring Fq +uFq (u2 = 0), which generalizes the results of IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 66(6):3657-3663, 2020. The parameters and Lee weight distributions of these four families of codes are completely determined. Most notably, via the Gray map, we obtain several classes of optimal linear codes over Fq, including (near) Griesmer codes and distance-optimal codes. Moreover, it is shown that most of the Gray images are minimal or self-orthogonal codes which are useful in applications.},

However, this correlation structure makes it very challenging to characterize the fundamental limits of non-centered (Rician), non-separable MIMO channels. In fact, there is a dearth of existing literature that addresses this specific aspect, underscoring the need for further research in this area. In this paper, we investigate the mutual information (MI) of non-centered non-separable MIMO channels, where both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components are considered. By utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we set up a central limit theorem for the MI and give the closed-form expressions for its mean and variance. The derived results are then utilized to determine the ergodic MI and outage probability of holographic MIMO channels. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.},

As application examples, the results are exercised in different scenarios using the α-μ and κ-μ fading models, which encompass several other well-known models such as Semi-Gaussian, Rayleigh, Rice, Nakagami-m, and Weibull. We provide unprecedented closed-form formulations for the level crossing rate bounds of the product of these widely-known fading processes. Notably, there are no closed forms for the level crossing rate of these products. Therefore, our bounds supply a benchmark for this metric, with one of them serving as an excellent approximation of the exact metric.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by modern applications such as computerized adaptive testing, sequential rank aggregation, and heterogeneous data source selection, we study the problem of active sequential estimation. The goal is to design an adaptive experiment selection rule and an estimator for more accurate parameter estimation. Greedy information-based experiment selection rules, which optimize information gain one step ahead, have been employed in practice thanks to their computational convenience, flexibility to context or task changes, and broad applicability. However, the optimality of greedy methods under a sequential decision theory framework is only established in the one-dimensional case, partly due to the problem’s combinatorial nature and the seemingly limited capacity of greedy algorithms. In this study, we close the gap for multidimensional problems. We cast the problem under a sequential decision theory framework with generalized risk measures for a large class of design-and-estimation methods. We propose adopting the maximum likelihood estimator with a class of greedy experiment selection rules. This class encompasses both existing methods and introduces new methods with improved numerical efficiency. We prove that these methods achieve asymptotic optimality when the risk measure aligns with the selection rule. Additionally, we establish that the proposed estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal, and further extend the results to allow early stopping rules. We also perform extensive numerical studies on both simulated and real data to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {We consider both classical and quantum variations of X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR). This is the first work to study SPIR with X-security in classical or quantum variations. We first develop a scheme for classical X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding SPIR (XSETSPIR) based on a modified version of cross subspace alignment (CSA), which achieves a rate of R = 1 − X+max(T,E)/N . The modified scheme achieves the same rate as the scheme used for X-secure PIR with the extra benefit of symmetric privacy, i.e., user-privacy as well as databaseprivacy. Next, we extend this scheme to its quantum counterpart based on the N-sum box abstraction. This is the first work to consider the presence of eavesdroppers in quantum private information retrieval (QPIR). In the quantum variation, the eavesdroppers have better access to information over the quantum channel compared to the classical channel due to the over-the-air decodability. To that end, we develop two different schemes for quantum X-secure, E-eavesdropped and T-colluding SPIR (QXSETSPIR) with secure over-the-air decoding. The first scheme achieves the highest possible super-dense coding gain, i.e., RQ = min {1, 2 (1 − X+max(T,E)/N) , which requires additional uploads from the user. The second scheme on the other hand requires no extra uploads. However, it does not achieve the super-dense coding gain in some cases based on the relation between the number of eavesdropped links and the number of interference terms. The second scheme is based on the idea that there exist some special entanglement states that can be used to hide the contents of the user-required messages from the eavesdroppers using the interference symbols.}},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy provides a robust framework for protecting sensitive data, while maintaining its utility for computation. In essence, a differentially private algorithm takes as input the data of multiple parties, and returns an output disclosing minimal information about any individual party. Previous research has introduced several quantum extensions of differential privacy, with applications ranging from quantum machine learning on private classical data to quantum shadow tomography. However, the local model of quantum differential privacy – where each party is responsible for privatizing their own data at a local level – has received limited attention. This work delves into locally differentially private quantum measurements. Although any measurement can be made locally differentially private by adding noise to the outcome, we demonstrate that certain quantum measurements inherently satisfy some degree of local differential privacy for specific classes of input states. This finding has two significant implications: first, limiting the analysis to classical noise injection mechanisms may lead to suboptimal privacy-utility trade-offs for quantum data; second, the theory of differential privacy can be harnessed to further investigate the capabilities of quantum measurements. Motivated by these insights, we establish strong data processing inequalities for the quantum relative entropy under local differential privacy and apply these results to asymmetric hypothesis testing of quantum states with restricted measurements. Additionally, we prove an equivalence between quantum statistical queries and quantum differential privacy in the local model, thereby addressing an open question posed by Arunachalam et al. [11]. Finally, we consider the task of quantum multi-party computation under local differential privacy, demonstrating that parity functions can be efficiently learned in this model, whereas the corresponding classical task requires exponentially many samples.},

The first class contains codes with local constraints; for example, the source data must be encoded by binary sequences containing no sub-words 00 and 111. The second class contains codes with global constraints; for example, the code-words must be binary sequences of certain even length where half of the symbols are zeros and half are ones It is important to note that often the necessary codes must fulfill some requirements of both classes. In this paper we propose a general polynomial complexity method for constructing codes for both classes, as well as for combinations thereof. The proposed method uses the Cover enumerative code, but calculates all the parameters on the fly with polynomial complexity, unlike the known applications of that code which employ combinatorial formulae. The main idea of the paper is to use dynamic programming to perform calculations like: how many sequences with a given prefix and a given suffix length satisfying constraints exist. For the constraints under consideration, we do not need to know the entire prefix, but much less knowledge about the prefix is sufficient. That is, we only need a brief description of the prefix.},

The inner bound is based on an achievable scheme that combines message cooperation and joint compression of past transmitted codewords and echo signals at each transmitter, resulting in unified cooperative communication and sensing. The outer bound is based on the ideas of dependence balance for communication rate, genie-aided state estimator and rate-limited constraints on sensing distortion.

  abstract     = {Sequences with low/zero ambiguity zone (LAZ/ZAZ) properties are useful in modern communication and radar systems operating over mobile environments. This paper first presents a new family of ZAZ sequence sets motivated by the “modulating” zero correlation zone (ZCZ) sequences which were first proposed by Popovic and Mauritz. We then introduce a second family of ZAZ sequence sets with comb-like spectrum, whereby the local Doppler resilience is guaranteed by their inherent spectral nulls in the frequency domain. Finally, LAZ sequence sets are obtained by exploiting their connection with a novel class of mapping functions. These proposed unimodular ZAZ and LAZ sequence sets are cyclically distinct and asymptotically optimal with respect to the existing theoretical bounds on ambiguity functions.},

We establish the optimal tradeoff between the classical communication and CR rates in each setting, thus characterizing the minimal resources for simulating classical-quantum correlations. Next, we consider coordination in networks with quantum links. We study the following models: 1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, 2) a broadcast network, and 3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the optimal tradeoff between quantum communication and entanglement rates in each setting, characterizing the minimal resources for entanglement coordination. The examples demonstrate that coordination of entanglement and coordination of separable correlations behave differently.

  abstract     = {Multi-antenna relays and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been utilized to construct favorable channels to improve the performance of wireless systems. A common feature between relay systems and IRS-aided systems is the two-hop multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. As a result, the mutual information (MI) of two-hop MIMO channels has been widely investigated with very engaging results. However, a rigorous investigation on the fundamental limits of two-hop MIMO channels, i.e., the first and second-order analysis, is not yet available in the literature, due to the difficulties caused by the two-hop (product) channel and the noise introduced by the relay (active IRS). In this paper, we employ large random matrix theory, specifically Gaussian tools, to derive the closed-form deterministic approximation for the mean and variance of the MI. Additionally, we determine the convergence rate for the mean, variance and the characteristic function of the MI, and prove the asymptotic Gaussianity. Furthermore, we also investigate the analytical properties of the fundamental equations that describe the closed-form approximation and prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. An iterative algorithm is then proposed to obtain the solutions for the fundamental equations. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.},

Extensive study has been done on polynomial-time algorithms for the graph alignment problem under the Erdős–Rényi graph pair model, where the two graphs are Erdős–Rényi graphs with edge probability qu, correlated under certain vertex correspondence. To achieve exact recovery of the correspondence, all existing algorithms at least require the edge correlation coefficient ρu between the two graphs to be non-vanishing as n → ∞. Moreover, it is conjectured that no polynomial-time algorithm can achieve exact recovery under vanishing edge correlation ρu &lt; 1/polylog(n). In this paper, we show that with a vanishing amount of additional attribute information, exact recovery is polynomial-time feasible under vanishing edge correlation ρu ≥ n−Θ(1). We identify a local tree structure, which incorporates one layer of user information and one layer of attribute information, and apply the subgraph counting technique to such structures. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed that recovers the vertex correspondence for most of the vertices, and then refines the output to achieve exact recovery. The consideration of attribute information is motivated by real-world applications like LinkedIn and Twitter, where user attributes like birthplace and education background can aid alignment.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we initiate the study of the Rank Decoding (RD) problem and Low Rank Parity Check (LRPC) codes with blockwise structure in rank-based cryptosystems. First, we introduce the blockwise errors (ℓ-errors) where each error consists of ℓ blocks of coordinates with direct-sum supports, and define the blockwise RD (ℓ-RD) problem as a natural generalization of the RD problem whose solutions are ℓ-errors (note that the RD problem is actually a special ℓ-RD problem with ℓ = 1). We adapt the typical attacks on the RD problem to the ℓ-RD problem, and find that the blockwise structure does not ease the problem too much: the ℓ-RD problem is still exponentially hard for appropriate choices of ℓ &gt; 1. Second, we introduce the blockwise LRPC (ℓ-LRPC) codes as generalizations of the LPRC codes whose parity-check matrices can be divided into ℓ sub-matrices with direct-sum supports, i.e., the intersection of two subspaces generated by the entries of any two sub-matrices is a null space, and investigate the decoding algorithms for ℓ-errors. We find that the gain of using ℓ-errors in decoding capacity outweighs the complexity loss in solving the ℓ-RD problem, which makes it possible to design more efficient rank-based cryptosystems with flexible choices of parameters. As an application, we show that the two rank-based cryptosystems submitted to the NIST PQC competition, namely, RQC and ROLLO, can be greatly improved by using the ideal variants of the ℓ-RD problem and ℓ-LRPC codes. Concretely, for 128-bit security, our RQC has total public key and ciphertext sizes of 2.5 KB, which is not only about 50% more compact than the original RQC, but also smaller than the NIST Round 4 code-based submissions HQC, BIKE, and Classic McEliece.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the unsourced random access (URA) problem with a random and unknown number of active users in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels.We derive non-asymptotic achievability bounds on the probability of incorrectly estimating the number of active users, and provide scaling laws on the gap between the estimated and true numbers of active users. We prove that the error probability reaches a plateau as the power P and blocklength n increase, whereas it decays exponentially with the number L of receive antennas and eventually vanishes. Then, we explore the fundamental limits of URA by deriving nonasymptotic achievability bounds and converse bounds (including two single-user converse bounds and one multi-user ensemble converse bound) on the minimum energy-per-bit required by each active user to transmit J bits with blocklength n under misdetection and false-alarm constraints. Numerical results show that the extra required energy-per-bit due to the uncertainty in the number Ka of active users decreases as L and E[Ka] increase and the error requirement becomes milder. In the non-asymptotic regime, using codewords distributed on a sphere outperforms Gaussian random coding. Existing schemes are shown to exhibit a large gap to our bounds when the number of active users is large, calling for more advanced schemes that perform energyefficiently in this case. In the asymptotic regime with n → ∞, we establish scaling laws on the minimum required P and L to reliably support Ka active users as functions of n, which highlight the potential of MIMO in enabling low-cost communication and indicate that it is possible for the minimum required P and L to remain on the same order when the number of active users increases but stays below a threshold.},

  abstract     = {This paper provides a finite-sample analysis of a passive stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (PSGLD) algorithm. This algorithm is designed to achieve adaptive inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Adaptive IRL aims to estimate the cost function of a forward learner performing a stochastic gradient algorithm (e.g., policy gradient reinforcement learning) by observing their estimates in real-time. The PSGLD algorithm is considered passive because it incorporates noisy gradients provided by an external stochastic gradient algorithm (forward learner), of which it has no control. The PSGLD algorithm acts as a randomized sampler to achieve adaptive IRL by reconstructing the forward learner’s cost function nonparametrically from the stationary measure of a Langevin diffusion. This paper analyzes the non-asymptotic (finite-sample) performance; we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein distance between PSGLD algorithm sample measure and the stationary measure encoding the cost function, and provide guarantees for a kernel density estimation scheme which reconstructs the cost function from empirical samples. Our analysis uses tools from the study of Markov diffusion operators. The derived bounds have both practical and theoretical significance. They provide finite-time guarantees for an adaptive IRL mechanism, and substantially generalize the analytical framework of a line of research in passive stochastic gradient algorithms.},

This paper proposes a two-stage optimization method to fully exploit AAVs’ flying, sensing, compressing, and transmitting capabilities for secure data acquisition under dual uncertainties. In the first stage, a deep reinforcement learning strategy is employed to optimize sensing and trajectory planning to explore the eavesdropping environment and balance computational and transmission demands. Building on the sensed information about the eavesdropping environment, the second stage focuses on minimizing task completion time through optimal resource allocation and hierarchical A* path planning, with the channel uncertainty addressed by incorporating an outage probability constraint. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce data completion time by 35.3%, validating its effectiveness in uncertain environments.},

Conversely, quick and safe vehicle authentication still poses a significant issue, especially at the handover time when switching between roadside units (RSUs), where network efficacy is influenced by computational overhead and re-authentication delays. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes DYNAMIC-TRUST. This blockchain-based authentication framework relies on the Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to avoid redundant re-authentication, minimizing computation and communication costs. Compared to conventional authentication approaches, our method decentralizes vehicle revocation, allowing RSUs to revoke compromised vehicles autonomously without relying on a trusted authority, providing resilience regardless of adversarial conditions. The proposed framework’s resistance to identity theft, replay, and Sybil attacks has been proven by formal security analysis using Scyther and the Real-Or-Random (ROR) oracle model. Also, the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is used to evaluate real-world practicality, proving improved scalability, lowered authentication latency, and greater network efficiency over various vehicular circumstances. Blockchain’s potential for enhancing vehicular network performance, trust, and security is highlighted in this study, which helps to develop smart cities and 6G-enabled Internet of Vehicles (IoV) infrastructures.},

Recent studies on mitigating bus bunching have turned to model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for developing holding control strategies, demonstrating superior performance over traditional model-based approaches. However, a systematic evaluation of how different learning configurations affect the overall performance of these methods remains unexplored. To this end, this study develops an open-source framework to systematically examine the control performance of various RL approaches, including both value-based and policy-based algorithms, under different configurations using real-world bus data. Our findings reveal that: 1) simpler state representations (e.g., considering only forward and backward spacings between adjacent buses) may outperform more complex ones that additionally incorporate stop-specific information; 2) adopting actions with discrete holding time achieve comparable results to their continuous counterparts, offering practical advantages for implementation; 3) while multi-agent methods can slightly improve performance, their computational costs can outweigh benefits in certain scenarios; and 4) RL approaches demonstrate strong generalizability across diverse routes and fleet sizes, suggesting potential for widespread application with minimal retraining. These insights could guide the selection and implementation of practical RL deployment for public transit agencies.},

Firstly, considering the coupling of longitudinal and lateral dynamics, the nonlinearity of tire force, the time-varying characteristics of longitudinal velocity and road adhesion coefficient, the time-varying nonlinear models of the 8-DOF vehicle dynamics system and SbW system are established. Secondly, a dual-channel event-triggering mechanism and low-complexity prescribed performance control method is proposed, in which the communication resources of sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator channels and the computing resources of the controller can be saved, also, the model uncertainty and measurement error can be against by the inherent robustness of the proposed methods. Thirdly, theoretical analysis is presented to show that the full-state and tracking errors of the SbW systems can be constrained to the prescribed ranges, and all signals of the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded. Finally, simulations and experiments are given to verify the validity of developed methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper revisits the Reactive Dynamic User-Equilibrium (RDUE) model for dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) of macroscopic traffic flow in two-dimensional continuum space, focusing on the Eikonal equation—a crucial partial differential equation (PDE) with specific boundary conditions. Traditionally, solving Eikonal equations has relied on iterative numerical methods through the discretization of the continuum space. However, this discretization compromises the precision of numerical solutions and could lead to non-convergence issues during iterative processes. This study refers to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and develops the Distance-Informed Neural Eikonal Solver (NES-DI) for solving Reactive Dynamic User-Equilibrium models. While the previously proposed Neural Eikonal Solver (NES) performs badly in a strong heterogeneous cost field with large cost differences, NES-DI explicitly considers the influence of solid boundaries during the factorization process by incorporating accurate distance information. Numerical examples of RDUE at both the static and dynamic levels are presented to illustrate the performance and applications of the NES-DI framework. The results demonstrate that NES-DI greatly outperforms both NES and the fast sweeping method. Moreover, NES-DI overcomes the limitations of discretization, enabling predictions of solutions at arbitrary locations within the computational domain. At the dynamic level, transfer learning is employed to leverage historical solutions to solve RDUE problems more efficiently. Overall, NES-DI shows the potential of solving reactive dynamic problems with strong heterogeneity, which offers a promising alternative to discretization-reliant numerical methods.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a safe learning-based eco-driving framework tailored for mixed traffic flows, which aims to optimize energy efficiency while guaranteeing system constraints during real-system operations. Even though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems. Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances, which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an average improvement of 10.88% in holistic energy efficiency compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.},

Most previous lane detection methods focus exclusively on analyzing individual images and overlook the inter-frame dynamics, while car-mounted cameras capture continuous streams amenable to leveraging intra-video context. In challenging scenes with blur, occlusion, or illumination variations, considering visible lanes from previous frames can aid current frame interpretation. To tackle above challenges, we introduce a parallel heterogeneous framework, called PHNet, for video lane detection. First, a novel router automatically analyzes multi-level features to determine the inference route of candidates with different visual cues. Then, a cross-frame attention mechanism leverages relationships between current candidates and positive embeddings from past frame to aggregate contextual cues. Unlike existing offline video lane detection methods, which face limitations in handling long video sequences and real-time video streams due to computational constraints, our proposed method operates as an online framework capable of processing clips of any length. Our method demonstrates robust lane detection through temporally association modeling and efficient online inference. The extensive experiments on public benchmark show that PHNet has superior performance versus state-of-the-art video lane detection methods.},

Most of the trials are carried out in a simulated setting, and further real-world scenarios may be required to confirm the algorithm’s efficacy. This methodology initially implements batch normalization techniques to enhance the training process of the deep neural network, subsequently utilizing the quasi-Newton method for optimization to successfully approximate the ideal answer. According to the experimental results, the QNRLO algorithm’s loss function and normalized computation rate have converged after 2,000 iterations, demonstrating the algorithm’s excellent stability and dependability. The findings demonstrate that the computational load and training time can be further optimized by appropriately adjusting certain parameters without compromising convergence performance. Furthermore, the technique incorporates system transmission time allocation into the TCPS model, hence augmenting the model’s practicality.

In environments supported by autonomous driving and 6G networks, this task plays a vital role in urban surveillance and traffic management by enabling the real-time sharing of vehicle location and status information through ultra-high-speed, low-latency 6G communication. The success of a retrieval model largely depends on the quality of the extracted representations, which can be influenced by factors such as background diversity and occlusions. This study proposes a method to extract representations that remain consistent across different domains while retaining the discriminative power necessary to determine a vehicle’s spatial location, regardless of background or environmental variations. To achieve this, we introduce a framework called full (abbr). Within abbr, we leverage large-scale pre-trained foundational models to provide spatial priors of vehicles, specifically the Grounding DINO model for object detection and the SAM model for object segmentation. These modules collaborate to help the network understand the spatial context of the object, enabling the feature extractor to focus on discriminative areas while minimizing interference. Additionally, we introduce a complementary feature alignment mechanism based on a memory bank to explore globally applicable knowledge within the learned representation of the object. These constituent elements collectively form SRP, to enhance its capability for outstanding performance in vehicle retrieval. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that SRP significantly outperforms existing models on widely recognized benchmarks.},

An optimization problem is formulated to maximize symmetry across clusters, evaluating the effectiveness of clustering based on stop location using k-means. A novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm utilizing the Double Deep Q-Network framework is proposed to identify optimal clusters, demonstrating an 8% improvement in symmetry optimization over k-means. Notably, k-means clusters still achieve an average symmetry level of 62% when accounting for geographical proximity and walking distance limits. Through the proposed clusters, transit planners can better understand passenger flow dynamics and predict alighting counts with incomplete data.},

To address this issue, a scenario that multiple intelligent vehicle applications cooperatively initiate computation offloading requests in 6G-enabled multi-server multi-access vehicle-to-edge computing systems is considered in this paper, and with the defined reasonable utilities for MEC servers and intelligent vehicle applications, a solution of bidding-enabled dynamic resource pricing for computation offloading is proposed.

However, managing the operation of QCs and AGVs is complex as numerous factors affect the operational performance, such as QC interference, vehicle congestion, and limited capacity of handover points. To address the problem, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming model that explicitly considers the above realistic factors. As the model is computationally inefficient even for small-scale instances, we develop a tailored two-stage algorithm, where the first stage is branch-and-bound for QC operations and the second is column generation for AGV operations.

To address these challenges, a modular and practice-oriented framework that assesses traffic criticality is proposed. Vehicular and environmental data can be used to objectively measure individual critical elements of traffic, which are then aggregated into a comprehensive scenario assessment. The framework is illustrated by applying it (i) to two maneuvers discussing effects of single criticality metrics and (ii) to two widely used datasets featuring highway and intersecting traffic for a statistical analysis. The assessment framework can be applied in many scenarios, ranging from identifying safety critical scenarios in existing data as a fundament for early development of ADSs to detecting safety critical emergency maneuvers in live data to trigger a deployed ADS. Fundamental to this process is the suitable selection of metrics, thresholds for critical behavior, and the system’s sensitivity in aggregating partially critical scenarios.},

Second, the shuffle manipulation module is designed which includes slicing and shuffling to manipulate the spatial and channel features so that the information loss problem caused by conventional convolutional downsampling is overcome. Third, the adaptive connection of features at different scales using learnable parameters is proposed, and then the target features are reinforced by location and channel calibration branches.

Traditional research on lane detection is mainly based on inter-frame similarity. Conversely, our methodology challenges this assumption, allowing the algorithm to adapt in diverse dynamic driving scenarios. In this paper, we proposed an advanced lane detection and tracking method using robust thresholding and frame coherence. A novel two stage feature extraction methodology for lane detection is introduced. In the initial stage, adaptive thresholding is employed based on the local statistical and geometrical constraints of lane markings at the sub-image level. Subsequently, artifacts are addressed and removed using a vertical aggregation technique combined with the Hough transform at the regional level. In this lane detection framework, tracking is integrated to establish a dynamic area of interest for lane search in the subsequent frame. For robust tracking, Kalman filter parameters are adjusted based on measurement reliability. To adapt to the non-linear variations inherent in real-world driving scenarios, outcomes of inter-frame similarity analysis are compared with periodic full-frame detection and a moving average window estimator is employed within the verification protocol. The proposed method is evaluated using Caltech dataset and our dataset, which was recorded at Indian highway and urban roads. Experiment results shows that the proposed method is robust to varying illumination conditions, dense shadows, lane change scenarios, abrupt change in lane width, and occluded lanes with a whooping average detection rate of 98.37%.},

  abstract     = {In navigating the challenges of real-time semantic communication (SC) codec updates in the 6G-era non-terrestrial network (NTN)-assisted vehicular networks (NTN-VNs), a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), this article introduces a novel approach inspired by human society. Facing complexities like 3-dimensional updating, network dynamism, and updating costs, NTN-VNs are treated as social networks. The proposed NTN-VN federated learning (NTN-VN-FL) framework asynchronously addresses challenges such as uplink and downlink SC codec updates, device decentralization, and asynchronous updating. By viewing device behaviors during updating as social behaviors with economic costs, an NTN-VN social management system ensures the proper functioning of the social network in the context of NTN-VN-FL. An economical social behavior selection mechanism, based on the reverse auction game for NTN-VN-FL, minimizes training delay and device energy costs, considering social relationships. The article also presents a two-stage Stackelberg game with the Vickrey auction rule to maximize social welfare in the auction. Simulation results highlight the superiority of NTN-VN-FL over existing potential application algorithms, effectively addressing the unique challenges of SC codec updating in NTN-VN. The efficacy of the social management system and social behavior selection mechanism is demonstrated in achieving optimal outcomes.},

  abstract     = {3D occupancy perception holds a pivotal role in recent vision-centric autonomous driving systems by converting surround-view images into integrated geometric and semantic representations within dense 3D grids. Nevertheless, current models still encounter two main challenges: modeling depth accurately in the 2D-3D view transformation stage, and overcoming the lack of generalizability issues due to sparse LiDAR supervision. To address these issues, this paper presents GEOcc, a Geometric-Enhanced Occupancy network tailored for vision-only surround-view perception. Our approach is three-fold: 1) Integration of explicit lift-based depth prediction and implicit projection-based transformers for depth modeling, enhancing the density and robustness of view transformation. 2) Utilization of mask-based encoder-decoder architecture for fine-grained semantic predictions; 3) Adoption of context-aware self-training loss functions in the pertaining stage to complement LiDAR supervision, involving the re-rendering of 2D depth maps from 3D occupancy features and leveraging image reconstruction loss to obtain denser depth supervision besides sparse LiDAR ground-truths. Our approach achieves State-of-the-Art performance on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset with the least image resolution needed and the most weightless image backbone compared with current models, marking an improvement of 3.3% due to our proposed contributions. Comprehensive experimentation also demonstrates the consistent superiority of our method over baselines and alternative approaches.

Furthermore, the study applied Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) features of tower crane operators.

In this work, we propose a novel beamfocusing scheme to improve the system performance for the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided hybrid near-and far-field communications with multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Compared to conventional schemes without considering the near-field beam pattern with a finite depth, in our proposed scheme, the RIS only serves one UAV, while other UAVs are within the radiation range of the concentrated signal energy by beamfocusing. Specifically, we study the polar radius and angular deviations between UAVs with a given beamfocusing gain, aiming to reveal the impact of RIS structure on beamfocusing gain. We also make a fair comparison between the proposed scheme and allocated RIS scheme, deriving the feasible reference distance. In addition, we study the feasibility for different RIS structures focusing on the beamfocusing gain, which has the potential to improve the system performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is always superior than that of the allocated RIS scheme within the feasible reference distance.},

In order to improve both planning and control efficiency while ensuring the validity of the planned trajectories for autonomous vehicles, a reinforcement learning and optimal control integrated method (RL-OCIM) for planning and control is proposed. The proposed method ensures the obstacle avoidance through incorporating lane change based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with the optimal control method (OCM). The trained PPO agent takes the structured information of the ego vehicle and the surrounding obstacles as input, and generates the trajectory terminal state for the ego vehicle. Subsequently, the continuous trajectory solving problem is transformed into an optimal control problem (OCP), resulting in the generation of a feasible trajectory that includes vehicle steering and longitudinal acceleration based on the vehicle kinematics model. In addition, to improve the efficiency of agent training, a pre-trained neural network is employed to generate trajectory feature points by taking the trajectory terminal states as input. During the agent training process, the trajectory feature points are obtained directly from the neural network after selecting an action. Experiments are conducted on a hybrid Lincoln MKZ vehicle to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed RL-OCIM, which includes various driving scenarios such as static obstacle avoidance and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

Accurate and reliable detection of smart road studs and its further integration into the perception and control modules of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) undoubtedly benefit road boundary detection, localization of CAVs and augument the safety of CAVs’ driving. This work investigates real-time, accurate and reliable detection of smart road studs, which is a challenging task for CAVs because existing methods fail to achieve accurate and real-time smart road stud detection, especially in harsh road environment. To address these challenges, we first build a real-world smart road stud dataset, and then propose and validate a lightweight and efficient smart road stud detection model based on the you only look once 8th version (YOLOv8), called SRS-YOLO. First, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention module is used to improve the coarse-to-fine (C2F) module to differentiate the channel importance of feature maps and improve the detection accuracy of smart road studs. Second, a novel downsampling module (DownS) that integrates the average pooling and the max pooling is designed to reduce the number of parameters and minimize information loss during the downsampling process. Third, the loss function is replaced with the Normalized Wasserstein Distance (NWD) loss to alleviate the sensitivity to location deviations when computing the loss for small targets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SRS-YOLO outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and achieves a 87.92% mean average precision at a real-time speed of 78 frames/s.

Our strategy primarily focuses on optimizing energy consumption during model training and updating at the vehicle end, thereby resolving the prevalent issue of limited end-user participation in FL due to high energy demands. Additionally, we introduce an advanced model selection method, prioritizing local model uploads and adaptively allocating bandwidth to clients with more extensive training data. This method enhances the efficiency and reliability of model updates, ensuring robust global model performance.

  abstract     = {Accurate metro ridership estimation is essential for effective urban transportation planning. Traditional regression methods relying on historical passenger flow data often overlook the intrinsic relationship between network scale and land use, limiting predictive accuracy. To address this issue, this study focuses on the Beijing urban rail transit system, aiming to explore how station-level factors influence spatial variations in metro ridership over a decade (2013–2022). An advanced machine learning framework that integrates Node-Place model with Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP-based machine learning method) is proposed. Twelve influencing factors are developed, including network centrality measures and points of interest (POI) attributes, and a CRITIC weighting method is applied to weight these variables within the Node-Place Model, ensuring an objective assessment of their relative importance. Utilizing LightGBM regression method combined with SHAP values, our model achieved an average R2 of 0.88 in annual average daily entry ridership regression and a smaller discrepancy between R2 and adjusted R2, significantly outperforming ordinary least squares (OLS, R2 = 0.42) and geographically weighted regression (GWR, R2 = 0.58). The proposed model consistently demonstrates an AIC value approximately 15% lower than alternative models across multiple years of regression tasks, highlighting its stability and superior performance. Key indicators identified include PageRank and the number of restaurants and enterprises around metro stations. Combining detailed land use data and network centrality measures with advanced machine learning techniques proves to be an effective way to enhancing ridership regression.},

This is especially true when considering accident scenarios, in which the dynamics can be affected by both high-frequency events, such as in high-sides, marked by rapid variations of the characteristics signals, and low-frequency events, such as in side slips, which exhibit slower and monotonic change in the same quantities. Therefore, designing an effective automatic eCall system for this type of vehicle is particularly challenging, while at the same time, it can significantly increase safety in dangerous situations. This paper proposed a novel approach for detecting falls of two-wheeled vehicles that avoids missed detections while minimizing the number of false alarms, which would heavily undermine its usability. We show, based on extensive analysis of a wide range of experimental data, why and how the proposed approach allows us to overcome the limitations of the existing proposal, ensuring a consistent detection of the wide range of falls that can happen on two-wheelers, also providing a detailed comparison with the scientific literature.},

High-resolution loop detector data and signal state records from Automated Traffic Signal Performance Measures (ATSPM) offer new opportunities for traffic signal optimization at intersections. However, additional factors such as geometry, traffic volumes, Turning-Movement Counts (TMCs), and human driving behaviors complicate this task. Existing simulators (e.g., SUMO, Vissim) are computationally intensive, while machine learning models often lack lane-specific traffic flow estimation. To address these issues, we propose two computationally efficient Attentional Graph Auto-Encoder frameworks as “Digital Twins” for urban traffic intersections. Leveraging graph representations and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), our models capture lane-level traffic flow dynamics at entry and exit points while remaining agnostic to intersection topology and lane configurations. Trained on over 40,000 hours of realistic traffic simulations with affordable GPU parallelization, our framework produces fine-grained traffic flow time series. This output supports critical applications such as estimating Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs), scaling to urban freeway corridors, and integrating with signal optimization frameworks for improved traffic management.},

Secondly, a parameter-adjustable cubic function negative-determination condition is proposed, generalizing the existing condition in the literature as a special case and reducing its conservatism. Then, by combining the proposed negative-determination condition with the suitable LKF, new stability conditions are derived, enabling a more accurate determination of the allowable delay upper bound (ADUB). Furthermore, to improve computational efficiency in determining the ADUB, the suitable LKF not only provides stability conditions with lower complexity, reducing time per iteration, but also incorporates a binary search algorithm, significantly minimizing the total number of iterations required.

This study proposes a novel deep clustering framework to comprehensively uncover passenger-searching strategies from extensive trajectory data. Specifically, multiple features from vacant searching trips are extracted and analogously defined as multi-channel images, where each channel corresponds to a specific feature. A novel deep image clustering approach is then proposed, integrating a feature representation module utilizing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), a self-expression module for affinity learning, a spectral clustering module, and a classification module for self-supervision. An effective training procedure is also presented for the proposed deep clustering framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against benchmark methods. Based on the clustering results, common and specific passenger searching strategies are further revealed. Specifically, our findings highlight the importance of individual’s contextual experience in explaining searching behavior and operational efficiency. Moreover, drivers cruising without clear searching strategy often exhibit lower performance, and some drivers may gamble with peers to increase their chances of picking up passengers. These results deliver important justifications for future studies and provide managerial implications to improve on-demand mobility.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an efficient solution to alleviate the limitations of local computing resources in vehicular networks. However, the high mobility of vehicles and the dynamic variability of network topologies make it significantly challengeable. In this work, we make a fusion of model-driven and data-driven intelligence to design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution for task offloading in urban VEC networks. First, computational models for task queue, transmission, computation, energy consumption, and expense are meticulously developed for the VEC network that integrates communication and computation. Vehicular tasks vary in type, urgency, size, and timeframe, leading to different latency requirements. Tasks may be executed locally within the vehicle, at a server after V2I offloading via cellular communications, or in a neighboring vehicle after V2V offloading via millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Each of these options incurs different levels of latency, energy consumption, and expense. Second, based on these models and the utility function that combines latency, energy consumption, and expense, an optimization problem for task offloading is formulated. This problem can be interpreted as a Markov decision process with a carefully designed reward function. Third, to address the offloading problem, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization-based task and target selection algorithm (MAPPO-TTSA). This algorithm also utilizes convolutional neural networks to extract features from large-scale states, thereby enhancing their correlation. Fourth, comprehensive training is performed on the observational data to determine the optimal parameters for predicting task offloading. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, and simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed intelligent task offloading scheme offers significant advantages in terms of average task completion delay and utility level across various scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In complex traffic environments, the driving performance of the leader vehicle in a platoon can be greatly impacted by sudden and unexpected changes in vehicle acceleration rates. This phenomenon is known as unknown jerk dynamics (JDs), and it can lead to more extreme car-following behaviors (CFBs) in platoon tracking control, which may raise safety and traffic capacity issues. To tackle these concerns, this work studies cooperative platoon tracking control and intermittent optimization problems for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with unknown reaction time delays (RTDs) using a nonlinear car following model (NCFM). In a free-design but directed communication network, we assume that the leader CAV’s external inputs have unknown but bounded parameters both for the JDs and RTDs, while only a small number of nearby follower CAVs are aware of the leader CAV’s acceleration signals. To solve these issues, we consider that each follower CAV implements a distributed observer law, which provides a reference signal stated as an estimated JD of the leader CAV. Then, a distributed platoon tracking control protocol is proposed to construct cooperative tracking controllers with identical inter-vehicle constraints (ICs). This maintains the desired safety distance between the CAVs and allows each follower CAV to track its leader CAV only through local information exchange. In addition, we present a robust intermittent optimization design and a novel intermittent sampling condition that can guarantee optimally scheduled feedback gains for the cooperative platoon tracking controllers to minimize the control cost in the presence of unknown JDs and RTDs under non-identical ICs. Simulation case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. We also demonstrate the efficient development of such a distributed cooperative car-following model for the platoon’s motion (or as an intelligent speed advising system for automated or human-driven vehicles), resulting in a trip that is safe, comfortable, and energy efficient.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectory prediction, as a key enabler of the intelligent transportation system, has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry in recent years. However, the variability and dynamism of traffic conditions pose significant challenges to current vehicle trajectory prediction methods, particularly in the form of domain bias. Domain bias occurs when a model trained on one traffic domain, such as one segment of a highway, underperforms when applied to another segment with different traffic patterns. To address this challenge and advance the field, we propose a new transfer learning-based collaborative vehicle trajectory prediction framework called TRACER, designed to provide reliable and accurate traffic predictions with high adaptability for cross-domain highway traffic scenarios. The core of our framework lies in an adaptive interactive extraction module and a trajectory generation module based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), further strengthened by a pre-task of intention recognition for vehicle operation types. To improve model robustness, consistency regularization is applied by injecting disturbances into the target data, and a one-dimensional Convolution (Conv1D)-based intention extraction module is integrated into the BiLSTM-based trajectory generation process, leading to notable improvements in prediction accuracy. Our framework is first trained on source domain data, followed by the transfer of a small amount of labeled data from the target domain, and the overall model is further refined using unlabeled data. By effectively mitigating domain bias, TRACER significantly enhances trajectory prediction accuracy while maintaining high adaptability. The results underscore the importance of addressing domain shift challenges in trajectory prediction tasks and demonstrate the potential of domain adaptation techniques to improve the prediction accuracy of vehicle trajectories across different domains in highway scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Most advanced methods for road surface defect detection may have the issue of large network structures, making them impractical for implementation on mobile embedded systems. In this study, A lightweight road surface defect real-time intelligent detection system based on cloud-edge collaboration is proposed. The system comprises a lightweight feature-enhanced YOLO network (YOLO-LFE), a multi-object tracking network called ByteTrack, and is deployed on intelligent edge devices, enabling real-time defect detection and storage of uploaded defect information through edge computing modules and cloud systems. Built upon the latest YOLOv8 architecture, a lightweight MobileNetV3 network is first introduced as the backbone feature extraction component, resulting in a noteworthy decrease in parameters and computational intricacy. Subsequently, the Enhanced Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ESPP) method built upon the human visual perception system is applied to swap out the Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fusion (SPPF) method, thereby enhancing the model’s capability to capture features from tiny entities. Finally, an enhanced progressive feature fusion network is designed to further address the semantic gap issue during subsequent fusion of primary features. Experimental results on a self-made dataset and the public RDD2022 dataset show that the proposed detection model maintains high accuracy while requiring fewer parameters and less computational resources. Compared to YOLOv8, the model reduces the number of parameters by 32.5% and decreases computational requirements by 37%. This makes it more suitable for deployment on embedded devices. Additionally, the system has been field-tested on vehicles, thereby validating the effectiveness of the entire system.},

  abstract     = {Efficient and reliable motion planning is essential for robots in transportation systems. Learning-based motion planners, especially those leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), have emerged as promising approaches to accelerate motion planning. However, current GNN-based planners suffer from inevitable performance bottlenecks due to their insufficient exploitation of environmental information and the intrinsic connections within graph structures. In contrast, the human brain exhibits innate strengths in decision-making and reasoning, enabling complex inferences from sparse observations and rapid integration of new information to control behavior. Neuroscience evidence reveals the human brain translates decision-making problems into graph structures and sensory observations, leveraging spatial relational memory for sensory inference. To address these issues, this paper proposes a brain-inspired GNN-based motion planner, BrainyMP, which innovatively draws on the brain’s spatial relational memory mechanisms. Specifically, a selective sampling strategy is proposed to reduce unnecessary exploration during the construction of the random geometric graph (RGG). Additionally, a Brainy Edge Selector is designed to filter inappropriate edges, enhancing planning quality. Furthermore, the Memory-aware Predictor is proposed to improve graph pattern learning capabilities and planning efficiency by integrating subgraph structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves planning quality and efficiency in maze and robotic-arm manipulation tasks while maintaining high success rates. These results indicate that emulating human brain mechanisms holds promise for improving robotic performance.},

However, with the expansion of the sensing range, the tens of thousands of vehicles and the openness of urban road networks pose a huge challenge for real-time participant recruitment in online VCS systems. To achieve efficient city-scale VCS, this paper proposes Dec-Recruiter, a decentralized framework for online participant recruitment. Specifically, Dec-Recruiter adopts a novel decision-making mode based on virtual grid agents, where vehicles traveling in the same direction within the same grid are considered homogeneous, simplifying the recruitment of specific vehicles to the selection of the number of vehicles in each direction. Meanwhile, through policy sharing among grid agents with the same geographic features, the complexity of city-scale VCS participant recruitment is further reduced. The core of Dec-Recruiter is a multi-agent contextual double-deep Q-network algorithm, which enables grid agents with different geographic features to collaborate on network-wide sensing tasks through their asynchronous decision-making. In this process, the Gaussian function is employed to adjust the reward distribution to address cold-start and data integrity issues in VCS. In addition, to ensure the convergence and training efficiency of the model on large-scale road networks, a pre-training-based transfer learning paradigm is also introduced. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that Dec-Recruiter can effectively recruit appropriate participants in the large-scale VCS and outperforms all baselines.},

In UAV-assisted Data Time-Sensitive IoT (DTIoT), the Age of Information is a crucial metric assessing data freshness, measuring the elapsed time from traffic sensors to the base station. Optimizing flight trajectories of multiple UAVs to minimize AoI while adhering to energy constraints poses a significant challenge. Current research often employs deep reinforcement learning for UAV trajectory control. Nevertheless, managing multi-agent continuous trajectories in intricate DTIoT network environments faces obstacles due to sparse rewards, thus impeding the training of deep neural network-based control policies using traditional DRL techniques. In this paper, we propose a network-oriented hierarchical reinforcement learning (NO-HRL) to control the UAVs’ flight trajectory in DTIoT networks for minimizing the AoI. We devise a control policy leveraging a two-tier hierarchical DRL framework, with the upper tier determining the target and the lower tier executing it. We also introduce a decoupled sequential training approach to efficiently train the mutually dependent two-tier DRL network of NO-HRL.

Although Quick Access Recorder (QAR) systems collect extensive multivariate flight data, previous studies have faced challenges in effectively modeling the complex interdependencies between flight parameters, which has limited their ability to predict multiple safety incidents simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a novel model, named MDGNN, to capture hidden spatio-temporal dependencies and predict both hard landing and tail strike risk incidents. Specifically, we employ temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to extract both localized representations and long-term temporal trends from multivariate flight data, ensuring the standardization of flight parameters across varying frequencies. Additionally, we are the first to construct a dynamic graph to model temporal relationships, applying a dynamic graph neural network and a temporal convolution module to accurately capture intricate spatial and temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments conducted on 37,904 Airbus A320 flight samples demonstrate that the MDGNN model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a case study visualizing key flight parameters highlights the model’s ability to reveal the root causes of safety exceedances, offering valuable insights for flight safety analysis.},

The key components of our approach include a state representation utilizing the Markov decision process that captures global train and station characteristics, and a policy network that extracts information from this representation to sequentially construct the train departure order. The main benefits of our framework include adaptability to different stopping plans and delay scenarios, decoupling from the problem size, and ensuring the feasibility of generated schemes. Furthermore, to improve the solution quality, we integrate the learned decision policies with a local search method, enabling the scalability of the model with little additional computation cost. Experiments on extensive TTO and TTR instances of the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway line demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach. Our DRL-based method outperforms all the heuristic rules and commercial solvers without retraining the model on various problem sizes, especially on large-scale cases under limited calculation time.},

  abstract     = {Effective detection of bus passengers enhances the intelligence and automation of public transportation systems, but it is challenged by complex backgrounds and severe scale imbalances. To address these challenges, we introduce DAEAR-DETR, a novel neural network architecture employing Dual-Attention mechanisms and Echo Accumulative Residuals (EAR) for bus passenger detection. This model features a Dual-Attention Encoder comprising the Low-Level Local Attention Module (LLLAM) and the High-Level Global Attention Module (HLGAM). Additionally, it integrates a Bidirectional Cross-scale Feature-Fusion Module (BCFM) and a decoder. The Echo Accumulative Residual (EAR) combats information degradation by reintroducing initial input sequences throughout the Transformer encoder layers. A Gating Mechanism (GM) within the EAR connections selectively filters and enhances relevant features based on the ongoing feature process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the custom bus passenger dataset, DAEAR-DETR achieves 71.9% AP50, 73.5% ARL, and 61.6% AR50:95, outperforming Faster R-CNN, YOLOv9, and other DETR-based methods. Furthermore, DAEAR-DETR demonstrates strong generalization on the public Caltech Pedestrian dataset, achieving Log Average Miss Rate (LAMR) of 4.16% for the Reasonable subset, 4.97% for the Small subset, and 27.79% for the Heavy Occlusion subset. A real-world bus passenger dataset is also created with 15,656 images and 76,006 labeled passengers.},

Overhead crane systems, being a crucial mode of transportation, find wide application in engineering practice. This paper proposes a compound control strategy for underactuated overhead crane systems, combining a deep reinforcement learning controller with a novel observer-based disturbance compensation algorithm. The aim is to suppress model uncertainties and external disturbances. Initially, an equivalent state variable is constructed to stabilize the overhead crane system, simplifying controller design. Subsequently, the model uncertainties and external disturbances are treated as generalized disturbances and incorporated as a new state. This state is estimated and compensated through a super-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with finite-time convergence. Lyapunov-based analysis demonstrates that the established state observer can reduce the residual estimate error to zero. Moreover, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a form of deep reinforcement learning, is employed to effectively eliminate tracking errors. The proposed scheme enables the underactuated system to achieve satisfactory performance, with adaptive control effort suited to different control states and disturbances. Simulation and hardware experiments are conducted, comparing the proposed control strategy with traditional methods, to illustrate its effectiveness and robustness.},

For this purpose, we design a convolution-transformer-based pipeline to extract local representative features and encode global correlations of intra-modality for inter-modality correspondence estimation between unaligned visible and thermal images.

However, in the face of multi-sensor high-frequency monitoring signals under extreme operating conditions, limited by the ability of model data modeling, the existing methods, based on classification and reconstruction strategies, are difficult to further improve the anomaly localization precision. To address the challenges and overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes a Dual-control Inference Diffusion Model (DIDM), which reconstructs and inferences on specified sensor samples to achieve accurate anomaly detection. The reverse diffusion inference process is controlled by the channel condition and mask prior, combined with two loss functions for alternating training, which enables inference for samples from specified sensors at specific moments. We evaluate the model based on the static ignition test data of a certain type of LRE. The results show that DIDM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of DIDM. Furthermore, by combining the error distributions of the inference results, we can achieve a more accurate location of anomaly in the time and frequency domains, which could increase the efficiency of rocket launches and air and space transportation, and enhance the potential of the academic results for industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {A vision-driven driver monitoring system plays a vital role of vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS) to guarantee the driving safety. Recent advances focus on modeling a deep learning-based method to realize the driver monitoring system, which benefits from the powerful capability of data-driven feature extraction. Although the acceptable performances of driver state monitoring methods are achieved, there is still a gap between the emerged techniques and actual application scenarios. First, the human-centric visual appearances are not involved comprehensively to represent the driver states, resulting in ignoring the contextual interaction of behaviors. Second, the inherent uncertainty of driver situation is not considered, while the unreliable samples would lead to the untrustworthy results. In this paper, we focus on a vision-based driver state monitoring method, where a trustworthy driver state perception (TDSP) is proposed via human-centric contextual interaction-driven evidential vision-language fusion in VCPS. Specifically, a vision-language model-based architecture is first modified in temporal dimension to represent the visual human-centric contextual interactions, while a vision-language consistency loss is designed to mitigate the gap between visual and textual representations. Then, an evidence-based learning method is introduced to jointly conduct the classification and uncertainty estimation for driver states. Furthermore, to model the human-centric contextual interactions towards the evidence-based paradigm comprehensively, Dempster-Shafer theory-based combination rule is introduced to fuse the visual and textual representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public benchmarks, where the superiority of TDSP is demonstrated compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The superior performance of TDSP to recognize dangerous states are 85.41% and 83.12% in terms of accuracy and F1 score, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 4.68% and 3.99%. Moreover, we validate the reliability of TDSP against the noisy data for VCPS. The code will be public at https://github.com/w64228013/TDSP.},

Initially, a generic performance constraint strategy is proposed by integrating an improved global performance function, which eliminates the subpar reconfigurability present in the specific performance function-based global constraint schemes. By embedding the saturation compensation function, a feedback mechanism between the saturation constraint and performance constraint is established, instead of cutting off the analysis separately, by giving the constraint boundaries the flexibility to expand and contract. Subsequently, the inherently unmodeled dynamics and uncertainties of the controlled vehicle are reconstructed online by interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems. By integrating the predefined-time differentiator into the recursive design framework, an adaptive fuzzy predefined-time formation protocol is developed to provide a streamlined solution for adjusting the settling time and facilitates engineering implementation. The stability analysis rigorously proves that all the variables are practical predefined-time bounded. The illustrative results verify the feasibility and functionality of the developed formation control strategy.},

  abstract     = {Detecting vulnerable road users (VRUs) at night presents significant challenges. Numerous methods rely heavily on annotations, yet the low visibility of nighttime images poses difficulties for labeling. To obviate the need for nighttime annotations, unsupervised domain adaptation manifests as a viable solution. However, existing approaches primarily focus on semantic-level domain gaps, often overlooking pixel-level discrepancies caused by inherent degradations in the nighttime domain. These degradations can impair machine vision and limit detection performance. In this paper, we propose TripleA, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework tailored for nighttime VRU detection. TripleA includes triple alignment. First, it aligns daytime and nighttime images to generate synthetic nighttime images, which are then enhanced for illumination and noise. To remove noise, we introduce an illumination difference-aware denoising network, incorporating a novel pseudo-supervised attention to achieve pixel-wise noise distribution alignment. This alignment is driven by pseudo-ground truth generated through a carefully designed exchange-recombination strategy, facilitating self-supervised training of the denoising network. Additionally, we introduce degradation alignment to ensure domain-invariant degradation encoding, which enhances the network’s robustness for real-world nighttime images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for nighttime VRU detection, all without the need for annotated nighttime data.},

Given the rapid and frequent changes in the topology of VANET networks due to the highspeed movement of vehicles, most VANET applications adopt broadcast communication, except for a few employing unicast communication. However, traditional task offloading models struggle to support broadcast applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a VANET broadcast task model to offload tasks from On-Board Units (OBUs) to Road-Side Units (RSUs) for the first time. To meet the requirement of low latency, an efficient polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is further proposed. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the algorithm, with all instances being solved in less than 6ms, which significantly surpasses the performance of existing solvers. Moreover, the solutions obtained from the algorithm exhibit gaps below 1%, indicating their high acceptability and applicability in practical VANET applications. Furthermore, extensive numerical experiments provide valuable insights into the practical implementation of task offloading, suggesting an appropriate ratio of 6 between the number of OBUs and RSUs.},

A co-simulation platform integrating Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and Webots was developed to serve as the driving simulator. A real-world roundabout in Ann Arbor, Michigan was built in the co-simulation platform as the study area, and merging scenarios were investigated. 36 participants were recruited and asked to navigate the roundabout under three aggressiveness levels (low, medium, and high) and three collision-warning designs (no-warning, 1-second-in-advance warnings, and 2-second-in-advance warnings). Experiment results indicate that advanced warnings can significantly enhance safety by minimizing potential risks compared to scenarios without warnings. Earlier warnings enable smoother driver responses and reduce abrupt decelerations. In addition, a personalized intent prediction model was developed to predict drivers’ stop-or-go decisions when the warning was displayed. Among all tested machine learning models, the XGBoost model achieves the highest overall prediction accuracy.},

It is crucial to develop an explainable and trustworthy decision-making system for autonomous vehicles interacting with pedestrians. Previous studies often used traditional game theory to describe interactions for its interpretability. However, it assumes complete human rationality and unlimited reasoning abilities, which is unrealistic. To solve this limitation and improve model accuracy, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates the partially observable markov decision process with behavioral game theory to dynamically model AV-pedestrian interactions at the unsignalized intersection. Both the AV and the pedestrian are modeled as dynamic-belief-induced quantal cognitive hierarchy (DB-QCH) models, considering human reasoning limitations and bounded rationality in the decision-making process. In addition, a dynamic belief updating mechanism allows the AV to update its understanding of the opponent’s rationality degree in real-time based on observed behaviors and adapt its strategies accordingly. The analysis results indicate that our models effectively simulate vehicle-pedestrian interactions and our proposed AV decision-making approach performs well in safety, efficiency, and smoothness. It captures key patterns of the driving behavior operated by real human drivers in virtual reality(VR) experiments and even achieves more comfortable navigation compared to our previous VR experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Coordination at unsignalized intersections has attracted increasing attention in recent years, which aims at improving the efficiency of intersection operations, while eliminating conflicts and deadlocks for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). This paper addresses the challenging issue of systematically optimizing CAV trajectories, tackling the high computational cost for finding a good solution, especially as the number of lanes and CAVs increases. To do so, a novel systematic optimal trajectory planning model is designed to efficiently guide CAVs through intersections without conflicts and deadlocks. To tackle the computational hurdles and enable real-time applications, based on the model, we develop a Petri net-aided Iterative Trajectory Optimization (P-ITO) solution algorithm. Leveraging the unique characteristics of the problem, this algorithm first designs a Petri net-based controller for conflict and deadlock avoidance so that initial feasible solutions are generated. Then, refinement is made on the initial feasible solutions to obtain an optimal or near optimal solution by designing an iterative process. This algorithm effectively ensures solution feasibility and enhances computing efficiency by searching for an optimal solution in the feasible region. Numerical experiments for intersections with bidirectional six-lane configurations illustrate the efficacy of our model in facilitating the safe and efficient passage of all CAVs while mitigating the risk of deadlocks. The P-ITO algorithm significantly outperforms the commercial solvers in both solution quality and computational time. Furthermore, our method is versatile, applicable to diverse intersection scenarios, and capable of maintaining high computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Automatic road extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images has greatly facilitated the applications of high-precision road mapping in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. However, challenges such as occlusions from buildings, trees, and complex road shapes bring great difficulties to precise road extraction. Also, existing methods often overlook the integrity of road direction and edge, leading to unsatisfactory extraction results. To alleviate the issue, this paper has presented a direction and edge co-awareness network (DENet). Firstly, the road edge detector (RED) is introduced to extract coarse road edges with abundant directional information. By leveraging the edge enhancement blocks, the edge structures of road can be efficiently refined, achieving the extraction of intricate narrow and elongated road shapes. Secondly, we incorporate the directional spatial attention (DSA) mechanism within the dual encoders and decoders to promote the extraction and fusion of road directional information and elongated features from different orientations, thus greatly mitigating the road occlusion issue. Finally, to fully interlace potential road information, a grouped local-global feature fusion (GLFF) is specifically designed to exchange multi-scale semantic information across different channels, simultaneously emphasizing road features and suppressing irrelevant background features. Numerous experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DENet for road extraction, achieving F1 scores of 78.51% on the CHN6-CUG dataset, 79.35% on the Massachusetts road dataset, and 77.90% on the GF2-FC dataset, outperforming several existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/gwy103/DENet.},

  abstract     = {Coplanar array capacitance imaging technology (CACT) is a non-destructive testing (NDT) method with rapid visual recognition. However, there is little research on its application for identifying internal distress in asphalt materials. This study proposes a CACT using a novel coplanar array capacitance sensor (CACS) to identify internal distress in asphalt materials. Firstly, the sensitivity field distributions of electrode pairs and CACS are established, and the optimal sensitivity layer is determined. In addition, the normalized capacitance of electrode pairs and the contribution rate required for distress imaging are analyzed. Finally, the distress images of asphalt materials are reconstructed. The relative depth, shape feature, and type of internal distress are determined. It is found that Layer 14 is the optimal sensitivity layer. Circular distress exhibits the highest normalized capacitance values, followed by square distress and triangle distress. The opposing electrode pairs demonstrate the greatest contribution to distress imaging. The redder the image, the deeper the distress, demonstrating that CACT can determine the relative depth of internal distress. The square distress image has the highest accuracy, followed by circular distress and triangle distress. The reconstructed images show that moisture distress in asphalt mixtures is reconstructed with the highest accuracy, followed by moisture distress in asphalt mastics, void distress in asphalt mastics, and void distress in asphalt mixtures.},

  abstract     = {Pavement distress, manifested as cracks, potholes, and rutting, significantly compromises road integrity and poses risks to drivers. Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network (GNN) model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by the proposed STGAN model. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.},

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has recently shown significant potential in addressing complex traffic dynamics, but the intricacies of partial observability and coordination in decentralized environments still remain key challenges in formulating scalable and efficient control strategies. To address these challenges, we present CoordLight, a MARL-based framework designed to improve intra-neighborhood traffic by enhancing decision-making at individual junctions (agents), as well as coordination with neighboring agents, thereby scaling up to network-level traffic optimization. Specifically, we introduce the Queue Dynamic State Encoding (QDSE), a novel state representation based on vehicle queuing models, which strengthens the agents’ capability to analyze, predict, and respond to local traffic dynamics. We further propose an advanced MARL algorithm, named Neighbor-aware Policy Optimization (NAPO). It integrates an attention mechanism that discerns the state and action dependencies among adjacent agents, aiming to facilitate more coordinated decision-making, and to improve policy learning updates through robust advantage calculation. This enables agents to identify and prioritize crucial interactions with influential neighbors, thus enhancing the targeted coordination and collaboration among agents. Through comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods over three real-world traffic datasets composed of up to 196 intersections, we empirically show that CoordLight consistently exhibits superior performance across diverse traffic networks with varying traffic flows.},

  abstract     = {Unsafe lane change behaviors have negative impacts on traffic safety. Identifying these risky patterns can help drivers make safe lane change decisions. In this paper, we develop a two-dimensional indicator based on field theory to evaluate lane change risks on the highway. The driving risk field is constructed by integrating the individual and interaction features of the source vehicle and the interacting vehicle. Parameter calibration with highD trajectory data allows the risk field forces to objectively reflect the risk perception. An adaptive optimization algorithm with cumulative gradient bias correction is introduced for parameter calibration. The enhanced first-order and second-order momentum, along with the long-term memory, are developed to adaptively adjust the learning rate and prune abnormal gradients. A Gaussian mixture model is applied to cluster the calibrated two-dimensional risk indicators, generating the F-F diagram. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed driving risk field model and the gradient-based algorithm. Confidence region estimation of the lane change risk distribution further validate the objectivity and interpretability of the F-F diagram. The 95% confidence level offers valuable insights for proactive traffic safety management, and lays a foundation for developing personalized lane change strategies. In the future, the F-F diagram could be integrated into lane change advisory systems or advanced driving assistance systems, helping drivers make informed lane change decisions.},

To address these challenges, we present MT-DyNN, a Multi-Teacher knowledge-distilled Dynamic Neural Network framework for instance-adaptive detection, optimizing detection accuracy and inference cost in autonomous driving. The framework’s student network comprises a customizable multi-branch residual detection network and a lightweight policy network. The former efficiently extracts multi-scale features in parallel without altering receptive fields, while the latter, depending on curriculum learning, captures task-relevant features and dynamically generates routing vectors to guide the activation or deactivation of residual blocks according to image instance complexity. The framework’s teacher network employs a soft-voting strategy to consolidate knowledge from multiple pre-trained teacher models, providing consistent guidance to the student. Within this distillation paradigm, the policy network’s routing search space is gradually refined, and the policy and detection networks are jointly fine-tuned to optimize the alignment between routing decisions and feature extraction. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that compared to early exiting and stochastic depth methods, MT-DyNN achieves higher accuracy at the same inference cost and reduces the cost by 50% and 59% at comparable accuracy levels. The generated routing maintains channel sparsity across diverse scenarios.},

First, allowing for the AGV kinematics and the setpoint tracking objective, we design a reduced-order descriptor sliding mode observer to synchronously reconstruct the tracking error states as well as physical faults. Then, we develop an event-triggered communication scheme in the control center side, leading to the tolerant controller by virtue of reconstructed tracking error dynamics with an improved transmission efficiency. In addition, we perform the strict theoretical guarantee of both estimation stability and tracking stability, based on which, the estimator and controller gains in conjunction with event trigger parameters are codesigned.

However, this approach faces two limitations when applied to planning for autonomous vehicles: chaotic branch expansion in the belief tree reduces computational efficiency, and particle deprivation hinders the accurate estimation of the dynamic intentions of surrounding vehicles. To this end, an intention-guided Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with a Heuristic-based Double Progressive Widening (POMCP-HDPW) approach is proposed to facilitate efficient decision-making for autonomous vehicles. We propose an enhance resampling method of PF that accounts for the driving intentions of surrounding vehicles, maintaining particle diversity and thereby improving estimation accuracy. Additionally, we prune the action and observation spaces by leveraging human driving experience and collision risk assessment, enabling the expansion and exploration of high-value belief nodes and preventing chaotic expansion. Three different methods are employed to drive the motion of surrounding vehicles, validating the robustness of the proposed model: intelligent driving model control, offline driving using the exiD trajectories, and driver-in-the-loop validation. Notably, experimental results on the exiD dataset demonstrate a success rate of 96.88% in off-ramp scenarios.},

Firstly, a collision risk assessment model is established using Closest Point of Approach and Quaternion Ship Domain to guide USVs to take timely and effective collision avoidance actions. Secondly, we adopt Deep Recurrent Q-Network algorithm to overcome the challenges posed by multi-ship scenarios, and the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework is employed in it to accurately establish multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance model. Moreover, to introduce a novel collaborative collision avoidance mechanism for multiple ships, we improved the network update mechanism of DRQN: by synergistically integrating the local Q value of each agent to acquire the multi-agent joint action Q value and the network parameters are subsequently updated based on the calculated global loss. Finally, we designed various experiments in a real water to validate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach. The experimental results indicate that this approach has the capacity to enable the ships to make effective collision avoidance actions in accordance with navigation practices and good seamanship. Comparative analysis with Deep Q-Network (DQN), DDQN, Dueling DQN, and Artificial Potential Field underscores the superior safety and rationality of the proposed approach in collision avoidance.

The scarcity of real paired training data complicates single-image rain removal tasks, prompting an increasing interest in unsupervised methods capable of handling real-world rainy images without paired data. At present, most unsupervised rain removal methods are based on the CycleGAN framework; however, the combination of this framework and transformer is not satisfactory owing to most Transformers’ insufficient ability to model real rain features with global inhomogeneous distributions, which prevents them from being fully applicable to unsupervised tasks. This study devised an unsupervised rain removal network based on CycleGAN and the DerainFormer transformer. First, a deformable sparse attention mechanism was developed to improve the Transformer’s suitability for unsupervised tasks in CycleGAN architectures. Subsequently, a two-stage alternating transformer structure was designed to enhance its global non-uniform modeling capabilities for real rain images, In addition, a dual-channel parallel feed-forward network was used to establish the correlation between multiscale rain stripes. Finally, since rain removal is considered a decomposition task, a rain layer unsupervised training method for joint positional contrastive learning was proposed to separate the rain streaks effectively. We conducted several experiments on different real and synthetic rain datasets and the results confirmed that our unsupervised rain removal method performed well.

  abstract     = {In recent years, vehicular networks have experienced substantial growth, transforming the landscape of the transportation industry. In particular, the issue of computing task offloading in vehicular networks is critically important. The two key considerations are offloading task delay and energy consumption. Thus, a multiple access (MA) scheme is necessary in vehicular networks to facilitate more efficient computation task offloading. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is recognized as a promising candidate for multiple access in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond networks due to its potential to improve overall spectrum efficiency through superposition coding. Moreover, mobile edge computing (MEC) can minimize computation task delay and energy consumption by bringing computational resources closer to vehicles. Therefore, this paper examines the potential of employing mobile edge computing (MEC) with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in vehicular networks to reduce overall computation offloading task delay and energy consumption. Specifically, computation models for task delay and energy consumption are presented. Additionally, considering universal frequency reuse, we analyze interference-limited scenarios and allow interference from the transmissions of other vehicles and roadside units. The optimization problems for delay and energy are formulated based on the described models. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, they are solved numerically using the Python programming language. Furthermore, analytical expressions for outage probability are provided to evaluate the typical vehicle’s outage performance. Simulation results demonstrate the delay and energy performance of the MEC-NOMA-enabled vehicular networks compared to their OMA-based counterparts. The results indicate that MEC-NOMA achieves lower delay, reduced energy consumption, and improved outage performance compared to OMA-based vehicular networks.},

  abstract     = {In the backdrop of an increasingly pressing need for effective urban and highway transportation systems, this work explores the synergy between model-based and learning-based strategies to enhance traffic flow management by use of an innovative approach to the problem of ramp metering control that embeds Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques within the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control problem is formulated as an RL task by crafting a suitable stage cost function that is representative of the traffic conditions, variability in the control action, and violations of the constraint on the maximum number of vehicles in queue. An MPC-based RL approach, which leverages the MPC optimal problem as a function approximation for the RL algorithm, is proposed to learn to efficiently control an on-ramp and satisfy its constraints despite uncertainties in the system model and variable demands. Simulations are performed on a benchmark small-scale highway network to compare the proposed methodology against other state-of-the-art control approaches. Results show that, starting from an MPC controller that has an imprecise model and is poorly tuned, the proposed methodology is able to effectively learn to improve the control policy such that congestion in the network is reduced and constraints are satisfied, yielding an improved performance that is superior to the other controllers.},

  abstract     = {Virtual coupling technology has been widely concerned due to its potential in improving the operational efficiency of rail transit. To mitigate the effects of measurement error and actuation fault on coordinated train operation, this paper proposes a distributed fault-tolerant control strategy for the virtual coupling train system by the integration of moving horizon estimation (MHE) and model predictive control (MPC). Considering potential faults for virtually coupled trains during operation, a faulty model is developed to capture measurement errors and loss of actuator effectiveness. A fault-tolerant control strategy is designed that consists of two modules, i.e., fault estimation and fault-tolerant control. The MHE method is employed in the fault estimation module to estimate faults by solving a local quadratic optimization problem based on historical data. In the fault-tolerant control module, a reconfigured train tracking control problem is constructed under the MPC framework on the premise of real-time estimation. An accelerated alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm is further designed to embed with the fault-tolerant model predictive controller to calculate the control commands in a distributed manner. Numerical experiments are conducted and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {The non-nominal troposphere induced by climate extremes poses a threat to the precision approach and landing of the civil aircraft in ground-based augmentation system (GBAS). However, there is currently no effective non-nominal troposphere monitoring method at both GBAS stations and aircrafts, which increases the integrity risk. This study proposes a novel approach for simultaneously modelling and monitoring ground station and aircraft non-nominal troposphere using precision point positioning (PPP) technology based on a regional reference network. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and meteorological data from the Hong Kong satellite positioning reference station network and numerical weather models from the European centre for medium-range weather forecasts are processed in all the year of 2017. A tropospheric correction (TC) model is used to correct station height-induced biases in zenith total delay (ZTD) obtained from PPP. By comparing the performance of 6 typical spatial interpolation algorithms in tropospheric delay interpolating, the universal Kriging algorithm is found to be the most suitable one which achieves a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.24 mm. The non-nominal troposphere is monitored using the constructed corrected ZTD map using universal Kriging method. A non-nominal troposphere up to 50 mm is observed, which can affect the integrity of the air navigation. Furthermore, the relationship between non-nominal troposphere and the rainfall is investigated. The study integrates widely distributed GNSS and meteorological data into a seamless non-nominal tropospheric monitoring service, enhancing the integrity of GBAS in air transportation.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Learning-Enhanced Adaptive Decision-Making (LEAD) framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focusing on dynamic merging scenarios. To capture the competitive and strategic nature of vehicle interactions, we develop an interaction behavior model based on non-cooperative game theory. The behavior is modeled as a dynamic game, where each vehicle optimizes its actions using a multifactorial reward function. To optimize the behavior model parameters, maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is employed to acquire optimal matching parameters. Additionally, a behavioral decision-making framework LEAD adapted to dynamic environments is proposed. By establishing a mapping between environmental variables and behavior model parameters, it enables parameters online learning and recognition, and achieves interactive behavior probabilities of AVs. Quantitative analysis employing naturalistic driving datasets (highD and exiD) and real-vehicle test data validates LEAD’s high consistency with human decision-making. In 188 tested interaction scenarios, the average human-like similarity rate is 81.73%, with a notable 83.12% in the highD dataset. Furthermore, in 145 dynamic interactions, LEAD matches human decisions at 77.12%, with 6913 consistence instances. Moreover, in real-vehicle tests, a 72.73% similarity with 0% safety violations is obtained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our LEAD framework in enabling AVs to make informed, adaptive behavior decisions in interactive environments.},

This exponential growth of IoV technology has introduced significant security and privacy issues, which pose potential threats to different types of attacks and cause different threats to the normal operation of vehicles. To prevent intelligent vehicle accidents and identify malicious attacks within IoV networks, various researchers have focused on machine learning (ML)-based methods to detect attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are a prominent solution for cyber attacks in IoV using ensemble learning. To achieve higher accuracy and detection rate, designing an improved detection framework using ensemble learning is a challenging task. The design of an ensemble-based IDS depends on two main challenges: selecting base classifiers and their combination methods. Therefore, in this study, we propose a hybrid ML model to detect various attacks in IoV. We have used different ML algorithms to develop an enhanced algorithm that can efficiently detect attacks in IoV networks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we have used two well-known datasets, (CIC-IDS2017) and (UNSW-NB15). The proposed algorithm shows outstanding performance from the performance results, with an average attack detection accuracy of 99.75% and 100% and an F1 score of 99.74% and 100%, respectively, for both datasets. Further performance scores, that is, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics, validate the exceptional effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {The development of autonomous driving has created new demands for real-time road surveillance. Portable, high-precision, low-power road infrastructure is needed to enable real-time communication of collected vehicle data with passing vehicles. Vehicle recognition and speed estimation are key challenges in this context. We propose a traffic detection device using dual-axis magneto-impedance (MI) sensors installed roadside to detect vehicles in adjacent lanes. Experiments were conducted by driving various vehicle types under a variety of complex road and traffic conditions, analyzing how different measurement conditions and driving patterns affect magnetic signatures. We identified the magnetic signatures most strongly correlated with vehicle recognition and speed estimation. We developed corresponding solutions to address issues as repeated misrecognition and the influence of non-adjacent lanes, which are frequently highlighted in related works. Ultimately, we achieved an overall recognition accuracy of 96.66% in random measurements on complex traffic conditions, reducing recognition errors related to these issues to 3.22%. Additionally, we proposed two speed estimation methods: the time-domain magnetic signature differential method and the dominant frequency method, utilizing multiple sensor nodes and a single node, respectively. Both speed estimation methods were analyzed and compared through controlled experiments, and their performance was evaluated in random measurement experiments. Both methods showed similar estimation accuracy on straight roads, with 100% and 98.8% of results falling within a ±5 km/h error range, respectively. In low-speed curved sections where multiple sensor nodes could not be deployed, we achieved speed estimation using a single sensor by analyzing frequency-domain signals. Finally, under complex traffic conditions, the device demonstrated a minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of only 2.09 km/h for speed estimation.},

Invisible watermarking, which ensures reliable information traceability without compromising carrier quality, holds significant potential for TCPS. However, achieving high robustness in the real world while maintaining imperceptibility is a challenge. To address this, we propose DGWW (Dual-discriminator GAN-based WaveFusion Watermarking), a novel invisible watermarking method that balances robustness and imperceptibility. The GAN-based approach is well suited for TCPS, as it enables adaptive watermark embedding aligned with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of transportation data, effectively handling diverse noise conditions and data types. DGWW integrates a WaveFusion Encoding Module, a Dual-Focus Discriminator, and a contrastive learning-based optimization strategy to enhance watermark embedding without degrading robustness. These components leverage multi-frequency information, assess local and global impacts on image quality, and guide model optimization. Experimental results show that DGWW outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and robustness under various noise conditions, offering a robust and scalable solution for image watermarking in TCPS environments. By maintaining data usability and strong resistance to noise attacks, DGWW advances digital watermarking in intelligent transportation systems.},

A Chi-squared residual-based ARAIM significantly differing from the traditional solution separation (SS) based ARAIM in principle is proposed for air transportation in this work. The proposed ARAIM expresses the integrity risk of each hypothesis as the product of the cumulative distribution functions of two Chi-squared distributions and the hypothesis occurrence probability. Based on the equivalence between the normalized solution separation and the residual Chi-square separation, an upper bound in terms of the worst Chi-squared distribution noncentrality parameter induced by GNSS faults is established for the integrity risk of each hypothesis. The log-concavity of the cumulative distribution function of Chi-squared distribution ensures that the protection level computation of the proposed ARAIM is theoretically convergent and conservative.

Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly understand the realistic V2V channel propagation conditions to develop suitable V2V communication systems and standards. However, due to high costs, most existing V2V studies focus on characterizing the vehicular channel theoretically and comparing it with simulation data or studying the empirical V2V channel in a specific scenario. In this work, we investigate the time variability of the received signal based on experimental data collected in an extensive measurement campaign at 5.9 GHz in a large set of propagation environments: urban-high traffic density, urban-low traffic density, suburban, highway, and rural environments. The time-variability of the received signal is characterized by time and frequency. The relationship between coherence time and the terminal velocity, coherence time and transmitter-receiver separation distance, and the relationship between Doppler spread and both effective velocity and separation distance, have been investigated. Furthermore, the correlation between coherence time and separation distance and effective velocity was investigated, as well as the correlation between Doppler spread and separation distance and effective velocity. The results provide a deeper understanding of the temporal variability of the channel and how it is influenced by factors such as traffic density, unique/multiple driving directions, terminal speed, separation distance, characteristics of the propagation environment, and visibility conditions. This knowledge is crucial for developing vehicular communication systems and can be applied to design strategies that reduce temporal variability in received signals.},

  abstract     = {RGB-Thermal semantic segmentation provides reliable support for intelligent traffic perception systems, such as road safety monitoring and autonomous driving perception, by fusing visible and thermal imaging modalities under adverse weather conditions and low-light environments at night. However, the scarcity of multimodal data and the high cost of annotations severely limit the generalization capability of traditional models. To address the core demands of urban scene segmentation, we propose a Hierarchical Matching Guided Feature Enhancement Network (HMFENet) tailored for few-shot learning. It tackles two major challenges: 1) scale diversity of traffic objects (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) under limited labeled data, which significantly degrades segmentation accuracy; 2) information redundancy across multimodal features, which undermines the enhancement effect of the thermal modality on traffic object segmentation. HMFENet employs a hierarchical dense matching mechanism to establish multi-scale and multi-level feature alignment between query images and support samples. Additionally, it incorporates a mutual information minimization constraint to optimize cross-modal complementarity, thereby enhancing segmentation robustness in complex urban scenes. Experiments on the urban scene dataset, Tokyo Multi-Spectral-4i demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results: an improvement of 5.9% and 9.4% in mean mIoU for critical traffic objects under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively, compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the complementary effect of the thermal modality contributes to a 2.5% improvement under the 1-shot setting. The proposed method provides a feasible solution for deploying multimodal traffic perception systems with low annotation costs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Zhou-xy99/HMFENet.},

However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU$\dag$ method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate QDCNN’s —key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time.

Due to the lack of channel characteristics for all-metal immersed tunnel environments, this paper conducts an in-depth study on channel measurement, channel modeling, and optimization of ETC systems within all-metal immersed tunnels. Using a channel measurement system based on the universal software radio peripheral (USRP), this study extracts multidimensional channel characteristic parameters from the measured data, such as path loss (PL), shadow fading (SF), K-factor (KF), root mean square delay spread (RMS DS), power angular spectrum (PAS), and azimuth angle spread (ASA). The unique characteristics of the all-metal tunnel are analyzed in comparison to tunnels made of other materials. To develop a comprehensive all-metal immersed tunnel channel model meeting the quasi-deterministic radio channel generator (QuaDRiGa) requirements, we employed ray tracing (RT) methods to supplement angle domain parameters. Subsequently, we used this channel model to aid in the design and optimization of ETC systems, addressing transaction failures and erroneous transactions within all-metal immersed tunnels by establishing optimization targets and constraints, resulting in optimal height, tilt angle, transmission power, and beamforming. The findings of this research not only enrich the channel scenarios in QuaDRiGa but also provide practical guidance for improving the performance of ETC systems.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has accelerated the adoption of Cloud and Edge Computing. The advent of sixth-generation mobile communication technology (6G) further facilitates the deployment of Cloud-Edge collaborative computing in large-scale Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Effective ITS must efficiently handle both latency-sensitive tasks (e.g., obstacle detection, traffic signal recognition) and computationally intensive tasks (e.g., path optimization, traffic flow prediction). However, existing Cloud-Edge collaborative frameworks struggle to accurately classify diverse workloads and provide efficient low-latency processing, leading to energy inefficiencies and task failures. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Deep Learning-based Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework (CECF) designed to optimize energy conservation in Cloud and Edge environments. CECF employs a DNN-based classifier to categorize workloads for processing in the Cloud or Edge.

To enhance scheduling efficiency for highly variable Cloud tasks, DSGA incorporates a novel self-adaptive mutation algorithm and a random point fixed distance crossover method. Extensive evaluations using real-world workload traces demonstrate that CECF achieves up to a 8.5% improvement in system reliability and reduces energy consumption by 35.88% compared to baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {In the context of autonomous driving, acquiring the trajectories of surrounding vehicles in advance by autonomous vehicles is a crucial factor in ensuring high-level road safety. While trajectory prediction methods based on deep learning have achieved promising results, these data-driven models lack interpretability and transparency, making their reliable use a significant challenge. In this paper, firstly, an intention-aware spatial-temporal attention network-based trajectory prediction model is constructed, which considers the coupling of driving intention and the interaction with surrounding vehicles, extracts important feature information of vehicles in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Secondly, a vehicle trajectory prediction method via the integration of data-driven and knowledge-guided is proposed, considering both hard and soft constraints. A hard constraint of vehicle kinematics is incorporated into the intention-aware spatial-temporal attention network prediction model to generate physically feasible predicted trajectories and to make this part of the network structure have a human-understandable physical meaning. In addition, by leveraging knowledge related to traffic rules, an auxiliary loss function based on knowledge constraint penalties is designed as a soft constraint to optimize the training of the model and improve the interpretability of the training process. Finally, the proposed model is experimentally evaluated on the datasets and the prediction results are analyzed in terms of reliability and accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that knowledge guidance effectively enhance the reliability and interpretability of the prediction, and improve the accuracy of long-term trajectory prediction.},

  abstract     = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for signal control, and several studies attempt to apply RL to network-wide signal control problems. Most existing methods for network-wide signal controls simply apply the pretrained model independently to the network or simply expand the observation range for the neighbors. While several recent studies have proposed cooperative signal control models using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches, they have not considered the transferability of the policy. This issue becomes more critical in treating a multi-agent signal control problem, since there exist innumerable possibilities of data distributions for the demand patterns. Hence, this research aims to develop a transferable and cooperative multi-agent traffic signal control model. As the key idea, we propose a decentralized and communication-based MARL approach that considers the spatial correlation of traffic dynamics in the model design and employs a graph representation for the state. Three experiments in simulated environments of the Gangnam district in Seoul, South Korea are conducted to 1) validate the model, 2) assess the policy’s transferability, and 3) evaluate the efficiency of the multi-agent cooperation. The experimental results show that the proposed model obtains a transferable policy so that it adapts to the unexperienced demand scenario. In addition, it is concluded that the joint action of the proposed RL model cooperatively rebalances the traffic demands so that it improves the efficiency of the network-wide signal controls.},

Nonetheless, it is still impeded by sparse bird’s-eye view (BEV) representation and unfavorable temporal context across frames, resulting in a sub-optimal solution to decision-making and vehicle navigation. In this work, we propose a novel Difference-guide Motion Prediction for vision-centric autonomous driving, that is DMP, where it integrates BEV map refinement with spatial-temporal relation modeling in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, a bidirectional view projection strategy is introduced for the complementary BEV feature generation via depth-consistency correction. To promote spatiotemporal context aggregation, we design a difference-guided motion approach by offset approximation to align motion-aware cues between adjacent frames, and a dual-stream pyramid module is further developed for historical information fusion and future instance segmentation during specific durations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes dataset demonstrate that it outperforms the baselines by a remarkable margin and delivers competitive motion prediction across diverse scenarios and range settings, suggesting its effectiveness and superiority.

  abstract     = {In this work, we address the problem of charging coordination between electric trucks and charging stations. The problem arises from the tension between the trucks’ nontrivial charging times and the stations’ limited charging facilities. Our goal is to reduce the trucks’ waiting times at the stations while minimizing individual trucks’ operational costs. We propose a distributed coordination framework that relies on computation and communication between the stations and the trucks, and handles uncertainties in travel times and energy consumption. Within the framework, the stations assign a limited number of charging ports to trucks according to the first-come, first-served rule. In addition, each station constructs a waiting time forecast model based on its historical data and provides its estimated waiting times to trucks upon request. When approaching a station, a truck sends its arrival time and estimated arrival-time windows to the nearby station and the distant stations, respectively. The truck then receives the estimated waiting times from these stations in response, and updates its charging plan accordingly while accounting for travel uncertainties. We performed simulation studies for 1,000 trucks traversing the Swedish road network for 40 days, using realistic traffic data with travel uncertainties. The results show that our method reduces the average waiting time of the trucks by 46.1% compared to offline charging plans computed by the trucks without coordination and update, and by 33.8% compared to the coordination scheme assuming zero waiting times at distant stations.},

This paper presents a routing protocol for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), incorporating a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The proposed system utilizes BDI-based generative AI models, which rely on predefined logic and rules rather than machine learning to make real-time routing decisions. These decisions are based on data from vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, roadside units (RSUs) and IoT sensors, which integrate traffic density, congestion levels, collision avoidance and hazard detection. The system aims to optimize the accuracy of route selection, energy consumption, and communication latency. The simulation results, implemented using NS3 for real-world traffic scenarios, show improvements in route selection accuracy, collision avoidance, and energy efficiency compared to traditional routing methods. Specifically, the proposed system achieved a route selection accuracy of 95%, a collision avoidance rate of 95%, and reduced the communication latency to 105 ms, outperforming the other two methods. Furthermore, energy consumption was minimized and reduced to 85 J per route. These results highlight the potential of BDI-based routing with generative AI to improve ITS performance, particularly in real-time traffic management.},

  abstract     = {As the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) within electrified road networks (ERNs) continues to grow, the criticality of fast-charging stations (FCSs) to support this growth and alleviate range anxiety for EV users is increasingly evident. Due to the complex operating environment of FCSs, their reliable, safe operation faces significant challenges, from exposure to natural disasters, deliberate attacks, and technical failures. This leads to the need to analyze the vulnerability of FCSs within ERNs. This paper provides a mathematical framework to assess the vulnerability of the ERN to intentional attacks and identify critical FCSs within ERNs. We propose a System Optimal Dynamic Mixed Traffic Flow Assignment Model (SODTA) game-theoretical for an ERN where electric and fuel vehicles coexist. Building upon this model, an attacker-defender (AD) framework is established for assessing the vulnerability of FCSs within the ERN. We transform this AD problem into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) one to solve it efficiently. Two indices are proposed to evaluate the vulnerability and the reallocation of charging loads within the ERN. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to conduct a vulnerability assessment of the ERN in North Carolina, USA. The key findings are as follows: 1) As the EV penetration increases, the studied ERN becomes more vulnerable to attacks. 2) With limited attack resources, mitigating performance losses over time is possible through charging load redistribution. 3) Variation in overall vulnerability levels with increasing attack resources reveals distinct patterns, ranging from mitigable to unmitigable vulnerability.},

  abstract     = {The development of intelligent transportation has generated many ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) tasks, which require sufficient communication and computation resources for task offloading and processing. Although mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a promising solution, its efficiency is subject to the limited knowledge and analysis capability on the physical networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT) empowered MEC framework to strengthen the MEC task offloading efficiency in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks. Our proposed DT is constructed through a hybrid data-driven and model-driven approach to capture the realistic transportation network features. Then, DT leverages the metric of time to collision to predict vehicular safety levels and estimates the corresponding URLLC task requirements of future time slots. The prediction results are further utilized to make decisions on the URLLC resource reservation. Different from conventional studies, we consider the influence of DT’s inaccurate predictions (i.e., the prediction with error) on the resource allocations. Specifically, the inaccurate DT prediction results are considered as uncertain constraints of the resource reservation problem. A robust parameter from the robust optimization is adopted to adjust the tradeoff between the problem uncertainty and solution optimality degree. Further, we leverage the optimized resource reservation results to construct the task offloading problem. The problem is decoupled into two sub-problems of channel resource allocation and computation resource allocation, respectively. And a two-stage matching algorithm is developed to solve each sub-problem based on the resource reservation constraints. Finally, realistic road information is mapped into DT for simulations. Simulation results validate the advantages of our proposed approach by comparing with existing schemes.},

The experts’ experience introduced in decision-making model could improve the engineering application ability of decisions. The research uses a pavement performance prediction model as the environment and applies reinforcement learning to optimize strategies in the decision model. Additionally, the model integrates multidimensional expert feedback into reward functions to better understand ambiguous decision rules.

At the second stage, to address specified-time constraints and gain the online optimization ability, a single-critic based enhanced learning rule is explored to generate an approximate optimal regulator that stabilizes error dynamics and minimizes value functions, wherein specified-time constraints can be handled by encoding inequality conditions as skilled barrier functions, and by making full use of historical data and current information, a finite-time learning mechanism driven by weight errors rather than Bellman errors is proposed to approximate the solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with faster decaying. The distinct merit is that an improved reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is formulated to prescribe an elliptical circumnavigation with assured time requirements and optimization behaviors, which can greatly outperform non-RL alternatives in maintaining the optimal performance index while exhibiting restriction handling ability via online learning. Lyapunov stability demonstrates that involved error variables are ultimately limited and resultant controller obeys optimality. The feasibility and values of presented algorithm are accessed by comparisons and simulations.},

  abstract     = {Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR) is a fine-grained classification task in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Recent works address VMMR through feature encoding schemes, part-based methods or attention modules. Despite their astounding results, these techniques concentrate on the high-level semantic features. This practice cripples the feature expressive ability of the networks as the granular traits of the vehicle distilled from the early convolution layers are not embedded into the final feature representations. In this work, by contrast, a Cross-Granularity (CG) module which is responsible for the integration of macroscopic and microscopic components is proposed. By incorporating the CG module into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the resultant network i.e. CGNet reinforces the feature extraction ability by amalgamating the feature maps from different scales to render a balanced mix between local contextual information and global semantic details. To validate the proposed framework, experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets. We report competitive performance on web-nature Comprehensive Cars, Stanford Cars, Car-FG3K and surveillance-nature Comprehensive Cars datasets with 98.3%, 95.4% 86.4% and 99.1% accuracies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the CGNet to pinpoint distinctive fine-grained details via the Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique and compare it against the baseline which learns on deep features alone. The generalization ability of the CG module on other CNNs is also examined and the results suggest a high compatibility between the two.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter-wave (mmW) automotive radar imaging technology shows significant promise in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Super-resolution imaging methods can be employed the limited aperture length of automotive radar to improve azimuth (angular) resolution. However, automotive radar images typically exhibit large dynamic range (LDR) and large scene (LS), leading to pay extensive computational complexity and storage demands when striving for higher image quality. To tackle this challenge, a fast lq sparsity-driven imaging method with adaptive-focusing framework (FLSD-AF) for mmWave automotive radar super-resolution imaging in this article. First, in AF framework, a detect-before-imaging (DBI) is proposed to make echo data to adaptive focused on potential target area (PTR), thereby reducing the dimension of the effective data to reduce computational complexity and storage demands. Second, a subspace-phase-compensation (SPC) is proposed to reduces storage demands of the measurement matrix by addressing the imaging model mismatch in near-field under LS. Finally, a fast lq sparsity-driven (FLSD) imaging method is proposed. It employs lq-norm nonconvex penalty function to address the biased problem to improve imaging quality under LDR, meanwhile the computational complexity of the matrix operation is greatly reduced by utilizing joint Kailath-Variant (K-V) formula and Gohberg-Semencul (G-S) factorization. In summary, the proposed FLSD-AF not only substantially enhances the imaging performance, but also significantly diminishes the storage demands and computational complexity under LDR and LS. The results of simulations and experimental data all verify the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {With the explosion of connected devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in the smart city, the challenge to meet the demands of urban computing is increasingly prominent. Recent advances in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications promote urban Internet-connected vehicles to become excellent candidates for computing tasks. However, due to the limited computing capacity of vehicles, conducting computation in the vehicular networks themselves is insufficient to satisfy the demands of smart city applications. Edge computing, which delivers computing tasks to edge servers (e.g., base stations, BSs, or roadside units, RSUs) with plenty of computing resources, could be a possible solution. However, the static deployment of edge servers may cause severe load unbalance among servers in both real-time communication and computation, thereby decreasing the system performance. This paper explores a two-hop vehicle-assisted edge computing network framework in which vehicles are able to offload the tasks beyond their capabilities to underloaded edge servers relaying via neighbor vehicles. According to the state of the time-varying vehicular environment and the dynamic traffic loads among RSUs, we formulate the task offloading, relay node selection, and resources allocations problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) aiming at maximizing the performance of the computation offloading capacity with the considerations of load balancing and latency constraints. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a DNN as Q action-value function approximator to solve this problem. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the system performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Hence, we are committed to exploring the use of EVs to achieve spatial and temporal energy supply redistribution via V2G and G2V. We propose a multi-type bidirectional power transfer network and minimize the system cost by determining facility siting and pricing, which can be modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. In lower-level, a transportation and power coupled network is constructed considering the bidirectional interaction between EVs and the grid. We propose a new user equilibrium to explain the equilibrium state under bidirectional interaction, construct the optimal power flow model under the equilibrium state, use variational inequality to solve the minimum travel cost, and obtain the locational marginal price by solving the Lagrange duality variable of the active power. In upper-level, we propose the government’s construction of multi-type charging facilities siting planning to minimize transportation system cost and facilities operation costs. For experimental analysis, we consider various interactive scenarios of EVs and the grid and use three comparative models to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that considering coupled network will effectively reduce the grid load and system cost. Notably, to provide more useful inspiration, we also have made a sensitivity analysis on the change of bidirectional transfer power and service price.},

  abstract     = {Due to the difficulties in data collection or data barriers, some crash types may not have sufficient data for analysis, i.e., data scarcity in task (DST). Furthermore, as in crash severity analysis, the number of serious injury or fatality crashes is usually much smaller than that of property damage or injury crashes, there exists class imbalance issue, i.e., data scarcity in class (DSC). To tackle the DST problem, as common crash severity knowledge may hide among cross-task crashes, cross-task crash severity analysis is proposed. Intuitively, by transferring the common crash severity knowledge from source task which contains sufficient crashes to assist the modelling in target task that suffers from DST problem, more effective target task crash severity model can be obtained. Meanwhile, to address the DSC issue, the cost-sensitive learning algorithm for unbiased modelling is adopted by which unequal cost values are assigned to the crashes with different severity levels. In this paper, we develop a cost-sensitive transfer graph convolutional network, where the advanced graph convolutional network is taken as the base learner to guarantee the effectiveness of crash severity analysis. The vehicle-pedestrian and vehicle-vehicle crash severity analysis in city of Seattle are taken as the target and source tasks, respectively. In comparison with eighteen state-of-the-art crash severity models, the proposed model can achieve at least 21.29%, 8.10% and 8.02% improvement in terms of overall summary score, Macro-F1 and Macro-Gmean, respectively. The significant contributing factors analysis also shows that the additional crash contributing factors can be identified, including not only common factors among cross-task data, but also new ground-truth factors of target task crash severity analysis.},

Despite their potential, practical challenges such as effective integration with existing systems and efficient optimization remain critical. This paper investigates the sum capacity enhancement of NOMA-enabled uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) communications in vehicular networks assisted IRS. In urban environments where direct links from UAV to vehicles are often obstructed by buildings or other obstacles, the IRS plays a critical role in improving signal quality by reflecting signals toward vehicles. We consider a downlink NOMA transmission scenario, where the UAV serves multiple ground vehicles, and signals are delivered through both direct and IRS-assisted links. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum capacity by simultaneously optimizing UAV power allocation and IRS passive beamforming while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference plus noise ratio requirement for each vehicle. To address the non-convex nature and reduce the complexity of the optimization, we first transform the original problem using the first-order Taylor expansion method. Then, we employ a two-step solution based on the fixed-point iteration method for passive beamforming at the IRS and standard convex optimization for UAV power allocation. The proposed solution is compared with a benchmark scheme with direct UAV-to-vehicle communication without IRS assistance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework converges quickly and significantly outperforms the benchmarks in terms of system capacity.},

For the latter, an efficient algorithm based on penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) and second order cone programming (SOCP) approaches is proposed.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a semantic SLAM methodology for autonomous driving, integrating panoramic camera and LiDAR fusion to address pose estimation inaccuracies and lack of semantic information in dynamic environments. On the LiDAR side, panoramic semantic segmentation results are projected onto point clouds and combined with clustering for instance segmentation, classifying points into unknown-motion landmarks, static landmarks, and ground points. Precise pose estimation is then achieved using purely static and semi-static landmarks. The visual component incorporates data augmentation and instance segmentation of front-view images, leveraging SuperPoint for feature extraction. 3D dynamic landmarks are projected onto segmentation results to generate dynamic-static masks, enabling the elimination of feature points within dynamic regions. A robust visual odometry system is implemented through the ORB-SLAM2 tracking framework, enhanced by SuperGlue feature association within a multi-level tracking mechanism. At the fusion level, a decision-layer fusion algorithm integrates both odometry sources. Furthermore, pose optimization is achieved through dual loop closure detection with inputs from both LiDAR and visual sources. The proposed system was validated using the CQU01-CQU04 datasets collected on a UGV, with high-precision GNSS serving as the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves mean of average error of estimated positions, standard deviation of estimated position errors, and position error at the trajectory end of 0.446m, 0.236m, and 0.775m, respectively. With loop closure enabled, the performance metrics showed enhancement to 0.320m, 0.181m, and 0.617m. This research demonstrates that our method improves localization accuracy while constructing semantic map comprising purely static elements.},

  abstract     = {In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle’s trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers’ decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue poses a serious threat to road safety. Although most vehicles are equipped with driver fatigue monitoring models, the performance of existing models is not satisfactory due to the complexity and unclear reliability of fatigue features. To address these issues, this study proposed a multi-layer adaptive driver fatigue monitoring (MADFM) model, based on the steering wheel signals obtained from 25 participants in a driving simulator. The steering wheel signals were sequentially processed through an adaptive window partitioning algorithm based on sample entropy, feature extraction, and an adaptive outlier point removal algorithm based on local outlier factor. Finally, a multi-scale adaptive feature selection (AFS) algorithm based on global-local correlation was applied to obtain the optimal feature set Do. AFS algorithm was then validated using a random forest model and compared with existing feature selection algorithms. The results showed that after adopting the AFS algorithm, the model’s fatigue monitoring accuracy reached 93.71%, which was 10.21% higher than the algorithm without using feature selection. Compared to four common feature selection algorithms, AFS algorithm demonstrated superior performance in terms of monitoring accuracy, precision, recall and interpretability. The interpretability analysis results revealed that steering wheel angle and lateral acceleration features were the most sensitive features affecting the accuracy of the fatigue monitoring model. This model could improve the monitoring performance of driver fatigue, prompting safer driving behaviors, and reducing traffic accidents risk.},

Data quality is crucial to intention prediction under a cooperative vehicle-infrastructure system, whereas the data collection of HDVs relies on the vehicle–infrastructure cooperative perception, which is inevitably exposed to perception errors. In this paper, a robust driving intention prediction framework based on multi-stage learning is proposed in mixed traffic under the vehicle–infrastructure cooperative perception situation. To address this issue, different information sources from vehicles and traffic are considered to derive the implied vehicle dynamic interaction relation and traffic flow context. A feature extraction module is developed to respectively capture the local and global features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for reducing the impact of noise, which ensures the prominent detailed and overall descriptions of driving intention can be comprehensively acquired. Then, the deep multi-scale technique and multi-layer perceptron network are introduced to further extract deep features, and improve the model adaptability by complementary feature learning mechanism and nonlinear mapping ability. Experiment results on a real-world dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in reducing the impact of poor data quality and accurately predicting driving intention.},

Most data-driven vehicle speed prediction is based on deep learning methods, which have poor generalization capabilities when predicting across working conditions. Based on this, this paper proposes a transfer learning method for vehicle speed prediction that improves across working conditions adaptability.

  abstract     = {In current Intelligent Transportation Systems, 4-dimensional (4D) millimeter-wave radar is gradually conquering more important roles. However, the rich multipath phenomena of radar waves can cause virtual images to be mistaken for actual targets. Most existing solutions aim to identify distinguishable features within a single signal frame to differentiate virtual targets from actual ones, but they fail to fully leverage temporal evolution information. Moreover, they are often limited to simple scenarios with low-order bounces and cannot handle extreme high-order bounce cases. To address this gap, in this paper we establish a research methodology based on topology and propagation graph theory, and propose a time-varying 4D trajectory-based physical target discrimination (TPTD) method. This method can handle multipath virtual images formed by arbitrary-order bounces. Its effectiveness and superiority over advanced methods have been qualitatively and quantitatively validated through traceable simulated and measured data. We also discuss in detail the scalability of the algorithm and its potential bottlenecks. The proposed method can be applied to fields such as precise radar sensing and channel modeling, laying the foundation for integrated sensing and communication and autonomous driving.},

This paper investigates asynchronous data fusion for lane-level vehicle tracking with randomly delayed measurements and inaccurate detections from millimeter wave (MMW) radars and magnetic sensors in tunnels, where vehicle tracking with single type of sensors can not meet the requirements of reliable and accurate lane-level tracking due to inaccurate radar detections at far distances, noisy radar detections in tunnel environment, and missed or false vehicle detections by magnetic sensors. A multisensor data association algorithm is first designed to assign the measurements of MMW radar and magnetic sensors to a particular vehicle. A multi-lane estimation model is then developed, which employs Bayesian weight mixture filtering to fuse MMW radar and magnetic sensor measurements and to estimate the lane in which a vehicle is located. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented in a real environment -the Xianfengding Tunnel located in Jiangxi Province, China. Experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the proposed method using real data. The proposed method and the collected data are further integrated to establish a real-time digital twin system aimed at supporting advanced traffic management.

  abstract     = {Estimating traffic demand, or origin-destination (OD) matrices, is crucial for transport studies and smart city development. The main objective is to calculate an OD matrix based on available sources (e.g. link traffic counts obtained from traffic sensors) to accurately reproduce field data. A significant complication when using information obtained from traffic sensors, is that such sensors are subject to considerable disruptions impacting data quality and reliability. Despite the extensive study of efficient OD estimation, there is a considerable gap in detecting faulty measurements and identifying faulty sensors within the estimation procedure. This work presents a novel methodology for OD matrix estimation in the presence of faulty measurements. The path-based cell transmission model (CTM) is employed to capture traffic network dynamics within a specified time window, linking link densities with per-path densities and path demand. For the purposes of this work, traffic networks that operate under free-flow conditions are considered and the problem is formulated in an optimisation framework with two distinct variations: 1) no explicit formulation of potential faulty sensors and 2) explicit modelling of potential faulty sensors. Following, a fault-adaptive algorithm is constructed that identifies, isolates and corrects faults to achieve robust demand estimation. The methodology is tested on two realistic literature networks and shows great potential in terms of OD matrix estimation in the presence of faulty measurements. Simulation results underpin the advantage of the proposed approach in terms of performance in estimating quantities of interest as well as identifying the faulty sensors and their fault characteristics.},

To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we introduce Hybrid pOlicy Path plannEr (HOPE). This novel solution integrates a reinforcement learning agent with Reeds-Shepp curves, enabling effective planning across diverse scenarios. HOPE guides the exploration of the reinforcement learning agent by applying an action mask mechanism and employs a transformer to integrate the perceived environmental information with the mask. To facilitate the training and evaluation of the proposed planner, we propose a criterion for categorizing the difficulty level of parking scenarios based on space and obstacle distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms typical rule-based algorithms and traditional reinforcement learning methods, showing higher planning success rates and generalization across various scenarios. We also conduct real-world experiments to verify the practicability of HOPE. The code for our solution is openly available on https://github.com/jiamiya/HOPE.},

Accurate prediction not only aids city managers in optimizing traffic operations but also empowers individuals to make informed travel decisions. However, achieving precise traffic flow predictions is challenging due to the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in traffic data. Recent advancements in Generative AI and deep learning have shown promise in addressing these challenges, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being commonly employed for extracting spatial and temporal features. Despite their effectiveness, CNNs are limited in fully capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies and are computationally intensive when stacked to address global dependencies, leading to slower convergence rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-WaveMLP, a globally aware spatiotemporal network model for traffic flow prediction. Leveraging Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP introduces the repeatable ST-WaveBlock structure, which is based on multilayer perceptron’s (MLPs). Each ST-WaveBlock includes two key modules: The Spatiotemporal Global Attention Component (SGAC), which captures global spatial and local temporal dependencies, and the Spatiotemporal Local Attention Component (SLAC), which captures local spatial and global temporal dependencies. This design ensures strong spatiotemporal representation learning, enabling effective modelling with only 2–4 stacked blocks. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering improved convergence and prediction accuracy. Compared to existing methods, Generative AI based ST-Wave MLP improves prediction accuracy by up to 9.57% and enhances convergence speed by up to 30.6%, making it a robust solution for traffic flow prediction in modern ITS empowered by Generative AI. When compared to the previous best models, the proposed model demonstrated training speed gains of 30.6%, 12%, and 28.6% on the TaxiBJ, TaxiJN, and TaxiGY datasets, respectively.},

Unlike classical communication scenarios, in vehicular communications the optimal resource allocation must be accomplished in a real-time manner, in order to maximally reduce the response delay. This presents a substantial challenge for current machine learning based intelligent resource optimization methods which may be sample inefficient, especially when the problem space becomes extremely huge. In this study, we develop a fast reinforcement learning (RL) framework for the real-time resource optimization of vehicular communications, whereby the transmitting power and the accessing frequency channels need to be jointly allocated. The main concept of our new method is that it incorporates a sample efficient structured exploration mechanism in the action space, which firstly ignores the local exploitation but focuses on a randomized global exploration. Thus, our exploration-first method, in contrast to classical exploitation-first RL, can reconstruct the coarse-grained global landscape of a huge Q-table from only the few samples. This learned prior knowledge would remarkably accelerate the convergence of subsequent incremental learning process, by concentrating on the identified attentional subspace of the Q-table. As demonstrated by numerical results, our new method would reduce the time complexity or the response delay by around 10 folds. As such, our fast RL method would have the great potential to such challenging optimization problems whereby the acquisition of massive training samples is time demanding, which hence provides the great promise to the emerging vehicular networks.},

However, complex environments not only increase the computational cost but also introduce multimodality in the agent’s future motions, presenting significant challenges for motion prediction. Therefore, we propose FSGA, a trajectory prediction framework that constructs a relationship graph between agents and lanes in future spacetime and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to analyze the interactions between these future spacetime agents and lanes. We employ a vectorized representation method to model the traffic scene as a graph. Through this vectorized scene representation, FSGA extracts spatio-temporal features from agents’ historical trajectories, including interactions between agents, and between agents and lanes. To reduce computational costs, a lane scoring mechanism is employed, allowing the model to focus only on the lanes that have a significant impact on the current agent’s motion. To address complexity and multimodality of future trajectories, we introduce a branching tree goal prediction structure that models multiple possible motion trends by representing waypoints and endpoints at different temporal stages. Based on these predicted goals, we construct a relationship graph that captures the associations between agents and lanes in future spacetime and obtains the interactions between agents and lanes, improving trajectory prediction accuracy.

Traditional surveillance methods employing RGB video footage for the monitoring of pedestrian movements have raised significant privacy issues, attributed to their capability to easily identify individuals. This paper shifts focus towards the utilization of 3D point cloud data as a less intrusive alternative for pedestrian monitoring, which inherently minimizes the risk of individual identification. Notwithstanding, traditional tracking methodologies frequently encounter difficulties in environments characterized by high pedestrian density, where occlusions caused by individuals obscuring one another from the sensors’ perspective are commonplace. This research introduces an advanced approach leveraging 3D point cloud data to address the challenges inherent in pedestrian tracking. A particular obstacle addressed is the frequent obstruction caused by pedestrians, who may be accompanied by objects such as baby strollers and/or luggage, thus complicating their detection and tracking when positioned behind others or in close proximity to the sensors. Such scenarios significantly undermine the efficacy of pedestrian segmentation and tracking, particularly in the context of Kalman-Filter-based methodologies. To mitigate these challenges, the proposed solution incorporates a method to spatially enhance the missing segments within the framework of Kalman-Filter-based multi-object tracking. The effectiveness of this approach has been rigorously assessed through the application of 3D point cloud data derived from diverse real-world settings, including laboratory environments, shopping mall entrances, and a densely populated urban area in Kita-ku, Osaka City, during a festival event.},

  abstract     = {The graph-based traffic forecasting is generally realized on the assumption of sufficient data, which could be impractical in the regions without well-deployed mobile sensors or data-processing facilities. Recent studies have developed a solution with the cross-region transfer learning, i.e. transferring traffic knowledge from the source regions to target ones, whose traffic data and computing resources are limited. Nevertheless, relevant issues, including initialization selection and domain adaptation, have not been effectively tackled in the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting. This paper proposes the cluster-granularity spatiotemporal transfer (CGSTT), which transfers the cluster-granularity knowledge from the source region to target one for the cross-region graph-based traffic forecasting, as not all source knowledge is positive to the target region. Additionally, the domain adaptation is achieved by the dual alignment consisting of the covariate alignment and label alignment of the source/target data, making the proposed CGSTT adapt to the target region efficiently. The superiority of the proposed method over ten compared baseline methods for both short-term and long-term predictions is demonstrated by the conducted experiments on four tasks, which show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art method by achieving an 8.89% average improvement in forecasting accuracy. The PyTorch implementation of the CGSTT is available at https://github.com/canyangguo/CGSTT.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Phone Signaling (MPS) data record the daily traces of urban residents, offering a cost-effective means to obtain travel information for urban traffic management and planning at low cost. However, despite the vast amount of data available, there remains a lag in the development of techniques for identifying fine-grained information such as travel modes. On the one hand, the high positioning error and irregular collection frequency make the identification of fine-grained modes challenging. On the other hand, the difficulties in collecting real labeled data limit the training and evaluation of advanced models. In this paper, we present an advanced Travel Mode Identification (TMI) framework and collect real labeled MPS data for evaluation. Specifically, a fast smoothing method is proposed to enhance noise reduction in large-scale trajectories while effectively mitigating positioning errors. We propose novel point-level bus route alignment features for advanced deep-learning models to improve differentiation between motorized modes. Furthermore, a deep learning model with ensembled feature encoding modules is designed to overcome training instability due to limited data amount. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 83.06% in identifying fine-grained travel modes, including walking, riding, bus, car, and metro, with recall rates exceeding 78% for all modes except walking. We analyze the relationship between accuracy and the spatiotemporal characteristics of trajectories, revealing a significant impact from the collection frequency, while showing insensitivity to distance gaps and positioning errors. This study demonstrates the potential of MPS for TMI and promotes its application in intelligent transportation systems.},

We show how the propagation characteristics of these channels are highly dependent on the presence or absence of certain reflective elements in the environment. Consequently, we propose a very simple ray tracing model to analyze the multipath behavior of the channel. We also discuss the stationarity of the channel through the comparison of three state-of-the-art methods. Stationarity time values between 25 ms and 41 ms were obtained for a car moving slightly under the maximum allowed speed of 120 km/h. Taking stationarity into account, we computed the channel wideband parameters. Delay spread values of less than 10 ns were obtained when the link antennas were properly aligned. However, they can jump to more than 100 ns when a line-of-sight (LOS) component is not dominant due to the presence of discrete reflectors.},

Large-scale models have recently attracted considerable attention in advanced autonomous driving applications due to their strong capabilities in information induction the process of extracting meaningful patterns from diverse data sources, analysis, and decision-making. They have demonstrated preliminary support for autonomous driving systems. However, when a vehicle fails to promptly analyze critical information and make effective decisions within constrained time intervals, severe safety incidents may occur. To address this issue, we propose a “Cognitive Tree” framework. This framework employs a tree-like structure to assign weights to various environmental factors, thereby guiding the model to prioritize processing information with higher weights. As a result, the reasoning process becomes more focused on key factors, achieving more real-time and safer decision-making in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates multiple modules that collaboratively consider environmental information across multiple dimensions, including speed, distance, direction, and future trajectories. By assigning distinct weights to different types of information and leveraging the Cognitive Tree framework in conjunction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation, our method progressively filters information, ensuring that the model remains centered on critical elements. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that, compared with traditional deep learning models and other large language model-based solutions, our framework achieves approximately a 25% reduction in collision rates.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent transportation systems are at risk of data misuse. Watermarking data that needs to be opened and shared can mitigate this problem, i.e., embedding signals into generated images, which are imperceptible to humans. Regardless of the shape of the image or any potential attacks it may undergo, the watermark can be detected by algorithms when needed. However, many watermarking schemes fail to resist attacks like cropping and translation, limiting their applicability in the intelligent transportation domain. To tackle these issues, we propose a dual watermarking framework based on Zernike moments for intelligent transportation systems, where a robust watermark and a periodic watermark are embedded in different planes of the cover image. Specifically, we propose a single-circle model (SCM) where Zernike moments are locally computed based on a circle centered at the image center with a radius proportional to image size for embedding the robust watermark. Since SCM is determined by measuring its center and radius, SCM is applicable to images of various sizes and shapes. Then we employ a robust combination of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) watermarking algorithms to embed the periodic watermark. For watermark extraction, we propose an efficient adaptive correction mechanism (AC) to recognize attack types and automatically relocate the embedding position of the watermark. By combining the above strategies, our proposed scheme can adaptively resist various attacks (e.g., random cropping, translation), which addresses the shortcomings of most existing watermarking schemes. We test the watermark using over 300 images of different sizes and shapes, and the experimental results prove that our proposed scheme achieves stronger robustness against various distortions with better invisibility, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as valuable tools in intelligent transportation systems, offering potential for real-time traffic monitoring and emergency response. However, the limited flight endurance of UAVs restricts their ability to collect large amounts of traffic event data crucial for data-driven models. While simulation platforms provide an alternative data source, a significant visual gap persists between synthetic and real images. Given the unique characteristics of UAV perspectives, where objects typically appear smaller, and the challenges faced by existing generative approaches in maintaining structural and semantic consistency, this paper proposes a novel generative approach. Our method integrates semantic mask guidance with a style-modulated Transformer-based GAN architecture to address these issues. Our approach first utilizes the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to extract semantic masks from GTA V simulated images. Subsequently, we introduce Spatially-Attentive Denormalization Modules (SADM) within the generator. These modules incorporate semantic mask statistics to enhance image quality and maintain consistency. Furthermore, we develop a perceptual discriminator incorporating a “memory bank” mechanism to more effectively evaluate image realism and stabilize the training process. To further enhance the quality of generated images, we develop a comprehensive training strategy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative metrics (i.e., FID and KID) and qualitative visual assessments, thus highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Overall, our approach offers a robust solution for generating highly realistic traffic event images from UAV perspectives, effectively addressing the scarcity of real-world UAV-recorded traffic event data.},

These CAVs will be equipped with various sensors for perceiving their surroundings and onboard computing capabilities to process sensor data in real-time. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is one of the essential sensors used for detecting objects and accurate distance estimation. However, LiDAR sensors are susceptible to several types of attacks. Adversaries can exploit LiDAR sensors either physically, by sending signals directly to the sensor, or digitally, by manipulating LiDAR data after gaining access to the in-vehicle network. Over the past few years, there has been significant research on the vulnerabilities, attack models, and security of LiDAR sensors. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive survey exists that addresses these aspects of autonomous vehicle security. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting an overview of LiDAR-based perception, data processing, threat models, and defense mechanisms for LiDAR sensors in CAVs. We believe this paper will serve as a valuable reference for researchers, providing a clear understanding of cyber-physical attacks and defense strategies related to LiDAR sensors in autonomous vehicles and related fields.},

Conversely, synthetic multi-source datasets hold promise for advancing the last mile of UDA but remain underutilized in current research. Thus, we propose DEC, a flexible UDA framework for multi-source datasets. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, DEC simplifies the task by categorizing semantic classes, training models for each category, and fusing their outputs by an ensemble model trained exclusively on synthetic datasets to obtain the final segmentation mask. DEC can integrate with existing UDA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas, significantly narrowing the syn-to-real domain gap.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) face considerable challenges when interacting with their environment, especially during lane changes. Enhancing decision-making and planning processes with prediction regarding the intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles can significantly improve lane change performance. However, prediction accuracy is limited by both the technology used and environmental variability. Utilizing low-confidence predictive data can adversely impact the safety and comfort of AV operations. This paper proposes a novel dual-model framework for lane change decision-making and planning of AVs (LC-Dual), which dialectically uses predictive data and provides redundant safety measures in parallel. In Model I, the optimal end-state trajectory for lane changes is planned using predictive information from the upper layer. In Model II, a redundant lane change trajectory is quickly generated based on a spatio-temporal safety corridor constructed from real perception data. Ultimately, the selection of the lane change model and trajectory is determined by rule-based decision-making, factoring in prediction confidence and computational efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the LC-Dual framework yields more adaptive trajectories in scenarios with accurate predictions and effective switches between lane change models in cases of inaccurate predictions. The LC-Dual framework markedly improves safety and efficiency in lane change operations, thereby facilitating broader AV adoption.},

  abstract     = {In scenario-based testing of autonomous vehicles, scenario types serve as input for generating test cases. Towards a comprehensive catalog of scenario types, expert-defined scenario types are complemented with types derived from real traffic data. Recorded traffic contains instances of different scenario types: By clustering these instances, a scenario type can be associated with each cluster. This involves adding semantics to recorded scenario instances, our clusters&#39; elements, in the form of maneuver-based descriptions of the behavior of scenario participants. Several works offer approaches to derive such instance descriptions. These approaches are often automated. The quality of the generated descriptions matters, given that subsequent steps build upon them. How to derive good descriptions automatically has not been addressed until now. In our work, (1) we approximate a description&#39;s quality by measuring the Frechet distance between the trajectories obtained by simulating ´ a description and the original trajectories in the dataset; (2) we introduce a quality threshold as to what makes a good description and, based on this threshold, we identify inadequate descriptions; (3) we build upon these evaluation results to modify identified inadequate descriptions automatically. In experiments, we extract and describe a set of 843 scenario instances from the inD intersection dataset: the average reconstruction quality in terms of a description&#39;s aggregated Frechet distance of 0.67 and ´ a ratio of 54% (459) of adequate descriptions improves to 0.34, and 97% (819). The average aggregated distance is reduced by half, i.e., the reconstruction quality is doubled.},

Second, relying on the extracted waterway patterns as “map context”, we enhance the Theta* path planning algorithm by taking the extracted traffic properties into consideration. An integrated solution combining both the waterway patterns and the enhanced Theta* algorithm has been applied to several domain use cases: a) waterway pattern based trajectory reconstruction; b) passage plan generation for various types of vessels; and c) vessel movement estimation and forecasting.

  abstract     = {Predicting pedestrian crossing behavior is important for intelligent traffic systems to avoid pedestrian-vehicle collisions. Most existing pedestrian crossing behavior models are trained and evaluated on datasets collected from a single country, overlooking differences between countries. To address this gap, we compared pedestrian road-crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings in Germany and Japan. We presented four types of machine learning models to predict gap selection behavior, zebra crossing usage, and their trajectories using simulator data collected from both countries. When comparing the differences between countries, pedestrians from the study conducted in Japan are more cautious, selecting larger gaps compared to those in Germany. We evaluate and analyze model transferability. Our results show that neural networks outperform other machine learning models in predicting gap selection and zebra crossing usage, while random forest models perform best on trajectory prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and transferability. We develop a transferable model using an unsupervised clustering method, which improves prediction accuracy for gap selection and trajectory prediction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of pedestrian crossing behaviors in different countries and offer valuable insights into model transferability.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we propose a radar-only simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm based on multiple input multiple output synthetic aperture radar images. The algorithm distinguishes itself from others by depending only on radar data for generating synthetic aperture radar images for estimating traversed trajectory and building a visual representation. In our algorithm, ego-velocity (estimated using only radar data) is used for generating synthetic aperture radar images. The generated radar images are used for rotation estimation in the odometry step as well as for place recognition by exploiting the Fourier-Radon image registration approach. After the trajectory is optimized, we combine coherent and incoherent processing over the radar data for generating a map of the traversed area. The proposed concept was evaluated over multiple sequences comprising heterogeneous and dynamic environments. The results show high performance of the algorithm in terms of place recognition, attaining a balanced f-score in the range of 0.86–0.96. Moreover, the algorithm also achieves good results in terms of simultaneous localization and mapping. For example, it achieves an absolute trajectory error of 0.11 m for a trajectory of length 340 m, and 0.43 m for a trajectory of length 1092 m. Finally, we also include a case study in which we show the capability of the radar-only localization and mapping solution in operating under scenarios that are challenging for global navigation satellite systems.},

In this study, we propose a 3D place recognition and pose estimation method for AAM using a hemispherical light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The proposed approach includes a feature extraction method that leverages height differences in surrounding objects, a method for generating local and global descriptors from feature distances, and an efficient geometric verification and localization process through correspondence calculation. Additionally, the method incorporates a process to create a virtual descriptor database using a point cloud map, enabling robust localization in unvisited areas. All procedures are handcrafted, and the performance of the proposed method is validated through comparison with state-of-the-art methods using datasets generated in a simulator. The proposed method achieved over 99.16% average precision (AP) and a 99.99% F1 score in loop closure detection. In pose estimation, it achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.836 meters or less for position and 0.195 degrees or less for heading. Furthermore, a time analysis on both a general PC and an embedded device confirmed the real-time capability of the proposed method, with an average pose estimation time of 21.70 milliseconds on the embedded device, demonstrating its feasibility for real-time localization in low-power environments.},

  abstract     = {The rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the global pursuit of energy efficiency and carbon neutrality necessitates effective strategies to mitigate their carbon footprint and enhance operational stability. Similarly, in order to achieve Sustainability Development Goals, a promising solution toward green mobility, which is gaining ground nowadays, constitutes Automated Vehicles (AVs), which are EVs having the capability to move autonomously, without the need for a driver. One of the most critical factors regarding energy efficiency is the optimal management of energy consumption of AVs. This research study explores the application of machine learning (ML) models for State-of-Charge (SoC) forecasting in AVs, crucial for addressing challenges such as range anxiety and grid overloading. Leveraging real-life EV data from automated minibuses in Gothenburg, Sweeden, a comprehensive pipeline is proposed for data pre-processing, feature selection, and model training. With a focus on predicting SoC several minutes ahead, various ML techniques, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic-net regression are embedded in a pipeline specifically developed to overcome the challenge of training time-series models on discontinuous data segments, corresponding to discharge cycles. This pipeline is called Cross-Segment-Leakage-Free (CSLF). The results demonstrate the efficacy of CSLF, with the best-performing model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.92 in a forecasting horizon of 30 minutes, representing a significant improvement over baseline models. The study underscores the importance of meaningful pre-processing and model selection in SoC consumption forecasting for AVs, offering insights into future research directions and deployment strategies for enhancing EV efficiency and grid stability.},

To minimize communication resources and actuation of actuators, eventtriggered control techniques with novel triggering mechanisms are introduced to adapt control inputs based on the developed adaptive finite-time compensation control strategies. For the purpose of guaranteeing the absence of Zeno phenomenon in the quadrotor UAVs, bounds on the inter-event execution time are defined. By incorporating the event-triggering conditions, bounded and asymptotic trajectory tracking results of position and attitude UAV subsystems are achieved respectively by utilizing Lyapunov stability theory under the influence of general perturbations. The effectiveness of the presented control strategies is validated through comparative simulation results of a quadrotor UAV system.},

This paper reformulates the proposed real-time position management scheme as a quadratic programming problem with equality constraints and solves it in real-time using the zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) model. To enhance the model&#39;s ability to detect real-time position management errors, an adaptive parameter finite-time convergent zeroing neural dynamics (AP-FTZND) model is introduced, incorporating adaptive parameters and a nonlinear activation function (AF) within the ZND framework. The global convergence of the AP-FTZND model is proven using the Lyapunov theory, and the upper bound of the convergence time is derived. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the AP-FTZND model in solving multi-agent real-time position management tasks are validated through simulations and physical experiments.},

Despite advancements, existing methods struggle with key challenges, particularly in modeling the complex spatio-temporal interactions and addressing the inherent multi-modality and multitask nature of the problem. In this paper, we introduce TAME, a novel model that integrates a Non-Autoregressive Transformer with Attention Mechanism and Mixture of Experts to address these limitations. TAME features a temporal attention network, a spatial attention interaction network, and a multi-task prediction network. For temporal relation modeling, we leverage a hybrid attention mechanism that simultaneously captures both intravehicle temporal dependencies and the inter-vehicle temporal interactions. Spatial interaction is modeled through a crossattention mechanism, enabling a more refined capture of the spatial dependencies between the target vehicle and its surrounding entities, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. To effectively handle multi-modal and multi-task predictions, we incorporate a mixture of experts framework within a non-autoregressive transformer, allowing for diverse future trajectories to be predicted in parallel without the compounding errors typical in autoregressive models. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets NGSIM and HighD demonstrate that TAME outperforms stateof-the-art methods in motion prediction tasks, achieving over 28% average improvement.},

However, the existing approaches solely relying on subgraph predictivity face a challenge: the learned invariant subgraph often contains numerous spurious nodes and shows poor connectivity, undermining the generalization power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To tackle this issue, we propose a summary graph-induced Invariant Learning (SIL) model that innovatively adopts a summary graph to leverage both the subgraph connectivity and predictivity for learning strong connected and accurate invariant subgraphs. Specifically, SIL first learns a summary graph containing multiple strongly connected supernodes while maintaining structure consistency with the original graph. Secondly, the learned summary graph is disentangled into an invariant supernode and spurious counterparts to eliminate the interference of highly predictive edges and nodes. Finally, SIL identifies a potential invariant subgraph from the invariant supernode to accomplish generalization tasks. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of the summary graph learning mechanism, guaranteeing that the learned summary graph is consistent with the original graph. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the SIL model.},

In this paper, we present FlexIM, the first efficient and verifiable index management system for blockchain dynamic queries. The key innovation in FlexIM is to uncover the inherent characteristics of blockchain, i.e., data distribution and block access frequency, and then to optimally choose the index by utilizing reinforcement learning technique under varying workloads. In addition, we enhance and facilitate verifiability with low storage overhead by leveraging Root Merkle Tree (RMT) and Bloom Filter Merkle Tree (BMT).

The ability to detect sarcasm plays a pivotal role in comprehending individuals&#39; true sentiments. To achieve a comprehensive grasp of sentence semantics, it is crucial to integrate external knowledge that can aid in deciphering entities and their intricate relationships within a sentence. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, their use of external knowledge is still relatively superficial. Specifically, Knowledge-enhanced entity and relationship understanding still face significant challenges. In this paper, we propose the Knowledge Enhanced Sentiment Dependency Graph Convolutional Network (KSDGCN) framework, which constructs a commonsense-augmented sentiment graph and a commonsense-replaced dependency graph for each text to explicitly capture the role of external knowledge for sarcasm detection. Furthermore, we validate the irrational relationships between co-occurring entity pairs within sentences and background knowledge by a signed attention mechanism. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results show that KSDGCN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is highly interpretable.},

Targeted sequential rule mining aims to obtain those interesting sequential rules that users focus on, thus avoiding the generation of other invalid and unnecessary rules. It can further improve the efficiency of users in analyzing rules and reduce the consumption of computing resources. In this paper, we first present the relevant definitions of target sequential rules and formulate the problem of targeted sequential rule mining. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm called TaSRM. Several pruning strategies and an optimization are introduced to improve the efficiency of TaSRM. Finally, a large number of experiments are conducted on different benchmarks, and we analyze the results in terms of running time, memory consumption, and scalability, as well as query cases with different query rules.

To overcome these challenges, we propose ${\sf CHASe}$ (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. ${\sf CHASe}$ focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, ${\sf CHASe}$ encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.

The structural diversity of a user is depicted by the number of social contexts inside his/her contact neighborhood. Three structural diversity models based on cohesive subgraph models (e.g., k-sized component, k-core, and k-truss), have been proposed. Previous solutions only focus on CPU-based sequential solutions, suffering from several key steps of that cannot be highly parallelized. GPUs enjoy high-efficiency performance in parallel computing for solving many complex graph problems such as triangle counting, subgraph pattern matching, and graph decomposition. In this paper, we provide a unified framework to utilize multiple GPUs to accelerate the computation of structural diversity search under the mentioned three structural diversity models. We first propose a GPU-based lock-free method to efficiently extract ego-networks in CSR format in parallel. Secondly, we design detailed GPU-based solutions for computing $k$-sized component-based, $k$-core-based, and also $k$-truss-based structural diversity scores by dynamically grouping GPU resources. To effectively optimize the workload balance among multiple GPUs, we propose a greedy work-packing scheme and a dynamic work-stealing strategy to fulfill usage.

Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interactive relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant challenges: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations within behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interactive relations, and includes a relation chain representation learner and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our DCMGNN surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

However, most of the current GNNs only consider fixed-neighbor discrete message-passing, disregarding the importance of the local structure of different nodes and the implicit information between nodes for smoothing features. Previous approaches either focus on adaptive selection for aggregation structures or treat discrete graph convolution as a continuous diffusion process, but none of them comprehensively considered the above issues, significantly limiting the model&#39;s performance. To this end, we present a novel approach called Flexible Diffusion Convolution (Flexi-DC), which exploits the neighborhood information of nodes to set a particular continuous diffusion for each node to smooth features. Specifically, Flexi-DC first extracts the local structure knowledge based on the degrees of nodes in the graph data and then injects it into the diffusion convolution module to smooth features. Additionally, we utilize the extracted knowledge to smooth labels. Flexi-DC is an efficient framework that can significantly improve the performance of most GNN architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that Flexi-DC outperforms their vanilla implementations by an average accuracy of 13.24% (GCN), 16.37% (JKNet), and 11.98% (ARMA) on nine graph datasets with different homophily ratios.},

We further introduce ItemRec, a straightforward plug-and-play approach that leverages mutual scores calculated by any model. The goal is to maximize the recommendation and acceptance of items by users. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate that ItemRec can enhance valid coverage by up to 38.5% while maintaining comparable or superior recommendation quality. This improvement comes with only a minor increase in model inference time, ranging from 1.5% to 5%. Furthermore, when compared to thirteen state-of-the-art recommendation methods across accuracy, fairness, and diversity, ItemRec exhibits significant advantages as well. Specifically, ItemRec achieves an optimal balance between precision and valid coverage, showcasing an efficiency gain ranging from 1.8 to 45 times compared to other fairness-oriented methodologies.

However, the widespread adoption of learned indexes is limited by their expensive training cost and the need for high accuracy of internal models. Although some studies attempt to optimize the building process of these learned indexes, existing methods are restrictive in scope and applicability. They are usually tailored to specific index types and heavily rely on pre-trained model knowledge, making deployment a challenging task. In this work, we introduce the Learned Index Optimization Framework (LIOF), a general and easily integrated solution aimed at expediting the training process and improving the accuracy of index model for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional learned indexes. The optimization of LIOF for the learned indexes is intuitive, directly providing optimized parameters for index models based on the distribution of node data. By leveraging the correlation between key distribution and node model parameters, LIOF significantly reduces the training epochs required for each node model. Initially, we introduce an optimization strategy inspired by optimization-based meta-learning to train the LIOF to generate optimized initial parameters for index node models. Subsequently, we present a data-driven encoder and a parameter-centric decoder network, which adaptively translate key distribution into a latent variable representation and decode it into optimized node model initialization. Additionally, to further utilize characteristics of key distribution, we propose a monotonic regularizer and focal loss, guiding LIOF training towards efficiency and precision. Through extensive experimentation on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that LIOF provides substantial enhancements in both training efficiency and the predictive accuracy for learned indexes.},

  abstract     = {Ensemble clustering can utilize the complementary information among multiple base clusterings, and obtain a clustering model with better performance and more robustness. Despite its great success, there are still two problems in the current ensemble clustering methods. First, most ensemble clustering methods often treat all base clusterings equally. Second, the final ensemble clustering result often relies on $k$-means or other discretization procedures to uncover the clustering indicators, thus obtaining unsatisfactory results. To address these issues, we proposed a novel ensemble clustering method based on structured graph learning, which can directly extract clustering indicators from the obtained similarity matrix. Moreover, our methods take sufficient consideration of correlation among the base clusterings and can effectively reduce the redundancy among them. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract     = {A transparent decision-making process is essential for developing reliable and trustworthy recommender systems. For sequential recommendation, it means that the model can identify key items that account for its recommendation results. However, achieving both interpretability and recommendation performance simultaneously is challenging, especially for models that take the entire sequence of items as input without screening. In this paper, we propose an interpretable framework (named PTSR) that enables a pattern- wise transparent decision-making process without extra features. It breaks the sequence of items into multi-level patterns that serve as atomic units throughout the recommendation process. The contribution of each pattern to the outcome is quantified in the probability space. With a carefully designed score correction mechanism, the pattern contribution can be implicitly learned in the absence of ground-truth key patterns. The final recommended items are those that most key patterns strongly endorse. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate remarkable recommendation performance, while statistical analysis and case studies validate the model interpretability.},

  abstract     = {Subgraph learning has dominated most practices of improving the expressive power of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). Existing subgraph discovery policies can be classified into node-based and partition-based, which both achieve impressive performance in most scenarios. However, both mainstream solutions still face a subgraph degradation trap. Subgraph degradation is reflected in the phenomenon that the subgraph-level methods fail to offer any benefits over node-level MPNNs. In this work, we empirically investigate the existence of the subgraph degradation issue and introduce a unified perspective, perfect reconstruction, to provide insights for improving two lines of methods. We further propose a subgraph learning strategy guided by the principle of perfect reconstruction. To achieve this, two major issues should be well-addressed, i.e., (i) how to ensure the subgraphs to possess with &#39;perfect’ information? (ii) how to guarantee the ’reconstruction’ power of obtained subgraphs? Firstly, we propose a subgraph partition strategy Rayleigh-resistance to extract non-overlap subgraphs by leveraging the graph spectral theory. Secondly, we put forward a Query mechanism to achieve subgraph-level equivariant learning, which guarantees subgraph reconstruction ability. These two parts, perfect subgraph partition and equivariant subgraph learning are seamlessly unified as a novel Rayleigh-resistance Equivariant Subgraph learning architecture (RayE-Sub). Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach can consistently outperform previous subgraph learning architectures.

Most studies mainly focus on mining communities by combining structure with attributes or structure with location, which do not consider structure, attributes, and location simultaneously. Therefore, we propose a parameter-free algorithm, called LCDMRS, to mine local communities in multi-attributed road-social networks. LCDMRS extracts a sub-network surrounding the given node and embeds it to generate the vector representations of nodes, which incorporates both structural and attributed information. Based on the vector representations of nodes, the average cosine similarity between nodes is designed to ensure both the structural and attributed cohesiveness of the community, while the community node density is designed to ensure the spatial cohesiveness of the community. Targeting the community node density and cosine similarity of nodes, LCDMRS takes the given node as the starting node and employs the community dominance relation to expand the community outward. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate LCDMRS outperforms comparison algorithms.},

There are two kinds of important negatives: hard and false negatives. Hard negatives are the negatives which are difficult to distinguish from positive samples, while false negatives are positive samples which are mistakenly identified as negatives. Harnessing hard negatives effectively can make the model more discriminative, and reducing false negatives can avoid misleading the model during training. Therefore, the two kinds of negatives are essential in high-quality negative sampling. However, the present negative sampling methods face two shortcomings: 1.judging one negative is hard or false mainly relies on score functions; 2. difficulty in balancing the impact of hard and false negatives. In this paper, we absorb bigram language model and propose a novel criterion to help verify the negatives are hard or false, and discuss how to keep the balance between hard and false negatives. Experiments on four representative score functions and two public datasets demonstrate the effects of the proposed negative sampling method.},

This necessitates the emerging field of imbalanced learning on graphs, which aims to correct these data distribution skews for more accurate and representative learning outcomes. In this survey, we embark on a comprehensive review of the literature on imbalanced learning on graphs. We begin by providing a definitive understanding of the concept and related terminologies, establishing a strong foundational understanding for readers. Following this, we propose two comprehensive taxonomies: (1) the problem taxonomy, which describes the forms of imbalance we consider, the associated tasks, and potential solutions; (2) the technique taxonomy, which details key strategies for addressing these imbalances, and aids readers in their method selection process. Finally, we suggest prospective future directions for both problems and techniques within the sphere of imbalanced learning on graphs, fostering further innovation in this critical area.},

  abstract     = {In the scenario of class-incremental learning (CIL), deep neural networks have to adapt their model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, e.g., the emergence of new classes over time. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, typical CIL methods either cumulatively store exemplars of old classes for retraining model parameters from scratch or progressively expand model size as new classes arrive, which, however, compromises their practical value due to little attention paid to parameter efficiency. In this paper, we contribute a novel solution, effective control of the parameters of a well-trained model, by the synergy between two complementary learning subnetworks. Specifically, we integrate one plastic feature extractor and one analytical feed-forward classifier into a unified framework amenable to streaming data. In each CIL session, it achieves non-overwritten parameter updates in a cost-effective manner, neither revisiting old task data nor extending previously learned networks; Instead, it accommodates new tasks by attaching a tiny set of declarative parameters to its backbone, in which only one matrix per task or one vector per class is kept for knowledge retention. Experimental results on a variety of task sequences demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art CIL approaches, especially in accuracy gain, knowledge transfer, training efficiency, and task-order robustness. Furthermore, a graceful forgetting implementation on previously learned trivial tasks is empirically investigated to make its non-growing backbone (i.e., a model with limited network capacity) suffice to train on more incoming tasks.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses the problem of convolutional kernel learning in univariate, multivariate, and multidimensional time series data, which is crucial for interpreting temporal patterns in time series and supporting downstream machine learning tasks. First, we propose formulating convolutional kernel learning for univariate time series as a sparse regression problem with a non-negative constraint, leveraging the properties of circular convolution and circulant matrices. Second, to generalize this approach to multivariate and multidimensional time series data, we use tensor computations, reformulating the convolutional kernel learning problem in the form of tensors. This is further converted into a standard sparse regression problem through vectorization and tensor unfolding operations. In the proposed methodology, the optimization problem is addressed using the existing non-negative subspace pursuit method, enabling the convolutional kernel to capture temporal correlations and patterns. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it to several real-world time series datasets. On the multidimensional ridesharing and taxi trip data from New York City and Chicago, the convolutional kernels reveal interpretable local correlations and cyclical patterns, such as weekly seasonality. For the monthly temperature time series data in North America, the proposed model can quantify the yearly seasonality and make it comparable across different decades. In the context of multidimensional fluid flow data, both local and nonlocal correlations captured by the convolutional kernels can reinforce tensor factorization, leading to performance improvements in fluid flow reconstruction tasks. Thus, this study lays an insightful foundation for automatically learning convolutional kernels from time series data, with an emphasis on interpretability through sparsity and non-negativity constraints.},

This model allows users to request vehicles from multiple companies (agents) simultaneously through a unified entry (a ‘hub’). In contrast to conventional services, the “hub-oriented” model emphasizes pricing competition. To address this scenario, an agent should consider its competitors when developing its pricing strategy. In this paper, we introduce DRLPG, a mixed opponent-aware pricing method, which consists of two main components: the two-stage guarantor and the end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) module, as well as interaction mechanisms. In the guarantor, we design a prediction-decision framework. Specifically, we propose a new objective function for the spatiotemporal neural network in the prediction stage and utilize a traditional reinforcement learning method in the decision stage, respectively. In the end-to-end DRL framework, we explore the adoption of conventional DRL in the “hub-oriented” scenario. Finally, a meta-decider and an experience-sharing mechanism are proposed to combine both methods and leverage their advantages. We conduct extensive experiments on real data, and DRLPG achieves an average improvement of 99.9% and 61.1% in the peak and low peak periods, respectively.

  abstract     = {Deep learning has been widely applied in recommender systems, which has recently achieved revolutionary progress. However, most existing learning-based methods assume that the user and item distributions remain unchanged between the training phase and the test phase. However, the distribution of user and item features can naturally shift in real-world scenarios, potentially resulting in a substantial decrease in recommendation performance. This phenomenon can be formulated as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) recommendation problem. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Dual Test-Time-Training framework for OOD Recommendation, termed DT3OR. In DT3OR, we incorporate a model adaptation mechanism during the test-time phase to carefully update the recommendation model, allowing the model to adapt specially to the shifting user and item features. To be specific, we propose a self-distillation task and a contrastive task to assist the model learning both the user&#39;s invariant interest preferences and the variant user/item characteristics during the test-time phase, thus facilitating a smooth adaptation to the shifting features. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the rationale behind our dual test-time training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to address OOD recommendation via a test-time-training strategy. We conduct experiments on five datasets with various backbones. Comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DT3OR compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.},

However, current neural methods often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Moreover, first-order logic methods, while systematic, struggle to integrate unstructured external knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework called Final, which combines FIrst-order logic with NAtural Logic for question answering. Our framework utilizes first-order logic to systematically decompose hypotheses and natural logic to construct reasoning paths from premises to hypotheses, employing bidirectional reasoning to establish links along the reasoning path. This approach not only enhances interpretability but also effectively integrates unstructured knowledge. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely QASC, WorldTree, and WikiHop, demonstrate that Final outperforms existing methods in commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, our framework also provides transparent reasoning paths that elucidate the rationale behind the correct decisions.},

  abstract     = {Prerequisite-link Prediction (PLP) aims to discover the condition relations of a specific event or a concerned variable, which is a fundamental problem in a large number of fields, such as educational data mining. Current studies on PLP usually developed graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the representations of pairs of nodes. However, these models fail to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs and integrate multiscale structures, leading to the insufficient expressive capability of GNNs. To this end, we in this paper proposed k-dimensional Weisferiler-Leman directed GNNs, dubbed k-WediGNNs, to recognize non-isomorphic graphs via the Weisferiler-Leman algorithm. Furthermore, we integrated the multiscale structures of a directed graph into k-WediGNNs, dubbed multiscale k-WediGNNs, from the bidirected views of in-degree and out-degree. With the Siamese network, the proposed models are extended to address the problem of PLP. Besides, the expressive power is then interpreted via theoretical proofs. The experiments were conducted on four publicly available datasets for concept prerequisite relation prediction (CPRP). The results show that the proposed models achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches, where our multiscale k-WediGNN achieves a new benchmark in the task of CPRP.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning (ML) model without the need to exchange their raw data. However, it relies on a centralized authority to coordinate participants&#39; activities. This not only interrupts the entire training task in case of a single point of failure, but also lacks an effective regulatory mechanism to prevent malicious behavior. Although blockchain, with its decentralized architecture and data immutability, has significantly advanced the development of FL, it still struggles to withstand poisoning attacks and faces limitations in computational scalability. We propose Zkfhed, a verifiable and scalable FL system that overcomes the limitations of blockchain-based FL in poison attacks and computational scalability. First, we propose a two-stage audit scheme based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which verifies that the training data are extracted from trusted organizations and that computations on the data exactly follow the specified training protocols. Second, we propose a homomorphic encryption delegation learning (HEDL), based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It is capable of outsourcing complex computing to external computing resources without sacrificing the client&#39;s data privacy. Final, extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Zkfhed can effectively identify malicious clients and is highly efficient and scalable in terms of online time and communication efficiency.},

Then, we introduce a gradient-based greedy algorithm as a new paradigm to solve this problem. To accelerate the computation cost, we leverage geometric properties, convex hull approximation, and approximation of the projected coordinate of each point. To further improve this algorithm, we use pre-pruning and fast update techniques, rending its especially apt for large-scale networks. Our proposed algorithms have nearlylinear time complexity.

  abstract     = {The query efficiency of Spark SQL is significantly impacted by its configurations. Therefore, configuration tuning has drawn great attention, and various automatic configuration tuning methods have been proposed. However, existing methods suffer from two issues: (1) high tuning overhead: they need to repeatedly execute the workloads several times to obtain the training samples, which is time-consuming; and (2) low throughput: they need to occupy resources like CPU cores and memory for a long time, causing other Spark SQL workloads to wait, thereby reducing the overall system throughput. These issues impede the use of automatic configuration tuning methods in practical systems which have limited tuning budget and many concurrent workloads. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Low-Overhead and Flexible approach for Spark SQL configuration Tuning, dubbed LOFTune. LOFTune reduces the tuning overhead via a sample-efficient optimization framework, which is proposed based on multi-task SQL representation learning and multi-armed bandit. Furthermore, LOFTune solves the low throughput issue with a recommendation-sampling-decoupled tuning framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LOFTune. In the sampling-allowed case, LOFTune can save up to 90% of the workload runs comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, in the zero-sampling case, LOFTune can reduce up to 41.26% of latency.},

Recently, significant advancements have been achieved through the application of various deep learning methodologies to address the KT challenges. However, a considerable proportion of deep learning based KT (DLKT) approaches exhibit striking similarities in their methodologies, model designs, and even the outcomes demonstrating minimal divergence. In addition, the evaluation procedures employed in current DLKT studies have not yet been standardized, resulting in substantial inconsistencies in the reported area under the curve (AUC) outcomes, despite analyzing the identical datasets using the same model. To address the two aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a generalized DLKT framework and presents the existing sophisticate DLKT models with five components, namely, multimodal data encoder, student knowledge memory, auxiliary knowledge base, learning outcome objective and computational efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we develop and open source a standardized DLKT benchmark platform named pyKT11https://pykt.org/, which consists of a standardized set of integrated data preprocessing procedures on 9 popular datasets across different domains and 21 frequently compared DLKT model implementations. With pyKT, we conduct empirical and reproducible research to assess the performance of prevalent DLKT algorithms in an unbiased and clear setting over multiple data sources. Finally, we discuss the applications of KT techniques in education and their future directions.},

The existing study of SEC focuses on recognizing a fixed set of social events. However, in real-world scenarios, new social events continually emerge on social media, which suggests the necessity for a practical SEC model that can swiftly adapt to the evolving environment with incremental social events. Therefore, in this paper, we study a new yet crucial problem defined as Continual Social Event Classification (C-SEC), where new events continually emerge in the sequentially collected social data. Accordingly, we propose a novel Temporal Event Knowledge Network (TEKNet) to continually learn temporal event knowledge for C-SEC with temporally incremental events. Firstly, we conduct present event knowledge learning to learn the classification of newly emerging events in the presently incoming data. Secondly, we design past event knowledge replay with self-knowledge distillation to consolidate the learned knowledge of past events and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we propose future event knowledge pretraining with a modality mixture mechanism to pretrain the classifiers for events that occur in the future. Comprehensive experiments on real-world social event datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TEKNet for C-SEC.},

The number of exact matches is then used to calculate the hit rate, hit ratio, precision, recall, or F1-score. This way of evaluating hashtag similarities is inadequate as it ignores the semantic correlation between the recommended and ground truth hashtags. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel semantic evaluation framework for hashtag recommendation, called #REval. This framework includes an internal module referred to as BERTag, which automatically learns the hashtag embeddings. We investigate on how the #REval framework performs under different word embedding methods and different numbers of synonyms and hashtags in the recommendation using our proposed #REval-hit-ratio measure. Our experiments of the proposed framework on three large datasets show that #REval gave more meaningful hashtag synonyms for hashtag recommendation evaluation. Our analysis also highlights the sensitivity of the framework to the word embedding technique, with #REval based on BERTag more superior over #REval based on Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe.},

  abstract     = {The single-source personalized PageRank (SSPPR) is a fundamental problem in the social works which find a lot of applications in information retrieval, recommender system, etc. Given a source node $s$ in a networks, it returns an importance score called PPR value of each node in the network w.r.t. the source node $s$. Despite that SSPPR is extensively studied in the traditional offline social networks, no research effort has been devoted to the problem under the emerging online social networks (OSN) where the network is online given and the access to the network is restricted. In an OSN, the network topology is not known apriori and the users are not allowed to randomly access the vertices and edges. Instead, the network provider only allows the users to explore the network from a given source vertex by using an API step by step in an crawling fashion. As such, all existing algorithms for SSPPR which requires the full knowledge of the global or local topology can not be applied to OSN. We observe that the only possible method for SSPPR on OSN is the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of random walks. But the traditional MC algorithm employs the static sampling for MC simulation which calculate the total number of random walks needed and obtain all of them in one lump. But this static sampling renders them suffer from the lack of interactiveness and flexibility which forces the users to wait until the end of algorithm without any feedback/indicator regarding the progress and thus, largely degrades the user experience a lot. Besides, they always overestimate the total number of random walks needed due to the nature of the worse-case analysis which is sample-independent. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a progressive sampling algorithm, namely Single-Source Personalized PageRank on Online Social Networks with Rademacher Average (PANDA), to boost the processing of SSPPR on the Online Social Networks. In our algorithm, the random walks are sampled iteratively in batches. In each iteration, we estimate the accuracy currently achieved with the random walks already being sampled and derive the error bound by adopting a key concept called Rademacher Average from the statistical machine learning theory. As such, our proposed algorithm is data-dependent which fully make sense of the random walks already sampled and help us terminate the algorithm earlier once our desired accuracy is achieved. We also develop a dynamic sampling schedule which in each iteration derives the sample size for the next iteration. Our empirical study shows that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by orders of magnitudes in terms of the efficiency with the same accuracy guarantee.},

Despite its growing prevalence, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on MoE. This survey seeks to bridge that gap, serving as an essential resource for researchers delving into the intricacies of MoE.

Next, we overview the core designs for various MoE models including both algorithmic and systemic aspects, alongside collections of available open-source implementations, hyperparameter configurations and empirical evaluations. Furthermore, we delineate the multifaceted applications of MoE in practice, and outline some potential directions for future research.

A key component of CL is mining the latent discriminative relationships between positive and negative samples and using them as self-supervised labels. We argue that this discriminative contrastive task is, in essence, similar to a classification task, and the “either positive or negative” hard label sampling strategies are arbitrary. To solve this problem, we explore ideas from data distillation, which considers probabilistic logit vectors as soft labels to transfer model knowledge. We attempt to abandon the classical hard sampling labels in CL and instead explore self-supervised soft labels. We adopt soft sampling labels that are extracted, without supervision, from the inherent relationships in data pairs to retain more information. We propose a new self-supervised graph learning method, Distill and Contrast (D&amp;C), for learning representations that closely approximate natural data relationships. D&amp;C extracts node similarities from the features and structures to derive soft sampling labels, which also eliminate noise in the data to increase robustness.

However, the user behavior information captured from multiple behaviors in a single domain is insufficient. Our study seeks to enhance user behavior prediction by leveraging both multi-behavior information and cross-domain information in a more effective manner. In order to explore the correlations and differences between different behaviors and different domains, we propose a novel competition framework consists of intra-domain competition and inter-domain competition for knowledge learning. Specifically, for intra-domain, a behavior competition mechanism is designed to enable the model to mine users&#39; interests and behavior patterns effectively. For inter-domain, a domain competition mechanism is designed to perform knowledge transfer and knowledge fusion for overlapping users in different domains. Through the competition mechanisms, our proposed Graph Competitive Transfer Network (GCTN) achieves knowledge transfer between different domains and captures users&#39; behavior patterns in different contexts. The effectiveness of the GCTN and its competition mechanisms has been validated through sufficient experimental trials on Douban and Amazon datasets.

Existing tensor-based MVSC methods construct self-representation subspace coefficient matrices of all views as a tensor, and introduce the tensor nuclear norm (TNN) to capture the complementary information hidden in different views. The key assumption is that the data samples of each subspace must be sufficient for subspace representation. This work proposes a nonconvex latent transformed low-rank tensor representation framework for MVSC. To deal with the insufficient sample problem, we study the latent low-rank representation in the multi-view case to supplement underlying observed samples. Moreover, we propose to use data-driven transformed TNN (TTNN), resulting from the intrinsic structure of multi-view samples, to preserve the consensus and complementary information in the transformed domain. Meanwhile, the proposed unified nonconvex low-rank tensor representation framework can better learn the high correlation among different views. To resolve the proposed nonconvex optimization model, we propose an effective algorithm under the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers and theoretically prove that the iteration sequences converge to the critical point.

In this work, we propose a novel decoding framework, DECIDER, which enables us to program rules on how we complete tasks to control a PLM. Differing from previous work, our framework transforms the encouragement of target words into the encouragement of all words that satisfy the rule. Specifically, DECIDER is a dual system where a PLM is equipped with a First-Order- Logic (FOL) reasoner to express and evaluate the rules, and a decision function to merge the outputs from both systems to steer the generation.

  abstract     = {Attribute-based signature (ABS) is an attractive variation of digital signature that enables signers to sign messages with fine-grained signature predicates. In ABS, a signer is able to perform signing operations without revealing personal attributes, and verifiers can only confirm that the signature was created by someone with attributes satisfying a specific signature predicate. However, traditional ABS suffers from key exposure, and the compromise of a signer&#39;s signature key results in invalidating all signatures from him/her. To address this problem, forward-secure ABS (FS-ABS) was introduced. Nevertheless, existing FS-ABS schemes have the shortcomings of low policy expressiveness and high computation costs, and thus are not suitable to be employed on mobile devices with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a user-friendly and expressive FS-ABS (UEFS-ABS) scheme that is proven secure in the standard model. The proposed scheme not only supports expressive signature predicates based on the linear secret sharing scheme, but also provides server-aided signature and outsourced verification functions, significantly reducing the workload of user terminals at both signature generation and verification stages. The experiments indicate that compared with the up-to-date FS-ABS scheme, our scheme reduces the computation costs for signature generation (on signers&#39; devices) and verification (on verifiers&#39; devices) by about 85% and 68%, respectively. This makes our scheme more suitable for user terminals in mobile computing scenarios.},

This combination allows the large foundation models and the small local domain models at the remote clients to learn from each other in a teacher-student learning setting. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of the ten challenging problems inherent in FedFMs, encompassing foundational theory, utilization of private data, continual learning, unlearning, Non-IID and graph data, bidirectional knowledge transfer, incentive mechanism design, game mechanism design, model watermarking, and efficiency. The ten challenging problems manifest in five pivotal aspects: “Foundational Theory,” which aims to establish a coherent and unifying theoretical framework for FedFMs. “Data,” addressing the difficulties in leveraging domain-specific knowledge from private data while maintaining privacy; “Heterogeneity,” examining variations in data, model, and computational resources across clients; “Security and Privacy,” focusing on defenses against malicious attacks and model theft; and “Efficiency,” highlighting the need for improvements in training, communication, and parameter efficiency. For each problem, we offer a clear mathematical definition on the objective function, analyze existing methods, and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. This in-depth exploration aims to advance the theoretical foundations of FedFMs, guide practical implementations, and inspire future research to overcome these obstacles, thereby enabling the robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving FedFMs in various real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Entity alignment aims to use pre-aligned seed pairs to find other equivalent entities from different knowledge graphs and is widely used in graph fusion-related fields. However, as the scale of knowledge graphs increases, manually annotating prealigned seed pairs becomes difficult. Existing research utilizes entity embeddings obtained by aggregating single structural information to identify potential seed pairs, thus reducing the reliance on pre-aligned seed pairs. However, due to the structural heterogeneity of KG, the quality of potential seed pairs obtained using only a single structural information is not ideal. In addition, although existing research improves the quality of potential seed pairs through semi-supervised iteration, they underestimate the impact of embedding distortion produced by noisy seed pairs on the alignment effect. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a seed expanded-aware graph neural network with iterative optimization for semi-supervised entity alignment, named SE-GNN. First, we utilize the semantic attributes and structural features of entities, combined with a conditional filtering mechanism, to obtain high-quality initial potential seed pairs. Next, we designed a local and global awareness mechanism. It introduces initial potential seed pairs and combines local and global information to obtain a more comprehensive entity embedding representation, which alleviates the impact of KG structural heterogeneity and lays the foundation for the optimization of initial potential seed pairs. Then, we designed the threshold nearest neighbor embedding correction strategy. It combines the similarity threshold and the bidirectional nearest neighbor method as a filtering mechanism to select iterative potential seed pairs and also uses an embedding correction strategy to eliminate the embedding distortion. Finally, we will reach the optimized potential seeds after iterative rounds to input local and global sensing mechanisms, obtain the final entity embedding, and perform entity alignment. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of our SE-GNN, showcasing the effectiveness of the model.

  abstract     = {Much research has applied automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems to English writing instruction; however, understanding how students internalize and apply this feedback to reduce writing errors is difficult, largely due to the personal and private nature of this process. Therefore, this research utilized eye-tracking technology to explore the AWE system&#39;s effectiveness in reducing the writing errors of English major students. A total of 118 higher vocational college students majoring in English in China participated in this eight-week study. The experimental group studied with and received feedback from both the AWE system (Pigai) and the teacher, whereas the control group studied without the AWE system and only received teacher feedback. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted before and after the writing instruction. Participants&#39; responses during the eye-tracking experiment, first-person eye movement video data, and corresponding gaze data were collected. Leveraging the application of neural network technology in optical character recognition (OCR), combined with data from an eye-tracking device, we developed a system that can transform first-person eye movement video data and gaze data into heatmaps and eye-tracking indices conducive to analysis. Various data analysis methods were employed, including neural network algorithms, heatmap analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, independent-samples t-test, and Welch&#39;s t-test. The results for the post-eye-tracking experiment responses, heatmaps, and eye-tracking indices indicate the advantages of using the AWE system, which effectively enhances students&#39; ability to recognize writing errors while reducing processing time, by facilitating the internalization of writing errors through continuous feedback on such errors, and enabling them to apply this knowledge to new materials, thereby recognizing writing errors more quickly and accurately, and thus helping them to reduce writing errors.

The results showed that the overall effect sizes for learning effects and learning experience were .922 and 1.153, respectively, suggesting that the Metaverse substantially influences educational effects and learning experience. The four moderating variables all play a significant role in shaping the influence of the Metaverse on both learning effects and experience.

Through precise performance prediction, schools can quickly pinpoint students facing challenges and provide customized educational materials suited to their specific learning needs. The reliance on teachers&#39; experience to predict students&#39; academic performance has proven to be less accurate and efficient than desired. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed a marked surge in employing machine learning and data mining techniques to forecast students&#39; performance. However, the academic community has yet to agree on the most effective algorithm for predicting academic outcomes. Nonetheless, conducting an analysis and comparison of the existing algorithms in this field remains meaningful. Furthermore, recommendations for selecting an appropriate algorithm will be provided to interested researchers and educators based on their specific requirements. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature on academic performance predictions using machine-learning approaches in recent years. It details the variables analyzed, the algorithms implemented, the datasets utilized, and the evaluation metrics applied to assess model efficacy. What makes this work different is that relevant surveys in the past 10 years are also analyzed and compared, highlighting their contributions and review methods. Additionally, we compared the accuracy of various machine learning models using popular open-access datasets and determined the best-performing algorithms among them.

Traditionally, expensive Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) have been utilized to gather IoT physical features, which are critical for reliable authentication. However, the high cost of SDRs makes them impractical for widespread deployment across the vast and diverse IoT ecosystem. In contrast, this paper presents AUTHFi, a novel cross-technology device authentication framework that transforms the SDR approach for collecting and authenticating IoT device signals (e.g., ZigBee and Bluetooth) by utilizing commercial WiFi devices. Specifically, AUTHFi leverages the recent advances in Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) to reconstruct the partial waveform of IoT transmission, thus eliminating the requirement for expensive SDRs. AUTHFi requires us to address several unique challenges. First, AUTHFi compensates for signal losses of the partial waveform to get more signal information. Then, it introduces an enhanced Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation and a fusion neural network that combines CFO and the reconstructed waveform for accurate device authentication. We implement AUTHFi based on RTL8812au (commodity WiFi) and CC2652P (commodity ZigBee/Bluetooth). Our thorough evaluation confirms that AUTHFi offers reliable authentication under various settings, achieving a maximum accuracy of 94.2%.},

While there are numerous schemes for file replacement, it remains a challenge to achieve good, robust, and predictable performance simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce a general scheme called Incremental Least-Recently-Used (iLRU), which builds on the classic Least-Recently-Used (LRU) algorithm. iLRU initially caches only a “portion” of the file upon the first request and incrementally caches more when there are more requests for the file. In this regard, the request frequency can be inferred from the cached size without incurring additional overhead, where a larger cached size represents a higher request frequency. We derive the theoretical hit ratio of iLRU based on the Time-to-Live (TTL) analysis. With the Time-to-Live (TTL) analysis, we can theoretically derive the hit ratio and properties of iLRU and notably show that iLRU allocates more cache space to popular files, resulting in a higher hit ratio than LRU. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of iLRU and validate the accuracy of the theoretical hit ratio. Furthermore, we conduct simulations over various real-world traces to show that iLRU outperforms existing schemes across various real-world traces, defenestrating the robustness of iLRU.},

This also renders them incompatible with secure aggregation mechanisms that are widely employed in federated learning for privacy protection. Moreover, CFL introduces the risk of malicious clients dominating several clusters and conducting poisoning attacks therein, thereby threatening secure model training. To address these issues, we propose ProCFL, a Privacy-Enhanced and Robust CFL framework incorporating gradient-free clustering and peer validation. Specifically, we first design a new protocol for measuring data distribution similarity among clients without using their gradient information. Then, we transform the client clustering process into a weighted set covering problem and introduce a diversity-optimized clustering algorithm to achieve near-optimal clustering results while eliminating any need for prior knowledge. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc detection mechanism that employs peer validation to identify and discard malicious client models. Extensive experimental evaluation of ProCFL validates its superior model robustness and accuracy performance compared to existing schemes.},

Inspired by Bayesian games, we model incomplete stochastic games between IoT end-points and edge nodes in edge intelligence (EI)-enabled IoT systems to conduct probability analysis for predicting and defending privacy leakage caused by malware infection. It is notable that the posterior probability is defined based on the Bayes&#39; rule to reflect the statistical inference of incomplete privacy leakage information. Such a method can intrinsically characterize the actual situations of IoT end-points. Further, we propose a novel privacy preservation optimization approach named Bayesian advantage actor critic (BA2C) for the practical implementation of optimization decision in EI-enabled IoT privacy-preserving systems. Eventually, we conduct experimental simulations to understand the most effective parameters in decision-making among the successful detection rate, successful infection rate, and false alarm rate. We also compare traditional algorithms and validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {Using the wireless waveform superposition property, over-the-air computation (OAC) enables federated learning (FL) to achieve fast model aggregation. However, this computing paradigm is vulnerable to poisoning attacks due to the openness of a wireless channel over time, where malicious mobile devices can introduce cumulative errors for the global FL model in a time-varying wireless environment for each communication round. This article presents a trust online OAC (TO-OAC) scheme to minimize impacts on the global model introduced by malicious devices adjusting to dynamic attack and wireless channel fluctuations over time. TO-OAC achieves this by utilizing trustworthy security quantification of OAC for each FL training round. To optimize the cumulative training loss at the aggregation node with the long-term power and trust constraints of mobile devices, we propose a joint trust, power, and channel-aware algorithm to flexibly update local and global models in response to the dynamic changes in the wireless and secure environment. We analyze the performance limits for the aggregation of trust models, considering metrics for computation and communication through time. We then propose another trust online regularization over-the-air computation (TOR-OAC) as an improved version of the TO-OAC scheme to decrease convergence time while ensuring long-term trust and power limitation. Experimental results performed on real-life datasets show that the two proposed schemes (TO-OAC and TOR-OAC) outperform prior works, especially in noisy, time-varying wireless channels and malicious attacks.},

  abstract     = {With the explosive development of mobile devices, mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has emerged as a promising approach for large-scale sensing data collection. In the research of MCS, blockchain technology has been widely adopted to decentralize the traditional mobile crowdsensing and tackle the problem of single point of failure. Incentive mechanisms are devised to boost participation with fairness and truthfulness. However, to better determine the incentive strategy, participants&#39; privacy can be disclosed on top of the blockchain and obtained by adversaries during the transmission and execution of user data, leading to serious security issues. In this paper, we propose a two-stage incentive scheme with efficiency, robustness and privacy preservation considered based on the combination of blockchain technology and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Detailedly, we design two kinds of smart contracts, where on-chain public contracts support the procedure of general crowdsensing interactions, and off-chain private ones enabled by TEE complete the privacy-preserving computations, including an online incentive mechanism for worker recruitment decisions and a truth discovery algorithm for data aggregation. Recovery mechanism and hash check mechanism are introduced to avoid TEE provider failures and TEE providers&#39; attacks, respectively. Our scheme is proved to be theoretically secure in terms of private information protection, worker participation anonymity, and data aggregation privacy. Experimental results also verify the feasibility and superiority of our incentive scheme.},

  abstract     = {Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a prevailing technology for many emerging robotic applications. Achieving real-time SLAM on mobile robotic systems with limited computational resources is challenging because the complexity of SLAM algorithms increases over time. This restriction can be lifted by offloading computations to edge servers, forming the emerging paradigm of edge-assisted SLAM. Nevertheless, the exogenous and stochastic input processes affect the dynamics of the edge-assisted SLAM system. Moreover, the requirements of clients on SLAM metrics change over time, exerting implicit and time-varying effects on the system. In this paper, we aim to push the limit beyond existing edge-assist SLAM by proposing a new architecture that can handle the input-driven processes and also satisfy clients&#39; implicit and time-varying requirements. The key innovations of our work involve a regional feature prediction method for importance-aware local data processing, a configuration adaptation policy that integrates data compression/decompression and task offloading, and an input-dependent learning framework for task scheduling with constraint satisfaction. Extensive experiments prove that our architecture improves pose estimation accuracy and saves up to $47\%$ of communication costs compared with a popular edge-assisted SLAM system, as well as effectively satisfies the clients&#39; requirements.},

  abstract     = {Transparent objects are prevalent in everyday environments, but their distinct physical properties pose significant challenges for camera-guided robotic arms. Current research is mainly dependent on camera-only approaches, which often falter in suboptimal conditions, such as low-light environments. In response to this challenge, we present FuseGrasp, the first radar-camera fusion system tailored to enhance the transparent objects manipulation. FuseGrasp exploits the weak penetrating property of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals, which causes transparent materials to appear opaque, and combines it with the precise motion control of a robotic arm to acquire high-quality mmWave radar images of transparent objects. The system employs a carefully designed deep neural network to fuse radar and camera imagery, thereby improving depth completion and elevating the success rate of object grasping. Nevertheless, training FuseGrasp effectively is non-trivial, due to limited radar image datasets for transparent objects. We address this issue utilizing large RGB-D dataset, and propose an effective two-stage training approach: we first pre-train FuseGrasp on a large public RGB-D dataset of transparent objects, then fine-tune it on a self-built small RGB-D-Radar dataset. Furthermore, as a byproduct, FuseGrasp can determine the composition of transparent objects, such as glass or plastic, leveraging the material identification capability of mmWave radar. This identification result facilitates the robotic arm in modulating its grip force appropriately. Extensive testing reveals that FuseGrasp significantly improves the accuracy of depth reconstruction and material identification for transparent objects. Moreover, real-world robotic trials have confirmed that FuseGrasp markedly enhances the handling of transparent items.

While existing studies emphasize end-to-end latency, this paper investigates energy-efficient quality-of-service (QoS)-oriented microservice provisioning, focusing on both QoS satisfaction and power consumption (PC) conservation. We propose the Green and Intelligent Resource Provision (GIRP) architecture, integrating a data-driven energy-latency-aware resource allocation and scheduling manager to balance latency and PC. To reconcile the trade-offs involved, a dual-objective optimization problem is formulated to minimize latency and energy use by selecting proper servers, allocating CPU cores, and determining service replicas. To address challenges with discrete variables, dual objectives, and implicit mappings, we leverage a model-free deep deterministic policy gradient-based reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, we develop a multi-task agent via the Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts model to simultaneously make two separate actions regarding CPU core numbers and service replica numbers, followed by a single-task agent to determine service scheduling. Extensive experiments on the DeathStarBenchmark testbed validate GIRP&#39;s effectiveness, demonstrating approximately 52% resource savings and a 43% reduction in PC compared to leading methods like Sinan, Firm, and heuristic-based algorithms. These results highlight GIRP&#39;s capability to optimize microservice orchestration by balancing end-to-end latency and power efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning protects users&#39; data privacy by sharing users&#39; local model parameters (instead of raw data) with a server. However, when massive users train a large machine learning model through federated learning, the dynamically varying and often heavy communication overhead can put significant pressure on the network operator. The operator may choose to dynamically change the network prices in response, which will eventually affect the payoffs of the server and users. This paper considers the under-explored yet important issue of the joint design of participation incentives (for encouraging users&#39; contribution to federated learning) and network pricing (for managing network resources). Due to heterogeneous users&#39; private information and multi-dimensional decisions, the optimization problems in Stage I of multi-stage games are non-convex. Nevertheless, we are able to analytically derive the corresponding optimal contract and pricing mechanism through proper transformations of constraints, variables, and functions, under three interaction structures of the participants. We show that the coordinated structure is better than the two uncoordinated structures, as it avoids the selfish behaviors of the network operator and the server; the vertically uncoordinated structure is better than the horizontally uncoordinated structure, as it avoids the interests misalignment between the server and the network operator. We also propose multi-period network pricing to reduce the implementation complexity of dynamic pricing. Numerical results based on real-world datasets show that our proposed mechanisms decrease the server&#39;s cost by up to 24.87% and increase the network operator&#39;s profit by up to 1245.25%, compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

DRX is a time-domain power-saving technology that allows user equipment (UE) to switch off their radio frequency module. BWP switching is a frequency domain operation that allows UE to operate on only partial bandwidth for power saving. Investigating the interaction and trade-off between DRX and BWP is a must to optimize network efficiency and enhance network performance. This work proposed a novel BWP-DRX joint mechanism and its analytical model that leverages the concept of “Detect time” with the consideration of BWP switching delay. The model reduces packet loss rate by 50%, packet delay by 36% and increases the energy efficiency rate by 50% when arrival rate is high with the trade-off of 12% power efficiency reduction when arrival rate is low compared to the model without Detect time. The influence of each parameter is further analyzed to reach the best network efficiency under different traffic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Harvesting energy from ambient energy source is the key technology for self-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices to maintain continuous operation without an external power supply. Motivated by the expansion and popularity of 5G networks, we propose a novel solution for IoT devices which are self-powered via harvesting energy from the millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications in 5G mmWave networks. For overcoming the high path loss in mmWave communications, directional narrow-beam transmission is adopted to provide sufficient link budget between transceivers through beamforming technology, which however makes IoT devices difficult to scavenge energy from the mmWave signals. Hence, we employ multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to assist in energy harvesting at the IoT devices and data transmission at the 5G users. Considering beam codebook design for 5G mmWave networks, this paper jointly optimizes the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based transmit codevectors at the 5G base station (BS) and the phase shifts of IRS&#39;s reflective elements for minimizing BS&#39;s transmit power, while satisfying the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) constraints at users and energy harvesting constraints of IoT devices. Nevertheless, owing to the intricate coupling of variables and discrete constraints, this joint optimization problem is extremely non-convex and non-linear. To address such challenges, we propose a penalty dual-decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm which combines the penalty-based augmented Lagrangian method and block coordinate descent method. It explores the structure of the mmWave channel and performs a double iterations in which the joint optimization problem is decomposed into several simplified subproblems. Simulation results reveal that the above algorithm enhances the energy efficiency as compared to other algorithms.},

MAMF-RL combines reinforcement learning and moth-flame optimization algorithms to interactively search for the optimal broadcast beams. By decomposing the problem into multiple single-sector antenna configuration problems, MAMF-RL effectively reduces the algorithm complexity. We conducted experiments utilizing real data in an 18-sector wireless coverage area. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we compared it with traditional methods such as the particle swarm algorithm. The results demonstrate that our MAMF-RL model achieves an average coverage rate of 1.82% higher and a 13.74% lower overlapping coverage rate compared to traditional methods.},

For long-endurance flights, we design and implement a buoyancy-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can use buoyancy lift to decrease the weight and increase the battery capacity so that the flight time can be significantly extended. However, the balloons of the buoyancy-aided UAV can cause “an inverted pendulum effect” and an instability issue on the drone attitude because the increased surface is easily affected by the gusty wind. We propose a buoyancy-aided adaptive stabilization control (BAASC) method with the DRL to stabilize the attitude and extend the flight time of the quadrotor-based buoyancy-aided UAV. This proposed model can immediately control the speeds of all rotors to balance the attitude based on the current state of the drone. Therefore, the degree of swing can be stabilized, and the inverted pendulum effect can be eliminated. The experimental results reveal that the designed buoyancy-aided UAV with the proposed BAASC scheme can effectively stabilize the attitude to extend the flight time by 112.8% compared with a nonbuoyancy-aided UAV under a gusty wind disturbance.},

The inflexible updating timescales lead to poor performance in the production networks. In this paper, we propose EdgeTimer, an unprecedented approach that automatically and adaptively determines respective updating timescales of multiple scheduling layers to achieve a better trade-off between the operation cost and service performance. Specifically, we design (i) a three-layer hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for efficient learning of tightly coupled policies, (ii) a tailored multi-agent DRL algorithm for decentralized scheduling, with the convergence strictly proved, and (iii) a lightweight system defender for deterministic reliability assurance. Furthermore, we apply EdgeTimer to a wide range of Kubernetes scheduling rules, and evaluate it using production traces with different workload patterns. Through extensive trace-driven experiments, we demonstrate that EdgeTimer can significantly decrease the operation cost for service providers without sacrificing the delay performance, thereby improving overall profits, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

This study presents a hierarchical aerial computing platform leveraging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platform (HAP) to meet the computation demands and latency requirements of various IoT applications for GUs. We propose a joint offloading decision, user association, and resource allocation (JOUR) scheme, utilizing binary offloading from GUs to UAVs and partial offloading from UAVs to HAP. The proposed scheme minimizes the energy consumption and latency while maximizing the load balancing. A matching game-based algorithm addresses the GUs offloading decision and GUs-UAVs association, followed by an enhanced soft actor-critic (ESAC) algorithm for UAV partial offloading decision, UAV computation resource allocation, and HAP computation resource allocation. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the JOUR scheme in reducing the energy consumption and latency, while improving the load balancing and task completion rates. This demonstrates its potential for optimizing the hierarchical aerial computing platforms in dynamic IoT environments.},

  abstract     = {Network slicing architecture is expected to fulfill network applications with heterogeneous requirements through efficient slice admission control (SAC) policies. Existing SAC approaches entirely rely on current limited observations to make admission decisions, ignoring the potential impact of future demands. The short-sighted behaviors lead to poor service performance and infrastructure providers&#39; (InPs&#39;) revenue in practice. In this paper, we propose OACR$^{2}$, an online SAC approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can exploit predictable future requests to make more precise admission control decisions for the long-term revenue, and reserve proper resources accordingly. Specifically, we design three novel schemes: (i) a requirement predictor based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and a novel input-output way to predict future unforeseen requests, (ii) a DRL admission controller based on the partially observable Markov decision process model to make precise admission decisions without accurate future request information, with the convergence strictly proved, and (iii) a decision defender to guarantee decision reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world traces demonstrate that compared to the No-wait, Wait-queue, and Wait-earliest time approaches, OACR$^{2}$ improves InPs&#39; revenue and acceptance ratio by up to 40.9% and 16.7%, respectively, without sacrificing online inference time (within 0.9 milliseconds).},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) technology, as a latency-sensitive application, can achieve real-time response to enhance the user&#39;s quality of experience (QoE) on edge devices. However, edge servers, unlike internally managed cloud servers, are prone to hardware failures, software abnormalities, and network attacks. Most prior studies have focused on reducing service delay and improving user coverage through service entity (SE) placement, often neglecting the critical impact of edge server malfunctions on user QoE. In this work, we design a stable service entity placement framework that connects users on faulty servers to collaborative edge servers, ensuring seamless task completion. This framework presents two primary challenges: determining the grouping of collaborative edge services and the placement of SEs. To address these challenges, we introduce a heuristic stable service entity placement (H-STEP) scheme. This scheme first determines the grouping of collaborative edge servers using an iterative search algorithm and then places SEs on suitable edge servers via a fast non-dominated sorting genetic placement algorithm. This approach balances stability benefits with total cost, enhancing the system&#39;s economic benefits. We theoretically analyze the performance of H-STEP and derive the performance gap between H-STEP and the optimal scheme. Extensive real-data-driven simulations demonstrate that H-STEP&#39;s performance closely approximates that of the optimal scheme and surpasses existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {The increasing popularity of earable devices stimulates great academic interest to design novel head gesture-based interaction technologies. But existing works simply consider it as a singular activity recognition problem. This is not in line with practice since users may have different body movements such as walking and jogging along with head gestures. It is also beneficial to recognize body movements during human-device interaction since it provides useful context information. As a result, it is significant to recognize such composite activities in which actions of different body parts happen simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a system called CHAR to recognize composite head-body activities with a single IMU sensor. The key idea of our solution is to make use of the inter-correlation of different activities and design a multi-task learning network to extract shared and specific representations. We implement a real-time prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate it. The results show that CHAR can recognize 60 kinds of composite activities (12 head gestures and 5 body movements) with high accuracies of 89.7% and 85.1% in sufficient data and insufficient data cases, respectively.},

Moreover, the privacy risk in model sharing and client data heterogeneity impact the efficacy of federated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal federated learning system named MASA. As a departure from existing approaches, MASA simultaneously enhances the model learning efficiency of both multimodal and unimodal clients while ensuring their data privacy. Firstly, we employ a gated cross-modal distillation scheme to achieve performance-aware knowledge transfer across modality-heterogeneous clients. To enhance the system security, MASA integrates a lightweight split-shuffle mechanism to realize the anonymization and encryption of model aggregation. Moreover, to reach personalized collaboration while protecting privacy, MASA features an attention-based spontaneous client clustering mechanism to form client cluster structures securely and distributedly. We evaluate our MASA on four public multimodal datasets for human activity recognition. The results show that our MASA outperforms leading multimodal federated learning methods on the model performance of both multimodal and unimodal clients.},

The metal coil vibration patterns of headset speakers/microphones have been proven to be highly correlated with the speaker-produced/microphone-received sound. This paper presents an online conversation eavesdropping system, RFSpy, which uses only one RFID tag attached on a headset to alternately sense metal coil vibrations of headset speaker and microphone for eavesdropping on speaker-produced and microphone-received sound. In some accessible scenarios, assuming attackers secretly attach a small, battery-free RFID tag under one ear cushion of an eavesdropped user&#39;s headset without being noticed. Meanwhile, RFID readers are camouflaged as decorations placed in/out of rooms to transmit and receive RF signals. When the eavesdropped user talks with other users online through the headset, RFSpy first activates the RFID tag to capture the metal coil vibration patterns of headset speaker and microphone upon RF signals. Then, RFSpy reconstructs sound spectrograms from the RF signal-based vibration patterns for not only trained words but also untrained (i.e., out-of-vocabulary) words utilizing designed SSR network. Finally, RFSpy converts the sound spectrograms to conversation content through sound recognition API. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFSpy can eavesdrop on online conversations with out-of-vocabulary words effectively.},

To tackle this issue, a multimodal scale normalization framework is proposed for the scale-robust precise pixel-level UAV positioning. The framework exploits our proposed distance-aware image slicing and distance-aware scale normalization module. Moreover, a modal fusion-based scale normalization network is proposed that can accept arbitrary low-resolution UAV patches and produce the consistent high-resolution images at a uniform UAV instance scale with a single learnable model. The proposed framework is generic and can be directly used in the existing pixel-level positioning pipelines to improve the positioning performance and scale robustness. To verify the proposed framework in the real application, a practical vision-radar UAV positioning system is developed. Experimental results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our framework.

To mitigate the impact of stragglers, system heterogeneity, including heterogeneous computing and network bandwidth, has been addressed. While previous studies have addressed system heterogeneity by splitting models into submodels, they offer limited flexibility in model architecture design, without considering potential inconsistencies arising from training multiple submodel architectures. We propose nested federated learning (NeFL), a generalized framework that efficiently divides deep neural networks into submodels using both depthwise and widthwise scaling. To address the inconsistency arising from training multiple submodel architectures, NeFL decouples a subset of parameters from those being trained for each submodel. An averaging method is proposed to handle these decoupled parameters during aggregation. NeFL enables resource-constrained devices to effectively participate in the FL pipeline, facilitating larger datasets for model training. Experiments demonstrate that NeFL achieves performance gain, especially for the worst-case submodel compared to baseline approaches (7.63% improvement on CIFAR-100). Furthermore, NeFL aligns with recent advances in FL, such as leveraging pre-trained models and accounting for statistical heterogeneity. Our code is available online [1].},

However, maintaining mapping accuracy under constrained and dynamic communication resources remains a significant challenge for the practical deployment of robot swarms. Concurrent data uploads from multiple agents can exacerbate network congestion, leading to the loss of critical information, delayed updates, and, ultimately, the inconsistency of the generated maps. This paper presents Hermes, an edge-assisted collaborative mapping system designed for communication-constrained environments. Hermes streamlines data transfer through bandwidth-aware map distillation, ensuring only the most crucial messages are transmitted to the edge server. We quantify the importance of keyframes and landmarks based on their information entropy gain in pose estimation. By selectively sharing essential submaps, Hermes adaptively balances communication bandwidth and information richness during the mapping process. We implemented Hermes on heterogeneous platforms and conducted experiments using public datasets and self-collected campus data. Hermes exceeds SwarmMap by 50% in bandwidth utilization with similar accuracy and surpasses COVINS-G by 65% in trajectory error under highly constrained network resources.},

However, the high computational demands of MNNs clash with limited on-device resources. MNNs involve input and model redundancies during inference, wasting resources to process redundant input components and run excess model parameters. Model Redundancy Elimination (MRE) reduces redundant parameters but cannot bypass inference for unnecessary input components. Input Redundancy Elimination (IRE) skips inference for redundant input components but cannot reduce computation for the remaining parts. MRE and IRE independently fail to meet the diverse computational needs of multimodal inference. To address these issues, we aim to combine the advantages of MRE and IRE to achieve a more efficient inference. We propose an adaptive multilevel redundancy elimination framework (AMRE), which supports both IRE and MRE. AMRE first establishes a collaborative inference mechanism for IRE and MRE. We then propose a multifunctional, lightweight policy model that adaptively controls the inference logic for each instance. Moreover, a three-stage training method is proposed to ensure the performance of collaborative inference in AMRE. We validate AMRE in three scenarios, achieving up to 52.91% lower latency, 56.79% lower energy cost, and a slight accuracy gain compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing service (MCS) providers recruit users to complete data collection tasks with an incentive mechanism. How to maximize the utility of service providers has long been a popular topic in MCS research. Applying the existing reverse auction mechanism to an MCS may result in excessively high payments, thereby reducing the utility of the MCS provider. The affine maximizer auction (AMA) mechanism increases the revenue of service providers and meets dominant-strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC) characteristics. However, the AMA mechanism is a forward auction mechanism and cannot be applied to MCSs. Inspired by the AMA mechanism, this paper innovatively proposes a reverse affine maximizer auction (RAMA) mechanism to solve the task allocation problem of MCSs, effectively improving the MCS provider utility. Specifically, we construct a RAMA theoretical model and prove that the mechanism satisfies DSIC characteristics. For the discrete MCS task allocation problem, we use the reverse virtual valuation combinatorial auction (RVVCA) mechanism, a subclass of RAMA, to design a random mechanism ${\mathrm{RVVCA}}^{t}$ and prove that the ${\mathrm{RVVCA}}^{t}$ has a logarithmic approximate ratio. For the differentiable MCS task allocation problem, we use the deep learning transformer framework to design RAMANet, which can fit an exponential number of allocation solutions and output the optimal allocation and payment. We experimentally compare the algorithms of the RAMA family we propose, which use affine maximization, with existing state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating that the proposed algorithms significantly improve MCS provider utility.},

Especially when differentiated services are transmitted concurrently, disharmonious transmission can give rise to resource contention, causing a large number of subflows to congest a single path and leading to performance degradation. To mitigate these challenges, this paper introduces HarmonyPath, a fine-grained flexible multipath transmission mechanism that can ensure harmonious resource occupation. Specifically, HarmonyPath firstly employs an in-band telemetry protocol to gather path resource information, generating a network resource distribution map. Based on this map, it flexibly allocates path resources according to the network resource distribution and service requirements. Then, HarmonyPath establishes a collaborative matching model for service demands and path resources. Through matrix transformation and calculation, it rapidly generates and deploys the scheduling strategy. To further alleviate service contention, HarmonyPath employs heuristic algorithms to optimize the scheduling strategy and achieve precise multipath transmission. Experiments demonstrate that HarmonyPath surpasses traditional algorithms in the multipath transmission of differentiated services, offering flexible service resource guarantees and enhancing network resource utilization efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Contactless mmWave-based human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for various applications, yet most existing approaches often assume consistent environments. Integrating domain adaptation offers a promising solution to this challenge. This prevailing paradigm works well when the source and target data are centralized on a single server while learning to adapt. However, in more universal and practical situations, such as personal health records, users&#39; biometric information, and financial issues, the raw data is typically protected by different privacy-preserving policies and is stored by multiple parties. Additionally, labeling RF signals in the target domain is a non-trivial and labor-intensive task for most end-users. To address these problems, this paper introduces FMDA, a federated multi-source domain adaptation framework for mmWave-based HAR. FMDA assesses the contribution of each source and performs weighted parameter aggregation for knowledge transfer. This facilitates unsupervised training of the target HAR model without requiring access to any source domain data. Moreover, the model is optimized by minimizing the generalization gaps between the source and target models, benefiting all participants during the learning process and enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FMDA. The results indicate that in the target domain, FMDA achieves comparable performance to supervised learning approaches, while also enhancing the efficacy of source domain models to varying degrees.},

Our methodology uncovers various metamorphosis scenarios, including re-births, re-branding, re-purposing, and others, enabling comprehensive characterisation.

Existing model compression works downgrade the prediction accuracy and fail to adapt to dynamic network bandwidth or hardware changes. Besides, the split inference for typical Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is inefficient for LVM&#39;s large intermediate result size. To address the computation and bandwidth limitation of edge devices of LVM, we design a new split inference acceleration LVMScissor by leveraging model parallelism and meta-heuristic algorithm. We first implement an inter-layer ViT parallelism strategy. After modeling the parallelized ViT split problem into a Multi-task three-processor scheduling (MTS) problem, we propose LVM-MSSA, a scheduling algorithm based on a famous meta-heuristic algorithm, the Multi-objective Salp Swarm Algorithm (MSSA) to schedule model parallelism and split strategy. The evaluation results show that compared to state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches, our solution is faster from $1.6\times$ to $6.92\times$ under variant LVMs, edge devices, datasets, and network traces.},

This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates contract-inspired contest theory, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and GDMs to optimize image generation in these resource-constrained environments. The framework addresses the critical challenges of resource allocation and semantic data transmission quality by incentivizing edge devices to efficiently transmit high-quality semantic data, which is essential for creating realistic and immersive images. The use of contest and contract theory ensures that edge devices are motivated to allocate resources effectively, while DRL dynamically adjusts to network conditions, optimizing the overall image generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves the quality of generated images but also achieves superior convergence speed and stability compared to traditional methods. This makes the framework particularly effective for optimizing complex resource allocation tasks in mobile edge Metaverse applications, offering enhanced performance and efficiency in creating immersive virtual environments.},

However, due to diverse application requirements and user demands, providing individualized transmission services that meet these requirements within CCNN remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a Cybertwin-enabled multipath transmission scheme (CMTS) to provide personalized quality-of-service (QoS)-guaranteed transmission services by dynamically creating network paths tailored to users&#39; demands. Specifically, by introducing Cybertwin, CMTS allows separate and dynamic scheduling of service and access network resources from different providers, decouples users from network providers, and enables more flexible use of heterogeneous network resources. Moreover, CMTS can make resource scheduling decisions on demand by leveraging the user&#39;s personal information held by Cybertwin. To fully exploit the potential of multiple paths, we formulate network resource planning as an optimization problem aimed at minimizing link differences and propose a heuristic method for determining optimal policies. Finally, we present the first implementation of Cybertwin in CCNN, validate CMTS in both emulated and semi-physical environments, and conduct thorough evaluations with benchmarks. The results show that CMTS can deliver a personalized, QoS-guaranteed transmission service while achieving efficient resource utilization.},

As a result, this paper investigates the blockage-resilient ISAC design that leverages the robustness offered by multi-base station (BS) collaboration. Given the dynamic blockages and the fluctuation in the targets&#39; radar cross section (RCS), the blockage-resilient multiBS collaborative ISAC design is cast as a chance constrained integer programming (CCIP) by jointly considering the diverse deadlines of different sensing tasks and the spatial/temporal user-target pairing for dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) waveform scheduling. To facilitate efficient solution finding, we develop a group concatenating assisted reinforcement learning (GCRL) algorithm, where we linearize the chance constraints via variable grouping and concatenation, enabling the RL agent to understand the problem structure with bipartite graphs so as to develop an efficient branching policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the resilience of the obtained ISAC scheme to dynamic blockages.},

This paper introduces a reliable communication method that combines multi-modal semantic communication with UAV-assisted vehicle MEC to minimize delays in communication and computation while maintaining semantic accuracy during jamming attacks. Our approach optimizes UAV trajectories, user associations, and channel selections, enabling the UAV to select optimal positions when associating with different modal users and reducing the impact of jammers during multi-modal task reception.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces mmEcho, a new acoustic eavesdropping method that utilizes millimeter-wave signals to sense vibration induced by sound precisely. Through signal processing techniques such as the intra-chirp scheme and phase calibration algorithm, mmEcho achieves micrometer-level vibration extraction without requiring target-related data. To improve the range of eavesdropping attacks while reducing noise, we optimize radar signals by leveraging the widespread availability of multiple antennas on commercial off-the-shelf radars. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of mmEcho in different real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that, with the aid of multi-antenna technology, mmEcho can more effectively reconstruct the audio from the target at various distances, directions, sound insulators, reverberating objects, sound levels, and languages.

  abstract     = {Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is one of the fundamental medium access control (MAC) protocols for ad hoc networks. As a network&#39;s size increases, its throughput degrades substantially because of packet collisions. To reduce the collision probability, combining non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with CSMA/CA is a promising solution. However, existing NOMA-CSMA/CA protocols adopt distributed power selection and channel inversion power control, resulting in a high power collision probability and limiting the number of power levels. To address these issues, we propose a power back-off NOMA-based CSMA/CA (PBN-CSMA/CA) protocol for ad hoc networks. The proposed protocol achieves centralized power allocation, avoiding power collisions by employing the Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence and the power level allocation (PLA) frame. Additionally, power back-off (PB) control is used to set the transmission power, which expands the number of power levels and gives full play to the performance advantages of NOMA. To analyze the performance comprehensively, the closed-form expressions of the average outage probability, normalized saturation throughput, average packet delay and transmission energy consumption are theoretically analyzed. Both the analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the PBN-CSMA/CA protocol outperforms the existing NOMA-CSMA/CA and traditional CSMA/CA protocols, with significant throughput gains and delay reductions.},

The situations of upload bandwidths are generally similar to those of download bandwidths, except that 5G upload bandwidths manifest N-shaped $( \nearrow \searrow \nearrow )$ fluctuations. Our cross-layer and cross-technology analysis reveals a variety of impact factors as well as their complicated interplay as the root causes, such as the bottlenecks in underlying infrastructure (e.g., communication devices and wired Internet access), the traffic offloading from one access technology to another, the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the side effects of aggressively migrating radio resources from 4G to 5G. With the longitudinal, holistic picture of today&#39;s mobile access bandwidth, we finally provide multifold practical implications on closing the technology gaps.},

  abstract     = {Integrating low-light image enhancement techniques, in which diffusion-based AI-generated content (AIGC) models are promising, is necessary to enhance nighttime teleoperation. Remarkably, the AIGC model is computation-intensive, thus necessitating the allocation of AIGC tasks to edge servers with ample computational resources. Given the distinct cost of the AIGC model trained with varying-sized datasets and AIGC tasks possessing disparate demand, it is imperative to formulate a differential pricing strategy to optimize the utility of teleoperators and edge servers concurrently. Nonetheless, the pricing strategy formulation is under information asymmetry, i.e., the demand (e.g., the difficulty level of AIGC tasks and their distribution) of AIGC tasks is hidden information to edge servers. Additionally, manually assessing the difficulty level of AIGC tasks is tedious and unnecessary for teleoperators. To this end, we devise a framework of AIGC task allocation assisted by the Vision Language Model (VLM)-empowered contract theory, which includes two components: VLM-empowered difficulty assessment and contract theory-assisted AIGC task allocation. The first component enables automatic and accurate AIGC task difficulty assessment. The second component is capable of formulating the pricing strategy for edge servers under information asymmetry, thereby optimizing the utility of both edge servers and teleoperators. The simulation results demonstrated that our proposed framework can improve the average utility of teleoperators and edge servers by $10.88 \sim 12.43\%$ and $1.4 \sim 2.17\%$, respectively.

  abstract     = {Blood pressure (BP) is a critical physiological parameter closely associated with severe diseases such as heart failure and kidney damage. Current methods either require additional or dedicated hardware, or closing touching to the devices, causing discomfort and inconvenience. Therefore, a convenient, contactless BP measurement solution is highly desired. In this work, we present Ubicon-BP, a ubiquitous, device-free, and contactless BP detection application. Ubicon-BP calculates BP based on the pulse transit time (PTT), a key feature that is medically proven correlated with BP. However, using smartphone sensors to contactless calculate PTT is non-trivial since it requires a micro-second level precision for cardiac event detection. To address this issue, we propose leveraging the acoustic sensors in smartphone to detect vibrations caused by heart valve movements, as well as camera sensors to measure finger pulses. To accurately measure heartbeat signal that are susceptible to motion, we first improve the sensing granularity of acoustic signals and then introduce the IQ-MVED model to eliminate motion interference. Furthermore, when recovering pulse signals from video signals, issues such as poor generalization performance arise. Consequently, we propose the TS-CAN and meta-learning models to obtain personalized pulse signals. Finally, we transform the extracted time-frequency features from the recovered heartbeats and pulse signals to the corresponding BP. Comprehensive testing involving 50 subjects reveal a standard deviation error of 4.27mmHg for diastolic pressure and 6.36mmHg for systolic pressure, respectively.},

  abstract     = {A UAV team shows tremendous potential for various mobile scenarios. However, some evidences reveal their vulnerability to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, which can significantly jeopardize the flight security or even lead to catastrophic incidents. Existing studies primarily focus on detecting or defending against FDI attacks at the trajectory control of individual UAVs, leaving a gap in a comprehensive secure mechanism that can simultaneously detect, localize, and compensate for such attacks across an entire UAV team. The complexity of developing such a solution is magnified by the multiple design goals, the inherent sophistication of UAV team, and practical attack assumptions. In this paper, we propose a joint secure framework based on multi-task deep learning to simultaneously detect FDI attacks, localize the compromised components, and compensate control signals to mitigate the impact of FDI attacks on promising UAV teams. Specifically, we design an all-in-one deep learning model framework with a temporal-spatial information extraction module and a hierarchical multi-task module to perform three tasks simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce an iterative learning method with experience replay to counteract knowledge decay during model training. Extensive experiments and real flight demonstrations are presented to validate the improved performance and the benefits of our proposed secure method.

  abstract     = {Nowadays, cross-device federated learning (FL) is the key to achieving personalization services for mobile users and has been widely employed by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Alibaba in production. With the explosive growth in the number of participants, the central FL server, which acts as the manager and aggregator of cross-device model training, would get overloaded, becoming the system bottlenecks. Inspired by the emerging wave of edge computing, an interesting question arises: Could edge clouds help cross-device FL systems overcome the bottleneck? This article provides a cautiously optimistic answer by proposing INP, a FL-specific In-Network Processing framework to achieve the goal. As in-network processing has broken the end-to-end principle of the involved communication and lacks the support of transport protocols, the key is to design domainspecific transport protocols for INP. To fill the gap, we propose the novel Model Download Protocol of MDP and Model Upload Protocol of MUP. With MDP and MUP, edge cloud nodes along the paths in INP can easily eliminate duplicated model downloads and pre-aggregate associated gradient uploads for the central FL server, thus alleviating its bottleneck effect, and further accelerating the entire training progress significantly.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as a viable solution for local-privacy-aware collaborative model training in wireless edge networks, but its practical deployment is hindered by the high communication overhead caused by frequent and costly server-device synchronization. Notably, most existing communication-efficient FL algorithms fail to reduce the significant inter-device variance resulting from the prevalent issue of device heterogeneity. This variance severely decelerates algorithm convergence, increasing communication overhead and making it more challenging to achieve a well-performed model. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient FL algorithm, named FedQVR, which relies on a sophisticated variance-reduced scheme to achieve heterogeneity-robustness in the presence of quantized transmission and heterogeneous local updates among active edge devices. Comprehensive theoretical analysis justifies that FedQVR is inherently resilient to device heterogeneity and has a comparable convergence rate even with a small number of quantization bits, yielding significant communication savings. Besides, considering non-ideal wireless channels, we propose FedQVR-E which enhances the convergence of FedQVR by performing joint allocation of bandwidth and quantization bits across devices under constrained transmission delays. Extensive experimental results are also presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms over their counterparts in terms of both communication efficiency and application performance.},

NR implements mixed numerology with flexible frame structures for future compatibility, whereas NOMA allows users with different channel states to share an identical Physical Resource Block (PRB). Multi-connectivity enables a user to connect to multiple networks for reliability, and multicast conveys data to users simultaneously that request the same content. However, resource allocation in the NOMA-based mixed numerology system with multi-connectivity for multicast remains unexplored. The problem is challenging due to 1) the different shapes of PRBs in NR and 2) the shared locations of PRBs in a frame with NOMA. In this paper, we formulate a new optimization problem, named Multicast, Multi-connectivity, and Multi-Dimensional Resource Allocation Problem (M $^{3}$ DRAP), and prove its NP-hardness and inapproximability. We propose an approximation algorithm for general M $^{3}$ DRAP with the ideas of Multicast Inter-Numerology Relation, Layer Dissimilarity, Subgrouping Nonuniformity, and Segmentation Preference. To find the intrinsic properties of PRB allocation for multicast in NOMA-based networks, we consider a single B5G usage scenario (e.g., eMBB, URLLC, or mMTC) and propose another approximation algorithm. Simulations demonstrate our algorithms improve the weighted sum rate by over 50% and increase the user satisfaction ratio by 1.5x.},

However, due to the simultaneous and constant model updates gathering from massive distributed clients, the central server generally becomes a performance bottleneck. Additionally, the stateful aggregation (retaining all the updates from each client) conducted by the central server further poses potential threats to privacy, since it may recover the raw data based on such model updates inversely. The state-of-the-art methodologies, however, fail to address these two problems concurrently and efficiently. To this end, we propose GAIN, a secure aggregation acceleration service for federated learning. At its core, GAIN leverages programmable switches deployed at the edge network to aggregate model updates in a stateless manner before transmitting them to the central server. Consequently, GAIN can accelerate the transmission and aggregation of model updates while eliminating the chance of recovering private data. We evaluate the performance of GAIN through FPGA-based experiments and large-scale simulations. The results show that GAIN can effectively reduce bandwidth overhead and achieve up to 4.11× training throughput acceleration while prioritizing privacy protection.},

Usually, an appropriate decision on user association requires timely channel information between vehicles and base stations (BSs), which is challenging given a fast-fading mmWave vehicular channel. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity semi-distributed contextual correlated upper confidence bound (SD-CC-UCB) algorithm to establish an up-to-date user association between vehicles and BSs without explicit measurement of channel state information (CSI). Under a contextual multi-arm bandits framework, SD-CC-UCB learns and predicts the transmission rate given the location and velocity of the vehicle, which can adequately capture the intricate channel condition for a prompt decision on user association. Further, SD-CC-UCB efficiently identifies the set of candidate BSs which probably support supreme transmission rates by leveraging the correlated distributions of transmission rates on different locations. To further refine the learning transmission rate to candidate BSs, each vehicle deploys the Thompson Sampling algorithm by taking the interference among vehicles and handover into consideration. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm achieves the network throughput within 100%-103% of a benchmark algorithm which requires perfect instantaneous CSI, demonstrating the effectiveness of SD-CC-UCB in vehicular communications.},

However, deploying STAR-RIS indoors presents challenges in interference mitigation, power consumption, and real-time configuration. In this work, a novel network architecture utilizing multiple access points (APs), STAR-RISs, and NOMA is proposed for indoor communication. To address these, we formulate an optimization problem involving user assignment, access point (AP) beamforming, and STAR-RIS phase control. A decomposition approach is used to solve the complex problem efficiently, employing a many-to-one matching algorithm for user-AP assignment and K-means clustering for resource management. Additionally, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) is leveraged to optimize the control of the STAR-RIS. Within the proposed MADRL framework, a novel approach is introduced in which each decision variable acts as an independent agent, enabling collaborative learning and decision making. The MADRL framework is enhanced by incorporating convex approximation (CA), which accelerates policy learning through suboptimal solutions from successive convex approximation (SCA), leading to faster adaptation and convergence.

Current HD map crowdsourcing mechanisms aim to enhance HD map freshness within recruitment budgets. However, many overlook unique and critical traits of crowdsourcing vehicles, such as random arrival and heterogeneity, leading to either compromised map freshness or excessive recruitment costs. Furthermore, these characteristics complicate the characterization of the feasible space of the optimal recruitment policy, necessitating a method to compute it efficiently in dynamic transportation scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and cost-effective vehicle recruitment (ENTER) mechanism. Specifically, the ENTER mechanism has a threshold structure and balances freshness with recruitment costs while accounting for the vehicles&#39; random arrival and heterogeneity. It also integrates the bound-based relative value iteration (RVI) algorithm, which utilizes the threshold-type structure and upper bounds of thresholds to reduce the feasible space and expedite convergence. Numerical results show that the proposed ENTER mechanism increases the HD map company&#39;s payoff by 23.40% and 43.91% compared to state-of-the-art mechanisms that do not account for vehicle heterogeneity and random arrivals, respectively. Furthermore, the bound-based RVI algorithm in the ENTER mechanism reduces computation time by an average of 18.91% compared to the leading RVI-based algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a dynamic pricing mechanism based near-optimal resource allocation for elastic edge offloading. First, we construct a resource pricing model and accordingly develop the utility functions for both EU and ES, the optimal pricing model parameters are derived by optimizing the utility functions. In the meantime, our theoretical analysis reveals that the EU&#39;s utility function reaches a local maximum within the search range, but exhibits barely growth with increased resource allocation beyond this point. To this end, we further propose the Dynamic Inertia and Speed-Constrained particle swarm optimization (DISC-PSO) algorithm, which efficiently identifies the near-optimal resource allocation. Comprehensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of DISC-PSO algorithm, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms existing schemes by reducing the average number of iterations to reach a near-optimal solution by 86.88%, increasing the EU utility function value by 0.13%, and decreasing the variance of results by 96.78%.},

  abstract     = {The prevalence of the pre-training &amp; fine-tuning paradigm enables machine learning models to quickly adapt to various downstream tasks by fine-tuning pre-trained foundation models (FMs), greatly facilitating various IoT applications that rely on model inference in dynamic edge serverless environments. Efficiently dispatching inference requests and configuring instances to batch inference requests can significantly enhance resource efficiency. However, existing serverless inference solutions are tailored for traditional models, make coarse-grained request dispatching and instance configuration decisions, fail to exploit the shared model backbone characteristics of the FM and capture delayed rewards in dynamic environments, and ignore communication latency between edge sites, resulting in high costs and constraint violations. In this paper, we leverage our insight that fine-grained batch inference requests can effectively exploit the shared model backbone feature of FM to save monetary costs. We propose an algorithm that incorporates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and expert intervention for fine-grained request dispatching and instance configuration, where the DRL component outputs fractional solutions as guidance, while the expert intervention module integrates our insights—batching reduces monetary costs at the expense of increased inference latency, whereas higher configurations shorten inference latency. This module rounds fractional solutions and adjusts instance configurations to search for optimal solutions while satisfying constraints, with theoretical guarantees rigorously proved. Finally, we conducted our experiments on an OpenFaas-based platform and simulator, and extensive trace-driven evaluation results show that ExpertDRL can save costs by up to 85.14% and improve request acceptance ratio by up to 26.93%, compared to the state-of-the-art solution.},

  abstract     = {Wi-Fi-based device-free localization (DFL) will be an integral part of many emerging applications, such as smart healthcare and smart homes. One popular approach to DFL in Wi-Fi makes use of fingerprinting based on channel state information (CSI). Unfortunately, high-quality fingerprints cannot easily be obtained in many real-world environments due to the complicated, time-varying and multipath conditions which exist. Additionally, existing methods struggle to update the DFL models in a real-time manner to track changes of environment. To address these issues, an online data-driven modelling DFL framework is designed for robustness enhancement. Specifically, the raw CSI data is first augmented with the hidden layer parameters of an online deep neural network to strengthen the pair-to-pair mappings between signal variations and a target&#39;s location. The radio map created with the augmented fingerprints can be updated with new sequential data collected from other domains, such as different times and layouts of the same environment. Subsequently, a novel online DFL model is established using these augmented fingerprints, which itself can be updated with new sequential data from other domains without the need for retraining. A forgetting mechanism is considered to mitigate the effects of outdated data on the localization performance. To validate our new framework, a comprehensive set of experiments have been performed in various environments for different scenarios. The experimental results verify the robustness and responsive tracking ability of the proposed online data-driven modelling DFL framework.},

However, due to the differing structures of heterogeneous models, it is hard to use them to identify clients with similar data distributions and further enhance the personalization of local models. Therefore, how to deal with data heterogeneity to obtain superior personalized local models for clients, while simultaneously addressing model heterogeneity and system risks is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL framework with fine-gRained layEr aggregAtion and Decentralized cluStering (Reads), which integrates four key components: (1) deep mutual learning with privacy guarantee for model training and privacy preservation, (2) fine-grained layer similarity computation among heterogeneous model layers, (3) fully decentralized clustering for soft clustering of clients based on layer similarities, and (4) personalized layer aggregation for capturing common knowledge from other clients. Through Reads, clients obtain personalized models that accommodate model heterogeneity, while the system ensures robustness against a single point of failure.

  abstract     = {In pursuit of low latency, real-time communication (RTC) service providers usually use multi-hop overlay links worldwide to bypass congested links, especially for medium- and long-distance transmissions. In such multi-hop long-distance transmission scenarios, utilizing retransmission to recover lost packets can result in increased end-to-end latency. Therefore, Forward Error Correction (FEC) is viewed as a promising way to solve the loss problem. However, for multi-hop overlay transmission, existing FEC schemes either introduce a non-negligible processing delay at each hop or reduce the processing delay at the cost of a high coefficient overhead. In this work, we propose a multi-hop FEC scheme, i.e., FEC-OEM, which considers both processing delay and coefficient overhead. FEC-OEM is designed based on two observations we obtained from measurements. First, coefficient overhead can only be reduced through an implicit transmission way. Therefore, we design a modulation-based recoding module that enables implicit coefficient transmission and hop-by-hop recoding at the same time. Second, using on-the-fly computation is a promising way to reduce processing delay. Accordingly, we design an elimination method to make the modulation-based recoding can be carried out on-the-fly. Real-world experiments demonstrate that FEC-OEM can reduce the processing delay by up to 88% without increasing the coefficient overhead compared to state-of-the-art schemes. We also use FEC-OEM to transmit packets for applications with different loss tolerances, and the results show that FEC-OEM can improve the QoE more effectively than state-of-the-art coding schemes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted base stations (UAV-MBSs) provide flexible wireless connectivity, extending communication coverage in underserved areas. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown great potential for cooperative UAV swarm control to support efficient communication coverage in dynamic and complex environments. However, existing MARL-based methods often suffer from low sample efficiency due to its trial-and-error training characteristics, limiting its ability to control large UAV swarms with continuous state-action space and partial observation. We notice that UAV swarm systems in communication coverage tasks exhibit a spatial symmetry property, e.g., a rotation in the spatial observation of a UAV results in a same rotation in its optimal action. Exploiting this property, we formulate the task as a symmetric decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and introduce symmetry-informed MARL, featuring a novel network called the symmetry-informed graph neural network (SiGNN) to serve as the policy/value networks. SiGNN leverages the inherent symmetry in multi-UAV systems by embedding the symmetry into the network structure, thereby enhancing the training efficiency to handle large swarms with continuous control. Theoretical analysis shows that the SiGNN strictly preserves symmetry properties, which guarantees the effectiveness of the approach. Experiments in simulation were conducted to handle communication coverage using up to 20 UAVs with continuous control. Experimental results demonstrate that SiGNN-based MARL outperforms advanced baselines, verifying its superior sample efficiency, scalability and robustness.},

Second, addressing the privacy leakage issue caused by the disclosure of data distribution information, this paper proposes an encryption algorithm for heterogeneous environments FedHE, which utilizes homomorphic encryption to protect local data distributions and aggregates local data information through KL dispersion in order to construct global data distributions. Finally, for the privacy leakage problem caused by uploading model parameters in federation training, this paper proposes a federation model parameter encryption algorithm DPFedMP. This algorithm dynamically injects Gaussian noise into the model parameters according to the difference of data distribution to realize differential privacy protection and update the global model.

The existing EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, primarily designed for computer vision and natural language processing, struggle with time series data due to their lack of understanding of temporal characteristics of the input data. In this paper, we take the research on XAI for time series forecasting one step further by proposing AIChronoLens, a new tool that links legacy XAI explanations with the temporal properties of the input. AIChronoLens allows diving deep into the behavior of time series predictors and spotting, among other aspects, the hidden causes of forecast errors. We show that AIChronoLens&#39;s output can be utilized for meta-learning to predict when the original time series forecasting model makes errors and fix them in advance, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictors. Extensive evaluations with real-world mobile traffic traces pinpoint model behaviors that would not be possible to identify otherwise and show how model performance can be improved by 32 % upon re-training and by up to 39 % with meta-learning.},

  abstract     = {WiFi based respiratory detection has attracted increasing attentions due to its ubiquity and convenience. In Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) scenarios, WiFi signals reflected from human target are blocked by obstacles and become much weaker, thus limiting the sensing range and hindering the practical deployment. The existing best respiratory detection system extended the sensing range by scaling and aligning dynamic components in WiFi signals. However, its dynamic component scaling causes the amplification of noise, while its dynamic component alignment increases computation complexity due to the traversal on all possible rotation angles. To address the above issues, in this paper we first build WiFi sensing range models for respiratory detection in NLoS scenario, find factors that limit the sensing range, and then propose a new respiratory detection system named RaliSense which can further rapidly extend the sensing range in NLoS scenario. The main idea of RaliSense is rapidly aligning dynamic components without amplifying noise, based on change direction vector and CSI ratio sum polarity of dynamic components. The proposed change direction vector is obtained by calculating the direction on which the noisy dynamic components have the maximum variance, and CSI ratio sum polarity is then obtained by summing the dynamic components which have been rotated by the change direction vector. According to the CSI ratio sum polarity, the rotation angle is quickly adjusted for aligning dynamic components. Extensive simulation and experiment results verify the effectiveness of our proposed sensing range models. The results also demonstrate that our proposed system RaliSense can effectively extend sensing range in NLoS scenario, achieving a 22.7% improvement over the best existing work but spending only a quarter of its computation time.},

Considering users&#39; costs for providing services, it is vital for the requester to design incentive mechanisms to encourage users&#39; participation in crowdsourcing under the budget constraint. This aligns with the concept of budget-feasible mechanism design. Existing budget-feasible mechanisms often assume immediate user reachability and willingness of joining the crowdsourcing, which is unrealistic. To address this issue, a promising approach is to have participating users diffuse auction information to potential users in the social network. However, this brings another challenge in that participating users can be strategic and therefore hesitant to invite more potential competitors to join the crowdsourcing platform. In this paper, we focus on developing diffusion mechanisms that incentivize strategic users to actively diffuse auction information through the social network. This helps to attract more informed users and ultimately increases the value of the procured services. Specifically, we propose optimal budget-feasible diffusion mechanisms that simultaneously guarantee individual rationality, budget-feasibility, strong budget-balance, incentive-compatibility (i.e., users report real costs and diffuse auction information to all their neighbors) and approximation. Experiment results under real datasets further demonstrate the efficiency of proposed mechanisms.},

We surprisingly notice that this problem can be easily generalized for similar services such as express, takeout, or crowdsensing services, which means MCRP is a new fundamental combinatorial optimization problem. Traditional graph search algorithms or indexing methods are usually time and space consuming or perform poorly, which are not suitable for solving the problem.

The encoder is a filter-integrated Graph Convolution Network with external information fusion combining a supervised pre-training classification task, while the latter mimics a pointer network with a rule-based mask mechanism and a domain feature crossover module.

Then, to solve this intractable non-linear integer program in an online manner, we design a set of polynomial-time algorithms that work together. Our approach dynamically chooses and switches winning bids under careful control, incorporates online learning to overcome posterior inference accuracy and workload queue dynamics, and leverages randomization to strategically convert fractional decisions of model placement and query dispatch into integers.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is recognized as a pivotal paradigm for 6 G, offering decentralized model training without compromising data privacy. Recent works have proposed deploying FL in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks for reliable model transmission between FL clients and the server. Nevertheless, the problem of simultaneous access point (AP) clustering (i.e., dynamically forming AP groups to facilitate client-server communication) and transmit power allocation has not been thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, most existing solutions do not simultaneously consider the fast decision-making requirements brought by user mobility and the scalability of solutions in large-scale networks. To address this gap, we propose DACPA, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based scheme that accounts for client mobility (walking speed) and heterogeneous computing capabilities. DACPA strategically assigns each client a customized AP cluster and corresponding transmit power configuration, thereby optimizing model update latency. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of DACPA in terms of convergence stability, spectral efficiency, global model update latency, and average energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Semantic communication (SC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for upcoming intelligent applications, enabling mobile devices to collaboratively execute intelligent tasks with edge servers through computation offloading. However, few studies have addressed the problem of collaborative inference in SC networks. Traditional collaborative inference mechanisms may suffer performance decline in SC systems and are vulnerable to eavesdroppers. To address these issues, firstly, we present an encryptor that encrypts semantic information to avoid privacy leakage and a decryptor for restoration. Besides, we propose a novel SC-empowered edge computing framework enabling mobile devices to deploy a partial semantic encoder and offload the rest to edge servers. Based on this framework, we formulate the collaborative inference optimization problem, jointly optimizing delay, energy consumption, and privacy leakage. DNNPart is devised based on deep deterministic policy gradient to address the problem, which consists of a semantic attention mechanism that enables it to focus on important state variables, a hybrid action representation method that makes it adapt to mixed discrete and continuous action spaces, a dynamic model splitting algorithm that locates the optimal partition layer and adaptively splits the semantic coders. Integrated with these components, DNNPart iteratively optimizes the offloading strategy to find the optimal offloading strategy. Extensive simulations were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with baseline mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {There are many deep learning (DL) powered mobile and wearable applications today continuously and unobtrusively sensing the ambient surroundings to enhance all aspects of human lives. To enable robust and private mobile sensing, DL models are often deployed locally on resource-constrained mobile devices using techniques such as model compression or offloading. However, existing methods, either front-end algorithm level (i.e. DL model compression/partitioning) or back-end scheduling level (i.e. operator/resource scheduling), cannot be locally online because they require offline retraining to ensure accuracy or rely on manually pre-defined strategies, struggle with dynamic adaptability. The primary challenge lies in feeding back runtime performance from the back-end level to the front-end level optimization decision. Moreover, the adaptive mobile DL model porting middleware with cross-level co-adaptation is less explored, particularly in mobile environments with diversity and dynamics. In response, we introduce CrowdHMTware, a dynamic context-adaptive DL model deployment middleware for heterogeneous mobile devices. It establishes an automated adaptation loop between cross-level functional components, i.e. elastic inference, scalable offloading, and model-adaptive engine, enhancing scalability and adaptability. Experiments with four typical tasks across 15 platforms and a real-world case study demonstrate that ${\sf CrowdHMTware}$ can effectively scale DL model, offloading, and engine actions across diverse platforms and tasks.

  abstract     = {Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) drive toward strong environmental adaptability, intelligence, and multifunctionality. However, due to unique UASN characteristics, such as long propagation delay, dynamic channel quality, and high attenuation, existing studies present untimeliness, inefficiency, and inflexibility in real practice. Digital twin (DT) technology is promising for UASNs to break the above bottlenecks by providing high-fidelity status prediction and exploring optimal schemes. In this article, we propose a Digital Twin-based Network Architecture (DTNA), enhancing UASNs&#39; environmental adaptability, intelligence, and multifunctionality. By extracting real UASN information from local (node) and global (network) levels, we first design a layered architecture to improve the DT replica fidelity and UASN control flexibility. In local DT, we develop a resource allocation paradigm (RAPD), which rapidly perceives performance variations and iteratively optimizes allocation schemes to improve real-time environmental adaptability of resource allocation algorithms. In global DT, we aggregate decentralized local DT data and propose a collaborative Multi-agent reinforcement learning framework (CMFD) and a task-oriented network slicing (TNSD). CMFD patches scarce real data and provides extensive DT data to accelerate AI model training. TNSD unifies heterogeneous tasks&#39; demand extraction and efficiently provides comprehensive network status, improving the flexibility of multi-task scheduling algorithms. Finally, practical and simulation experiments verify the high fidelity of DT. Compared with the original UASN architecture, experiment results demonstrate that DTNA can: (i) improve the timeliness and robustness of resource allocation; (ii) greatly reduce the training time of AI algorithms; (iii) more rapidly obtain network status for multi-task scheduling at a low cost.},

The aim of this paper is to enhance the reliability among D2D ground users (GUs) and extend the lifespan of 5 G and beyond 5 G (B5G) wireless communication system. This work may be applicable for packet delivery in bustling urban areas, especially where ground-to-ground (G2G) links are in deep fade. For modeling air-to-ground (A2G) links among GUs to IRS/UAV and IRS/UAV to GUs, we consider a height-dependent Nakagami-$m$ channel model for small-scale fading and height-dependent path-loss exponent for modeling large-scale fading. The lifespan of the network is improved by proposing height-dependent energy harvesting (EH) at UAV. We derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) whenever the signal reaches the receiving node, either via UAV or via IRS. We also develop the expression of spectral efficiency and derive a closed-form expression of an outage probability by taking the combined effect of the signal for the proposed scenario using decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying at the UAV. Additionally, the statistical parameters such as mean, variance, and probability density function (PDF) of total noise are derived, which is useful at the receiver node for estimating the bit error rate (BER). The analytical result is validated with simulation results, and the work is compared with the existing state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Secure task matching has been a crucial research problem in crowdsourcing, requiring the alignment of workers&#39; preferences and requesters&#39; task requirements while ensuring user privacy and matching integrity. Recently, some researchers applied blockchain to crowdsourcing, either replacing the platform for decentralization or recording proofs for public verification to defend against malicious platforms. However, they still suffer from unitary coarse-grained matching models or expensive on-chain costs. To address these limitations, we propose PGVMatch, a privacy-aware and fine-grained crowdsourcing task-matching scheme with lightweight on-chain public verifiability. Our scheme is constructed on our newly proposed cryptographic primitive–Multi-authority Attribute-Based Keyword Search with Public Verifiability (MABKS-PV), which avoids access policy leakage and key escrow risks on a single authority, meanwhile adding constant-size proof generation and lightweight verification algorithms to a basic ABKS construction. In PGVMatch, requesters can select workers with fine-grained attribute demands, and workers can pick interested tasks with multi-keyword search, preserving dual-side privacy. The matching process is conducted off-chain, while constant-size proofs are recorded on-chain for efficient and public verification of matching integrity. Security analysis and extensive experiments on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain demonstrate both the security and our superior performance. PGVMatch outperforms the existing scheme with the fastest matching result verification, achieving a 29% improvement in throughput and a 33% reduction in latency.},

This paper addresses the critical challenge of precisely localizing users within a communication network by leveraging the controlled-reflective properties of RIS elements without relying on more power-hungry traditional methods, e.g., GPS, adverting the need of deploying additional infrastructure and even avoiding interfering with communication efforts. Moreover, we go one step beyond: we build COLoRIS, an Opportunistic ISAC approach that leverages localization-agnostic RIS configurations to accurately position mobile users via trained learning models. Extensive experimental validation and simulations in large-scale synthetic scenarios show $\mathbf{5\%}$ positioning errors (with respect to field size) under different conditions. Further, we show that a low-complexity version running in a limited off-the-shelf (embedded, low-power) system achieves positioning errors in the $\mathbf{11\%}$ range at a negligible $\mathbf{+2.7\%}$ energy expense with respect to the classical RIS.},

In this paper, we consider a mixed cloud/vehicular-fog computing (VFC) system that employs vehicle-carried fog nodes (V-FNs) in addition to cloud servers to offload tasks from V-UEs. To minimise the maximum service delay (which includes the transmission delay, queueing delay, and processing delay) among all V-UEs, we jointly optimise the offloading decisions of all V-UEs, the computation resource allocation at all V-FNs, the allocation of resource block (RB) and transmission power for all V-UEs while considering the mobility of V-UEs and V-FNs. The joint optimisation is solved by devising a fireworks algorithm-based offloading decision optimisation scheme, in conjunction with a bisection method-based V-FN computation resource allocation scheme and a clustering-based communication resource allocation scheme. Simulation results show that our proposed schemes outperform the benchmarks in terms of service the maximum delay among all V-UEs.},

On the contrary, clothes-relevant features can be used to discover same-clothes intermediaries that possess informative identity clues. Based on this observation, we propose a Feasibility-Aware Intermediary Matching (FAIM) framework to additionally utilize clothes-relevant features for retrieval. Firstly, an Intermediary Matching (IM) module is designed to perform an intermediary-assisted matching process. This process involves using clothes-relevant features to find informative intermediates, and then using clothes-irrelevant features of these intermediates to complete the matching. Secondly, in order to reduce the negative effect of low-quality intermediaries, an Intermediary-Based Feasibility Weighting (IBFW) module is designed to evaluate the feasibility of intermediary matching process by assessing the quality of intermediaries.

However, existing methods either use fixed-scale blocks for sampling that leads to limited insights into the image content or employ a plain convolutional neural network (CNN) in each iteration that weakens the perception of broader contextual prior. In this paper, we propose a novel DUN (dubbed SVASNet) for image compressive sensing, which achieves scale-variable adaptive sampling and hybrid-attention Transformer reconstruction with a single model. Specifically, for scale-variable sampling, a sampling matrix-based calculator is first employed to evaluate the reconstruction distortion, which only requires measurements without access to the ground truth image. Then, a Block Scale Aggregation (BSA) strategy is presented to compute the reconstruction distortion under block divisions at different scales and select the optimal division scale for sampling. To realize hybrid-attention reconstruction, a dual Cross Attention (CA) submodule in the gradient descent step and a Spatial Attention (SA) submodule in the proximal mapping step are developed. The CA submodule introduces inter-phase inertial forces in the gradient descent, which improves the memory effect between adjacent iterations. The SA submodule integrates local and global prior representations of CNN and Transformer, and explores local and global affinities between dense feature representations. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed SVASNet achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Human-centric Emotional Video Captioning (H-EVC) aims to generate fine-grained, emotion-related sentences for human-based videos, enhancing the understanding of human emotions and facilitating human-computer emotional interaction. However, existing video captioning methods primarily focus on overall event content, often overlooking sufficient subtle emotional clues and interactions in videos. As a result, the generated captions frequently lack emotional information. To address this, we propose a novel Emotion-oriented Cross-modal Prompting and Alignment (ECPA) approach for large foundation models to enhance H-EVC accuracy by effectively modeling fine-grained visual-textual emotion clues and interactions. Using large foundation models, our ECPA introduces two learnable prompting strategies: visual emotion prompting (VEP) and textual emotion prompting (TEP), as well as an emotion-oriented cross-modal alignment (ECA) module. In VEP, we develop two-level learnable visual prompts, i.e., emotion recognition (ER)-level and action unit (AU)-level prompting, to assist pre-trained vision-language foundation models to attend to both coarse and fine emotion-related visual information in videos. In TEP, we correspondingly devise two-level learnable textual prompts, i.e., sentence-level emotional tokens, and word-level masked tokens, for obtaining both whole and local textual prompt representations related to emotions. To further facilitate the interaction and alignment of visual-textual emotion prompt representations, our ECA introduces another two levels of emotion-oriented prompt alignment learning mechanisms: the ER-sentence level and the AU-word level alignment losses. Both enhance the model&#39;s ability to capture and integrate both global and local cross-modal emotion semantics, thereby enabling the generation of fine-grained emotional linguistic descriptions in video captioning. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate that our ECPA outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on various H-EVC datasets (a relative improvement of 8.48% on MAFW and 10.58% on EmVidCap) by a large margin, but also support zero-shot tasks on two video captioning datasets (MSVD and MSRVTT), underscoring its applicability and generalization capabilities.

  abstract     = {Scribble supervised salient object detection (SSSOD) constructs segmentation ability of attractive objects from surroundings under the supervision of sparse scribble labels. For the better segmentation, depth and thermal infrared modalities serve as the supplement to RGB images in the complex scenes. Existing methods specifically design various feature extraction and multi-modal fusion strategies for RGB, RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, and Visual-Depth-Thermal image input respectively, leading to similar model flood. As the recently proposed Segment Anything Model (SAM) possesses extraordinary segmentation and prompt interactive capability, we propose an SSSOD family based on SAM, named SSFam, for the combination input with different modalities. Firstly, different modal-aware modulators are designed to attain modal-specific knowledge which cooperates with modal-agnostic information extracted from the frozen SAM encoder for the better feature ensemble. Secondly, a siamese decoder is tailored to bridge the gap between the training with scribble prompt and the testing with no prompt for the stronger decoding ability. Our model demonstrates the remarkable performance among combinations of different modalities and refreshes the highest level of scribble supervised methods and comes close to the ones of fully supervised methods.},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the data-sparsity problem by transferring knowledge across domains. Existing CDR methods generally assume that the user-item interaction data is shareable between domains, which leads to privacy leakage. Recently, some privacy-preserving CDR (PPCDR) models have been proposed to solve this problem. However, they primarily transfer simple representations learned only from user-item interaction histories, overlooking other useful side information, leading to inaccurate user preferences. Additionally, they transfer differentially private user-item interaction matrices or embeddings across domains to protect privacy. However, these methods offer limited privacy protection, as attackers may exploit external information to infer the original data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated User Preference Modeling (FUPM) framework. In FUPM, first, a novel comprehensive preference exploration module is proposed to learn users&#39; comprehensive preferences from both interaction data and additional data including review texts and potentially positive items. Next, a private preference transfer module is designed to first learn differentially private local and global prototypes, and then privately transfer the global prototypes using a federated learning strategy. These prototypes are generalized representations of user groups, making it difficult for attackers to infer individual information. Extensive experiments on four CDR tasks conducted on the Amazon and Douban datasets validate the superiority of FUPM over SOTA baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/Lili1013/FUPM.},

  abstract     = {Zero-shot visual grounding is the task of identifying and localizing an object in an image based on a referring expression without task-specific training. Existing methods employ heuristic rules to step-by-step perform visual perception for visual grounding. Despite their remarkable performance, there are still two limitations. First, such a rule-based manner struggles with expressions that are not covered by predefined rules. Second, existing methods lack a mechanism for identifying and correcting visual perceptual errors of incomplete information, resulting in cascading errors caused by reasoning based on incomplete visual perception results. In this article, we propose an Error-Aware Generative Reasoning (EAGR) method for zero-shot visual grounding. To address the limited adaptability of existing methods, a reasoning chain generator is presented, which prompts LLMs to dynamically generate reasoning chains for specific referring expressions. This generative manner eliminates the reliance on human-written heuristic rules. To mitigate visual perceptual errors of incomplete information, an error-aware mechanism is presented to elicit LLMs to identify these errors and explore correction strategies. Experimental results on four benchmarks show that EAGR outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by up to 10% and an average of 7%.},

  abstract     = {The social relation is a fundamental attribute of human beings in daily life. The ability of humans to form large organizations and institutions stems directly from our complex social networks. Therefore, understanding social relationships in the context of multimedia is crucial for building domain-specific or general artificial intelligence systems. The key to reason social relations lies in understanding the human interactions between individuals through multimodal representations such as action and utterance. However, due to video editing techniques and various narrative sequences in videos, two individuals with social relationships may not appear together in the same frame or clip. Additionally, social relations may manifest in different levels of granularity in video expressions. Previous research has not effectively addressed these challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-Granularity Relation Graph Aggregation Framework (MGRG) to enhance the inference ability for social relation reasoning in multimedia content, like video. Different from existing methods, our method considers the paradigm of jointly inferring the relations by constructing a social relation graph. We design a hierarchical multimodal relation graph illustrating the exchange of information between individuals&#39; roles, capturing the complex interactions at multi-levels of granularity from fine to coarse. In MGRG, we propose two aggregation modules to cluster multimodal features in different granularity layer relation graph, considering temporal aspects and importance. Experimental results show that our method generates a logical and coherent social relation graph and improves the performance in accuracy.},

A distinctive feature of HCANet is the incorporation of a novel Hierarchical Cross-Attention (HCA) block into both stages, enabling the effective capture of long-range correlations between individual and clothing modalities. The HCA block functions as a cornerstone, enhancing the depth and robustness of the network. By adopting a hierarchical approach, it facilitates a nuanced representation of the interaction between the person and clothing, capturing intricate details essential for an authentic virtual try-on experience.

However, during the verification stage, there is a risk that the trigger set could be leaked and exposed to adversaries. If this occurs, the adversaries might apply this leaked trigger set to claim ownership of the model, posing significant copyright issues for the watermarked DNN. To address such an evidence exposure problem, a secure neural network watermarking protocol is put forward in this paper. In the proposed protocol, the trigger set is not fixed, once the trigger is utilized for verification, it is invalid and cannot be used for verification in the future. As a result, even if the trigger set is leaked during the verification process and obtained by the attacker, they cannot use it for copyright verification since it is invalid. To assist the protocol, a trigger set generation method is designed, in which the auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN) and the target classification model are trained together. The special logits distribution and the labels of the generated trigger samples can be ensured and verified effectively in this way. The performance of the trigger generation methods regarding effectiveness, fidelity, and robustness is verified by experiments, and the security analysis of the designed watermarking protocol is conducted.},

In this paper, we propose a method of continuous bijection supervised pyramid diffeomorphic deformation (PDD) for learning tooth meshes, which could be used to directly generate high-quality tooth meshes from CBCT Images. Overall, we adopt a classic two-stage framework. In the first stage, we devise an enhanced detector to accurately locate and crop every tooth. In the second stage, a PDD network is designed to deform a sphere mesh from low resolution to high one according to pyramid flows based on diffeomorphic mesh deformations, so that the generated mesh approximates the ground truth infinitely and efficiently. To achieve that, a novel continuous bijection distance loss on the diffeomorphic sphere is also designed to supervise the deformation learning, which overcomes the shortcoming of loss based on nearest-neighbour mapping and improves the fitting precision. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both different evaluation metrics and the geometry quality of reconstructed tooth surfaces.},

The abundant multimodal cues in micro-videos exhibit substantial potential in enhancing content comprehension. However, effectively harnessing the collaborative characteristics across different modalities remains a significant challenge, especially in multi-label scenarios due to inconsistent behaviors regarding label correlations. To better tackle this issue, in this paper, we first introduce a multimodal dual-graph collaborative network with serial attentive aggregation mechanism (MDGCN) for micro-video multi-label classification. In MDGCN, we exploit an asymmetric encoder-decoder framework, which incorporates multiple parallel encoders with complementary representations and a decoder to ensure the completeness of encoded results. Meanwhile, an adversarial constraint is used to ensure individual differences prominently featured within each modality. Furthermore, considering the inconsistency of label correlations across various modalities, we then construct a serial attentive graph convolutional network that employs an interactive dual-graph attention paradigm to sequentially integrate multimodal representations and dynamically explore label correlations. The experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

While user-dependent (DEP) estimators generally outperform user-independent (IND) estimators, they require the pre-collection of DEP training data. In contrast, our real-time algorithm adapts IND estimators to self-labeled DEP data generated during walking, eliminating the need for pre-collected datasets. The algorithm also features a biomimetic scaling mechanism that adjusts prosthetic assistance based on speed estimates. We evaluated our algorithm on novel subjects (N=10) with unilateral above-knee amputations during treadmill and overground walking. For treadmill trials, when adapted with estimated and ground truth labels, estimators achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074 0.023 (mean, standard deviation) and 0.074 0.018 m/s, respectively, reflecting a significant 28% (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in MAE compared to non-adapted estimators. For overground trials, treadmill-adapted estimators demonstrated a significant 18% (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in MAE compared to non-adapted estimators. Our algorithm significantly reduced speed estimation errors within one minute of walking and delivered biomimetic assistance (r = 0.91) across speeds. This approach allows off-the-shelf powered prostheses to seamlessly adapt to new users, delivering biomimetic assistance through precise, real-time walking speed estimation.},

In this paper, pedicle screw placement is adopted as an example to assess the effectiveness and performance of the NOR2CORS. An assessment criterion is also proposed to assess the accuracy of pedicle screw placement based on the widely-used Gertzbein and Robbins classification. Experiments are conducted on a human spine model (24 pedicles) and ex-vivo porcine spine (10 pedicles). According to the proposed assessment criterion, 96% pedicles on human spine model can be classified as grade A and 4% grade B, with 67% of them as grade A2 and above. In the ex-vivo porcine spine experiment, all pedicle screw placements can be classified as grade A, with 80% of them as grade A2 and above.

As a case study, we formulate the objective of providing assistance as needed as an optimisation problem, and we demonstrate how musculoskeletal modelling can be used to develop personalised interventions. Eighteen healthy participants (age = 26 ± 4) were recruited and the personalised control parameters for each were obtained to provide assistance as needed during a unilateral tracking task. A comparison was carried out between the personalised controller and the non-personalised controller. In simulation, a significant improvement was predicted when the personalised parameters were used. Experimentally, responses varied: six subjects showed significant improvements with the personalised parameters, eight subjects showed no obvious change, while four subjects performed worse. High interpersonal and intra-personal variability was observed with both controllers. This study highlights the importance of personalised control in robot-assisted gait training, and the need for a better estimation of human-robot interaction and human behaviour to realise the benefits of model-based optimisation.},

  abstract     = {For many decades, developments of knee prostheses have shown a dichotomy regarding fundamental working principles. The industry has mainly emphasized on quasi-passive hydraulic solutions, whereas most research works have focused on powered devices, employing electric actuation. The former have an energetically passive effect at the knee joint, for which they often lack in providing versatility and movement robustness for the wearer. Powered prostheses can address these deficiencies, but are often rejected as they struggle to fulfill other user needs (e.g., weight and acoustic noise). Correspondingly, recent studies have emerged that attempt to significantly attenuate the deficiencies of fully powered prosthesis knees, partially sacrificing on device versatility. Recognizing the state-of-the art difficulties in balancing active assistance and user needs fulfilment, this work analyses human-centered design perspectives and their prospects for prosthetic development, in light of the often diverging user needs. We conclude that various types of both explored and yet unexplored semi-powered solutions may have the potential to provide the better trade-off between quasi-passive and fully powered prosthetic devices.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive mitral valve repair offers significant advantages over traditional open-heart surgery, yet it remains a complex procedure that exposes both patients and medical staff to radiation. To address these challenges, a significant research interest is growing in automating these manual procedures. Continuum robots represent a promising approach, thanks to their ability to navigate confined spaces. However, their nonlinear behavior presents challenges in modeling and control. In this study, we developed a robust position control method for a variable-length tendon-driven continuum robot. We designed a control system that effectively tracks the desired target positions by employing a constant curvature model and a Jacobian-based control algorithm with real-time position feedback. We assessed the stability of our system through Lyapunov analysis, demonstrating reliable convergence to these target positions. Experimental validation conducted in a cardiovascular phantom demonstrated significant improvements with respect to the state of the art. Our method achieved a trajectory following error of approximately 2.43 mm 1.63, 3.23 and a target position error of about 1.92 mm 1.73, 3.13. Moreover, the computation time per trajectory point was reduced to approximately 0.04 seconds, highlighting enhanced computational efficiency.

The proposed device conforms to the nonlinear behavior of the tibiofemoral contact force during squat motions, by means of patient-custom cams. Using pneumatic cylinders as springs, the unloading assistance provided by the brace is tailored to the patient’s pathology and adjusted during the rehabilitation process. To assess the performance of our orthosis, various tests are conducted to evaluate its efficiency in terms of tibiofemoral contact load reduction. For this purpose, a robotic test-bench, equipped with a robotic arm, emulates upper leg motion under applied forces (hybrid force-motion control). A pseudo-leg is attached to the robot end-effector, and the orthosis is mounted onto it. The test bench is instrumented with two six degrees of freedom force-torque sensors. Using these force sensors as ground truth, tibiofemoral contact force measurements are obtained with and without our orthosis and compared. A pair of cams is fabricated based on data from a patient whose information is retrieved from the Orthoload database. Experimental results demonstrate a contact force reduction of up to 100 force range corresponding to the robot’s maximum capacity.},

  abstract     = {Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) employing surface electromyography (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals has garnered increasing interest in areas of bionic prostheses and human-machine interaction. However, existing multimodal approaches predominantly extract global specificity at a single temporal scale, which neglects local dynamic characteristics. This limitation hinders the effective capture of global-local temporal information, resulting in restricted performance and frequent misclassification of dynamic gestures. To this end, we propose a novel global-local Fusion model, termed Temporal-spatial Dependence Fusion (TsdFusion), for sEMG-ACC-based HGR. TsdFusion harnesses temporal-spatial dependencies (Tsd) from multi-time scale handcrafted features and employs a Convolution-Transformer framework for global-local fusion, thus enriching local dynamic information while preserving global insights. Specifically, the Tsd inputs are independently constructed from sEMG and ACC through multi-time scale window segmentation and feature engineering. Furthermore, the global and local temporal-spatial correlations within unimodal Tsd inputs are characterized by the unimodal transformer and dimension-wise convolution modules, respectively. Subsequently, a Convolution-coupled-transformer progressive hierarchical fusion module effectively integrates intramodal specificity and intermodal hierarchical relationship for final prediction. Evaluations on four public datasets, including transradial amputees and healthy subjects, demonstrate TsdFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal HGR methods. The TsdFusion effectively recognizes dynamic gestures, facilitating promising HGR-based interaction for prostheses or assistance robotics.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a leader-follower robotic system featuring a novel 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) Remote Center of Motion (RCM) mechanism, tailored to address the limitations associated with traditional posterior segment ocular microsurgery. The proposed 4-DOF mechanism employs parallelogram motion replication to relocate the bulky instrument insertion drive from the end-effector to the proximal linkage on the base, minimizing obstruction to the microscope’s field of view and the surgical environment. The mechanism’s orthogonal or coincident arranged degrees of freedom, paired with independent drive units, facilitate calibration and enhance control accuracy. A minimized internal constraint force optimization method was proposed to improve RCM point stability and tip positioning accuracy. The mechanism’s configuration and parameters were optimized through an analytical mechanics model, effectively reducing the constraint force on the internal components under the same external loads, thereby minimizing deformation and maintaining accuracy. To enhance robot compatibility, modular surgical instruments with a quick-change coupler were developed based on the analysis of traditional instruments’ characteristics. The prototype was built and kinematically calibrated to reduce manufacturing and assembly errors and thus improve accuracy. Following kinematic calibration to minimize manufacturing and assembly errors, experimental validation revealed positioning accuracies of 49 ± 23 μ m and 22 ± 13 μ m, repeatabilities of 25 ± 10 μ m and 9 ± 4 μ m, and RCM deviations of 13 ± 10 μ m and 18 ± 11 μ m on the X-Z and Y-Z planes, respectively. The cannulation experiment further demonstrates the prototype’s potential for robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery.},

  abstract     = {Lung ultrasound scanning is essential for diagnosing lung diseases. The scan effectiveness critically depends on both longitudinal and transverse scans through intercostal spaces to reduce rib shadowing interference, as well as maintaining the probe perpendicular to pleura for pathological artifact generation. Achieving this level of scan quality often depends heavily on the experience of doctors. Robotic ultrasound scanning shows promise, but currently lacks a direct path planning method for intercostal scanning, and probe orientation does not consider imaging differences between lungs and solid organs. In this paper, we aim to fully automate two fundamental operations in lung ultrasound scanning: longitudinal and transverse scans. We propose pioneering path planning methods along intercostal spaces and innovative solutions for adaptive probe posture adjustment using real-time pleural line feedback, specifically addressing the unique characteristics of lung ultrasound scanning. This ensures the acquisition of high-quality, diagnostically meaningful ultrasound images. In addition, we develop a robotic lung ultrasound system to validate the proposed methods. Extensive experimental results on two volunteers and a chest phantom confirm the efficacy of our methods, and demonstrate the system’s feasibility in automated lung ultrasound examinations. Our work lays a solid foundation for automated robotic complete lung scanning.},

However, surgeons require advanced techniques, and several studies have evaluated surgical skills through motion measurements to improve skill proficiency. However, existing measurement systems have a low tolerance for occlusion and are difficult to use in operating rooms with many obstacles. Therefore, a hybrid measurement system was developed for laparoscopic surgery. This system consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a distance sensor, and an optical motion capture (MoCap). When MoCap data are unavailable, surgical instrument motion is calculated using the IMU and distance sensor data, and when it is available, the IMU drift is corrected using MoCap data. The MoCap markers were arranged individually, thus facilitating the measurement of multiple instruments simultaneously. The validation experiment in the wet-lab training confirmed that the error was smaller than that measured using MoCap alone, and the subjects expressed that the subjective disturbance caused by the sensors was very small during the procedure. The measurement experiment was conducted in cadaver surgical training, and 15 cases of nephrectomy were successfully recorded. This system facilitated highly accurate measurements during practical surgical training and surgical skills analysis.},

  abstract     = {In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the twist steering of the flexible endoscope plays an important role in tracking the preoperative path during cavity intervention. However, the flexible endoscope’s twisting motion has high nonlinearity and uncertainty, which bring challenges for accurate modeling and controller design. In this study, a novel active modeling-based improved control (AMIC) scheme is proposed, which achieves precise control of the robotic flexible endoscope’s twisting motion. First, the Coleman-Hodgdon (C-H) model is modified to serve as the reference model to describe the twist steering. Then, the model error in the C-H model is introduced as an extended state. Upon this, an active modeling algorithm is developed by using the unscented Kalman filter. The proposed model estimates both the twisting angle and the model error in real time. Based on the proposed model, the AMIC strategy is developed to enhance the tracking performance of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a reference trajectory. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on a self-built robotic flexible endoscope under various insertion depths and tip-part configurations. Compared to the PID controller, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AMIC scheme achieves a 63.1% reduction in tracking error under a sinusoidal trajectory.},

To ensure that the RARS automatically completes the task in a safe manner, we propose a safety control framework that employs iterative enhanced control based on interaction model to handle the retraction interaction problem, and avoids interference with the operation of surgeons through null-space optimization. First, we performed a performance test of the RARS on a phantom model, and the results showed that the maximum tracking error of the retraction force was 0.51N, demonstrating satisfactory tracking performance. Second, we validated the effectiveness of null-space optimization by observing the evolution of joint positions. Finally, we conducted experiments on in-vivo animal and the results showed that the proposed RARS exhibited superior performance in safe retraction force tracking accuracy and tissue damage compared to traditional manual retractions.},

The adoption of robotic technology offers the potential to bring intra-operative radiation exposure down to a minimum, or even eliminate it. Non-ionizing approaches, such as Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), are progressively explored as standalone or fluoroscopy-adjunct techniques for 3D vasculature reconstruction. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of real-time 3D Main Vessel (MV) modeling from the fusion of IVUS and EM pose data obtained from sensors embedded at the tip of a robotic catheter. This paper proposes to advance MV modeling towards a comprehensive radiation-free 3D guidance framework by means of intra-operative Side Branch (SB) detection and modeling. Two models are proposed to approximate the geometry of SB vessel ostia: a sphere and a cylinder. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) recursively estimates the state of these models considering the MV model, while the catheters navigates through the vessel. In silico and in vitro validation results show the potential clinical value of the proposed strategy for facilitating safer robotic catheter steering.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a robust myoelectric intention recognition framework to recognize human locomotion mode and detect irrelevant locomotion intention. The framework is integrated into the control system of the lower limb exoskeleton robot for experimental validation. Most conventional electromyography(EMG) intention detection methods aim to accurately detect the target motion intentions but ignore the possible effects of irrelevant intentions. In traditional action intention recognition strategies, most researchers did not consider entering irrelevant action intentions into the model during training. Therefore, when using a classification model, if irrelevant action intentions are input, the model will still recognize it as a type of target action intention. That can lead to incorrect recognition results, which will cause the robot to perform wrong movements and pose a safety risk to the wearer. To detect and reject irrelevant motion intentions, we first used the dual-purpose autoencoder-guided temporal convolution network (DA-TCN) to obtain discriminative features of the surface EMG signal. Autoencoders (AE)/Variable Autoencoders (VAE) are then trained for each of the seven deep features of the target motion intention. In addition, irrelevant motion intentions are detected according to the value of their reconstruction error. The recall rate of this method for the detection of irrelevant motion intentions exceeds 99% and the accuracy rate exceeds 99%.At the same time, we replaced the TCN with the LSTM model and compared the performance of the two after adding irrelevant motion discrimination. We collected data on seven goals and three unrelated motor intentions from seven experimenters for testing and completed an online experimental validation. The motion recognition accuracy of all the experimenters can be maintained above 86%.},

Delegating this task to robots would be beneficial in terms of reducing infection risks and bolstering the healthcare system, but a critical component of the NP swab test is having the swab aligned properly with the nasal cavity so that it does not cause excessive discomfort or injury by traveling down the wrong passage. Existing research towards robotic NP swabbing typically assumes the patient’s head is held within a fixture. This simplifies the alignment problem, but is also dissimilar to clinical scenarios where patients are typically free-standing. Consequently, our work creates a vision-guided pipeline to allow an instrumented robot arm to properly position and orient NP swabs with respect to the nostrils of free-standing patients. The first component of the pipeline is a precomputed joint lookup table to allow the arm to meet the patient’s arbitrary position in the designated workspace, while avoiding joint limits. Our pipeline leverages semantic face models from computer vision to estimate the Euclidean pose of the face with respect to a monocular RGB-D camera placed on the end-effector. These estimates are passed into an unscented Kalman filter on manifolds state estimator and a pose based visual servo control loop to move the swab to the designated pose in front of the nostril. Our pipeline was validated with human trials, featuring a cohort of 25 participants. The system is effective, reaching the nostril for 84% of participants, and our statistical analysis did not find significant demographic biases within the cohort.},

However, due to the complex shape of the vertebra, three-dimensional (3D) US reconstructions generated from two-dimensional (2D) US scans often lack important anatomic information, such as the spinous process. This paper investigates scanning strategies that reorient the probe during US scanning to improve surface coverage of 3D US reconstructions. A two-scan procedure with a path re-planning algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm uses information from a first exploratory scan to generate an improved imaging trajectory whereby the US probe is near-perpendicular to the targeted bone surface. The results show a 30.4%, 42.3%, and 75.0% improvement in surface coverage on a synthetic phantom, cadaver, and human volunteers, respectively, achieving up to 56% surface coverage on human volunteers. These results emphasise the value of exploiting information about the underlying anatomy to optimise the scanning trajectory. The increased surface coverage of the 3D US reconstructions will provide higher quality radiationfree visualisation, extending the role of US as a complementary imaging modality for safe and effective diagnosis and spine interventions.},

As wearable robots become more intelligent and automated, anticipatory control is limited for amputees because they lack prior knowledge of the timing and nature of changes in the robot’s motion, making human-machine collaboration more challenging. This study addresses the need for improved wearable robot transparency by enhancing a prosthetic controller to provide users with advanced notifications of locomotion mode changes. Five transfemoral amputees (TFA) wore our designed knee prosthesis and walked on a treadmill. We simulated a terrain misrecognition error by switching the locomotion mode from treadmill walking to stair ascent. Our study focused on three main questions: 1.) What is the ideal timing that the TFAs need to mitigate for machine errors? 2.) How do TFAs compensate for prosthetic knee errors? And 3.) How does the robotic prosthetic leg respond to the TFAs’ corrective actions? We found that the enhanced transparency system helps TFAs anticipate changes and adjust their gait to compensate for the terrain misrecognition error. Specifically, providing notifications about 650 milliseconds before a locomotion mode change significantly reduced the effect of robot errors. Although the error compensation from TFAs resulted in a larger magnitude of error induced by the prosthetic knee, the TFAs were able to tolerate it and improve balance stability. According to questionnaires on user preferences, with notification of prosthetic knee motion, the TFAs could trust the device more even though the devices might have occasional errors. This study demonstrates that simple notifications of the robot’s movement intent enhance the predictability of prosthetic motion, facilitating anticipatory adjustments that improve safety and user trust.},

  abstract     = {Motor-powered ankle exoskeletons have been shown to improve walking and rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with and without gait impairments (e.g., cerebral palsy (CP)). To date, ankle exoskeleton designs have either placed the motors on the shanks (direct or quasi-direct drive) or around the waist with Bowden cable transmissions. The former offers better transmission efficiency, while the latter reduces added mass biomechanical penalty. The biomechanical effects of motor placement may be magnified for individuals with CP due to weakened lower limb strength. To date, no study has compared how motor placement alters the biomechanical responses and user perceptions of individuals with or without gait impairment (e.g., CP). In this study involving 7 individuals with CP and 9 unimpaired individuals, we compared their metabolic cost of transport, lower limb muscle activities, and user perceptions when using ankle exoskeletons with either waist-mounted motors (and Bowden cables) or shank-mounted motors that were otherwise identical. Despite changes in lower leg muscle recruitment, results showed no statistical differences in the metabolic cost of transport. Shank-mounted motors were preferred by more participants in both cohorts (e.g., 6/7 in CP). These results help inform the ergonomics and mechanical designs of ankle exoskeletons and how they may be perceived.},

The proposed design is a constrained cable robot with a vertical workspace, capable of supporting and measuring the motion of a stroke survivor’s arm and hand during therapy activities, with a modular end effector design to simulate a variety of activities of daily living. The technical requirements of the design are described and linked to research on therapy activities, activities of daily living, and anthropometry.

  abstract     = {Exoskeletons used for rehabilitation must operate together with the patient to adapt to the biomechanical-inspired movements of the regular human gait cycle rather than operate by following a predefined trajectory without considering the human-robot interaction effects. This work presents the assessment of a lower limb exoskeleton whose motion is performed according to a collaborative approach given the movements of the human user and the relative force concerning the exoskeleton structure. The OpensimTM software serves to define the force and position reference trajectories to follow during the gait cycle, which serves as a reference for the hybrid control. These forces and movements are compared to the results of a virtual model that considers the interaction between the user and the exoskeleton in two possible scenarios. The first scenario contemplates the implementation of a position controller to generate interaction-independent movement of the exoskeleton. The second scenario considers the force exerted by the exoskeleton on the patient to trigger a force-based controller after trespassing a predefined value. This leads to a hybrid control scheme, which considers the position restrictions in the closed-loop feedback control strategy. Using this approach, the exoskeleton can collaborate actively with the user and provide motion as required, responding to position-controlled motion if the user is not opposed to the exoskeleton motion. This novel strategy permits the evaluation of a hybrid position-force controller for wearing the active orthosis. Numeric simulations show the performance of the proposed system. These outcomes confirm the supposed advantages of the proposed controller.},

  abstract     = {Extensive attention has been paid to the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches on federated learning (FL) to tackle the label scarcity problem. Previous works on federated SSL (FedSSL) generally fall into two categories: parameter-based model aggregation or data-based feature sharing to achieve knowledge transfer among multiple unlabeled clients. Despite the progress, they inevitably rely on some assumptions, such as homogeneous models or the existence of an additional public dataset, which hinder the universality of the training frameworks for more general scenarios (e.g., unlabeled clients with heterogeneous models). Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel and general method named federated self-supervised learning with feature-correlation-based aggregation (FedFoA) to tackle the above limitations. By exchanging feature correlation instead of model parameters or feature mappings, our approach reduces the discrepancies of local representations learning processes, thus promoting collaboration between heterogeneous clients. A factorization-based method is designed to extract the cross-feature relation matrix from local representations, which serves as a knowledge medium for the aggregation phase. We demonstrate that FedFoA is a heterogeneity-supportive and privacy-preserving training framework and can be easily compatible with state-of-the-art FedSSL methods. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.},

  abstract     = {Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to locate objects with only image-level labels. Previous works mainly follow the framework of class activation map (CAM), which discovers the objects by estimating the contribution of each pixel position to the category prediction. However, most of them overlook the pixel-level spatial and semantic contextual correlation, resulting in: 1) limited activation ranges that only highlight the most discriminative parts rather than the entire object and 2) low activation values for some foreground parts, especially regions near the boundary between foreground and background. To alleviate this issue, we propose an activation diffusion network (ADNet) to progressively refine both the range and value of activations on the localization map. Specifically, a context propagation module is first developed to learn the top–down spatial dependency between adjacent feature maps, which helps back-propagate the activation from the discriminative part to its surroundings for more complete objects. Then, a diffusion probability distillation module (DPDM) is proposed, which transfers the pixel-level semantic correlation emerging in the image generation process to the localization map generation in a teacher–student learning manner. This helps boost the value of the activated foreground region and stimulates the value of neighboring inactivated foreground positions to sharpen the object boundary. Experiments on various datasets and backbones demonstrate the superiority of our ADNet over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in object localization and segmentation, yielding 82.2% and 62.2% Top-1 Loc on Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) and ImageNet Large-ScaleVisual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) datasets and 76.6% pixel average precision (PxAP) on OpenImages dataset. Qualitative results also show that we can achieve a more complete and consistent activation covering the whole object.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based multiview clustering methods have gained significant attention in recent years. In particular, incorporating graph filtering into these methods allows for the exploration and utilization of both feature and topological information, resulting in a commendable improvement in clustering accuracy. However, these methods still exhibit several limitations: 1) the graph filters are predetermined, which disconnects the link with subsequent clustering tasks and 2) the separability of the filtered features is poor, which may not be suitable for the clustering. To mitigate these aforementioned issues, we propose Multiview Clustering via Block Diagonal Graph Filtering (MvC-BDGF), which can learn cluster-friendly graph filters. Specifically, the block diagonal graph filter with localized characteristics, which could make the filtered features very discriminating, is innovatively designed. The MvC-BDGF model seamlessly integrates the learning of graph filters with the acquisition of consensus graphs, forming a unified framework. This integration allows the model to obtain optimal filters and simultaneously acquire corresponding clustering labels. To solve the optimization problem in the MvC-BDGF model, an iterative solver based on the coordinate descent method is devised. Finally, a large number of experiments on benchmark datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. The code is available at https://github.com/haonanxin/MvC-BDGF_code.},

While existing HGNN-based approaches excel in modeling high-order correlations among data using hyperedges, they often have difficulties in distinguishing diverse semantics ( e.g., bioactivities between drug and target in biological networks) of different correlations, making it challenging to learn accurate final representations. The underlying reason is that the specific semantic information of each hyperedge cannot be captured and distinguished during the modeling and learning process. To address this, we propose a mode HGNN (MHGNN) framework that extends the vanilla hypergraph structure by endowing hyperedges with mode information for encapsulating their semantics and then performs mode-aware high-order message passing upon mode hypergraph for achieving comprehensive node representations. Extensive evaluations on four real-world datasets under two representative tasks have demonstrated the outstanding performance of MHGNN against the state of the arts.},

This work proposes a novel framework, surrogate-based physical error correction (SPEC), which addresses the unmet need for measurement reliability estimation and self-correction under process data uncertainty, by bringing together physics-and network-based optimization. The workings of SPEC are demonstrated using the paradigm of gas parameter estimation in the laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS). It operates in two modes, estimation and correction. During estimation, SPEC provides an initial state estimate, with estimation reliability being assessed by the physics-driven anomaly detection (PAD) module, which uses a hybrid error, combining a nondifferentiable reconstruction error, calculated through an ensemble network, and a differentiable feasibility error. When an estimate is flagged as unreliable, the correction mode is enabled. This network-based optimization algorithm delivers efficient and robust state correction by using a greedy ensemble search. SPEC’s performance is evaluated in a variety of experiments including outside-of-distribution and noisy data. Moreover, it offers reconfigurability through PAD configuration modification, eliminating the need for ML estimator retraining.},

In BLS, the feature nodes predominantly utilize linear features, and sparse representation is mainly employed in the feature optimization component. The robustness of these features to different data needs to be improved. Although there are many improved algorithms for BLS in feature optimization, there is no improvement based on fractional calculus at present. This article proposes BLS-FC, a novel data classification and regression method that can seamlessly combine BLS and fractional calculation. Fractional calculus describes the properties of data between integer orders and has memory properties. Fractional Fourier transform (Frft) also has time domain and frequency domain information. First, Frft is added to the broad learning feature node extraction to enrich the node features, which is called BLS-Frft. Second, fractional calculus is integrated into the BLS-Frft sparse representation feature optimization, and the feature representation capability is enhanced by fractional differential memory. This part is called BLS-FS. Finally, in order to solve the problem of unstable features of random fractional order subspaces, a fractional order multiscale feature interaction based on BLS-Frft is proposed, which is called BLS-MF.

  abstract     = {Topology identification of stochastic complex networks is an important topic in network science. In modern identification techniques under a continuous framework, the controller has a negative dynamic gain (feedback gain), such that stochastic LaSalle’s invariance principle (SLIP) is directly satisfied. In this article, the topology identification of stochastic complex networks is studied under aperiodic intermittent control (AIC). It is noteworthy that the AIC has a rest time, which indicates the SLIP is not valid since there is no negative feedback gained during this period. This motivates us to find other methods to obtain identification criteria. In this study, the graph-theoretic method and the stochastic analysis technique are integrated to obtain the almost surely exponential synchronization of drive–response networks. Furthermore, this integration enables the topology identification criteria of the drive network to be derived, which differs from previous work that directly utilized SLIP. It is worth mentioning that the topology identification criteria under the stochastic framework are first proposed based on the AIC in this work. The control strategy not only reduces the control cost but also makes it easier to operate. To enhance the application value of the network model, regime-switching diffusions, multiple weights, and nonlinear couplings are simultaneously considered. Finally, the proposed identification criteria are tested by using neural networks. At the same time, the validity of the theoretical results is further proved by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Background subtraction in videos is a core challenge in computer vision, aiming to accurately identify moving objects. Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has emerged as a promising unsupervised (US) paradigm for this task, showing strong performance on various benchmark datasets. Building on RPCA, tensor RPCA (TRPCA) variants have further enhanced background subtraction performance. However, current TRPCA methods often treat moving object pixels independently, lacking spatial-temporal structured-sparsity constraints. This limitation leads to performance degradation in scenarios with dynamic backgrounds, camouflage, and camera jitter. In this work, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal regularized tensor sparse RPCA algorithm to address these issues. By incorporating normalized graph-Laplacian matrices into the sparse component, we enforce spatial-temporal regularization. We construct two graphs—one across spatial locations and another across temporal slices—to guide regularization. By maximizing our objective function, we ensure that the tensor sparse component aligns with the spatiotemporal eigenvectors of the graph-Laplacian matrices, preserving disconnected moving object pixels. We formulate a new objective function and employ batch and online-based optimization methods to jointly optimize background-foreground separation and spatial-temporal regularization. Experimental evaluation on six publicly available datasets demonstrates the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods.},

In this article, we theoretically characterize the power of noisy quantum kernels and demonstrate that under depolarizing noise, quantum kernel methods may only have very poor prediction capability, even when the generalization error is small. Specifically, we quantitatively describe the decreasing of the prediction capability of noisy quantum kernels in terms of the rate of quantum noise, the size of training samples, the number of qubits, and the number of layers affected by quantum noises. Our results clearly demonstrate that for a given number of training samples, once the number of layers affected by noise exceeds some threshold, the prediction capability of noisy kernels is very poor. Thus, we provide a crucial warning to employ noisy quantum kernel methods for quantum computation and the theoretical results can also serve as guidelines when developing practical quantum kernel algorithms for achieving quantum advantages.},

Traditional methods that model the non-Euclidean characteristics of EEG signals demonstrate robustness and high performance, but they suffer from significant computational costs and are typically restricted to a single BCI paradigm. This article addresses these limitations by utilizing a diffeomorphism from Riemannian manifolds to the Cholesky space, which simplifies the solution process and enables application across multiple BCI paradigms. Our proposed Cholesky space-based model, CSNet, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in motor imagery (MI) decoding and emotion recognition and demonstrates competitive performance in error-related negativity (ERN) decoding, all without the need for data preprocessing. Furthermore, our runtime comparison shows that the Cholesky space method is more efficient than the method based on the Riemannian manifold as the matrix dimension increases. To enhance the interpretability of CSNet, we perform t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization for MI, frequency band energy visualization for emotion recognition, and temporal importance visualization for ERN. The results indicate that CSNet effectively learns discriminative features, identifies important frequency bands, and focuses on important temporal features. The CSNet effectively captures the non-Euclidean characteristics of EEG signals across various BCI paradigms, while mitigating high computational costs, making it a promising candidate for future BCI algorithms.

  abstract     = {Anomaly localization, which involves localizing anomalous regions within images, is a significant industrial task. Reconstruction-based methods are widely adopted for anomaly localization because of their low complexity and high interpretability. Most existing reconstruction-based methods only use normal samples to construct model. If anomalous samples are appropriately utilized in the process of anomaly localization, the localization performance can be improved. However, usually only weakly labeled anomalous samples are available, which limits the improvement. In many cases, we can obtain some knowledge of anomalies summarized by domain experts. Taking advantage of such knowledge can help us better utilize the anomalous samples and thus further improve the localization performance. In this article, we propose a novel reconstruction-based method named knowledge-informed self-training (KIST) which integrates knowledge into a reconstruction model through self-training. Specifically, KIST utilizes weakly labeled anomalous samples in addition to the normal ones and exploits knowledge to yield pixel-level pseudolabels of the anomalous samples. Based on the pseudolabels, a novel loss that promotes the reconstruction of normal pixels while suppressing the reconstruction of anomalous pixels is used. We conduct experiments on different datasets and demonstrate the advantages of KIST over the existing reconstruction-based methods.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is of significant importance in the enhancement and optimization of real-world applications. The task of MTSF poses substantial challenges due to the unpredictability of temporal patterns and the complexity in modeling the influence of all nonpredictive sequences on the target sequence at different time stages. Recent research has demonstrated the potential held by the Transformer algorithm to augment long-term forecasting capability. However, certain obstacles considerably obstruct the direct application of the Transformer to MTSF, such as an unsuitable embedding method, inadequate consideration of intervariable associations, and the intrinsic restriction of the point-wise objective function. To overcome these challenges, the Fusionformer, an effective Transformer-based forecasting model, is put forth in this article, which is characterized by three distinctive features: 1) the introduction of a segment-wise sequence embedding (SWSE) method allows for the conversion of the input sequence into multiple informative segments; 2) the implementation of a fusion attention mechanism (FAM), designed to capture predominant features across the time dimension and to model intricate intervariable dependencies; and 3) the development of an adversarial learning method, equipped with an auxiliary discriminator, facilitates the learning of data distribution, instead of progressively correcting the prediction error, thus substantially enhancing the MTSF’s accuracy. Furthermore, a Fusionformer-based risk assessment (FRA) method is structured for open-pit mine slope failure early warning issue (SFEW), which aims to prevent potential disasters by accurately predicting future slope movement trends and assessing the probabilities of landslide occurrences. Experimental outcomes validate that Fusionformer outperforms existing forecasting methods, while the FRA framework provides valuable insights and practical guidance for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Motor imagery (MI), an important category in electroencephalogram (EEG) research, often intersects with scenarios demanding low energy consumption, such as portable medical devices and isolated environment operations. Traditional deep learning (DL) algorithms, despite their effectiveness, are characterized by significant computational demands accompanied by high energy usage. As an alternative, spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the biological functions of the brain, emerge as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, SNNs typically exhibit lower accuracy than their counterpart convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Although attention mechanisms successfully increase network accuracy by focusing on relevant features, their integration in the SNN framework remains an open question. In this work, we combine the SNN and the attention mechanisms for the EEG classification, aiming to improve precision and reduce energy consumption. To this end, we first propose a noniterative leaky integrate-and-fire (NiLIF) neuron model, overcoming the gradient issues in traditional SNNs that use iterative LIF neurons for long time steps. Then, we introduce the sequence-based attention mechanisms to refine the feature map. We evaluated the proposed noniterative SNN with attention (NiSNN-A) model on two MI EEG datasets, OpenBMI and BCIC IV 2a. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1) our model outperforms other SNN models by achieving higher accuracy and 2) our model increases energy efficiency compared with the counterpart CNN models (i.e., by 2.13 times) while maintaining comparable accuracy.},

This study introduces a brain-inspired spiking neural model that integrates the learning and forgetting processes of sequential memory. The proposed model closely mimics the distributed and sparse temporal coding observed in the biological neural system. It employs one-shot online learning for memory formation and uses biologically plausible mechanisms of neural oscillation and phase precession to retrieve memorized sequences reliably. In addition, an active forgetting mechanism is integrated into the spiking neural model, enabling memory removal, flexibility, and updating. The proposed memory model not only enhances our understanding of human memory processes but also provides a robust framework for addressing temporal modeling tasks.},

Real-world data often encounters the issue of missing information, leading to a surge of interest in the domain of incomplete MVC (IMVC). Despite existing approaches having made significant progress in addressing IMVC, two significant challenges persist: 1) many alignment-based methodologies tend to overlook the topological relationships among instances and 2) the view representations based on completion lack reconstructive properties, casting doubt on their alignment with the actual view representations. In response, we present a novel approach termed neighbor-based completion for addressing IMVC (NBIMVC), which capitalizes on the topological information among instances and the consistent information across views. Specifically, our method uses autoencoders to learn feature representations for each view and leverages nearest-neighbor relationships between unique and complete instances to complete missing features in missing views. Subsequently, we enforce hard negative alignment constraints on complete paired instances in the feature space. Finally, we ensure the consistency of views in the semantic space by employing cluster information and a shared clustering network, which facilitates the final multiview categories output and effectively resolves the IMVC problem. Extensive experimental evaluations validate the efficacy of our proposed method, showcasing comparable or superior performance to existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a new graph neural network (GNN) explainability model, CiRLExplainer, which elucidates GNN predictions from a causal attribution perspective. Initially, a causal graph is constructed to analyze the causal relationships between the graph structure and GNN predicted values, identifying node attributes as confounding factors between the two. Subsequently, a backdoor adjustment strategy is employed to circumvent these confounders. Additionally, since the edges within the graph structure are not independent, reinforcement learning is incorporated. Through a sequential selection process, each step evaluates the combined effects of an edge and the previous structure to generate an explanatory subgraph. Specifically, a policy network predicts the probability of each candidate edge being selected and adds a new edge through sampling. The causal effect of this action is quantified as a reward, reflecting the interactivity among edges. By maximizing the policy gradient during training, the reward stream of the edge sequence is optimized. The CiRLExplainer is versatile and can be applied to any GNN model. A series of experiments was conducted, including accuracy (ACC) analysis of the explanation results, visualization of the explanatory subgraph, and ablation studies considering node attributes as confounding factors. The experimental results demonstrate that our model not only outperforms current state-of-the-art explanation techniques, but also provides precise semantic explanations from a causal perspective. Additionally, the experiments validate the rationale for considering node attributes as confounding factors, thereby enhancing the explanatory power and ACC of the model. Notably, across different datasets, our explainer achieved improvements over the best baseline models in the ACC-area under the curve (AUC) metrics by 5.89%, 5.69%, and 4.87%, respectively.},

In this work, we propose an implicit neural-guided cyclic generative model for UIE tasks, and the bidirectional mapping structure solves the aforementioned ill-posed problem from the perspective of bridging the gap between the metric-favorable and the perceptual-friendly versions. The multiband-aware implicit neural normalization effectively alleviates the degradation distribution. The U-shaped generator simulates human visual attention mechanisms, which enables the aggregation of global coarse-grained and local fine-grained features, and enhances the texture and edge features under the guidance of shallow semantics. The discriminator ensures perception-friendly visual results through a dual-branch structure via appearance and color.

Current research in cross-subject EEG emotion recognition has been insufficient in uncovering the shared neural underpinnings of affective processing in the human brain. To address this issue, we propose the parallel contrastive multisource domain adaptation (PCMDA) model, inspired by the neural representation mechanism in the ventral visual cortex. Our model employs a neuron-perception-inspired contrastive learning architecture for EEG-based emotion recognition in subject-independent scenarios. A two-stage alignment methodology is employed for the purpose of aligning numerous source domains with the target domain. This approach integrates a parallel contrastive loss (PCL) which simulates the self-supervised learning mechanism inherent in the neural representation of the human brain. Furthermore, a self-attention mechanism is integrated to extract emotion weights for each frequency band. Extensive experiments were conducted on three publicly available EEG emotion datasets, SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED), database for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP), and finer-grained affective computing EEG dataset (FACED), to evaluate our proposed method. The results demonstrate that the PCMDA effectively utilizes the unique EEG features and frequency band information of each subject, leading to improved generalization across different subjects in comparison to other methods.},

Recently, deep unfolded CI (DUCI) algorithms, which unfold the iterative algorithms into deep neural networks (DNNs), have achieved remarkable results. Theoretically, unfolding a convergent iterative algorithm could ensure a stable DUCI algorithm, i.e., its performance increases as the increasing stage. However, ensuring convergence often involves imposing constraints, such as bounded spectral norm or tight property, on the filter weights or sparsifying transform. Unfortunately, these constraints may compromise algorithm performance. To address this challenge, we present a provably bounded dynamic sparsifying transform network (BSTNet), which can be explicitly proven to be a bounded network without imposing constraints on the analysis sparsifying transform. Leveraging this advantage, the analysis sparsifying transform can be adaptively generated via a trainable DNN. Specifically, we elaborate a dynamic sparsifying transform generator capable of extracting multiple feature information from input instances, facilitating the creation of a faithful content-adaptive sparsifying transform. We explicitly demonstrate that the proposed BSTNet is a bounded network, and further embed it as the prior network into a DUCI framework to evaluate its performance on two CI tasks, i.e., spectral snapshot CI (SCI) and compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CSMRI). Experimental results showcase that our DUCI algorithms can achieve competitive recovery quality compared to benchmark algorithms. Theoretically, we explicitly prove that the proposed BSTNet is bounded, and we provide a comprehensive theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed iteration algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This brief presents a novel optimal control (OC) approach based on Q-learning to address robust control challenges for uncertain nonlinear systems subject to mismatched perturbations. Unlike conventional methodologies that solve the robust control problem directly, our approach reformulates the problem by minimizing a value function that integrates perturbation information. The Q-function is subsequently constructed by coupling the optimal value function with the Hamiltonian function. To estimate the parameters of the Q-function, an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique is employed to develop a critic neural network (NN). Leveraging this parameterized Q-function, we derive a model-free OC solution that generalizes the model-based formulation. Furthermore, using Lyapunov’s direct method, the resulting closed-loop system is guaranteed to have uniform ultimate bounded stability. A case study is presented to showcase the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.},

A majority of existing methods fail to accurately characterize and exploit the geometrically invariant structures of protein-ligand complexes for predicting binding affinities. In this study, we propose Geo-protein-ligand binding affinity (PLA), a geometric equivariant graph representation learning framework with local-global structure awareness, to predict binding affinity by capturing the geometric information of protein-ligand complexes. Specifically, the local structural information of 3-D protein-ligand complexes is extracted by using an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN), which iteratively updates node representations while preserving the equivariance of coordinate transformations. Meanwhile, a graph transformer is utilized to capture long-range interactions among atoms, offering a global view that adaptively focuses on complex regions with a significant impact on binding affinities. Furthermore, the multiscale information from the two channels is integrated to enhance the predictive capability of the model. Extensive experimental studies on two benchmark datasets confirm the superior performance of Geo-PLA. Moreover, the visual interpretation of the learned protein-ligand complexes further indicates that our model offers valuable biological insights for virtual screening and drug repositioning.},

  abstract     = {Multiview subspace clustering (MSC) maximizes the utilization of complementary description information provided by multiview data and achieves impressive clustering performance. However, most of them are inefficient or even invalid among large-scale scenarios due to expensive computational complexity. Recently, anchor strategy has been developed to address this, which selects a few representative samples as anchor points for representation learning and anchor graph construction. However, most of them only explore single cross-view correlation, i.e., cross-view consistency from the global aspect or cross-view complementarity from the local aspect, which provides insufficient semantic correlation understanding and exploration for complex multiview data. To effectively address this issue, this study proposes a fast multiview subspace clustering (FMSC) with local-global anchor representation collaborative learning. FMSC integrates the discriminative anchor points learning and anchor graph construction with optimal structure into a joint framework. Furthermore, local (view-specific) and global (view-shared) anchor representations are learned collaboratively under two interaction strategies at different levels, providing beneficial guidance from global learning to local learning. Thus, the proposed FMSC can maximize the exploration of the complementarity-consistency among multiview data and capture a more comprehensive semantic correlation. More importantly, an effective algorithm with linear complexity is designed to solve the corresponding optimization problem of FMSC, making it more practical in large-scale clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed FMSC in both clustering performance and computational efficiency.},

In addition, existing methods lack proof of strict privacy protection. To address the above issues, we propose a new secure federated k-means clustering framework to achieve better clustering results under privacy requirements. Specifically, for the clients, we use cluster centers (representative points) generated by k-means to represent the corresponding clusters. These representative points can effectively preserve the structure of the local data and they are encrypted by differential privacy. For the server, we propose two methods to reprocess the uploaded encrypted representative points to obtain better final cluster centers, one uses k-means, and the other considers the improved density peaks (density cores) as final centers and then sends them back to the clients. Finally, each client assigns local data to their nearest centers. Experimental results show that the proposed methods perform better than several centralized (nonfederated) classical clustering algorithms [k-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), and density peak clustering (DPC)] and state-of-the-art (SOTA) centralized clustering algorithms in most cases. In particular, the proposed algorithms perform better than the SOTA FC framework k-FED (ICML2021) and MUFC (ICLR2023).},

In the context of convex objective functions, we show that with proper step sizes and hyperparameters, the average regret can achieve the convergence rate ${\mathcal { O}}(T^{-(1/2)})$ after T iterations under some standard assumptions. We further improve it to $O(T^{-1}\log T)$ when the objective functions are strongly convex. In the context of smooth objective functions (not necessarily convex), based on properties of the strongly convex differentiable mirror map, our algorithms achieve convergence rates of order ${\mathcal { O}}(T^{-(1/2)})$ up to a logarithmic term, requiring large or increasing hyperparameters that are coincident with practical usage of Adam-type algorithms.

Then, based on these assumptions, we develop a mode-dependent discontinuous Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (DLKF) to reduce model conservatism. Next, we introduce a new auxiliary slack-matrix-based integral inequality (ASMBII) to approximate the integral quadratic terms arising from the derivative of the DLKFs. Furthermore, we develop a multiple stochastic sampling framework to achieve asymptotic synchronization between the primary and secondary systems, and less conservative criteria for asymptotic stability in the mean square sense of the error model are derived by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, we present the numerical validations and corresponding experimental results in a pragmatic application of image processing to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed algorithms and techniques.

To solve these issues, in this article, we propose a new dual consistency constraint-based self-supervised representation learning method for heterogeneous graphs with missing attributes. Specifically, we first investigate the representation completion and the within-view consistency loss to complete missing information in the representation space, and then, we investigate the cross-view consistency loss to ensure data consistency across views. We further reconstruct the masked data to avoid information loss due to the masking process. As a result, our method effectively filters out noise and inaccurate information by the representation completion process as well as achieves discriminative representation learning for heterogeneous graphs with missing attributes.

This article introduces a constraint transformation-based design method that ensures excitation signals always originate from a fixed region, regardless of initial conditions. By meeting the compactness condition required by the universal approximation theorem, this approach safeguards the functionality of the NN-driven control unit. Additionally, a decaying damping rate is employed to enable the tracking error to asymptotically converge to zero, rather than being ultimately uniformly bounded (UUB). To further ensure robust operation even if the NN underperforms due to an insufficient number of neurons or violation of the compact set condition, a new control strategy is developed based on the worst case behavior of NNs. This “fail-secure” mechanism significantly enhances the reliability of the NN-based control scheme. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method are confirmed through numerical simulations, demonstrating its potential to substantially improve the robustness and performance of NN-driven control systems.},

In contrast to traditional model-free schemes used for estimating the Jacobian matrix of the robotic arm, in this work, a novel estimator directly for the pseudoinverse (PI) of the Jacobian matrix based on Zhang neurodynamics (ZN) is proposed for the first time. In addition, a novel model-free and PI-free ZN (MFPIFZN) scheme for path tracking control of robotic arms is proposed. The MFPIFZN scheme not only significantly reduces the operation complexity by eliminating the requirement to compute the PI of the Jacobian matrix but also enhances the accuracy by eliminating the potential errors that may arise from the computation of the PI. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees for the convergence and stability of the MFPIFZN scheme. Finally, experimental results conducted on planar four-link and Kinova Jaco2 robotic arms vividly illustrate the excellent performance of the MFPIFZN scheme.

To address these issues, we propose a tri-interaction enhancement network (TIENet), which contains three modules: spatial-frequency interaction (SFI), intermodal mask interaction (IMMI), and intramodal feature fusion (IMFF). Specifically, the SFI boosts the modality-specific representation by integrating the amplitude-guided attention mechanism into the phase space, combined with spatial-domain convolution to achieve fine-grained information learning. Meanwhile, the IMMI enhances the richness of the feature descriptors by embedding the intermodal relationships to preserve complementary information. Finally, the IMFF module considers the structure of the human body and integrates intramodal contextual information.

This undesired structure arising either due to undesired artifacts (e.g., noise) or by design (e.g., asynchronous or aperiodic sampling in distributed sensors) results in irregularity in the temporal dimension and forms a bottleneck in data mining. Although extensive data science approaches have been proposed to address learning problems involving irregular data, the emphasis was largely placed on filling in the missing entries via interpolation and binning, or the methods were tailored to specific data analytic tasks. In this article, we develop a reservoir computing (RC)-based iterative learning method for recovering missing data in irregular time series generated by dynamical systems and networks. In particular, we formulate this learning task as a fixed-point iterative learning problem and develop a training procedure using an RC network (RCN). We find that when the irregular time series has “sufficient” samples to train an RCN within a tolerant training error then the missing samples in the time series can be recovered systematically. We also derive sufficient conditions with respect to the choices of the reservoir parameters that guarantee the convergence of the iterative procedure. We present several numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed iterative RCN approach. Specifically, we illustrate the capability of our approach to recover missing data in irregular time series generated by chaotic Rössler and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) systems. Finally, we also report the results of incorporating our approach in an irregular medical data classification task.},

  abstract     = {Salamander-like robots, renowned for their versatile locomotion, present unique challenges in the development of effective path-following controllers due to their distinctive movement patterns and complex body structures. Conventional path-following controllers, while effective for various bionic robots, struggle with the intricate modeling for salamander-like robots and often require laborious manual tuning. Conversely, learning-based methods offer promising alternatives but face issues such as reliance on environmental interactions, short-sighted prediction, and irrational design of state space and reward function. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a diffusion model-based hierarchical control framework that treats path tracking as a sequence generation problem. The diffusion model’s capability to model joint distributions of state, action, and reward sequences enables it to outperform other learning-based approaches in efficient data utilization, stable training, and long-horizon dependency modeling. Our framework integrates a high-level policy driven by guided diffusion with a low-level controller for parsing commands into executable movements via inverse kinematics, reducing the action space and improving learning efficiency. In addition, we design a more reasonable state space and reward function tailored to the path-following task, addressing shortcomings in prior learning-based controllers. Furthermore, we optimize the diffusion model (DM) by developing lightweight network architectures and incorporating advanced attention mechanisms, to ensure its practical deployment on physical robots with limited computational resources, without compromising performance. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness in diverse path-following tasks for salamander-like robots, marking a significant advancement in the control of biomimetic robots.},

  abstract     = {Multiview data, characterized by rich features, are crucial in many machine learning applications. However, effectively extracting intraview features and integrating interview information present significant challenges in multiview learning (MVL). Traditional deep network-based approaches often involve learning multiple layers to derive latent. In these methods, the features of different classes are typically implicitly embedded rather than systematically organized. This lack of structure makes it challenging to explicitly map classes to independent principal subspaces in the feature space, potentially causing class overlap and confusion. Consequently, the capability of these representations to accurately capture the intrinsic structure of the data remains uncertain. In this article, we introduce an innovative multiview representation learning (MVRL) by maximizing two information-theoretic metrics: intraview coding rate reduction and interview mutual information. Specifically, in the intraview representation learning, we aim to optimize feature representations by maximizing the coding rate difference between the entire dataset and individual classes. This process expands the feature representation space while compressing the representations within each class, resulting in more compact feature representations within each viewpoint. Subsequently, we align and fuse these view-specific features through space transformation and cross-sample fusion to achieve consistent representation across multiple views. Finally, we maximize information transmission to maintain consistency and correlation among data representations across views. By maximizing mutual information between the consensus representations and view-specific representations, our method ensures that the learned representations capture more concise intrinsic features and correlations among different views, thereby enhancing the performance and generalization ability of MVL. Experiments show that the proposed methods have achieved excellent performance.},

To address this issue and robustly train shared models using distributed noisy labeled data, we propose FedDQ, a noise-robust FL framework that utilizes co-distillation and quality-aware aggregation techniques. FedDQ incorporates two key features: a noise-adaptive training strategy and an efficient label-correcting mechanism. The noise-adaptive training strategy relies on the estimation of labels’ noise levels to dynamically adjust clients’ training engagement, which mitigates the impact of wrong labels while efficiently exploring features from clean data. In addition, FedDQ designs a two-head network and employs it for co-distillation. The co-distillation strategy facilitates knowledge transfer among clients to share the representational capabilities. Besides, FedDQ enhances label correction to rectify improper labels through co-filtering and label correction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDQ in improving model performance and handling noisy data challenges in FL settings. On the CIFAR-100 dataset with noisy labels, FedDQ exhibits a notable improvement of up to 32.4% compared to the baseline method.},

In this article, we propose the better forward compatibility pretraining (BFCP) to further enhance forward compatibility in FSCIL. We adopt a two-stage training for the backbone network in the base session. First, we train the backbone network at the image-level to enhance its feature extraction capability, enabling the model to extract valuable information from unknown class images. Second, we fine-tune the backbone network at the feature-level with fake prototypes and instances to achieve clustering base classes and reserve space for unknown new classes. For all incremental new sessions, we freeze the backbone network and employ prototype rectification without further training to refine the prototypes of the novel classes. We conduct extensive experiments with different input scales, including federated cross-domain pretraining and cross-domain class-incremental experiments. BFCP efficiently handles both novel and base classes of each incremental session and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy of 63.47% on the CIFAR100 dataset.},

Existing IFD-oriented MUDA approaches frequently fail to recognize the distinct importance of each source domain relative to specific target samples, or lack flexibility in integrating diagnostic insights from multiple sources. In response, a novel MUDA approach is proposed for IFD, termed point-to-set metric-gated mixture of experts (PSMMoEs). This method leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoEs) framework to automatically integrate the complementary information from multiple source domains. It develops a deep point-to-set distance (PSD) metric learning technique within the MoE’s gating mechanism, effectively fusing domain-specific features by assessing the similarity between individual target samples and each source domain. The method ensures balanced training across progressive stages, harmonizing multitask learning with joint training for the MoE framework. Furthermore, a multilayer maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) measurement is employed for domain alignment, ensuring feature alignment across different domains at multiple levels. In order to assess the efficacy of the proposed method, it is compared with several leading domain adaptation methods on publicly available and laboratory-based rotating machinery fault datasets. The experimental results demonstrate superior classification and adaptation capabilities of the proposed fault diagnosis method.},

Control theory provides systematic techniques for designing feedback systems while ensuring fundamental properties such as stabilizability, which are crucial for practical control applications. However, conventional data-driven approaches often overlook or struggle to explicitly incorporate such control properties into learned models. To address this, we introduce a novel neural network (NN)-based approach that concurrently learns the system dynamics, a stabilizing feedback controller, and a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, thus explicitly guaranteeing stabilizability in the learned model. Our proposed deep learning framework is versatile and applicable across a wide range of control problems, including safety control, $L_{2}$ -gain control, passivation, and solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi inequalities. By embedding stabilizability as a core property within the learning process, our method allows for the development of learned models that are not only data-driven but also grounded in control-theoretic guarantees, greatly enhancing their utility in real-world control applications. This article includes examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing the stability and control performance improvements achieved in various control scenarios. The methods proposed in this article can be easily applied to modeling without control design.

Self-paced curriculum learning (SPCL), which models the easy-to-hard learning progression from human beings, is considered as a potential savior. In spite of the fact that numerous SPCL solutions have been explored, it still confronts two main challenges exactly in solving deep networks. By virtue of various designed regularizers, existing weighting schemes independent of the learning objective heavily rely on the prior knowledge. In addition, alternative optimization strategy (AOS) enables the tedious iterative training procedure, thus there is still not an efficient framework that integrates the SPCL paradigm well with networks. This article delivers a novel insight that attention mechanism allows for adaptive enhancement in the contribution of diverse instance information to the gradient propagation. Accordingly, we propose a general-purpose deep SPCL paradigm that incorporates the preferences of implicit regularizer for different samples into the network structure with inductive bias, which in turn is formalized as the self-paced curriculum network (SPCNet). Our proposal allows simultaneous online difficulty estimation, adaptive sample selection, and model updating in an end-to-end manner, which significantly facilitates the collaboration of SPCL to deep networks. Experiments on image classification and scene classification tasks demonstrate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art schemes and obtains superior performance.},

To address this challenge, open-world SSL (OWSSL) is proposed in recent years and attracts much attention. One core difficulty in OWSSL is to enhance the representative ability for unlabeled samples, especially for those in novel classes. More recently, several works introduce contrastive learning into OWSSL and achieve impressive performance. However, they mainly focus on conducting contrastive learning solely in either feature or prediction spaces, while ignoring the thorough exploration of information potentials in dual spaces. In this study, we propose a novel method to handle OWSSL tasks via dual-space contrastive learning (DSCL). DSCL contains two modules: intraspace contrastive learning and interspace contrastive learning. In the intraspace module, we bridge the two spaces with a learnable classifier and impose contrastive learning in the dual spaces, such that the category discriminative information could be effectively utilized to improve the representative ability. In interspace module, to further enhance the utilization of complementary information from dual spaces, we introduce neighborhood information from feature space to enhance predictive learning and meanwhile utilize the cluster structure from the prediction spaces to improve intraclass compactness of the features. Compared with state-of-the-art competitors, the proposed DSCL achieves superior performance on the popular benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100, Imagenet100, CIFAR10, CUB-200, and Scar.},

In this article, we aim to effectively incorporate the attribute view into GCL while leveraging multiscale structure views. We identify that directly contrasting the attribute view with the local structure view results in impaired performance, primarily due to the excessively low level of mutual information (MI) between these two contrastive views. To overcome this inherent limitation, we propose a novel Attribute and Structure-Preserving GCL framework, named attribute and structure-preserving graph contrastive learning (ASP). ASP adopts an innovative contrastive view generation process that aggregates different graph views as the final contrastive view. The framework has two main modules: the attribute-preserving contrastive learning module and the structure-preserving contrastive learning module. These modules capture attribute and long-range global structure information of the input graphs. We further extend ASP to ASP-adaptive which can flexibly generate contrastive views with adaptive aggregation mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world graph benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ASP and ASP-adaptive over several representative baselines on both node classification and link prediction tasks.

It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the behavioral pseudo-label informed sparse graph convolution network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction.

  abstract     = {The ability of processing long contexts is crucial for large language models (LLMs), but training LLMs with a long-context window requires substantial computational resources. Many sought to mitigate this through the sparse attention mechanism. However, sparse attention faces a noticeable gap compared with full attention in capturing long-distance information, leading to limited long-context processing capabilities. To effectively address this issue, this article proposes a novel sparse transformer architecture called 2-D transformer (2D-former), aimed at extending the context windows of pretrained LLMs while reducing GPU memory requirements. The 2D-former incorporates a 2-D attention mechanism that consists of a long-distance information compressor (LDIC) and a blockwise attention (BA) mechanism. LDIC can self-adaptively extract blockwise representational features by convolution and compress long-distance information into a set of tokens based on the significance of each block. The BA mechanism integrates these features, enabling each token to directly communicate with any of its preceding tokens during the computation of sparse attention. In this way, sparse attention can fully utilize long-distance information to bridge the gap with full attention while greatly reducing computational requirements. The 2D-former only needs to add less than 0.14% of additional trainable parameters to extend the context length of LLaMA2 7B to 32k on 4 A100 GPUs with 40-GB memory. In addition, it is compatible with most current acceleration techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. Furthermore, we conduct supervised fine-tuning with 2D-former using our self-collected long-instruction fine-tuning dataset, named LongTuning, which comprises over 11k long-context question-answer (QA) pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that 2D-former achieves efficient long-context extension with minimal GPU memory and computational time consumption, while maintaining superior performance across both downstream long-context and short-context tasks.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional point cloud semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision. As the fully supervised approaches suffer from the generalization issue with limited data, few-shot point cloud segmentation models have been proposed to address the flexible adaptation. Nevertheless, due to the class-agnostic nature of the few-shot pretraining, its pretrained feature extractor is hard to capture the class-related intrinsic and abstract information. Therefore, we introduce the new concept of shallow and deep similarities and propose a shallow–deep similarity learning network (SDSimPoint) that aims to learn both shallow (superficial geometry, color, etc.) and deep similarities (intrinsic context and semantics, etc.) between the support and query samples, thereby boosting the performance. Moreover, we design a beyond-episode attention module (BEAM) to enlarge the region of the attention mechanism from a single episode to the entire dataset by utilizing the memory units, which enhances the extraction ability to better capture the shallow and deep similarities. Furthermore, our distance metric function is learnable in the proposed framework, which can better adapt to complex data distributions. Our proposed SDSimPoint consistently demonstrates substantial improvements compared to baseline approaches across various datasets in diverse few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation settings.},

However, existing studies face challenges in addressing the high-level noise and heterogeneity in multi-omics data. This article presents a novel approach that combines large foundation models (LFMs) with soft attention mechanisms to enhance, select, and fuse multi-omics features, thereby improving the performance of disease classification. Specifically, we first propose a mathematical model based on soft attention mechanisms. This model employs multi-head attention (MHA) and self-attention (SA) for feature selection, and uses cross-attention (CA) for feature fusion. Then, a multi-way soft attention fusion framework (MSAFF) with LFMs is proposed. In this approach, biomedical LFMs are used to construct low-noise biomedical features. The multi-way soft attention algorithm implements effective feature selection and fusion described in the mathematical model. Experimental results on the public imaging genetics datasets demonstrate the advanced performances of MSAFF in both disease classification and AD-related pathogeny discrimination. This article provides intelligent support for the diagnosis and pathogenesis research of AD. Our code can be accessed at github.com/fmri123456/MSAFF.},

To enhance transmission reliability and reduce network resource consumption, BEMs are used to convert measurement signals into binary bit strings (BBSs) of limited length, which are then transmitted to the estimator through noisy communication channels. During transmission, random bit errors may occur in the BBSs due to channel noise. For the considered nonlinear networked control systems affected by random bit errors, a neural-network (NN)-based recursive estimation strategy is proposed, where an NN with a time-varying tuning scalar is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinearity of the networked control systems. By using the proposed strategy, the upper bounds of the estimation error of the system state and the trace of the estimation error of the NN weight (NNW) are first derived. These bounds are then minimized by recursively designing both the estimator gain matrix and the tuning scalar of the NNW. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed estimation strategy is demonstrated through a numerical example.},

  abstract     = {Graph contrastive learning (GCL), as a typical self-supervised learning paradigm, has been able to achieve promising performance without labels and gradually attracts much attention. Graph-level method aims to learn representations of each graph by contrasting two augmented graphs. Previous studies usually simply apply contrastive learning to keep the embeddings of augmented views from the same anchor graph (positive pairs) close to each other, as well as separate the embeddings of augmented views from different anchor graphs (negative pairs). However, it is well-known that the structure of graph is always complex and multiscale, which gives rise to a fundamental question: after graph augmentation, will the previous assumption still hold in reality? Through experimental analytics, we find that the semantic information of two augmented graphs from the same anchor graph may be not consistent, and whether two augmented graphs are positive or negative sample pairs is highly correlated with the multiscale structure of the graph. Based on this observation, we then propose a multiscale subgraph contrastive learning method, named MSSGCL, which can characterize the fine-grained semantic information. Specifically, we generate global and local views at different scales based on subgraph sampling and construct multiple contrastive relationships according to their semantic associations to provide richer self-supervised information. Furthermore, to further improve the generalization performance of the model, we propose an extended model called MSSGCL++. It adopts an asymmetric structure to avoid pushing semantically similar negative samples far away. We further introduce adversarial training to perturb the augmented view and thus construct a more difficult self-supervised training task. Finally, a min-max saddle point problem is optimized and the “free” strategy is used to speed up the training process. Extensive experiments and parametric analysis on 16 real-world graph classification datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Compared with state of the art (SOTA) method, our method achieves improvements of 2% and 1.6% in unsupervised and transfer learning settings, respectively.},

  abstract     = {In artificial intelligence (AI), generalization refers to a model’s ability to perform well on out-of-distribution data related to the given task, beyond the data it was trained on. For an AI agent to excel, it must also possess the continual learning capability, whereby an agent incrementally learns to perform a sequence of tasks without forgetting the previously acquired knowledge to solve the old tasks. Intuitively, generalization within a task allows the model to learn underlying features that can readily be applied to novel tasks, facilitating quicker learning and enhanced performance in subsequent tasks within a continual learning framework. Conversely, continual learning methods often include mechanisms to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, ensuring that knowledge from earlier tasks is retained. This preservation of knowledge over tasks plays a role in enhancing generalization for the ongoing task at hand. Despite the intuitive appeal of the interplay of both abilities, existing literature on continual learning and generalization has proceeded separately. In the preliminary effort to promote studies that bridge both fields, we first present empirical evidence showing that each of these fields has a mutually positive effect on the other. Next, building upon this finding, we introduce a simple and effective technique known as shape-texture consistency regularization (STCR), which caters to continual learning. STCR learns both shape and texture representations for each task, consequently enhancing generalization and thereby mitigating forgetting. Remarkably, extensive experiments validate that our STCR, can be seamlessly integrated with existing continual learning methods, including replay-free approaches. Its performance surpasses these continual learning methods in isolation or when combined with established generalization techniques by a large margin.

However, the iterative processing of large matrices often makes the computation process cumbersome. To address this issue, for TRLDA, we propose a novel random method that extracts orthogonal bases from matrices, allowing computations with small-sized matrices. This significantly reduces computational time without compromising accuracy. For ratio trace LDA, we introduce a fast generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) algorithm, which demonstrates superior speed compared to MATLAB’s built-in GSVD algorithm in experiments. By integrating this new GSVD algorithm into ratio trace LDA, we propose FGSVD-LDA, which exhibits low computational complexity and good classification performance. The experimental results show that both methods effectively achieve dimensionality reduction and deliver satisfactory classification accuracy.},

To tackle this problem, an essential task named multi-future trajectory prediction (MTP) has recently been studied.

In this article, we present the first survey for MTP with our unique taxonomies and a comprehensive analysis of frameworks, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

  abstract     = {Positive and unlabeled (PU) learning, which trains binary classifiers using only PU data, has gained vast attentions in recent years. Traditional PU learning often assumes that all the positive samples are labeled accurately. Nevertheless, due to the reasons such as sample ambiguity and insufficient algorithms, label noise is almost unavoidable in this scenario. Current PU algorithms neglect the label noise issue in the positive set, which is often biased toward certain instances rather than being uniformly distributed in practical applications. We define this important but understudied problem as PU learning with instance-dependent label noise (PUIDN). To eliminate the adverse impact of IDN, we leverage confidence scores for each instance in the positive set, which establish the connection between samples and labels without any assumption on noise distribution. Then, we propose an unbiased estimator for classification risk considering both label and confidence information, which can be computed immediately from PUIDN data along with their confidence scores. Moreover, our classification framework integrates an optimization strategy of alternating iteration based on the correlation between different confidence information, thereby alleviating the additional requirement for training data. Theoretically, we derive a generalization error bound for our proposed method. Experimentally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through various types of numerical results.},

Based on our findings, we propose an average of pruning (AoP), consisting of model averaging (MA) and pruning, to mitigate the unstable behaviors.

Previous methods relying on the node/edge attributes or the distance on the graph structure are not practical due to the deficiency of the attributes and the limitation of the explicit distance estimation, respectively. Moreover, the existing graph representation learning methods mostly rely on graph neural networks (GNNs), which cannot adequately take the dynamic correlations between nodes into consideration, leading to the generating of inferior node embeddings. Thus, we propose a time-aware graph (TAG) learning method for link prediction on temporal networks. We first conduct a theoretical causal analysis proving that the correlations between nodes are required to be unchanged for the temporal graph representation learning using GNNs. Then, we model the recent dynamic node correlations by designing an edge-dropping (ED) module and adopting a recent neighbor sampling (RNS) strategy so as to approximate the above condition. Besides, we also preserve the long-term stable node correlations by introducing additional self-supervisions using the contrastive learning. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on four public temporal network datasets, i.e., MathOverflow, StackOverflow, AskUbuntu, and SuperUser, demonstrate that TAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of average precision (AP) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). In addition, TAG can ensure high computational efficiency by making the temporal graph lightweight, letting it be practical in real-world applications.},

In addition, real-time anomaly detection poses high demands on low computational cost and model robustness, presenting substantial obstacles for unsupervised time-series anomaly detection. In this article, we propose the data-driven spontaneous perturbation based on the sequence-image strategy and temporal anomaly knowledge enhancement strategy based on artificial anomalous data pairs to enhance the cognition of abnormal knowledge in unsupervised scenarios. On this basis, we propose the denoising autoencoder based on the broad learning system (DBLS-AE), which sufficiently learns the anomalous patterns, achieving efficient anomaly detection with low computational costs. To enhance the robustness in handling complex and diverse temporal anomalies, we further propose the progressive diversity denoising autoencoders based on the broad learning system (PddBLS-AE), which gradually prioritizes challenging samples and constructs a diverse ensemble of DBLS-AEs, markedly improving both performance and robustness. By innovatively utilizing the broad learning system (BLS), PddBLS-AE achieves accelerated training compared with advanced deep learning models.

The core of our approach is to represent the spatial configurations of ground objects topologically and encode these layouts using a binary matrix factorization (MF) technique that robustly addresses the challenge of noisy image-level labels. Specifically, for each UHD aerial photograph, we identify visually and semantically important object patches. These patches are then connected spatially to form graphlets, small graphs that capture the layout and relations between adjacent objects. To enhance the understanding of these graphlets, we propose a binary MF approach that captures their semantic content. The method integrates four key components: 1) learning binary hash codes; 2) refining noisy labels; 3) incorporating deep image-level semantics; and 4) adaptively updating the data graph. The binary MF is solved iteratively, with each graphlet being transformed into a set of discrete hash codes. These hash codes, which represent the spatial and semantic information of the graphlets, are subsequently encoded into a feature vector using a kernel machine, enabling multilabel categorization of the aerial photographs. For validation, we compiled a large-scale dataset of UHD aerial photographs, sourced from 100 of the top-ranked cities worldwide. Experimental results demonstrate that: 1) our method excels in learning categorization models from imperfect labels and 2) the integration of the four proposed attributes enables effective encoding of the graphlets into hash codes, providing a powerful representation of the UHD aerial photographs.},

  abstract     = {Modern quantitative finance and portfolio-based investment hinge on multimedia news and historical price trends for stock movement prediction. However, prior studies overlook the long tail effect in the feature distribution of stocks, inevitably leading to biased attention and thus degrading the efficiency of utilizing news. To this end, we propose a prompt-adaptive trimodal model (PA-TMM) to overcome the biased stock attention networks and tail feature scarcity problem. In this model, sentiments automatically extracted from trimodal information serve as prompts reflecting the market’s collective mood for other entities, and the interactions among stocks are dynamically inferred for integrating both news- and price-induced movements. By leveraging the movement prompt adaptation (MPA) strategy, our model proactively adapts to the feature-imbalanced phenomenon and converges toward being responsive to the news sensitively. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets consistently demonstrate not only the superiority of the proposed framework over various state-of-the-art baselines, but also its effectiveness, profitability, and robustness in Fintech.

  abstract     = {Existing domain adaptation semantic segmentation (DASS) methods under adverse conditions often depend on pseudo-labels for network training. However, these pseudo-labels are frequently plagued by noise and bias toward high-confidence predictions, thereby impeding the enhancement of segmentation performance. This article tackles the above challenge by proposing a novel boundary-based active domain adaptation (ADA) framework, which efficiently selects both informative low-confidence samples and high-confident but misclassified samples to be labeled while maximizing the segmentation performance under a limited annotation budget. For the evaluation of sample confidence and informativeness, we first propose ranking weighted feature space impurity (RWFSI) metric to quantify category distribution among a sample’s nearest neighbors within the feature space and consider the samples with higher RWFSI values as low-confidence samples around the decision boundary, which can also alleviate the category imbalance of active labels. Subsequently, we apply Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to model the distribution across source and target domains. Using the spatial arrangement of each GMM component, we define the intraclass domain shift score (ICDSS), which identifies samples with high ICDSS values as those more likely to be high-confidence but misclassified, aiding in refining sample selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is superior to the existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation and active learning (AL) methods and comparable with those of full supervision.

In this work, we tackle this shortcoming by proposing a synthetic graph generation tool that enables scaling datasets to production-size graphs with trillions of edges and billions of nodes. The proposed method comprises a series of parametric models that can either be randomly initialized or fit to proprietary datasets. These models can then be released to researchers to study graph methods on the synthetic data, facilitating prototype development and novel applications.

Our framework incorporates two key modules: an event-aware motion detection (EAMD) module that adaptively aggregates multiframe motion information using event-driven masks and a pyramidal adaptive selection module that separates background and rain layers by leveraging contextual priors from both event and conventional camera data. To facilitate efficient training, we introduce a real-world dataset of synchronized rainy videos and event streams.

  abstract     = {Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and unlabeled data share an identical class distribution; however, in practice, this assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel framework, diversify and conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the context of open-set SSL (OSSL). In particular, we note that existing OSSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be easily failed when the labeled data are insufficient, leading to performance degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models that are differently biased toward the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables robust outlier detection, even when the labeled data are underspecified. Our key contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently biased toward outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art OSSL methods across various protocols.},

DL-NMPC-SD uses an a priori nominal vehicle model in combination with a scene dynamics model learned from temporal range sensing information. The scene dynamics model is responsible for estimating the desired vehicle trajectory, as well as to adjust the true system model used by the underlying model predictive controller. We propose to encode the scene dynamics model within the layers of a deep neural network, which acts as a nonlinear approximator for the high-order state space of the operating conditions. The model is learned based on temporal sequences of range-sensing observations and system states, both integrated by an Augmented Memory component. We use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and the Bellman optimality principle to train our learning controller with a modified version of the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm, enabling us to estimate the desired state trajectory as an optimal action-value function. We have evaluated DL-NMPC-SD against the baseline dynamic window approach (DWA), as well as against two state-of-the-art End2End and RL methods, respectively. The performance has been measured in three experiments: 1) in our GridSim virtual environment; 2) on indoor and outdoor navigation tasks using our RovisLab autonomous mobile test unit (AMTU) platform; and 3) on a full-scale autonomous test vehicle driving on public roads.},

  abstract     = {Despite notable advancements across various tasks, deep sequence recognition models are shown to grapple with the dilemma of over-confidence, leading to unreliable predicted confidence, necessitating the need for calibration. Current efforts predominantly focus on classification model calibration, leaving the sequence recognition model calibration analysis underexplored and challenging. In this work, we discover that the primary reason for over-confidence in sequence recognition models stems from the one-hot encoding target sequence training paradigm and identify two distinct manifestations of over-confidence: perception and semantic context over-confidence. To address these challenges, we propose a heterogeneous correlation aware sequence regularization (HCSR) method that adaptively incorporates correlated sequences into training alongside the target sequence as additional supervision to regularize the probability of the target sequence from arbitrarily escalating. Specifically, a correlated sequence mining (CSM) model is designed, capable of efficiently mining heterogeneous correlated sequences, which can be flexibly customized to search for specific types of correlated sequences in demand to facilitate the calibration of corresponding types of over-confidence in the calibrating model, thereby achieving fine-grained calibration. Meanwhile, an adaptive calibration module is introduced to adaptively coordinate the optimization weights between the target sequence and correlated sequences, enabling the co-calibration among different samples. Comprehensive experiments conducted on several widely employed sequence recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current competing methods by a substantial margin.

This framework employs a compact convolutional neural network architecture to achieve high-quality image denoising. Given a single observed noisy image, we first aim to obtain multiple images with different noise versions. We ensure that the content remains as consistent as possible with the true signal of the noisy image while keeping the noise independent. Specifically, we construct a pixel bank tensor, where each pixel consists of the most similar pixels from the non-local region of the noisy image. Then, multiple training samples, also known as pseudo instances, can be derived from the pixel bank by randomly pixel sampling. By harnessing pixel- wise random sampling, Pixel2Pixel generates a large number of training pseudo instances, thus avoiding reliance on specific training data. In addition, this non-local pixel selection and random sampling strategy helps to break down the spatial correlation of real-world noise as well. Since the proposed method does not require accurate priors on the noise distribution and clean training images, it is suitable for a wide range of noise types and different noise levels, exhibiting strong generalization ability, especially in real noisy scenes. Extensive experiments across various noise types show that Pixel2Pixel outperforms existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/qingma2016/Pixel2Pixel.},

  abstract     = {Recently, text-guided scalable vector graphics (SVG) synthesis has shown great promise in domains like iconography and sketching. However, existing Text-to-SVG methods often face challenges in editability, visual quality, and diversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for text-guided SVG synthesis that significantly enhances editability, quality, and diversity. To enhance the editability of output SVGs, we introduce a Hierarchical Image VEctorization (HIVE) framework that operates at the semantic object level and supervises the optimization of components within the vector object. This approach facilitates the decoupling of vector graphics into distinct objects and component levels. Our proposed HIVE algorithm, informed by image segmentation priors, not only ensures a more precise representation of vector graphics but also enables fine-grained editing capabilities within vector objects. To improve the diversity of output SVGs, we present a Vectorized Particle-based Score Distillation (VPSD) approach. VPSD addresses over-saturation issues in existing methods and enhances sample diversity. A pre-trained reward model is incorporated to re-weight vector particles, improving aesthetic appeal and enabling faster convergence. Additionally, we design a novel adaptive vector primitives control strategy, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of the number of primitives, thereby enhancing the presentation of graphic details. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over baseline methods in terms of editability, visual quality, and diversity. We also show that our new method supports up to six distinct vector styles, capable of generating high-quality vector assets suitable for stylized vector design and poster design},

However, depending on the datasets, class labels may not align with the actual data clusters, and such misalignment hampers accurate validation. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate and compare datasets regarding their cluster-label matching (CLM), i.e., how well their class labels match actual clusters. Internal validation measures (IVMs), like Silhouette, can compare CLM over different labeling of the same dataset, but are not designed to do so across different datasets. We thus introduce Adjusted IVMs as fast and reliable methods to evaluate and compare CLM across datasets. We establish four axioms that require validation measures to be independent of data properties not related to cluster structure (e.g., dimensionality, dataset size). Then, we develop standardized protocols to convert any IVM to satisfy these axioms, and use these protocols to adjust six widely used IVMs. Quantitative experiments (1) verify the necessity and effectiveness of our protocols and (2) show that adjusted IVMs outperform the competitors, including standard IVMs, in accurately evaluating CLM both within and across datasets. We also show that the datasets can be filtered or improved using our method to form more reliable benchmarks for clustering validation.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen a tremendous growth in both the capability and popularity of automatic machine analysis of media, especially images and video. As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimised for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, significant developments have been made in image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we greatly extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilise this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learned image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks – classification, instance and semantic segmentation, and object detection.},

  abstract     = {Visible-thermal small object detection (RGBT SOD) is a significant yet challenging task with a wide range of applications, including video surveillance, traffic monitoring, search and rescue. However, existing studies mainly focus on either visible or thermal modality, while RGBT SOD is rarely explored. Although some RGBT datasets have been developed, the insufficient quantity, limited diversity, unitary application, misaligned images and large target size cannot provide an impartial benchmark to evaluate RGBT SOD algorithms. In this paper, we build the first large-scale benchmark with high diversity for RGBT SOD (namely RGBT-Tiny), including 115 paired sequences, 93 K frames and 1.2 M manual annotations. RGBT-Tiny contains abundant objects (7 categories) and high-diversity scenes (8 types that cover different illumination and density variations). Note that, over 81% of objects are smaller than 16×16, and we provide paired bounding box annotations with tracking ID to offer an extremely challenging benchmark with wide-range applications, such as RGBT image fusion, object detection and tracking. In addition, we propose a scale adaptive fitness (SAFit) measure that exhibits high robustness on both small and large objects. The proposed SAFit can provide reasonable performance evaluation and promote detection performance. Based on the proposed RGBT-Tiny dataset, extensive evaluations have been conducted with IoU and SAFit metrics, including 32 recent state-of-the-art algorithms that cover four different types (i.e., visible generic detection, visible SOD, thermal SOD and RGBT object detection).

Firstly, the operations of convolutions, ReLUs and Max pooling in a CNN are represented as the multiplication of multiple matrices for a fixed sample in order to obtain an algebraic expression of CNNs, this expression clearly suggests that CNNs are PWL functions. Although such representation has high time complexity, it provides a more convenient and intuitive way to study the mathematical properties of CNNs. Secondly, we develop a tight bound of the number of linear regions and the upper bounds of generalization error for CNNs, both taking into account factors such as the number of layers, dimension of pooling, and the width in the network.

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models. In addition to providing a thorough review of the current state of GFMs, this article also outlooks potential avenues for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.},

  abstract     = {Multi-modal learning aims to enhance performance by unifying models from various modalities but often faces the “modality imbalance” problem in real data, leading to a bias towards dominant modalities and neglecting others, thereby limiting its overall effectiveness. To address this challenge, the core idea is to balance the optimization of each modality to achieve a joint optimum. Existing approaches often employ a modal-level control mechanism for adjusting the update of each modal parameter. However, such a global-wise updating mechanism ignores the different importance of each parameter. Inspired by subnetwork optimization, we explore a uniform sampling-based optimization strategy and find it more effective than global-wise updating. According to the findings, we further propose a novel importance sampling-based, element-wise joint optimization method, called Adaptively Mask Subnetworks Considering Modal Significance (AMSS). Specifically, we incorporate mutual information rates to determine the modal significance and employ non-uniform adaptive sampling to select foreground subnetworks from each modality for parameter updates, thereby rebalancing multi-modal learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the reliability of the AMSS strategy through convergence analysis. Building upon theoretical insights, we further enhance the multi-modal mask subnetwork strategy using unbiased estimation, referred to as AMSS+. Extensive experiments reveal the superiority of our approach over comparison methods.},

The core challenge lies in minimizing the commonalities among different sources. Existing deep learning approaches either neglect the significance of feature interactions or rely on heuristically designed architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Exclusion unfolding Network (DExNet), a lightweight, interpretable, and effective network architecture for SIRR. DExNet is principally constructed by unfolding and parameterizing a simple iterative Sparse and Auxiliary Feature Update (i-SAFU) algorithm, which is specifically designed to solve a new model-based SIRR optimization formulation incorporating a general exclusion prior. This general exclusion prior enables the unfolded SAFU module to inherently identify and penalize commonalities between the transmission and reflection features, ensuring more accurate separation. The principled design of DExNet not only enhances its interpretability but also significantly improves its performance. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DExNet achieves state-of-the-art visual and quantitative results while utilizing only approximately 8% of the parameters required by leading methods.},

We redefine feature drift as the instability of target features within boundary constraints while solving partial differential equations (PDEs). From this insight, we propose the Spatial Residual (SR) block, which uses SkipCut to establish effective constraints across the network width for solving PDEs and optimizes the solution space. It is implemented as a general-purpose backbone with 5 Spatial Residuals (BSR5) for complex feature scenarios. Specifically, BSR5 extracts discrete channel slices through SkipCut, where each sliced feature is parsed within the appropriate data capacity. In gradient backpropagation, SkipCut functions as a ShortCut, optimizing information flow and gradient allocation to enhance performance and accelerate training. Experiments on the RUOD dataset show that BSR5-integrated DETRs and YOLOs achieve state-of-the-art results for conventional and end-to-end detectors. Specifically, our BSR5-DETR improves 1.3% and 2.7% AP than RT-DETR with ResNet-101, while reducing parameters by 41.6% and 6.6%, respectively. Further validation highlights BSR5&#39;s strong convergence and robustness, especially in training from scratch scenarios, making it well suited for data-scarce, resource-constrained, and real-time tasks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a scene-level inverse rendering framework that uses multi-view images to decompose the scene into geometry, SVBRDF, and 3D spatially-varying lighting. While multi-view images have been widely used for object-level inverse rendering, scene-level inverse rendering has primarily been studied using single-view images due to the lack of a dataset containing high dynamic range multi-view images with ground-truth geometry, material, and spatially-varying lighting. To improve the quality of scene-level inverse rendering, a novel framework called Multi-view Attention Inverse Rendering (MAIR) was recently introduced. MAIR performs scene-level multi-view inverse rendering by expanding the OpenRooms dataset, designing efficient pipelines to handle multi-view images, and splitting spatially-varying lighting. Although MAIR showed impressive results, its lighting representation is fixed to spherical Gaussians, which limits its ability to render images realistically. Consequently, MAIR cannot be directly used in applications such as material editing. Moreover, its multi-view aggregation networks have difficulties extracting rich features because they only focus on the mean and variance between multi-view features. In this paper, we propose its extended version, called MAIR++. MAIR++ addresses the aforementioned limitations by introducing an implicit lighting representation that accurately captures the lighting conditions of an image while facilitating realistic rendering. Furthermore, we design a directional attention-based multi-view aggregation network to infer more intricate relationships between views. Experimental results show that MAIR++ not only outperforms MAIR and single-view-based methods but also demonstrates robust performance on unseen real-world scenes.},

Mainstream zeroth-order optimization algorithms, however, concentrate on exploiting zeroth-order-estimated first-order gradient information of the objective landscape. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-algorithm called Hessian-Aware Zeroth-Order (ZOHA) optimization algorithm, which utilizes several canonical variants of zeroth-order-estimated second-order Hessian information of the objective: power-method-based, and Gaussian-smoothing-based. We conclude theoretically that ZOHA enjoys an improved convergence rate compared with existing work without incorporating in zeroth-order optimization second-order Hessian information. Empirical studies on logistic regression as well as the black-box adversarial attack are provided to validate the effectiveness and improved success rates with reduced query complexity of the zeroth-order oracle.},

These methods necessitate careful spatiotemporal discretization to achieve reasonable accuracy, leading to significant computational challenges and inaccurate simulations, particularly in cases with substantial spatiotemporal variations. To address these limitations, we propose the Monte Carlo Neural PDE Solver (MCNP Solver) for training unsupervised neural solvers via the PDEs&#39; probabilistic representation, which regards macroscopic phenomena as ensembles of random particles. Compared to other unsupervised methods, MCNP Solver naturally inherits the advantages of the Monte Carlo method, which is robust against spatiotemporal variations and can tolerate coarse step size. In simulating the trajectories of particles, we employ Heun&#39;s method for the convection process and calculate the expectation via the probability density function of neighbouring grid points during the diffusion process. These techniques enhance accuracy and circumvent the computational issues associated with Monte Carlo sampling. Our numerical experiments on convection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to other unsupervised baselines.},

In this paper, we propose a batch transformer module, BatchFormerV1, to equip deep neural networks themselves with the abilities to explore sample relationships in a learnable way. Basically, the proposed method enables data collaboration, e.g., head-class samples will also contribute to the learning of tail classes. Considering that exploring instance-level relationships has very limited impacts on dense prediction, we generalize and refer to the proposed module as BatchFormerV2, which further enables exploring sample relationships for pixel-/patch-level dense representations. In addition, to address the train-test inconsistency where a mini-batch of data samples are neither necessary nor desirable during inference, we also devise a two-stream training pipeline, i.e., a shared model is first jointly optimized with and without BatchFormerV2 which is then removed during testing. The proposed module is plug-and-play without requiring any extra inference cost. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed method on over ten popular datasets, including 1) different data scarcity settings such as long-tailed recognition, zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and contrastive learning; and 2) different visual recognition tasks ranging from image classification to object detection and panoptic segmentation.

Moreover, since in real-world scenarios statistical information about the original image cannot be directly obtained, we suggest a multi-stage rate-adaptive sampling strategy. This strategy sequentially adjusts the sampling ratio allocation based on the information gathered from previous samplings. We formulate the multi-stage rate-adaptive sampling as a convex optimization problem and address it using a combination of Newton&#39;s method and binary search techniques.

This is because these methods mainly focus on recovering the depth regarding the camera center, where the depth difference between the car and the ground quickly shrinks while the distance increases. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, dubbed BEVHeight++, to address this issue. In essence, we regress the height to the ground to achieve a distance-agnostic formulation to ease the optimization process of camera-only perception methods. By incorporating both height and depth encoding techniques, we achieve a more accurate and robust projection from 2D to BEV spaces. On popular 3D detection benchmarks of roadside cameras, our method surpasses all previous vision-centric methods by a significant margin. In terms of the ego-vehicle scenario, BEVHeight++ surpasses depth-only methods with increases of +2.8% NDS and +1.7% mAP on the nuScenes test set, and even higher gains of +9.3% NDS and +8.8% mAP on the nuScenes-C benchmark with object-level distortion. Consistent and substantial performance improvements are achieved across the KITTI, KITTI-360, and Waymo datasets as well. The code is available at https://github.com/yanglei18/BEVHeight_Plus.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) generation opens up new possibilities for lifelike experiences in various applications, where users can explore dynamic objects or characters from any viewpoint. Meanwhile, video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to produce realistic and imaginative frames. These models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, indicating the potential to act as world simulators. In this work, we present Video4DGen, a novel framework that excels in generating 4D representations from single or multiple generated videos as well as generating 4D-guided videos. This framework is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. The 4D outputs generated by Video4DGen are represented using our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS), which optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. We design warped-state geometric regularization and refinements on Gaussian surfels, to preserve the structural integrity and fine-grained appearance details, respectively. Additionally, in order to perform 4D generation from multiple videos and effectively capture representation across spatial, temporal, and pose dimensions, we design multi-video alignment, root pose optimization, and pose-guided frame sampling strategies. The leveraging of continuous warping fields also enables a precise depiction of pose, motion, and deformation over per-video frames. Further, to improve the overall fidelity from the observation of all camera poses, Video4DGen performs novel-view video generation guided by the 4D content, with the proposed confidence-filtered DGS to enhance the quality of generated sequences. In summary, Video4DGen yields dynamic 4D generation with the ability to handle different subject movements, while preserving details in both geometry and appearance. The framework also generates 4D-guided videos with high spatial and temporal coherence. With the ability of 4D and video generation, Video4DGen offers a powerful tool for applications in virtual reality, animation, and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been gaining attention as a significant form of 3D content representation. With the proliferation of NeRF-based creations, the need for copyright protection has emerged as a critical issue. Although some approaches have been proposed to embed digital watermarks into NeRF, they often neglect essential model-level considerations and incur substantial time overheads, resulting in reduced imperceptibility and robustness, along with user inconvenience. In this paper, we extend the previous criteria for image watermarking to the model level and propose NeRF Signature, a novel watermarking method for NeRF. We employ a Codebook-aided Signature Embedding (CSE) that does not alter the model structure, thereby maintaining imperceptibility and enhancing robustness at the model level. Furthermore, after optimization, any desired signatures can be embedded through the CSE, and no fine-tuning is required when NeRF owners want to use new binary signatures. Then, we introduce a joint pose-patch encryption watermarking strategy to hide signatures into patches rendered from a specific viewpoint for higher robustness. In addition, we explore a Complexity-Aware Key Selection (CAKS) scheme to embed signatures in high visual complexity patches to enhance imperceptibility. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Supervised Cross-Modal Retrieval (SCMR) achieves significant performance with the supervision provided by substantial label annotations of multi-modal data. However, the requirement for large annotated multi-modal datasets restricts the use of supervised cross-modal retrieval in many practical scenarios. Active Learning (AL) has been proposed to reduce labeling costs while improving performance in various label-dependent tasks, in which the most informative unlabeled samples are selected for labeling and training. Directly exploiting the existing AL methods for supervised cross-modal retrieval may not be a good idea since they only focus on the uncertainty within each modality, ignoring the inter-modality relationship within the text-image pairs. Furthermore, existing methods focus exclusively on the informativeness of data during sample selection, leading to a biased, homogenized set where selected samples often contain nearly identical semantics and are densely distributed in a region of the feature space. Persistent training with such biased data selections can disturb multi-modal representation learning and substantially degrade the retrieval performance of SCMR. In this work, we propose an Active Supervised Cross-Modal Retrieval (ASCMR) framework, which effectively identifies informative multi-modal samples and generates unbiased sample selections. In particular, we propose a probabilistic multi-modal informativeness estimation that captures both the intra-modality and inter-modality uncertainty of multi-modal pairs within a unified representation. To ensure unbiased sample selection, we introduce a density-aware budget allocation strategy that constrains the active learning objective of maximizing the informativeness of selection with a novel semantic density regularization term. The proposed methods are evaluated on three widely used benchmark datasets, MS-COCO, NUS-WIDE, and MIRFlickr, demonstrating our effectiveness in significantly reducing the annotation cost while outperforming other baselines of active learning strategies. We could achieve over 95% of the fully supervised model&#39;s performance by only utilizing 6%, 3%, and 4% active selected samples for MS-COCO, NUS-WIDE, and MIRFlickr, respectively.

  abstract     = {Open set recognition (OSR) requires models to classify known samples while detecting unknown samples for real-world applications. Existing studies show impressive progress using unknown samples from auxiliary datasets to regularize OSR models, but they have proved to be sensitive to selecting such known outliers. In this paper, we discuss the aforementioned problem from a new perspective: Can we regularize OSR models without elaborately selecting auxiliary known outliers? We first empirically and theoretically explore the role of foregrounds and backgrounds in open set recognition and disclose that: 1) backgrounds that correlate with foregrounds would mislead the model and cause failures when encounters ‘partially’ known images; 2) Backgrounds unrelated to foregrounds can serve as auxiliary known outliers and provide regularization via global average pooling. Based on the above insights, we propose a new method, Background Mix (BackMix), that mixes the foreground of an image with different backgrounds to remove the underlying fore-background priors. Specifically, BackMix first estimates the foreground with class activation maps (CAMs), then randomly replaces image patches with backgrounds from other images to obtain mixed images for training. With backgrounds de-correlated from foregrounds, the open set recognition performance is significantly improved. The proposed method is quite simple to implement, requires no extra operation for inferences, and can be seamlessly integrated into almost all of the existing frameworks.},

To address these issues, we propose Deformable Graph Transformer (DGT) that performs sparse attention via dynamically selected relevant nodes for efficiently handling large-scale graphs with a linear complexity in the number of nodes. Specifically, our framework first constructs multiple node sequences with various criteria to consider both structural and semantic proximity. Then, combining with our learnable Katz Positional Encodings, the sparse attention is applied to the node sequences for learning node representations with a significantly reduced computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DGT achieves superior performance on 7 graph benchmark datasets with 2.5 ∼ 449 times less computational cost compared to transformer-based graph models with full attention},

We propose a general and lowcost framework for FIL named Re-Fed+, which is designed to help clients cache important samples for replay. Specifically, when a new task arrives, each client initially caches selected previous samples based on their global and local significance. The client then trains the local model using both the cached samples and the new task samples.

Different from conventional multi-modal IL work that considers reproducing the demonstrated different behaviors, we aim to imitate a policy that rapidly adapts to sudden dynamic changes, even when encountering dynamics unseen during training. We propose a method called Generalizable Multi-modal Adversarial Imitation Learning (GMAIL) for non-stationary dynamics, which adversarially trains a discriminator and a generator. Due to dynamic mismatch between the experts and the imitator, the optimal next state for the imitator may require several steps for the experts to reach, inspiring us to propose to take the state-next-state pairs within multiple steps in the demonstrated trajectories to facilitate imitation under dynamic mismatch. For quick identification of the changed dynamic, GMAIL learns a dynamics-sensitive generator by introducing a history-based context encoder. On a wide range of navigation, locomotion and autonomous driving tasks, empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of GMAIL.},

Naturally, the lane is a traffic sign with high-level semantics, whereas it owns the specific local pattern which needs detailed low-level features to localize accurately. Using different feature levels is of great importance for accurate lane detection, but it is still under-explored. On the other hand, current lane detection methods still struggle to detect complex dense lanes, such as Y-shape or fork-shape. In this work, we present Cross Layer Refinement Network aiming at fully utilizing both high-level and low-level features in lane detection. In particular, it first detects lanes with high-level semantic features and then performs refinement based on low-level features. In this way, we can exploit more contextual information to detect lanes while leveraging local-detailed features to improve localization accuracy. We present Fast-ROIGather to gather global context, which further enhances the representation of lane features. To detect dense lanes accurately, we propose Correlation Discrimination Module (CDM) to discriminate the correlation of dense lanes, enabling nearly cost-free high-quality dense lane prediction. In addition to our novel network design, we introduce LineIoU loss which regresses lanes as a whole unit to improve localization accuracy.

  abstract     = {Nine-degrees-of-freedom (9-DoF) object pose and size estimation is crucial for enabling augmented reality and robotic manipulation. Category-level methods have received extensive research attention due to their potential for generalization to intra-class unknown objects. However, these methods require manual collection and labeling of large-scale real-world training data. To address this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based paradigm for domain-generalized category-level 9-DoF object pose estimation. Our motivation is to leverage the latent generalization ability of the diffusion model to address the domain generalization challenge in object pose estimation. This entails training the model exclusively on rendered synthetic data to achieve generalization to real-world scenes. We propose an effective diffusion model to redefine 9-DoF object pose estimation from a generative perspective. Our model does not require any 3D shape priors during training or inference. By employing the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model, we demonstrate that the reverse diffusion process can be executed in as few as 3 steps, achieving near real-time performance. Finally, we design a robotic grasping system comprising both hardware and software components. Through comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and the real-world robotic system, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization performance.

  abstract     = {This paper explores stochastic multi-level compositional optimization, where the objective function is a composition of multiple smooth functions. Traditional methods for solving this problem suffer from either sub-optimal sample complexities or require huge batch sizes. To address these limitations, we introduce the Stochastic Multi-level Variance Reduction (SMVR) method. In the expectation case, our SMVR method attains the optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal {O}(1/\epsilon ^{3})$ to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point for non-convex objectives. When the function satisfies convexity or the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, we propose a stage-wise SMVR variant. This variant improves the sample complexity to $\mathcal {O}(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ for convex functions and $\mathcal {O}(1/(\mu \epsilon ))$ for functions meeting the $\mu$-PL condition or $\mu$-strong convexity. These complexities match the lower bounds not only in terms of $\epsilon$ but also in terms of $\mu$ (for PL or strongly convex functions), without relying on large batch sizes in each iteration. Furthermore, in the finite-sum case, we develop the SMVR-FS algorithm, which can achieve a complexity of $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon ^{2})$ for non-convex objectives, $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon \log (1/\epsilon ))$ for convex functions and $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{n}/\mu \log (1/\epsilon ))$ for objectives satisfying the $\mu$-PL condition, where $n$ denotes the number of functions in each level. To make use of adaptive learning rates, we propose the Adaptive SMVR method, which maintains the same complexities while demonstrating faster convergence in practice.},

Despite the remarkable performance improvements compared with traditional processing pipelines, existing learning approaches still exhibit limitations in terms of flexibility, generalizability, robustness, and/or representation capability. To comprehensively address the above issues, in this paper, we investigate an explicit point-based human reconstruction framework named HaP, which utilizes point clouds as the intermediate representation of the target geometric structure. Technically, our approach features fully explicit point cloud estimation (exploiting depth and SMPL), manipulation (SMPL rectification), generation (built upon diffusion), and refinement (displacement learning and depth replacement) in the 3D geometric space, instead of an implicit learning process that can be ambiguous and less controllable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves quantitative performance improvements of 20% to 40% over current state-of-the-art methods, and better qualitative results. Our promising results may indicate a paradigm rollback to the fully-explicit and geometry-centric algorithm design. In addition, we newly contribute a real-scanned 3D human dataset featuring more intricate geometric details. We will make our code and data publicly available at https://github.com/yztang4/HaP.},

  abstract     = {Recent neural networks based surface reconstruction can be roughly divided into two categories, one warping templates explicitly and the other representing 3D surfaces implicitly. To enjoy the advantages of both, we propose a novel 3D representation, Neural Vector Fields (NVF), which adopts the explicit learning process to manipulate meshes and implicit unsigned distance function (UDF) representation to break the barriers in resolution and topology. This is achieved by directly predicting the displacements from surface queries and modeling shapes as Vector Fields, rather than relying on network differentiation to obtain direction fields as most existing UDF-based methods do. In this way, our approach is capable of encoding both the distance and the direction fields so that the calculation of direction fields is differentiation-free, circumventing the non-trivial surface extraction step. Furthermore, building upon NVFs, we propose to incorporate two types of shape codebooks, ı.e., NVFs (Lite or Ultra), to promote cross-category reconstruction through encoding cross-object priors. Moreover, we propose a new regularization based on analyzing the zero-curl property of NVFs, and implement this through the fully differentiable framework of our NVF (ultra). We evaluate both NVFs on four surface reconstruction scenarios, including watertight vs non-watertight shapes, category-agnostic reconstruction vs category-unseen reconstruction, category-specific, and cross-domain reconstruction.},

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) attempts to solve such problem. Recent works show that self-training is a powerful approach to UDA. However, existing methods have difficulty in balancing the scalability and performance. In this paper, we propose a hard-aware instance adaptive self-training framework for UDA on the task of semantic segmentation. To effectively improve the quality and diversity of pseudo-labels, we develop a novel pseudo-label generation strategy with an instance adaptive selector. We further enrich the hard class pseudo-labels with inter-image information through a skillfully designed hard-aware pseudo-label augmentation. Besides, we propose the region-adaptive regularization to smooth the pseudo-label region and sharpen the non-pseudo-label region. For the non-pseudo-label region, consistency constraint is also constructed to introduce stronger supervision signals during model optimization. Our method is so concise and efficient that it is easy to be generalized to other UDA methods.

There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, e.g., languages, and the other for continuous representations, e.g., location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 11 benchmarks.

Specifically, predictions for large-valued outcomes tend to be negatively biased (underestimating actual values), while those for small-valued outcomes are positively biased (overestimating actual values). We refer to this linear central tendency warped bias as the “systematic bias of machine learning regression”. In this paper, we first demonstrate that this systematic prediction bias persists across various machine learning regression models, and then delve into its theoretical underpinnings. To address this issue, we propose a general constrained optimization approach designed to correct this bias and develop computationally efficient implementation algorithms. Simulation results indicate that our correction method effectively eliminates the bias from the predicted outcomes. We apply the proposed approach to the prediction of brain age using neuroimaging data. In comparison to competing machine learning regression models, our method effectively addresses the longstanding issue of “systematic bias of machine learning regression” in neuroimaging-based brain age calculation, yielding unbiased predictions of brain age.},

  abstract     = {The goal of object navigation task is to reach the expected objects using visual information in unseen environments. Previous works typically implement deep models as agents that are trained to predict actions based on visual observations. Despite extensive training, agents often fail to make wise decisions when navigating in unseen environments toward invisible targets. In contrast, humans demonstrate a remarkable talent to navigate toward targets even in unseen environments. This superior capability is attributed to the cognitive map in the hippocampus, which enables humans to recall past experiences in similar situations and anticipate future occurrences during navigation. It is also dynamically updated with new observations from unseen environments. The cognitive map equips humans with a wealth of prior knowledge, significantly enhancing their navigation capabilities. Inspired by human navigation mechanisms, we propose the Hierarchical Object-to-Zone (HOZ++) graph, which encapsulates the regularities among objects, zones, and scenes. The HOZ++ graph helps the agent to identify the current zone and the target zone, and computes an optimal path between them, then selects the next zone along the path as the guidance for the agent. Moreover, the HOZ++ graph continuously updates based on real-time observations in new environments, thereby enhancing its adaptability to new environments. Our HOZ++ graph is versatile and can be integrated into existing methods, including end-to-end RL and modular methods. Our method is evaluated across four simulators, including AI2-THOR, RoboTHOR, Gibson, and Matterport 3D. Additionally, we build a realistic environment to evaluate our method in the real world.

Unlike previous methods that model video segmentation in an end-to-end manner, our approach decouples video segmentation into three cascaded sub-tasks: segmentation, tracking, and refinement. This decoupling design allows for simpler and more effective modeling of the spatio-temporal representations of objects, especially in complex scenes and long videos. Accordingly, we introduce two novel components: the referring tracker and the temporal refiner. These components track objects frame by frame and model spatio-temporal representations based on pre-aligned features. To improve the tracking capability of DVIS, we propose a denoising training strategy and introduce contrastive learning, resulting in a more robust framework named DVIS++. The proposed decoupled framework efficiently handles universal and open-vocabulary object representations, allowing DVIS++ to conduct universal and open-vocabulary video segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on six mainstream benchmarks, including the VIS, VSS, and VPS datasets. Using a unified architecture, DVIS++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art specialized methods on these benchmarks in closed- and open-vocabulary settings.

In this work, we highlight the potential of effectively training a VOS model using remarkably sparse video annotations—specifically, as few as one or two labeled frames per training video, yet maintaining near equivalent performance levels. We introduce this innovative training methodology as low-shot video object segmentation, abbreviated as low-shot VOS. Central to this method is the generation of reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled frames during the training phase, which are then used in tandem with labeled frames to optimize the model. Notably, our strategy is extremely simple and can be incorporated into the vast majority of current VOS models. For the first time, we propose a universal method for training VOS models on one-shot and two-shot VOS datasets. In the two-shot configuration, utilizing just 7.3% and 2.9% of labeled data from the YouTube-VOS and DAVIS benchmarks respectively, our model delivers results on par with those trained on completely labeled datasets. It is also worth noting that in the one-shot setting, a minor performance decrement is observed in comparison to models trained on fully annotated datasets.

Besides, the handling of identified unknown samples is typically restricted to the assignment of a generic “unknown” class label but fails to explore underlying category information. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a new paradigm for OSR, entitled Reason and Discovery (RAD), which comprises two main modules: the Reason Module and the Discovery Module. Specifically, in the Reason Module, the distinction between known and unknown is performed from the perspective of reasoning the matching relations between topological information and appearance characteristics of discriminative regions. Then, the mixture and recombination of relation representations across classes are employed to provide diverse estimations of unknown distribution, thereby recalibrating OSR decision boundaries. Moreover, in the Discovery Module, the identified unknown samples are semantically grouped through a biased deep clustering process for discovering novel category information. Experimental results on various datasets indicate that the proposed method can achieve outstanding OSR performance and good novel category discovery efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud semantic segmentation can enhance the understanding of the production environment and is a crucial component of vision tasks. The efficacy and generalization prowess of deep learning-based segmentation models are inherently contingent upon the quality and nature of the data employed in their training. However, it is often challenging to obtain data with inter-class balance, and training an intelligent segmentation network with the imbalanced data may cause cognitive bias. In this paper, a network framework InvSpaceNet is proposed, which generates an inverse feature space to alleviate the cognitive bias caused by imbalanced data. Specifically, we design a dual-branch training architecture that combines the superior feature representations derived from instance-balanced sampling data with the cognitive corrections introduced by the proposed inverse sampling data. In the inverse feature space of the point cloud generated by the auxiliary branch, the central points aggregated by class are constrained by the contrastive loss. To refine the class cognition in the inverse feature space, features are used to generate point cloud class prototypes through momentum update. These class prototypes from the inverse space are utilized to generate feature maps and structure maps that are aligned with the positive feature space of the main branch segmentation network. The training of the main branch is dynamically guided through gradients back propagated from different losses. Extensive experiments conducted on four large benchmarks (i.e., S3DIS, ScanNet v2, Toronto-3D, and SemanticKITTI) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate point cloud imbalance issues and improve segmentation performance.},

  abstract     = {Due to the wide existence of unlabeled graph-structured data (e.g. molecular structures), the graph-level clustering has recently attracted increasing attention, whose goal is to divide the input graphs into several disjoint groups. However, the existing methods habitually focus on learning the graphs embeddings with different graph reguralizations, and seldom refer to the obvious differences in data distributions of distinct graph-level datasets. How to characteristically consider multiple graph-level datasets in a general well-designed model without prior knowledge is still challenging. In view of this, we propose a novel Graph Prompt Clustering (GPC) method. Within this model, there are two main modules, i.e., graph model pretraining as well as prompt and finetuning. In the graph model pretraining module, the graph model is pretrained by a selected source graph-level dataset with mutual information maximization and self-supervised clustering regularization. In the prompt and finetuning module, the network parameters of the pretrained graph model are frozen, and a groups of learnable prompt vectors assigned to each graph-level representation are trained for adapting different target graph-level datasets with various data distributions. Experimental results across six benchmark datasets demonstrate the impressive generalization capability and effectiveness of GPC compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to different downstream tasks through tuning. This pre-training and then fine-tuning paradigm has become a standard practice in deep learning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners, considering one may not be able to access or fully fine-tune the pre-trained models. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Transfer Learning.},

  abstract     = {6D pose estimation of rigid objects is a long-standing and challenging task in computer vision. Recently, the emergence of deep learning reveals the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict reliable 6D poses. Given that direct pose regression networks currently exhibit suboptimal performance, most methods still resort to traditional techniques to varying degrees. For example, top-performing methods often adopt an indirect strategy by first establishing 2D-3D or 3D-3D correspondences followed by applying the RANSAC-based P $n$ P or Kabsch algorithms, and further employing ICP for refinement. Despite the performance enhancement, the integration of traditional techniques makes the networks time-consuming and not end-to-end trainable. Orthogonal to them, this paper introduces a fully learning-based object pose estimator. In this work, we first perform an in-depth investigation of both direct and indirect methods and propose a simple yet effective Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDRN) to learn the 6D pose from monocular images in an end-to-end manner. Afterwards, we introduce a geometry-guided pose refinement module, enhancing pose accuracy when extra depth data is available. Guided by the predicted coordinate map, we build an end-to-end differentiable architecture that establishes robust and accurate 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and rendered RGB-D images to refine the pose. Our enhanced pose estimation pipeline GDRNPP (GDRN Plus Plus) conquered the leaderboard of the BOP Challenge for two consecutive years, becoming the first to surpass all prior methods that relied on traditional techniques in both accuracy and speed.

  abstract     = {Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new avenues for research into embodied AI agents and robotics. Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation–a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation–remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2 Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2 Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2 Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.

  abstract     = {While existing causal discovery methods mostly focus on continuous time series, causal discovery for mixed time series encompassing both continuous variables (CVs) and discrete variables (DVs) is a fundamental yet underexplored problem. Together with nonlinearity and high dimensionality, mixed time series pose significant challenges for causal discovery. This study addresses the aforementioned challenges based on the following recognitions: (1) DVs may originate from latent continuous variables (LCVs) and undergo discretization processes due to measurement limitations, storage requirements, and other reasons. (2) LCVs contain fine-grained information and interact with CVs. By leveraging these interactions, the intrinsic continuity of DVs can be recovered. Thereupon, we propose a generic deep mixed time series temporal causal discovery framework. Our key idea is to adaptively recover LCVs from DVs with the guidance of CVs and perform causal discovery in a unified continuous-valued space. Technically, a new contextual adaptive Gaussian kernel embedding technique is developed for latent continuity recovery by adaptively aggregating temporal contextual information of DVs. Accordingly, two interdependent model training stages are devised for learning the latent continuity recovery with self-supervision and causal structure learning with sparsity-induced optimization. Experimentally, extensive empirical evaluations and in-depth investigations validate the superior performance of our framework. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/chunhuiz/MiTCD.},

  abstract     = {Attribute-missing graph learning, a common yet challenging problem, has recently attracted considerable attention. Existing efforts have at least one of the following limitations: 1) lack a noise filtering and information enhancing scheme, resulting in less comprehensive data completion; 2) isolate the node attribute and graph structure encoding processes, introducing more parameters and failing to take full advantage of the two types of information; and 3) impose overly strict distribution assumptions on the latent variables, leading to biased or less discriminative node representations. To tackle the issues, based on the idea of introducing intimate information interaction between the two information sources, we propose Weight-sharing Attribute-missing Graph autoEncoder (WAGE) to boost the expressive capacity of node representations for high-quality missing attribute reconstruction. Specifically, three strategies have been conducted. Firstly, we entangle the attribute embedding and structure embedding by introducing a weight-sharing architecture to share the parameters learned by both processes, which allows the network training to benefit from more abundant and diverse information. Secondly, we introduce a $K$-nearest neighbor-based dual non-local learning mechanism to improve the quality of data imputation by revealing unobserved high-confidence connections while filtering unreliable ones. Thirdly, we manually mask the connections on multiple adjacency matrices and force the structure-oriented embedding sub-network to recover the actual adjacency matrix, thus enforcing the resulting network to be able to selectively exploit more high-order discriminative features for data completion. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of WAGE against state-of-the-art competitors.},

DIST differentiates itself from conventional techniques by adeptly handling the often significant prediction discrepancies between the student and teacher models.

Moreover, DIST uniquely considers the semantic similarities between different instances and each class at the intra-class level. The method is further enhanced by two significant improvements: (1) A teacher acclimation strategy, which effectively reduces the discrepancy between teacher and student, thereby optimizing the distillation process. (2) An extension of the DIST loss from the logit level to the feature level, a modification that proves especially beneficial for dense prediction tasks. DIST stands out for its simplicity, practicality, and adaptability to various architectures, model sizes, and training strategies.

Specifically, we integrates a fine-grained statistical noise model and contrastive learning strategy, with a unique data augmentation to enhance learning ability. Then, we use this model to estimate noise parameters on evaluation dataset, which are subsequently used to craft camera-specific noise distribution and synthesize realistic noise. One distinguishing feature of our methodology is its adaptability: our pre-trained model can directly estimate unknown cameras, making it possible to unfamiliar sensor noise modeling using only testing images, without calibration frames or paired training data. Another highlight is our attempt in estimating parameters for fine-grained noise models, which extends the applicability to even more challenging low-light conditions.

The neighborhood search has emerged as an effective approach, yielding high-quality solutions across different VRPs.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Learning-aided Neighborhood Search algorithm (LaNS) that employs a cutting-edge multi-agent reinforcement learning-driven adaptive operator/neighborhood selection mechanism to achieve efficient routing for VRP. Within this framework, two agents serve as high-level instructors, collaboratively guiding the search direction by selecting perturbation/improvement operators from a pool of low-level heuristics. Furthermore, to equip the agents with comprehensive information for learning guidance knowledge, we have developed a new informative state representation. This representation transforms the spatial route structures into an image-like tensor, allowing us to extract spatial features using a convolutional neural network. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VRP benchmarks, including the capacitated VRP (CVRP), multi-depot VRP (MDVRP) and cumulative multi-depot VRP with energy constraints, demonstrate LaNS&#39;s superiority over the state-of-the-art neighborhood search methods as well as the existing learning-guided neighborhood search algorithms.},

In this work, we delve into extremely low-bit quantization and construct a unified theoretical analysis, which provides an in-depth understanding of the reason for the failure of low-bit quantization. According to the theoretical study, we argue that the existing methods fail in low-bit schemes due to significant perturbation on weights and lack of consideration of activation quantization. To this end, we propose Brecq and QDrop to respectively solve these two challenges, based on which a Q-Limit framework is constructed. Then the Q-Limit framework is further extended to support a mixed precision quantization scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that can push the limit of PTQ down to INT2. Extensive experiments on various handcrafted and searched neural architectures are conducted for both visual recognition/detection tasks and language processing tasks. Without bells and whistles, our PTQ framework can attain low-bit ResNet and MobileNetV2 comparable with quantization-aware training (QAT), establishing a new state-of-the-art for PTQ.

  abstract     = {Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), as a crucial research problem of Embodied AI, requires an embodied agent to navigate through complex 3D environments following natural language instructions. Recent research has highlighted the promising capacity of large language models (LLMs) in VLN by improving navigational reasoning accuracy and interpretability. However, their predominant use in an offline manner usually suffers from substantial domain gap between the VLN task and the LLM training corpus. This paper proposes a novel strategy called Navigational Chain-of-Thought (NavCoT), where we fulfill parameter-efficient in-domain training to enable self-guided navigational decision, leading to a significant mitigation of the domain gap in a cost-effective manner. Specifically, at each timestep, the LLM is prompted to forecast the navigational chain-of-thought by: 1) acting as a world model to imagine the next observation according to the instruction, 2) selecting the candidate observation that best aligns with the imagination, and 3) determining the action based on the reasoning from the prior steps. In this way, the action prediction can be effectively simplified benefiting from the disentangled reasoning. Through constructing formalized labels for training, the LLM can learn to generate desired and reasonable chain-of-thought outputs for improving the action decision. Experimental results across various training settings and popular VLN benchmarks (e.g., Room-to-Room (R2R), Room-across-Room (RxR), Room-for-Room (R4R)) show the significant superiority of NavCoT over the direct action prediction variants. Through simple parameter-efficient finetuning, our NavCoT outperforms a recent GPT4-based approach with $\sim$7% relative improvement on the R2R dataset. We believe that NavCoT will help unlock more task-adaptive and scalable LLM-based embodied agents, which are helpful for developing real-world robotics applications.

This deficiency greatly limits their applications when high-fidelity hand modeling is required, e.g., personalized hand modeling. To address this problem, we design a frequency split network to generate 3D hand meshes using different frequency bands in a coarse-to-fine manner. To capture high-frequency personalized details, we transform the 3D mesh into the frequency domain, and proposed a novel frequency decomposition loss to supervise each frequency component. By leveraging such a coarse-to-fine scheme, hand details that correspond to the higher frequency domain can be preserved. In addition, the proposed network is scalable, and can stop the inference at any resolution level to accommodate different hardware with varying computational powers. To feed the scalable frequency network with frequency split image features, we proposed an image-graph ring feature mapping strategy. To train our network with per-vertex supervision, we use a bidirectional registration strategy to generate a topology-fixed ground-truth. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method in terms of recovering personalized shape details, we introduce a new evaluation metric named Mean-frequency Signal-to-Noise Ratio (MSNR) to measure the mean signal-to-noise ratio of mesh signal on each frequency component. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates fine-grained details for high-fidelity 3D hand reconstruction, and our evaluation metric is more effective than traditional metrics for measuring mesh details.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating the performance of low-light image enhancement (LLE) is highly subjective, thus making integrating human preferences into LLE a necessity. Existing methods fail to consider this and present a series of potentially valid heuristic criteria for training LLE models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, i.e., aesthetics-guided low-light image enhancement (ALL-E), which introduces aesthetic preferences to LLE and motivates training in a reinforcement learning framework with an aesthetic reward. Each pixel, functioning as an agent, refines itself by recursive actions. We further present ALL-E+, an extended version of ALL-E, which casts a two-stage aesthetics-guided enhancement and denoising. ALL-E+ achieves low-light enhancement and denoising compensation sequentially in a unified framework, resulting in significant improvements in both subjective visual experience and objective evaluation. Extensive experiments show that integrating aesthetic preferences can further improve the visual experience of enhanced images. Our results on various benchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.},

Our method, HandRT, jointly optimizes hand pose, shape, appearance, and lighting parameters using a physically-based shading model in a differentiable rendering framework incorporating Monte Carlo path tracing. HandRT extends our previous work, Intrinsic Hand Avatar, by relaxing the assumption of a known coarse hand pose and utilizing depth data in the optimization. Specifically, we introduce an articulated registration energy based on iterative closest point over the depth point cloud that enables reconstruction from unknown hand poses via tracking across frames. Thus, we can reconstruct the avatar from arbitrary poses with high accuracy without relying on an off-the-shelf 2D joint detector at each frame. Further, HandRT is capable of precisely tracking the reconstructed avatar from either RGB or RGB-D input. Our evaluation demonstrates that our method outperforms existing hand avatar reconstruction methods on all commonly used metrics while producing significantly accurate mesh compared to state-of-the-art hand mesh recovery methods by a large margin on public and our captured datasets.

On the other hand, compact multi-modal trackers are more efficient but often suffer from reduced performance due to limited feature representation. To mitigate the performance gap between compact and more complex trackers, we introduce a cross-modality distillation framework. This framework includes a complementarity-aware mask autoencoder designed to enhance cross-modal interactions by selectively masking patches within a modality, thereby forcing the model to learn more robust multi-modal representations. Additionally, we present a specific-common feature distillation module that transfers both modality-specific and shared information from a more powerful model&#39;s backbone to the compact model. Moreover, we develop a multi-path selection distillation module to guide a simple fusion module in learning more accurate multi-modal information from a sophisticated fusion mechanism using multiple paths. Extensive experiments on six multi-modal tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed tracker, despite being lightweight, outperforms most state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness. Notably, our tiny variant achieves a PR score of 67.5% on LasHeR, a PR score of 58.5% on DepthTrack, and a PR score of 73.1% on VisEvent with only 6.5 M parameters, while operating at 126 FPS on an NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing image deraining methods and provide a unified evaluation setting to evaluate their performance.

  abstract     = {The key performance bottleneck of large-scale graph processing on memory-limited GPUs is the host-GPU graph data transfer. Existing GPU-accelerated graph processing frameworks address this issue by managing the active subgraph transfer at runtime. Some frameworks adopt explicit transfer management approaches based on explicit memory copy with filter or compaction. In contrast, others adopt implicit transfer management approaches based on on-demand accesses with the zero-copy mechanism or unified virtual memory. Having made intensive analysis, we find that as the active vertices evolve, the performance of the two approaches varies in different workloads. Due to heavy redundant data transfers, high CPU compaction overhead, or low bandwidth utilization, adopting a single approach often results in suboptimal performance. Moreover, these methods lack effective cache management methods to address the irregular and sparse memory access pattern of graph processing. In this work, we propose a hybrid transfer management approach that takes the merits of both two transfer approaches at runtime. Moreover, we present an efficient vertex-centric graph caching framework that minimizes CPU-GPU communication by caching frequently accessed graph data at runtime. Based on these techniques, we present HytGraph, a GPU-accelerated graph processing framework, which is empowered by a set of effective task-scheduling optimizations to improve performance. Experiments on real-world and synthetic graphs show that HytGraph achieves average speedups of 2.5×, 5.0×, and 2.0× compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated graph processing systems, Grus, Subway, and EMOGI, respectively.},

It is urgent to improve GPU utilization, but existing works lack research on fine-grained allocation for GPU resources, as it typically allocates GPUs as indivisible units. Serverless computing reveals an opportunity to optimize utilization with fine-grained resource allocation methods, but it requires addressing three main challenges: co-location performance degradation, service level objectives guarantee of serverless functions, and cold start overhead. We propose SMore, a framework based on serverless computing to optimize GPU resource utilization of DL clusters. SMore dynamically predicts the possible co-location performance degradation and leverages a degradation-aware scheduling algorithm to ensure that the co-location decisions do not impact workload performance. It also dynamically preloads or offloads DL models by predicting the request numbers of the subsequent period to address the cold start issue. Through actual trace testing on the prototype of SMore, we find that the average GPU utilization can be increased by 34% with degradation being controlled effectively.},

We propose a novel communication-efficient personalized FL framework for edge intelligence that estimates the low-rank component of the training model gradient and stores the residual component at each client. The low-rank components obtained across communication rounds have high similarity, and sharing these components with the server can significantly reduce communication overhead. Specifically, we highlight the importance of previously neglected residual components in tackling statistical heterogeneity, and retaining them locally for training model updates can effectively improve the personalization performance. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee of our framework.

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for addressing non-Euclidean problems. GNNs operate through two key execution phases: i) aggregation and ii) combination. In the aggregation phase, the feature data of neighboring graph nodes are gathered, which is expressed as sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) between an adjacency matrix and a feature embedding table. The combination phase takes the aggregated feature embedding as input to a neural network model with learnable weights. Typically, the adjacency matrix is extremely sparse due to inherent graph structures, making the aggregation phase a significant bottleneck in GNN computations. This paper introduces Graphite, a GNN acceleration framework to overcome the challenge of SpMM operations and enable graphics processing units (GPUs) to exploit massive thread-level parallelism more efficiently via existing dense acceleration units (i.e., tensor cores). To that end, Graphite employs three techniques for GNN acceleration. Firstly, hardware-aware sparse graph reshaping (HAS) rearranges graph structures to replace sparse operations with dense computations, enabling hardware acceleration through GPU tensor cores. Additionally, balanced thread block scheduling (BTS) distributes sparse thread blocks evenly across streaming multiprocessors in GPUs, and zero-aware warp skipping (ZAWS) eliminates ineffective threads that operate on meaningless zeros. Experimental results show that Graphite achieves an average compression rate of 84.1% for adjacency matrices using HAS. Combined with BTS and ZAWS, Graphite delivers an average 1.55x speedup over the conventional SpMM-based GNN computation method.},

  abstract     = {In modern parallel system architectures, prefetchers are essential to mitigating the performance challenges posed by long memory access latencies. These architectures rely heavily on efficient memory access patterns to maximize system throughput and resource utilization. Prefetch aggressiveness is a central parameter in managing these access patterns; although increased prefetch aggressiveness can enhance performance for certain applications, it often risks causing cache pollution and bandwidth contention, leading to significant performance degradation in other workloads. While many existing prefetchers rely on static or simple built-in aggressiveness controllers, a more flexible, adaptive approach based on system-level feedback is essential to achieving optimal performance across parallel computing environments. In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Prefetch Aggressiveness Control (APAC) framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically manage prefetch aggressiveness in parallel system architectures. The APAC controller operates as an RL agent, which optimizes prefetch aggressiveness by dynamically responding to system feedback on prefetch accuracy, timeliness, and cache pollution. The agent receives a reward signal that reflects the impact of each adjustment on both performance and memory bandwidth, learning to adapt its control strategy based on workload characteristics. This data-driven adaptability makes APAC particularly well-suited for parallel architectures, where efficient resource management across cores is essential to scaling system performance. Our evaluation with the ChampSim simulator demonstrates that APAC effectively adapts to diverse workloads and system configurations, achieving performance gains of 6.73% in multi-core systems compared to traditional Feedback Directed Prefetching (FDP). By improving memory bandwidth utilization, reducing cache pollution, and minimizing inter-core interference, APAC significantly enhances prefetching performance in multi-core processors. These results underscore APAC&#39;s potential as a robust solution for performance optimization in parallel system architectures, where efficient resource management is paramount for scaling modern processing environments.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained deduplication (also known as delta compression) can achieve a better deduplication ratio compared to chunk-level deduplication. This technique removes not only identical chunks but also reduces redundancies between similar but non-identical chunks. Nevertheless, it introduces considerable I/O overhead in deduplication and restore processes, hindering the performance of these two processes and rendering fine-grained deduplication less popular than chunk-level deduplication to date. In this paper, we explore various issues that lead to additional I/O overhead and tackle them using several techniques. Moreover, we introduce MeGA, which attains fine-grained deduplication/restore speed nearly equivalent to chunk-level deduplication while maintaining the significant deduplication ratio benefit of fine-grained deduplication. Specifically, MeGA employs (1) a backup-workflow-oriented delta selector and cache-centric resemblance detection to mitigate poor spatial/temporal locality in the deduplication process, and (2) a delta-friendly data layout and “Always-Forward-Reference” traversal to address poor spatial/temporal locality in the restore workflow. Evaluations on four datasets show that MeGA achieves a better performance than other fine-grained deduplication approaches. Specifically, MeGA significantly outperforms the traditional greedy approach, providing 10–46 times better backup speed and 30–105 times more efficient restore speed, all while preserving a high deduplication ratio.},

  abstract     = {GPUs are widely used hardware acceleration platforms in many areas due to their great computational throughput. In the meanwhile, GPUs are vulnerable to transient hardware faults in the post-Moore era. Analyzing the error resilience of GPUs are critical for both hardware and software. Statistical fault injection approaches are commonly used for error resilience analysis, which are highly accurate but very time consuming. In this work, we propose GEREM, a first framework to speed up fault injection process so as to estimate the error resilience of GPU microarchitectures swiftly and precisely. We find early fault behaviors can be used to accurately predict the final outcomes of program execution. Based on this observation, we categorize the early behaviors of hardware faults into GPU Early Fault Manifestation models (EFMs). For data structures, EFMs are early propagation characteristics of faults, while for pipeline instructions, EFMs are heuristic properties of several instruction contexts. We further observe that EFMs are determined by static microarchitecture states, so we can capture them without actually simulating the program execution process under fault injections. Leveraging these observations, our GEREM framework first profiles the microarchitectural states related for EFMs at one time. It then injects faults into the profiled traces to immediately generate EFMs. For data storage structures, EFMs are directly used to predict final fault outcomes, while for pipeline instructions, machine learning is used for prediction. Evaluation results show GEREM precisely assesses the error resilience of GPU microarchitecture structures with $237\times$ speedup on average comparing with traditional fault injections.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional sparse data emerge in many critical application domains such as healthcare and cybersecurity. To extract meaningful insights from massive volumes of these multi-dimensional data, scientists employ unsupervised analysis tools based on tensor decomposition (TD) methods. However, real-world sparse tensors exhibit highly irregular shapes and data distributions, which pose significant challenges for making efficient use of modern parallel processors. This study breaks the prevailing assumption that compressing sparse tensors into coarse-grained structures (i.e., tensor slices or blocks) or along a particular dimension/mode (i.e., mode-specific) is more efficient than keeping them in a fine-grained, mode-agnostic form. Our novel sparse tensor representation, Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (ALTO), encodes tensors in a compact format that can be easily streamed from memory and is amenable to both caching and parallel execution. In contrast to existing compressed tensor formats, ALTO constructs one tensor copy that is agnostic to both the mode orientation and the irregular distribution of nonzero elements. To demonstrate the efficacy of ALTO, we accelerate popular TD methods that compute the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) model across different types of sparse tensors. We propose a set of parallel TD algorithms that exploit the inherent data reuse of tensor computations to substantially reduce synchronization overhead, decrease memory footprint, and improve parallel performance. Additionally, we characterize the major execution bottlenecks of TD methods on multiple generations of the latest Intel Xeon Scalable processors, including Sapphire Rapids CPUs, and introduce dynamic adaptation heuristics to automatically select the best algorithm based on the sparse tensor characteristics. Across a diverse set of real-world data sets, ALTO outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude speedup over the best mode-agnostic formats. Compared to the best mode-specific formats, which require multiple tensor copies, ALTO achieves $5.1\times$ geometric mean speedup at a fraction (25%) of their storage costs. Moreover, ALTO obtains $8.4\times$ geometric mean speedup over the state-of-the-art memoization approach, which reduces computations by using extra memory, while requiring 14% of its memory consumption.},

  abstract     = {The high resource demand of deep learning training (DLT) workloads necessitates the design of efficient schedulers. While most existing schedulers expedite DLT workloads by considering GPU sharing and elastic training, they neglect layer elasticity, which dynamically freezes certain layers of a network. This technique has been shown to significantly speed up individual workloads. In this paper, we explore how to incorporate layer elasticity into DLT scheduler designs to achieve higher cluster-wide efficiency. A key factor that hinders the application of layer elasticity in GPU clusters is the potential loss in model accuracy, making users reluctant to enable layer elasticity for their workloads. It is necessary to have an efficient layer-elastic system, which can well balance training accuracy and speed for layer elasticity. We introduce ICEFROG, the first scheduling system that utilizes layer elasticity to improve the efficiency of DLT workloads in GPU clusters. It achieves this goal with superior algorithmic designs and intelligent resource management. In particular, (1) we model the frozen penalty and layer-aware throughput to measure the effective progress metric of layer-elastic workloads. (2) We design a novel scheduler to further improve the efficiency of layer elasticity. We implement and deploy ICEFROG in a physical cluster of 48 GPUs. Extensive evaluations and large-scale simulations show that ICEFROG reduces average job completion times by 36-48 % relative to state-of-the-art DL schedulers.},

Unfortunately, the inherent scheduler of NPU does not consider real-time scheduling. Therefore, it cannot meet real-time requirements of airborne embedded systems. At present, there is less research on the multi-task real-time scheduling of the NPU device. In this paper, we first design an NPU resource management framework based on Kubernetes. Then, we propose WAMSPRES, a workload-aware NPU performance model based soft preemptive real-time scheduling method. The proposed workload-aware NPU performance model can accurately predict the remaining execution time of the task when it runs with other tasks concurrently. The soft preemptive real-time scheduling algorithm can provide approximate preemption capability by dynamically adjusting the NPU computing resources of tasks. Finally, we implement a prototype NPU scheduler of the airborne embedded system for the fixed-wing UAV. The proposed models and algorithms are validated on both the simulated and realistic task sets. Experimental results illustrate that WAMSPRES can achieve low prediction error and high scheduling success rate.},

Offloading a computation to the many-core acceleration fabric implies synchronization and communication overheads which can hamper overall performance and efficiency, particularly for small and fine-grained parallel tasks. In this work, we present a detailed, cycle-accurate quantitative analysis of the offload overheads on Occamy, an open-source massively parallel RISC-V based heterogeneous MPSoC. We study how the overheads scale with the number of accelerator cores. We explore an approach to drastically reduce these overheads by co-designing the hardware and the offload routines. Notably, we demonstrate that by incorporating multicast capabilities into the Network-on-Chip of a large (200+ cores) accelerator fabric we can improve offloaded application runtimes by as much as 2.3x, restoring more than 70% of the ideally attainable speedups. Finally, we propose a quantitative model to estimate the runtime of selected applications accounting for the offload overheads, with an error consistently below 15%.},

Three key challenges in robotic tactile sensing are 1) interpreting sensor signals, 2) generating sensor signals in novel scenarios, and 3) learning sensor-based policies. For visuotactile sensors, interpretation has been facilitated by their close relationship with vision sensors (e.g., RGB cameras). However, generation is still difficult, as visuotactile sensors typically involve contact, deformation, illumination, and imaging, all of which are expensive to simulate; in turn, policy learning has been challenging, as simulation cannot be leveraged for large-scale data collection. We present TacSL (taxel), a library for GPU-based visuotactile sensor simulation and learning. TacSL can be used to simulate visuotactile images and extract contact-force distributions over $200\times$ faster than the prior state-of-the-art, all within the widely-used Isaac Simulator. Furthermore, TacSL provides a learning toolkit containing multiple sensor models, contact-intensive training environments, and online/offline algorithms that can facilitate policy learning for sim-to-real applications. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a novel online reinforcement-learning algorithm called asymmetric actor-critic distillation (AACD), designed to effectively and efficiently learn tactile-based policies in simulation that can transfer to the real world. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our library and algorithms by evaluating the benefits of distillation and multimodal sensing for contact-rich manipulation tasks, and most critically, performing sim-to-real transfer.

The utility of the proposed approach is particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs.

  abstract     = {Decision-making in robotics using denoising diffusion processes has increasingly become a hot research topic, but end-to-end policies perform poorly in tasks with rich contact and have limited interactivity. This paper proposes Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (HDP), a new robot manipulation policy of using contact points to guide the generation of robot trajectories. The policy is divided into two layers: the high-level policy predicts the contact for the robot&#39;s next object manipulation based on 3D information, while the low-level policy predicts the action sequence toward the high-level contact based on the latent variables of observation and contact. We represent both-level policies as conditional denoising diffusion processes, and combine behavioral cloning and Q-learning to optimize the low-level policy for accurately guiding actions towards contact. We benchmark Hierarchical Diffusion Policy across 6 different tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art imitation learning method Diffusion Policy with an average improvement of 20.8%. We find that contact guidance yields significant improvements, including superior performance, greater interpretability, and stronger interactivity, especially on contact-rich tasks. To further unlock the potential of HDP, this paper proposes a set of key technical contributions including one-shot gradient optimization, trajectory augmentation, and prompt guidance, which improve the policy&#39;s optimization efficiency, spatial awareness, and interactivity respectively. Finally, real-world experiments verify that HDP can handle both rigid and deformable objects.

To help address this challenge, we present PRO-MIND$^{\star }$, a novel human-in-the-loop framework that exploits valuable data about the human co-worker to optimise robot trajectories. By estimating human attention and mental effort, our method dynamically adjusts safety zones and enables on-the-fly alterations of the robot path to enhance human comfort and optimal stopping conditions. Moreover, we formulate a multi-objective optimisation to adapt the robot&#39;s trajectory execution time and smoothness based on the current human psycho-physical stress, estimated from heart rate variability and frantic movements. These adaptations exploit the properties of B-spline curves to preserve continuity and smoothness, which are crucial factors in improving motion predictability and comfort. Evaluation in two realistic case studies showcases the framework&#39;s ability to restrain the operators&#39; workload and stress and to ensure their safety while enhancing human-robot productivity. Further strengths of PRO-MIND include its adaptability to each individual&#39;s specific needs and sensitivity to variations in attention, mental effort, and stress during task execution.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a compliant and passive shared control framework for teleoperated robot-assisted tasks. Inspired by the human operator&#39;s capability of continuously regulating the arm impedance to perform contact-rich tasks, a novel control schema, exploiting the variable impedance control framework for force tracking is proposed. Moreover, bilateral teleoperation and shared control strategies are implemented to alleviate the human operator&#39;s workload. Furthermore, a global energy tank-based approach is integrated to enforce the system&#39;s passivity. The proposed framework is first evaluated to assess the force-tracking capability when the robot autonomously performs contact-rich tasks, e.g., in an ultrasound scanning scenario. Then, a validation experiment is conducted utilizing the proposed shared control framework. Finally, the system&#39;s usability is investigated with 12 users. The experiment results in system assessment revealed a maximum median error of 0.25 N across all the force-tracking experiment setups, i.e., constant and time-varying ones. Then, the validation experiment demonstrated significant improvements regarding the force tracking tasks compared to conventional control methods, and the system passivity was preserved during the task execution. Finally, the usability experiment shows that the human operator workload is significantly reduced by 54.6% compared to the other two control modalities. The proposed framework holds significant potential for the execution of remote robot-assisted medical procedures, such as palpation and ultrasound scanning, particularly in addressing deformation challenges while ensuring safety, compliance, and system passivity.},

To overcome this hurdle, we propose a so-far-unprecedented autonomous method to synthesize self-aligning knee joint mechanisms, requiring neither a baseline design nor human intervention during synthesis. Our method transforms the synthesis problem into an optimization problem amenable to an efficient gradient-based algorithm using a discretized ground mechanism model. The main challenge in the conversion lies in how to define the objective and constraint functions in order to ensure the fundamental self-aligning capability and also to impose a desired force transmittance profile. Several design cases were considered to show the effectiveness of the newly proposed functions for the optimization-based synthesis formulation, notably in addressing degree-of-freedom requirements. Although this study focuses primarily on knee joint mechanisms assisting gait motion and aligning with the flexion axis, the developed method can be applied to other self-aligning robot mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping sub-problems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline viewpoint changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline [1]. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods. Compared to ESVO [1], our new pipeline significantly reduces the camera pose tracking error by $40\%$–$80\%$ and $20\%$–$80\%$ in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative pose error, respectively; at the same time, the mapping efficiency is improved by a factor of five. We release our pipeline as an open-source software for future research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Locomotion gaits are fundamental for control of soft terrestrial robots. However, synthesis of these gaits is challenging due to modeling of robot-environment interaction and lack of a mathematical framework. This work presents an environment-centric, data-driven, and fault-tolerant probabilistic Model-Free Control (pMFC) framework that allows for soft multi-limb robots to learn from their environment and synthesize diverse sets of locomotion gaits for realizing open-loop control. Here, discretization of factors dominating robot-environment interactions enables an environment-specific graphical representation where the edges encode experimental locomotion data corresponding to the robot motion primitives. In this graph, locomotion gaits are defined as simple cycles that are transformation invariant, i.e., the locomotion is independent of the starting vertex of these periodic cycles. Gait synthesis, the problem of finding optimal locomotion gaits for a given substrate, is formulated as Binary Integer Linear Programming (BILP) problems with a linearized cost function, linear constraints, and iterative simple cycle detection. Experimentally, gaits are synthesized for varying robot-environment interactions. Variables include robot morphology - three-limb and four-limb robots, TerreSoRo-III and TerreSoRo-IV; substrate - rubber mat, whiteboard and carpet; and actuator functionality - simulated loss of robot limb actuation. On an average, gait synthesis improves the translation and rotation speeds by 82% and 97% respectively. The results highlight that data-driven methods are vital to soft robot locomotion control due to complex robot-environment interactions and simulation-to-reality gaps, particularly when biological analogues are unavailable.},

Existing inspection-planning algorithms do not explicitly address this uncertainty, which can hinder their performance. To overcome this, we introduce IRIS-under uncertainty (IRIS-U2), an inspection-planning algorithm that provides statistical assurances regarding coverage, path length, and collision probability. Our approach builds upon IRIS—our framework for deterministic, highly efficient, and provably asymptotically-optimal framework. This extension adapts IRIS to uncertain settings using a refined search procedure that estimates POI coverage probabilities through Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. We demonstrate IRIS-U2 through a case study on bridge inspections, achieving improved expected coverage, reduced collision probability, and increasingly precise statistical guarantees as MC samples grow. Additionally, we explore bounded suboptimal solutions to reduce computation time while preserving statistical assurances.},

However, these robots constitute a challenging case of study for control purposes due to the two-wheeled inverted pendulum dynamics that characterizes their mobility and support, as it is underactuated and unstable. In this paper, we propose a novel whole-body control approach to stabilize two-wheeled humanoids. To tackle the control problem of their forward motion and pitch equilibrium, leveraging on the observation that such systems are usually characterized by a faster and a slower dynamics (being the pitch angle faster and the forward displacement slower), we design a Composite Whole-Body control that combines two computed-torque control loops to stabilize both dynamics to the desired trajectories. The control approach is introduced and its derivation is described for the simpler case of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum first, and for a whole two-wheeled humanoid after. To prove its validity, the control approach is tested experimentally on the two-wheeled humanoid robot Alter-Ego. The robot proves to be able to perform complicated interaction tasks, including opening a door, grasping a heavy object, and resisting to external dynamic disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.},

  abstract     = {Robotic systems are typically composed of various subsystems, such as localization and navigation, each encompassing numerous configurable components (e.g., selecting different planning algorithms). Once an algorithm has been selected for a component, its associated configuration options must be set to the appropriate values. Configuration options across the system stack interact non-trivially. Finding optimal configurations for highly configurable robots to achieve desired performance poses a significant challenge due to the interactions between configuration options across software and hardware that result in an exponentially large and complex configuration space. These challenges are further compounded by the need for transferability between different environments and robotic platforms. Data efficient optimization algorithms (e.g., Bayesian optimization) have been increasingly employed to automate the tuning of configurable parameters in cyber-physical systems. However, such optimization algorithms converge at later stages, often after exhausting the allocated budget (e.g., optimization steps, allotted time) and lacking transferability. This paper proposes CURE—a method that identifies causally relevant configuration options, enabling the optimization process to operate in a reduced search space, thereby enabling faster optimization of robot performance. CURE abstracts the causal relationships between various configuration options and the robot performance objectives by learning a causal model in the source (a low-cost environment such as the Gazebo simulator) and applying the learned knowledge to perform optimization in the target (e.g., Turtlebot 3 physical robot). We demonstrate the effectiveness and transferability of CURE by conducting experiments that involve varying degrees of deployment changes in both physical robots and simulation.},

While greedy heuristics are a popular solution in the case of length constrained paths, it remains a challenge to compute optimal solutions in the discrete setting subject to routing constraints. We show that this challenge is surprisingly easy to circumvent. Using the optimality of the posterior mean for a class of functions of the squared loss yields an exact formulation as a mixed integer program. We demonstrate that this approach finds optimal solutions in a variety of settings in seconds and when terminated early, it finds sub-optimal solutions of higher quality than existing heuristics.},

  abstract     = {Soft millirobots are highly promising for biomedical applications due to their reconfigurability and multifunctionality within physiological environments. However, the diverse and narrow biological cavity environments pose significant adaptability challenges for these millirobots. Here, we present a dual-morphology, thin-film millirobot equipped with a magnetic drive head and a functional tail to facilitate multimodal motion and targeted cell delivery. The millirobot can reversibly switch between two distinct morphologies in response to environmental stimuli through the deformation of its hydrogel body. Utilizing these dual morphologies, the millirobot can perform robust multimodal fundamental motions controlled by magnetic fields. We encapsulate fundamental motions with specific programmable magnetic field parameters into motion primitives, allowing easy invocation and adjustment of motion modes on demand. A knowledge graph is established to map terrain features to motion units, enabling the identification of optimal motion modes based on typical terrain characteristics. Experimental results indicate that the millirobot can effectively switch its morphology and movement modes to navigate various terrains, including narrow and curved channels as small as 1 mm, 0.8 mm high stairs with a 15° incline, and even the complex environment of a swine intestinal lumen. Its functional tail can carry immune cells to target and kill cancer cells. This robot can transport drugs and cells while navigating complex terrains through multimodal motion, paving the way for targeted medical tasks in intricate human environments in the future.},

Its potential use is for advanced manipulation, planning and control. We model the interconnected object-suction cup system as a lumped 6D massspring-damper systems, employing a potential energy function on SE(3), parametrized by a 6 × 6 stiffness matrix. By exploiting geometric symmetries of the suction cup, we reduce the parameter identification problem, from 6(6 + 1)/2 = 21 to only 5 independent parameters, greatly simplifying the parameter identification procedure, that is otherwise ill-conditioned. Experimental validation is provided and data is shared openly to further stimulate research.

  abstract     = {Before deploying autonomous systems in safety-critical applications, we must be able to understand and verify the safety of these systems. For cases where the risk or cost of real-world testing is prohibitive, we propose a simulation-based framework for a) predicting ways in which an autonomous system is likely to fail and b) automatically adjusting the system&#39;s design and control policy to preemptively mitigate those failures. Existing tools for failure prediction struggle to search over high-dimensional environmental parameters, cannot efficiently handle end-to-end testing for systems with vision in the loop, and provide little guidance on how to mitigate failures once they are discovered. We approach this problem through the lens of approximate Bayesian inference, using differentiable simulation and rendering for efficient failure case prediction and repair (and providing a gradient-free version of our algorithm for cases where a differentiable simulator is not available). We include a theoretical and empirical evaluation of the trade-offs between gradient-based and gradient-free methods, applying our approach to a range of robotics and control problems, including optimizing search patterns for robot swarms, UAV formation control, and robust network control. Compared to optimization-based falsification methods, our method predicts a more diverse, representative set of failure modes, and we find that our use of differentiable simulation yields solutions that have up to 10x lower cost and requires up to 2x fewer iterations to converge relative to gradient-free techniques. In hardware experiments, we find that repairing control policies using our method leads to a 5x robustness improvement.

We introduce a new start pose robustness metric for steerable needle motion plans. A steerable needle deployment typically consists of a physician manually placing a steerable needle at a precomputed start pose on the surface of tissue and handing off control to a robot, which then autonomously steers the needle through the tissue to the target. The handoff between humans and robots is critical for procedure success, as even small deviations from a planned start pose change the steerable needle&#39;s reachable workspace. Our metric is based on a novel geometric method to efficiently compute how far the physician can deviate from the planned start pose in both position and orientation such that the steerable needle can still reach the target. We evaluate our metric through simulation in liver and lung scenarios. Our evaluation shows that our metric can be applied to plans computed by different steerable needle motion planners and that it can be used to efficiently select plans with large safe start regions.},

Dynamic game theory offers a formal framework for analyzing such intricacies. Yet, solving constrained dynamic games and determining the interaction outcome in the form of generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE) pose computational challenges due to the need for solving constrained coupled optimal control problems. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing to leverage the special structure of many real-world multi-agent interactions. More specifically, our key idea is to leverage constrained dynamic potential games, which are games for which GNE can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem associated with minimizing the potential function. We argue that constrained dynamic potential games can effectively facilitate interactive decision-making in many multi-agent interactions. We will identify structures in realistic multi-agent interactive scenarios that can be transformed into weighted constrained potential dynamic games (WCPDGs). We will show that the GNE of the resulting WCPDG can be obtained by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through various simulation studies and show that we achieve significant improvements in solve time compared to state-of-the-art game solvers. We further provide experimental validation of our proposed method in a navigation setup involving two quadrotors carrying a rigid object while avoiding collisions with two humans.},

We emphasize the interplay between perception and motion planning in decisionmaking by introducing the concept of occupancy queries to quantify the perception requirements for sampling-based motion planners. Sensor and algorithm performance are evaluated using False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) across various factors such as geometric relationships, object properties, sensor resolution, and environmental conditions. By integrating perception requirements with perception performance, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach is proposed for efficient sensor and algorithm selection and placement. This forms the basis for a co-design optimization that includes the robot body, motion planner, perception pipeline, and computing unit. We refer to this framework for solving the co-design problem of mobile robots as CODEI, short for Co-design of Embodied Intelligence. A case study on developing an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) for urban scenarios provides actionable information for designers, and shows that complex tasks escalate resource demands, with task performance affecting choices of the autonomy stack. The study demonstrates that resource prioritization influences sensor choice: cameras are preferred for cost-effective and lightweight designs, while lidar sensors are chosen for better energy and computational efficiency.},

Splat-Plan builds a safe-by-construction polytope corridor through the map based on mathematically rigorous collision constraints and then constructs a Bézier curve trajectory through this corridor. Splat-Loc provides real-time recursive state estimates given only an RGB feed from an on-board camera, leveraging the point-cloud representation inherent in GSplat scenes. Working together, these modules give robots the ability to recursively re-plan smooth and safe trajectories to goal locations. Goals can be specified with position coordinates, or with language commands by using a semantic GSplat. We demonstrate improved safety compared to point cloud-based methods in extensive simulation experiments. In a total of 126 hardware flights, we demonstrate equivalent safety and speed compared to motion capture and visual odometry, but without a manual frame alignment required by those methods. We show online re-planning at more than 2 Hz and pose estimation at about 25 Hz, an order of magnitude faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby enabling real-time navigation.

While vision-based tactile sensing has improved robotic grippers, it is challenging to realize high resolution vision-based tactile sensing in robot arms due to presence of curved surfaces, difficulty in uniform illumination, and large distance of sensing area from the cameras. In this paper, we propose a novel piezoluminescent skin that transduces external applied pressures into changes in light intensity on the other side for viewing by a camera for pressure estimation. By engineering elastomer layers with specific optical properties and integrating a flexible electroluminescent panel as a light source, we develop a compact tactile sensing layer that resolves the layout issues in curved surfaces. We achieved multipoint pressure estimation over an expansive area of 502 sq. cm with high spatial resolution, a Two-Point Discrimination distance of 3 mm horizontally and 5 mm vertically which is comparable to that of human fingers as well as a high localization accuracy (RMSE of 1.92 mm).

Building upon the intuition introduced in [11], the learned model is presented as a general framework for modeling, controlling, and designing soft manipulators. First, the method&#39;s adaptability and versatility are illustrated through optimization-based control problems involving positioning and manipulation tasks with mechanical contact-based coupling. Secondly, the low-memory consumption and the high prediction speed of the learned condensed model are leveraged for real-time embedding control without relying on costly online FEM simulation.

However, instead of assuming reciprocity, it poses an adaptive control problem to adapt to the cooperation level of other robots and agents in real time. This is achieved through a novel nonlinear opinion dynamics design that relies solely on sensor observations. As a by-product, we leverage tools from the opinion dynamics formulation to naturally avoid the deadlocks in geometrically symmetric scenarios that typically suffer VO-based planners. Extensive numerical simulations show that AVOCADO surpasses existing motion planners in mixed cooperative/ non-cooperative navigation environments in terms of success rate, time to goal and computational time.

  abstract     = {Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO&#39;s applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.},

  abstract     = {Robotic manipulator applications often require efficient online motion planning. When completing multiple tasks, sequence order and choice of goal configuration can have a drastic impact on planning performance. This is well known as the robot task sequencing problem (RTSP). Existing general-purpose RTSP algorithms are susceptible to producing poor-quality solutions or failing entirely when available computation time is restricted. We propose a new multi-query task sequencing method designed to operate in semi-structured environments with a combination of static and non-static obstacles. Our method intentionally trades off workspace generality for planning efficiency. Given a user-defined task space with static obstacles, we compute a subspace decomposition. The key idea is to establish approximate isometries known as $\epsilon$-Gromov-Hausdorff approximations that identify points that are close to one another in both task and configuration space. Importantly, we prove bounded suboptimality guarantees on the lengths of paths within these subspaces. These bounding relations further imply that paths within the same subspace can be smoothly concatenated, which we show is useful for determining efficient task sequences. We evaluate our method with several kinematic configurations in a complex simulated environment, achieving up to 3x faster motion planning and 5x lower maximum trajectory jerk compared to baselines.},

The approach leverages the recent notion of closed-loop state sensitivity and the associated ellipsoidal tubes of perturbed trajectories for taking into account online time-varying restrictions on state and input constraints. This makes the MPC controller “aware” of potential additional requirements needed to cope with parametric uncertainty, thus significantly improving the tracking performance and success rates during navigation in constrained environments. One key contribution lies in the introduction of a computationally efficient robust MPC formulation with a comparable computational complexity to a standard MPC (i.e., an MPC not explicitly dealing with parametric uncertainty). An extensive simulation campaign is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in handling parametric uncertainties and enhancing task performance, safety, and overall robustness. Furthermore, we also provide an experimental validation that shows the feasibility of the approach in real-world conditions and corroborates the statistical findings of the simulation campaign. The versatility and efficiency of the proposed method make it therefore a valuable tool for real-time control of robots subject to non-negligible uncertainty in their models.},

  abstract     = {The paper develops a novel motion model, called Generalized Multi-Speed Dubins Motion Model (GMDM), which extends the Dubins model by considering multiple speeds. While the Dubins model produces time-optimal paths under a constant-speed constraint, these paths could be suboptimal if this constraint is relaxed to include multiple speeds. This is because a constant speed results in a large minimum turning radius, thus producing paths with longer maneuvers and larger travel times. In contrast, multi-speed relaxation allows for slower speed sharp turns, thus producing more direct paths with shorter maneuvers and smaller travel times. Furthermore, the inability of the Dubins model to reduce speed could result in fast maneuvers near obstacles, thus producing paths with high collision risks. In this regard, GMDM provides the motion planners the ability to jointly optimize time and risk by allowing the change of speed along the path. GMDM is built upon the six Dubins path types considering the change of speed on path segments. It is theoretically established that GMDM provides full reachability of the configuration space for any speed selections. Furthermore, it is shown that the Dubins model is a specific case of GMDM for constant speeds. The solutions of GMDM are analytical and suitable for real-time applications. The performance of GMDM in terms of solution quality (i.e., time/time-risk cost) and computation time is comparatively evaluated against the existing motion models in obstacle-free as well as obstacle-rich environments via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that in obstacle-free environments, GMDM produces near time-optimal paths with significantly lower travel times than the Dubins model while having similar computation times. In obstacle-rich environments, GMDM produces time-risk optimized paths with substantially lower collision risks.},

This paper presents a passive linear MPC control scheme to implement bilateral teleoperation that optimizes the trade-off between stability and transparency (a.k.a. performance). First, we introduce a linear virtual energy tank with a novel energy-sharing policy, allowing us to define a passive linear MPC. Second, we provide conditions to guarantee the stability of the non-linear closed-loop system. We validate the proposed approach in a teleoperation scheme using two 7-DOF manipulators while performing an assembly task.

  abstract     = {Trajectory optimization has been a popular choice for motion generation and control in robotics for at least a decade. Several numerical approaches have exhibited the required speed to enable online computation of trajectories for real-time of various systems, including complex robots. Many of these said are based on the differential dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm – initially designed for unconstrained trajectory optimization problems – and its variants, which are relatively easy to implement and provide good runtime performance. However, several problems in robot control call for using constrained formulations (e.g. torque limits, obstacle avoidance), from which several difficulties arise when trying to adapt DDP-type methods: numerical stability, computational efficiency, and constraint satisfaction. In this article, we leverage proximal methods for constrained optimization and introduce a DDP-type method for fast, constrained trajectory optimization suited for model-predictive control (MPC) applications with easy warm-starting. Compared to earlier solvers, our approach effectively manages hard constraints without warm-start limitations and exhibits good convergence behavior. We provide a complete implementation as part of an open-source and flexible C++ trajectory optimization library called ALIGATOR. These algorithmic contributions are validated through several trajectory planning scenarios from the robotics literature and the real-time whole-body MPC of a quadruped robot.},

For long-term operations, a map-centric nonlinear factor recovery method is designed to sparsify poses while preserving mapping accuracy. We validate the SLIM system with multi-session real-world LiDAR data from classical LiDAR mapping datasets, including KITTI, NCLT, HeLiPR and M2DGR. The experiments demonstrate its capabilities in mapping accuracy, lightweightness, and scalability. Map re-use is also verified through map-based robot localization.

This paper presents NeuPAN: a real-time, highly accurate, map-free, easy-to-deploy, and environment-invariant robot motion planner. Leveraging a tightly coupled perception-to-control framework, NeuPAN has two key innovations compared to existing approaches: 1) it directly maps raw point cloud data to a latent distance feature space for collision-free motion generation, avoiding error propagation from the perception to control pipeline; 2) it is interpretable from an end-to-end model-based learning perspective. The crux of NeuPAN is solving an end-to-end mathematical model with numerous point-level constraints using a plug-and-play (PnP) proximal alternating-minimization network (PAN), incorporating neurons in the loop. This allows NeuPAN to generate real-time, physically interpretable motions. It seamlessly integrates data and knowledge engines, and its network parameters can be fine-tuned via backpropagation. We evaluate NeuPAN on a ground mobile robot, a wheel-legged robot, and an autonomous vehicle, in extensive simulated and real-world environments. Results demonstrate that NeuPAN outperforms existing baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities across various environments, including the cluttered sandbox, office, corridor, and parking lot.

Our proposed framework can achieve high-force/precision tasks by utilizing the supporting surface just as we humans do while taking into account various important constraints (e.g., system stability, joint angle/torque limits, friction-cone constraint, etc.) and the passive compliance of the flexible base. We first design the control as a combination of: 1) nominal control; 2) active stiffness control; and 3) feedback wrench control. We then sequentially perform optimizations of the nominal configuration (and its related wrenches) and the active stiffness control gain. We also design the PI (proportional-integral) type feedback wrench control to improve the robustness and precision of the control. The key theoretical enabler for our framework is a novel stiffness analysis of the dual-arm system with flexibility, which, when combined with certain constraints, provides some peculiar relations, that can effectively be used to significantly simplify the optimization problem-solving and to facilitate the feedback wrench control design by manifesting the compliance relation at the interaction port.

  abstract     = {In evolutionary robotics (ER), the evolution of a robot’s morphology (i.e., physical structure) or controller (i.e., control algorithm or instruction sequence) often entails tackling an extensive number of tasks. The use of evolutionary multitasking (EMT) in ER, which optimizes multiple tasks simultaneously by reusing potentially useful knowledge across diverse tasks, could improve the performance of problem-solving to each task. However, existing EMT methods do not fully use intertask correlations, limiting knowledge sharing. In view of this, this study introduces a novel framework, termed adaptive group-based collaborative optimization, tailored for handling optimization problems involving a large number of tasks within the ER domain simultaneously. The proposed framework divides tasks into groups according to their similarity and then proceeds through two principal stages, namely, intergroup knowledge separation and intragroup knowledge reunion. During intergroup knowledge separation stage, an adaptive method for selecting crossover operators enables source tasks to share useful knowledge to the target task across groups. During intragroup knowledge reunion stage, an adaptive knowledge combination strategy facilitates the target task in assimilating knowledge from multiple sources intragroup. We validated the efficacy of the proposed framework in both planar manipulators and hexapod robot experiments. The results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms (i.e., MME, MMKT) on several metrics (e.g., mean fitness and quality diversity metrics). The proposed method can effectively improve the effectiveness and diversity of solutions in solving ER problems with a large number of tasks (e.g., 5 000 or 10 000), and has broad potential in practical ER applications.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a novel approach to improving multitarget searching in unknown environments using multirobot systems while ensuring adaptability to changing communication conditions. The proposed method addresses challenges arising from limited scope, dynamic circumstances, and inaccurate decision data due to communication disruptions or interference in real-world scenarios. A comprehensive environmental map is generated using a grid-based mapping methodology, encompassing data related to obstacles, coverage, target occupancy, and communication conditions. Considering the constraints imposed by communication conditions, we develop the adaptive communication condition hierarchical distributed model predictive control framework. This framework incorporates a hierarchical communication strategy for multirobot target search. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, a series of comparative experiments are conducted on three distinct maps, each characterized by unique communication environments, obstacle layouts, and target distributions. These experiments employ four commonly used swarm intelligence algorithms. The research findings indicate that implementing the proposed search framework and communication strategy significantly reduces the time and communication costs associated with locating targets in complex and unfamiliar environments. This is particularly relevant for multirobot systems operating under diverse and limited communication conditions, substantially increasing the task’s success rate.},

  abstract     = {Graffiti detection is essential in historic building protection and urban neighborhood management. Graffiti detection has made significant progress in recent years based on the development of deep learning. However, small-scale graffiti, interference from the background, and the false detection of word parts in graffiti make it a challenging problem. This article proposes a Transformer-based high-precision graffiti detection method, namely DIG. Precisely, it consists of three modules: 1) Spatial query selection (SQS), scale-aware IoU loss (SIL); 2) Denoising Task with binary contrastive denoising (BCDN); and 3) IoU-guided box denoising (IBD) modules. To detect small-scale graffiti, this paper proposes SIL to help the loss function to perceive small-scale graffiti and large-scale graffiti fairly. To reduce the false detection of word parts, this article presents the SQS module, which integrates spatial information into the query selection process of the Encoder to filter out falsely detected bounding boxes within the graffiti. To reduce the interference from the background, this article introduces a denoising task with BCDN and IBD modules, improving the model’s ability to distinguish graffiti from the background and accurately select appropriate bounding boxes. A large number of experimental results on the STORM dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with an AP50 of 87.9%. Moreover, DIG achieved competitive results on the FineFM dataset for mask detection. This indicates that DIG can also be conveniently transferred to detect other scenarios.},

This is called sensory connectivity maintenance. A function termed as coordination function with sensory connectivity maintenance (CFSCM) is defined to describe the performances of the coordination as well as the sensory connectivity status between the agents. Then, a general control strategy is designed based on the proposed CFSCM for spatial coordination of multiple nonholonomic agents with sensory connectivity maintenance. Moreover, the applications of the proposed control strategy for formation with omnidirectional sensors and flocking with directional sensors are shown, respectively.

Main objective of this research is to propose a novel neural network-based framework, enhanced by a metaheuristic approach, to achieve robust energy prediction in the context of mobile app development. The metaheuristic approach here aims to achieve two goals: 1) identifying suitable learning algorithms and their corresponding hyperparameters, and 2) determining the optimal number of layers and neurons within each layer. Moreover, due to limitations in accessing certain aspects of a mobile phone, there might be missing data in the data set, and the proposed framework can handle this. In addition, we conducted an optimal algorithm selection strategy, employing 13 base and advanced metaheuristic algorithms, to identify the best algorithm based on accuracy and resistance to missing values. The representation in our proposed metaheuristic algorithm is variable-size, meaning that the length of the candidate solutions changes over time. We compared the algorithms based on the architecture found by each algorithm at different levels of missing values, accuracy, F-measure, and stability analysis. Additionally, we conducted a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for statistical comparison of the results. The extensive experiments show that our proposed approach significantly improves energy consumption prediction. Particularly, the JADE algorithm, a variant of differential evolution (DE), DE, and the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy deliver superior results under various conditions and across different missing value levels.},

This method enables autonomous decision-making and game equilibrium in group decision scenarios, considering individual preferences amidst constraints like incomplete information and alliance limitations. Leveraging the complementary entropy theorem on superiority, inferiority, and fuzzy measures, we propose a cognitive model for information interaction and attribute fusion. Utilizing the ordered weighted averaging operator and average tree solutions aids in identifying optimal alliance structures. We subsequently discuss evaluating missing information to complete the topological network.

Specifically, to improve the model accuracy and control capabilities, we proposed a nonparallel distributed compensation-based controller approach, be precise, the system and controller adopts the distinct membership functions. Moreover, the stability analysis of IT3FSs in the state space form is studied newly in this article. Besides the primary membership function that exists for interval type-2 fuzzy systems (IT2FSs), the IT3FSs possess the secondary membership function to handle the overall uncertainty which enacts the superiority of the proposed work. Notably, the adequate stability criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI) using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Additionally, the convex relaxation technique is used to strengthen the design flexibility and achieve the faster convergence rate, which converts an optimization problem with a vector variable to a convex program with a matrix variable, via a lifting technique. A noteworthy aspect is that the application of the convex relaxation technique in the context of IT3FSs is proposed for the first time in literature. Finally, the comparative results between IT2FSs and IT3FSs are shown via two illustrative examples, including the inverted-pendulum model, to underscore the efficacy and practical implementations of the developed control methodology.},

In what follows, with the aid of the parallel distributed compensation fuzzy control scheme, the main results of stability analysis and controller synthesis for the closed-loop re-entrant manufacturing control system are derived using a timer-dependent Lyapunov functional with spatio–temporal auxiliary variables. It is found that by means of the proposed fault-tolerant control approach, the RMS can be effectively and robustly driven to a desired production mode with steady feeding and production rates while the upper bound of a quadratic cost function is minimized.

Then, the equivalent transformation of the reconstructed system is implemented by virtue of barrier functions. With the aid of the nonquadratic utility function, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of the NZS game is derived. After that, an adaptive critic scheme with experience replay is employed to acquire the Nash equilibrium solution. Furthermore, a novel dynamic self-triggered rule is proposed with the dead-zone operation, which not only significantly reduces source consumption but also overcomes the implementation difficulty of monitoring hardware in the event-triggered mechanism. Moreover, the stability of the system and the uniform ultimate boundedness of the critic weights are guaranteed.

The proposed adaptive barrier-function global PID-type control method is designed to handle both matched and unmatched uncertainties and adjust the control parameters in real time to account for changes in system dynamics and perturbations. It efficiently handles both matched and mismatched uncertainties, ensuring precise tracking performance even amid uncertain dynamics and disturbances. The methodology dynamically adjusts control parameters in real time to accommodate changes in system dynamics, enhancing adaptability and performance. The globality of the suggested controller ensures the absence of a reaching phase and establishes the presence of the sliding mode around the surface right from the beginning. The proposed method has also been expanded to address uncertain dynamic systems with both matched and unmatched disturbances, while accounting for actuator faults and input saturation. The efficacy of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through simulation studies and experimental results on a rotary inverted pendulum (RIP) system, showcasing rapid convergence and exceptional tracking capabilities in practical scenarios. The contributions of this research lie in presenting a novel methodology that significantly contributes to the field of nonlinear control systems, offering a robust framework capable of addressing uncertainties in complex nonlinear systems. The results show that the method achieves fast convergence and excellent tracking performance in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances.

  abstract     = {A secret sharing scheme is an important cryptographic procedure that enables the secure distribution of secret information, such as private images, in an untrusted network. However, in all secret sharing schemes, the sizes of the shares increase in proportion to the size of the secret information, because they involve computationally expensive polynomials of degree n-1 (n is total number of shares) and increasingly large modulus of modulo operations for security. Moreover, with large share sizes, it is not easy in practice to encrypt them quickly using block cipher algorithms. Therefore, ensuring the security of secret sharing for large-scale visual data with a reasonable share length and efficiently encrypting n shares properly represents formidable challenges. To overcome these challenges in secret sharing schemes, we propose new multiparty random phase wrapping secret sharing systems for visual datasets. Computational optical imaging enables the acquisition of wrapped phase information, ranging from –π to π, to be expressed in the form of a complex sinusoidal waveform. The proposed scheme allows for large-scale secret data—such as confidential digital images and visual data, including optical images—to be securely and efficiently shared and distributed to multiple parties or agencies utilizing a digital representation of a complex sinusoidal waveform of the secret information. The proposed scheme can be useful in cryptographic key escrow systems and in use with large-scale secret data.},

In this article, without converting signed graph into corresponding unsigned structure via the gauge transformation, the bipartite complete synchronization of heterogeneous fractional networks is explored. Above all, a mathematic model of fractional networks with signed topology and heterogeneous nodes’ dynamics is introduced, in which the topological graph possesses both negative and positive edges to illustrate the competition and cooperation between individuals, and the desired synchronized state is an arbitrarily specified smooth orbit and not necessarily the decoupled state. Additionally, two innovative control schemes with logarithmic quantizer are developed, and several conditions are obtained to reach bipartite complete synchronization of fractional heterogeneous networks just by virtue of the Laplacian matrix of the original signed graph rather than the traditional technique of gauge transformation.

Second, an integral sliding hyperplane is formulated within the estimation space, which serves as the foundation for deriving the sliding mode dynamics, ensuring robustness against disturbances. Recognizing the diversity of transition rates (TRs), an elastic sliding mode controller is designed to accommodate three distinct types of TRs, which is also strategically designed to guarantee reachability and maintain sliding motion. Third, stochastic stability with an H∞ attenuation level is conducted separately for each type of TR. Correspondingly, the development of an algorithm for determining threshold parameters in triggered conditions is presented. Simultaneously, a proof of the nonexistence of Zeno behavior is provided, ensuring the stability and efficiency of the proposed system.

Given a plant, attackers work as a group in the framework of a coordinated distributed architecture and have the ability to edit some sensor readings to conceal the faults to confuse the operator. Furthermore, attackers necessarily remain furtive, i.e., their presence should not be discovered by the operator. In order to describe the set of all possible furtive attacks, a joint furtive diagnoser is established. We prove that an LPN under the above attacks is diagnosable if and only if its joint furtive diagnoser does not have the cycles composed of pairs of either faulty states and normal states, or faulty states and uncertain states. A new labeling function is proposed to enforce a plant to be diagnosable against as many attacks as possible. Examples are provided to illustrate the proposed method.},

To handle these challenges, this article proposes a distribution-allowed noise-resistant neural dynamics (DANRND) model to solve TDQP problems with equality and inequality constraints by introducing auxiliary variables rather than by using the nonlinear complementary problem (NCP) function. The proposed model is able to effectively eliminate the hysteresis error and suppress the influence of noises. Specifically, the proposed model is capable of implementation in a distributed manner, which extends its scope of applications. Then, theoretical analyses are provided to prove the global convergence in both noise-free and noisy conditions. Simulative examples and comparison results with existing methods are offered, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed DANRND model. Finally, a distributed cooperative task based on the k-winner-take-all (kWTA) operation is performed on a multirobot platform to further verify the distributed implementation of the proposed DANRND model.},

The information of each node is transmitted to the remote estimator through shared digital communication networks. Taking the bandwidth-limited situation into account, the model of bit-rate constraints and the encoding-decoding strategy are employed to reflect the principles of resource allocation and data schedule. Moreover, two Bernoulli sequences are adopted to depict the topologies switched stochastically and the deception attacks occurred randomly. A novel optimized SEBRCs method for NCDNs is proposed such that, for both stochastic topological structures and deception attacks, the covariance upper bound of estimation error can be derived and the estimator parameter can be determined accordingly. It is worth mentioning that both the related effects caused by attack probability and bit-rate constraints onto estimation performance are clarified from the monotonicity analysis perspectives, where new analysis method is given. Besides, a sufficient criterion is given to guarantee the uniform mean-square boundedness of the obtained covariance upper bound. Finally, the applicability of the presented SEBRCs method is demonstrated via solving the indoor localization problem with multiple mobile robots.},

In addition, a breakthrough detector and regulator based on the human force reaction process are advised to repress the positional overshooting deriving from force jump at the moment of tissue breakthrough. This method enhances the manipulating smoothness and suppresses puncture needle overshooting. The overshooting is compensated accordingly by the proposed regulator and surgical risk is lowered.

Nevertheless, the conventional obtained QIP estimates are numerically unstable, especially when the error samples contain outliers, resulting in the optimal solution of the MEE criterion deviating from the target vector to a certain extent. To address this problem, we introduce the M-estimate method from robust statistics into the QIP estimation process; thus, a robust estimation method called instantaneous M-estimate QIP (IM-QIP) is proposed, and several important properties of IM-QIP are presented. The proposed IM-QIP estimates could be implemented simply while ensuring great robustness. Naturally, we further propose the corresponding instantaneous M-estimate MEE (IM-MEE) criterion and apply it to adaptive filtering. A robust recursive adaptive filtering algorithm, called the recursive IM-MEE (RIM-MEE) algorithm, is proposed and analyzed in this article, along with its stability and theoretical steady-state performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that the RIM-MEE algorithm achieves a smaller theoretical bound compared to the traditional MEE algorithm under heavy-tailed and skewed noise conditions. The simulation results revealed the robustness of the IM-QIP estimates and verified the theoretical expectations and superior performance of the RIM-MEE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Federated Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) has received considerable attention due to the increasing need for privacy-conscious data analysis across diverse domains and sources in many real-world applications. Recent developments in federated FCM, however, are still in their infancy and largely unexplored. These methods struggle to handle nonindependent and identically distributed (non-iid) data. Moreover, critical hyperparameters, such as the number of iterations for local updates, are typically set manually, which can significantly affect the performance of federated clustering. To address these challenges, we introduce an Adaptive Federated FCM with an auxiliary model, named AF-FCM. In this approach, prior information from the auxiliary model, along with a proximal term in the local objective, mitigates the effects of the non-iid environment, enhancing both model robustness and effectiveness. Critical hyperparameters are adaptively adjusted using a proposed adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) algorithm, guided by a carefully designed fitness function. Within APSO, a nonlinear regression function adjusts the inertia weight, reducing the risk of convergence to local optima. In AF-FCM, global prototypes are refined using momentum gradient descent (MGD). Numerical experiments highlight the effectiveness and generalization performance of AF-FCM across various conditions, including heterogeneity variations, the number of clients, and the number of clusters. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art federated clustering baseline methods validates the competitive performance of AF-FCM.},

To address this issue, we investigate a privacy protection scheme based on multifeature fusion tensor (PPS-MFFT). Different from previous studies using a single feature or simple combination of several features, for every face image, PPS-MFFT first constructs a multifeature fusion tensor through hierarchically exploiting the correlations and complementarity between deep-learning features and those handcrafted features for stronger robustness and transferability. Further, on the basis of such tensors, the target images are reasonably chosen to enhance the camouflage effects while maintaining the visual similarities for final perturbed images, which are generated by means of developing a new optimization model for better tradeoff between effectiveness and practicability. Finally, the measurement results validate that both higher protective efficacy (e.g., 16% more in misidentifying the original face images) and acceptable visual effects can be obtained by PPS-MFFT when compared to the existing methods, and thus demonstrate the generality and applicability of our scheme.},

  abstract     = {This article focuses on the design of optimal linear stealthy (OLS) attacks with colored noises for linear cyber–physical systems (CPSs). Unlike existing linear attacks that neglect the autocorrelation of attack signals, OLS attacks with colored noises are more destructive while eliminating their impact on the residuals. By leveraging eigendecomposition and matrix splitting methods, explicit solutions for optimal attacks are derived by solving two distinct optimization problems. To illustrate the superiority of such attack behaviors, we further investigate OLS attacks with colored noises and historical innovations, where the leverage of historical data is maximized to enhance attack performances. Finally, we provide an illustration of the effectiveness of these attacks through an example of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV).},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an extended zero-gradient-sum (EZGS) approach for solving constrained distributed optimization with free initialization and desired convergence properties. A Newton-based continuous-time algorithm is first designed for general constrained optimization, which is adapted to handle inequality constraints by using log-barrier penalty functions. Then, a general class of EZGS dynamics is developed to address equation-constrained distributed optimization, where an auxiliary dynamics is introduced to ensure the final ZGS property from any initialization. It is demonstrated that for typical consensus protocols and auxiliary dynamics, the proposed EZGS dynamics can achieve the performance with exponential/finite/fixed/prescribed-time (PT) convergence. Particularly, the nonlinear consensus protocols for finite-time EZGS algorithms allow for heterogeneous power coefficients. Significantly, the proposed PT EZGS dynamics is continuous, uniformly bounded, and capable of reaching the optimal solution in a single stage. Furthermore, the barrier method is employed to handle the inequality constraints effectively. Finally, the efficiency and performance of the proposed algorithms are validated through numerical examples, highlighting their superiority over existing methods. In particular, by selecting appropriate protocols, the proposed EZGS dynamics can achieve desired convergence performance.},

  abstract     = {Robust knowledge acquisition approaches are one of the research hotspots in data mining. The fuzzy dominance rough sets (FDRS) model is an important knowledge acquisition tool for ordinal classification tasks. However, it has been proved in practice that this model usually performs poorly fault tolerance, and only one noisy sample can cause huge interference in acquiring knowledge. Attribute reduction is one of the nontrivial applications of the FDRS. At present, most attribute reduction methods for ordinal classification tasks mainly focus on the dependence of decision to attributes, while ignoring the information provided by the separability of classes and the correlation of attributes for ordinal classification. In view of these two issues, this article first proposes a robust FDRS model with filterable noise samples. Then, the class-separability and attribute-correlation are explored in robust fuzzy dominance rough approximation space, and corresponding attribute evaluation index is designed. Finally, an attribute reduction algorithm is designed to select the attribute subset with the highest classification performance. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better robustness and classification performance.},

It should be noticed that a new framework comprising a special PDT switching strategy is proposed for distributed DoS attacks with energy limitation. Accordingly, the controlled system is converted into a complex and constrained PDT-switched system. Subsequently, based on weak multi-Lyapunov functions, membership-function-dependent sufficient criteria are offered for judging the globally uniformly exponential stability of the researched closed-loop system, from which the gains of the observer and the controller can be computed. Finally, an algorithm generating PDT switching sequences for distributed DoS attacks is proposed, and simulations are given to substantiate the usability of the developed approach.},

Due to the effects of DoS attacks, such controlled CDSs can be viewed as a switched system with two modes: a stable mode during dormant intervals and an unstable one during attack intervals. Because of the switching character of the CDS with DoS attacks, some well-known data-driven control methods can not be used directly. To tackle this issue, a new relationship between the dormancy and activation periods of DoS attacks is built, which offers a more reasonable description of DoS attacks. Additionally, in the presence of measurement noise, a novel lemma (Lemma 3) is introduced to establish a data-based representation of CDSs using noisy measurement data. Without the need of explicit system parameter identification, stabilization criteria and control gain matrix are derived solely based on the input-state data. Finally, the effectiveness and good performance of the proposed method are illustrated through a numerical example and a power system.},

However, traditional GNNs are primarily designed based on the homophily assumption, which means that they show poor performance on heterophilic networks where dissimilar nodes prefer to connect. To address this issue, several heterophilic GNNs have been proposed that employ techniques, such as extending local neighbors and improving GNN architectures. From another perspective, recent studies have shown that, unlike homophilic GNNs, heterophilic GNNs exhibit higher robustness against graph adversarial attacks. In these attacks, the attackers try to inject small perturbations into the graph. Therefore, in this study, we delve into the core designs of heterophilic GNNs, including high-order neighbor, potential neighbor, ego-neighbor separation, and interlayer combination designs. We further analyze the influence of these key designs on the robustness of GNNs. We conducted comprehensive experiments to compare the impact of different designs on baseline and real-world GNN models. The findings of this work can serve as a reference for future studies aiming to design more robust and universal GNNs.},

By developing backstepping, an event-triggered switched NN observer, event-triggered adaptive NN controllers of subsystems and three novel switching dynamic event-triggering mechanisms (ETMs) are constructed. Multiple event-triggering communications from sensor to controller and observer to controller and controller to actuator are thus achieved under arbitrary switchings. Naturally, more communication burdens can be reduced compared with those existing single or dual event-triggering communications methods for non-switched and switched systems. Note that one difficulty caused by dual asynchronous switchings among candidate subsystems and candidate controllers and candidate observers is overcome. Also, other difficulties caused by finding an adjustable positive lower bound of interexecution times for each ETM and the errors between continuous-time and sampled-data-based basis function vectors of NNs are overcome.

This inherent instability poses a significant challenge to traditional incremental-consensus-based distributed optimization or game methods, which rely on a stable and consistent agent population to compute and maintain equilibrium solutions effectively. The necessity for these methods to continuously enforce constraints and the time-intensive process of recalculating equilibria in response to agent dynamics present a substantial bottleneck in the optimization of OMASs. To address this challenge, we develop an innovative incremental consensus-based distributed (ICBD) algorithm to achieve the dynamic Nash equilibrium (NE) for constrained noncooperative game of OMASs. The ICBD algorithm leverages predefined-time stability and integral sliding-mode control to enable rapid recalibration to new equilibria and maintain constraints without the need for prolonged recalculations.

Meanwhile, a narrower error envelope is yielded when such torques are absent, which also improves the fidelity of the desired impedance model. To achieve the prescribed tracking performance of the inner position loop, a two-stage backstepping control is proposed by defining two first-order composite error surfaces bridged by a second-order dynamic surface. This promulgates the minimum number of backstepping stages under the available state feedback, thus avoiding “explosion of terms.” In addition, dual-adaptive neural networks are incorporated into the backstepping control to compensate for the matched and unmatched disturbances. Real-time experiments are conducted to validate the appeal of the proposed method.},

It is shown that the dynamics trajectories converge to NE within fixed-time from arbitrary initial conditions, achieving a quicker convergence rate through the selection of distinct time-varying coefficients. Moreover, the upper bounds of the settling time for the proposed NE seeking neurodynamic approaches are explicitly provided. In addition, the study investigates the robustness of the designed neurodynamic approaches in the presence of bounded noises.

Although there has been a growing interest in multiobjective problems with complex constraints, such as the vehicle routing problem with time windows, existing multiobjective evolutionary optimization techniques still face significant challenges, particularly when addressing the fragmented and narrow feasible regions that arise from these constraints. Our research introduces a refined framework tailored for complex constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The methodology conducts an initial strong-weak analysis to categorize constraints and merges each strong constraint with all weak constraints to form subsets. Each subset, combined with the original objective functions, defines a subproblem. Independent optimization of the original problem and subproblems is carried out by utilizing multiple populations. Information acquired from the subproblems’ populations is transferred into the population of the original issue, thereby expediting the detection of the feasible region and simplifying the resolution of the original problem. The efficacy of our innovative algorithm, when benchmarked against traditional constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms across 72 test functions, has demonstrated superior convergence, diversity, and competitiveness.},

Initially, a coupled performance index function associated with consensus errors is constructed. As the positive-definite function with the quadratic form is allocated to the constructed consensus errors-based performance index function, the original system stabilization problem is converted into the issue of seeking an optimal control strategy profile for the leader and followers. Under the hierarchical Stackelberg–Nash differential game framework, the optimal control strategies are derived in sequence and further proved to compose the equilibrium points of Stackelberg–Nash differential games. Afterward, based on the ADP technique, a modified single-critic neural network (NN) is implemented and the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation is approximately identified. Under the proposed control scheme, the leader–follower consensus of the considered MAS can be achieved while consuming less control cost. Meanwhile, all signals of the MAS are ensured to be uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a numerical simulation and an application to the electrode regulating system of the three-phase electric arc furnace are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

However, the massive kernels, deep fusion, and heterogeneous ensemble mechanisms, which are the core of the three frameworks, respectively, lead to overfitting risks. Therefore, in this article, a novel convolution-based TSC algorithm multichannel-based multiview shallow fusion (MC-MSF) within a new shallow fusion ensemble-based MCF is proposed. MC-MSF enhances feature diversity, quality, and classifier diversity while suppressing the overfitting risks via three shallow components. For feature diversity, the original series is mapped to the connected multichannel series spaces, and then diverse pooling features are extracted via a single-layer convolution with fewer kernels. For feature quality, the power of proportion of positive values (PPPV) features with adaptive powers are extracted based on alternating gradient descent, and the multiview shallow feature fusion is implemented to generate fused features. For classifier diversity, diverse linear classifiers are trained on the combined multiview feature vectors to ensemble homogeneously. The state-of-the-art TSC accuracy is achieved by MC-MSF via the sequential operation of three effective shallow components, as verified by comparative experiments on the public UCR and real excavator fault diagnosis application datasets.},

According to the processed model, we propose a novel predictive control algorithm for register control, incorporating a coupling-based selection algorithm to strategize the control weight matrix of the controller against the adverse effects of system coupling. The effectiveness and superior performance of CMB-MPC are demonstrated by experiments and comparisons, and the results indicate that CMB-MPC imparts three distinct advantages.

Second, it achieves a remarkable enhancement in register accuracy within R2R printing systems, surpassing the capabilities of conventional MPC and fully decoupled proportional-differential control methods.

By the cooperativity theory and Lyapunov stability theory, it is established that the distributed interval observer can not only access some information about MASs at any instant, that is, the upper and lower bounds of each component of the agent state, but also realize the cooperative behavior of MASs under some essential conditions involving network synchronization and the unstable eigenvalue of the system matrix. In addition, with the help of a new time-varying transformation matrix, the new interval observer is constructed to eliminate the non-negative constraint.

Then, a novel event-triggered cluster consensus protocol is designed for MASs with DoS attacks and structurally balanced signed digraphs, where Zeno behavior can be strictly excluded by the proposed triggering mechanism. Furthermore, to cope with the structurally unbalanced signed digraph, an improved event-triggered resilient consensus protocol is developed by introducing a pinning control strategy. By utilizing the piecewise Lyapunov functional approach, some sufficient conditions are derived for the cluster consensus under structurally balanced and unbalanced signed digraphs, while the selection principles of event-triggered parameters and resilient controller gains are obtained.

  abstract     = {Contrastive learning is a promising solution to the problem of data sparsity in the field of recommendation system since it is able to extract self-supervised signals from raw data. The traditional contrastive learning-based sequential recommendation algorithms generate augmentations of original item sequences by utilizing crop, mask and reorder operations. However, those augmentation schemes destroy the underlying semantics of item sequences, resulting in difficulty in accurately defining positive and negative samples. To address this issue, we propose a contrastive translation based sequential recommendation algorithm, namely, CT4Rec. Specifically, CT4Rec generates augmented views of item sequences by injecting noises into embeddings of users and items, which is able to guarantee that the underlying semantics of augmented views are consistent with those of original item sequence. Hence, CT4Rec is able to effectively learn the invariances among the augmented views. In addition, the personalized translation operations are utilized to model the third-order relationships among entities. Moreover, it is difficult for contrastive learning-based recommendation algorithms with static temperature to simultaneously capture the differences among individual users/items and among the clusters of users/items. Hence, we utilize a dynamic temperature strategy to enhance CT4Rec, which endows CT4Rec with the capabilities of group-wise discrimination and instance discrimination. Our validation on five benchmark datasets shows that CT4Rec outperforms SOTA sequential recommendation methods. Our code is released at https://github.com/zar123123/CT4Rec.},

Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program. The relative performances of the two algorithms are compared in the context of their applicability. Performance analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors with respect to three important metrics.

Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative control framework of human–machine game in lateral and longitudinal dimensions considering dynamic allocation of driving authority to improve the collaborative performance of co-driving. First, a human–machine collaborative driving system model that adapts to the characteristics of co-driving mode is built as the basis of the shared control scheme. Then, the unconscious competitive relationship of human–machine is described as the game interaction relationship, with optimal control strategies for both sides being deduced theoretically at the game equilibrium. Additionally, a dynamic adjustment strategy of driving authority considering the longitudinal speed is established based on the assessment of lateral and longitudinal risks. Finally, the driver-in-the-loop test and co-simulation results show that the proposed control strategy has achieved good performance in terms of path tracking, driver’s driving burden, and vehicle stability.},

Group multirole assignment (GMRA), an extension of group role assignment (GRA), is a critical step in the RBC process, enabling the formation of efficient collaborative teams by reasonably assigning roles to agents. Recognized as a significant determinant impacting assignment and collaboration, conflict has been delineated and incorporated into GMRA. Nevertheless, the specified conflict is characterized as an oppositional conflict (OC), signifying that conflicting agents are engaged in conflict across the entirety of the role set. Rather than completely OC, which is highly specific, a more prevalent relationship involves conflict in certain aspects while remaining conflict-free in others. Therefore, we propose the concept of general conflict (GC) to describe the more common and realistic conflict relationship, offering a broader and novel perspective to depict conflict relationships. Then, we formalize these two problems by considering GC avoidance in GRA and GMRA, called GRA with GC (GRAGC) and GMRA with GC (GMRAGC), respectively. Furthermore, we establish the necessary conditions for the GRAGC and GMRAGC problems through a graph-theoretical lens, accompanied by a thorough analysis of their mathematical nature. Additionally, we propose practical solutions and refine methodologies to address both problems. The effectiveness of the improved algorithms utilizing necessary conditions is verified by simulations, which also provides evidence supporting the advantages of conflict avoidance.},

Initially, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to linearize agent dynamics under false data injection (FDI) attacks and external disturbances. Subsequently, a proportional-integral (PI) protocol is employed to achieve overall robust formation. We present rigorous theoretical analyses of both stages, demonstrating the guaranteed convergence of GANs training and the closed-loop formation errors.

  abstract     = {Crowd management plays a crucial role in improving travel efficiency and reducing potential risks caused by overcrowding in large public places. Crowd control at entrances is a common way in our daily life to avoid overcrowding, but nowadays the control of crowd inflow at the entrances of public places mainly relies on manual operation. In this article, we intend to propose a dynamic crowd inflow control system (DRIFT) to avoid risks of overcrowding and improve the throughput of public places. First, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes throughput by adjusting the crowd inflow rate of each entrance in the public place. Through mathematical analysis and related proofs, we introduce a baseline for the aforementioned problem that can calculate the upper bound of static inflow rate. With this baseline, we can easily measure the performance of other dynamic inflow control algorithms. Second, we treat the proposed optimization problem as a real-time decision-making problem, and further propose the DRIFT system based on deep reinforcement learning to address it. Specifically, the strategy of DRIFT is a basic actor–critic framework adapting a shared long short term memory (LSTM) layer to extract scene feature information. Third, we train it through proximal policy optimization (PPO) to improve learning performance. The environment for experiments is a crowd simulation model of OpenAI Gym structure based on real scene data from the 1F floor of the Chengdudong Railway Station and Xizhimen Railway Station. In comparison experiments and ablation experiments, the strategy of our DRIFT outperforms all other comparison strategies, including the most recent strategy using reinforcement learning, in term of system crowd throughput and robustness.},

  abstract     = {In the context of distribution inconsistent data classification, addressing distribution shift is crucial, typically accomplished through domain adaptation (DA) techniques. Once distributions are aligned between the source and target domains, the problem transforms into a conventional recognition task. This article introduces a new method called multitarget DA based on Evidence Theory (MET). For a given target domain, a random merger with other target domains is performed, generating distinct new target domains. Domain-invariant features corresponding to each new target domain are learned by minimizing distribution discrepancies separately between the source and different new target domains. The merging of target domains alters the distribution of the new target domain, leading to variations in the retained information within the learned domain-invariant features. For a query pattern in this target domain, multiple soft classification results (CCR) are obtained after aligning the distributions of the source and different new target domains. These soft CCR complement each other, and evidence theory is employed as a tool to represent and combine uncertain information, fusing these results. The weights for this fusion are automatically learned by minimizing the mean squared error between the combined results and the ground truth on labeled source domain data. The final class decision is determined through the weighted evidential combination of multiple pieces of soft CCR. MET is assessed on several datasets (i.e., Office+Caltech-10, VLSC, and V-RSIR) and compared to various advanced DA methods (e.g., GNN, MT, PAL, PTD, and so on) to validate its effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrate that MET usually can obtain a higher classification performance (i.e., the accuracy can be improved by 2% compared to many methods in most cases).},

  abstract     = {Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a promising paradigm inspired by transfer learning to solve the cold-start problem in recommender systems. Existing state-of-the-art CDR methods train an explicit mapping function to transfer the cold-start users from a data-rich source domain to a target domain. However, a limitation of these methods is that the mapping function is trained on overlapping users across domains, while only a small number of overlapping users are available for training. By visualizing the loss landscape of the existing CDR model, we find that training on a small number of overlapping users causes the model to converge to sharp minima, leading to poor generalization. Based on this observation, we leverage loss-geometry-based machine learning approach and propose a novel CDR method called sharpness-aware CDR (SCDR). Our proposed method simultaneously optimizes recommendation loss and loss sharpness, leading to better generalization with theoretical guarantees. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that SCDR significantly outperforms other CDR models on cold-start recommendation tasks. Additionally, our method enhances the model’s robustness to adversarial attacks.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing objects from posed images is a crucial and complex task in computer graphics and computer vision. While NeRF-based neural reconstruction methods have exhibited impressive reconstruction ability, they tend to be time-comsuming. Recent strategies have adopted 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) for inverse rendering, which have led to quick and effective outcomes. However, these techniques generally have difficulty in producing believable geometries and materials for glossy objects, a challenge that stems from the inherent ambiguities of inverse rendering. To address this, we introduce GlossyGS, an innovative 3D-GS-based inverse rendering framework that aims to precisely reconstruct the geometry and materials of glossy objects by integrating material priors. The key idea is the use of micro-facet geometry segmentation prior, which helps to reduce the intrinsic ambiguities and improve the decomposition of geometries and materials. Additionally, we introduce a normal map prefiltering strategy to more accurately simulate the normal distribution of reflective surfaces. These strategies are integrated into a hybrid geometry and material representation that employs both explicit and implicit methods to depict glossy objects. We demonstrate through quantitative analysis and qualitative visualization that the proposed method is effective to reconstruct high-fidelity geometries and materials of glossy objects, and performs favorably against state-of-the-arts.},

  abstract     = {Parametric edge reconstruction for point cloud data is a fundamental problem in computer graphics. Existing methods first classify points as either edge points (including corners) or non-edge points, and then fit parametric edges to the edge points. However, few points are exactly sampled on edges in practical scenarios, leading to significant fitting errors in the reconstructed edges. Prominent deep learning-based methods also primarily emphasize edge points, overlooking the potential of non-edge areas. Given that sparse and non-uniform edge points cannot provide adequate information, we address this challenge by leveraging neighboring segmented patches to supply additional cues. We introduce a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs edges precisely and completely via surface patch segmentation. First, we propose PCER-Net, a Point Cloud Edge Reconstruction Network that segments surface patches, detects edge points, and predicts normals simultaneously. Second, a joint optimization module is designed to reconstruct a complete and precise 3D wireframe by fully utilizing the predicted results of the network. Concretely, the segmented patches enable accurate fitting of parametric edges, even when sparse points are not precisely distributed along the model&#39;s edges. Corners can also be naturally detected from the segmented patches. Benefiting from fitted edges and detected corners, a complete and precise 3D wireframe model with topology connections can be reconstructed by geometric optimization. Finally, we present a versatile patch-edge dataset, including CAD and everyday models (furniture), to generalize our method. Extensive experiments and comparisons against previous methods demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. We will release the code and dataset to facilitate future research.},

However, notwithstanding numerous studies this only has anecdotal support. Here we used a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm where 26 participants experienced a VR scenario where the RL agent could sequentially propose changes to 5 binary factors: mono or stereo vision, 3 or 6 degrees of freedom head tracking, mono or spatialised sound, low or high display resolution, or one of two color schemes. The first 4 are SC, whereas the last is not. Participants could reject or accept each change proposed by the RL, until convergence. Participants were more likely to accept changes from low to high SC than changes to the color. Additionally, theory suggests that increased PI should be associated with lower eye scanpath entropy. Our results show that mean entropy did decrease over time and the final level of entropy was negatively correlated with a post exposure questionnaire-based assessment of PI.},

Currently, due to the presence of joint hinges and limb occlusions in human point clouds, point cloud alignment is challenging. To address these two limits, this paper proposes an unsupervised non-rigid human point cloud registration method based on deformation field fusion. The method mainly consists of the deep dynamic link deformation field estimation module and the probabilistic alignment deformation field estimation module. The deep dynamic link deformation field estimation module uses a time series network to convert non-rigid deformation into multiple rigid deformations. Then, feature extraction is performed to estimate the deformation field based on the rigid deformations. The probabilistic alignment deformation field estimation module builds on a Gaussian mixture model and adds local and global constraint conditions for deformation field estimation. Finally, the two deformation fields are fused into the total deformed field by aligning them, which enhances the sensitivity to both global and local feature information. The experimental results on public datasets and real private datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has higher accuracy and better robustness under joint hinges and limb adhesion conditions.},

This information is recurrent in tasks where users are familiar with components that fit together without needing specialized tools but lack knowledge of the specific orientations required for the assembly. A typical example is placing rubber gaskets that fit smoothly into grooves but where no markings indicate the correct sealing side. We evaluated six different AR presentation modes for conveying component orientation: image, video, static side-by-side product model, animated side-by-side product model, static in-situ product model, and animated insitu product model. The literature provides no clear agreement on which is the most effective. To fill this gap, we conducted a user study with 36 participants, measuring completion time, accuracy, and cognitive load across the six AR presentation modes. We also analyzed how users interacted with each of them and collected user subjective feedback.

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) presents immersive opportunities across many applications, yet the inherent risk of developing cybersickness during interaction can severely reduce enjoyment and platform adoption. Cybersickness is marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work primarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and motion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the dynamic nature of cybersickness while users experience and freely interact in VR. We propose a novel method to continuously identify and quantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users&#39; passively monitored electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method estimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing techniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels in real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific calibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses the considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness research. In addition to our method&#39;s implementation, we release our dataset of 16 participants and approximately 2 hours of total recordings to spur future work in this domain.

  abstract     = {When several people are co-located and immersed in a mixed reality environment, they may feel like they share the virtual environment or not. This feeling of copresence, along with its parent dimensions of social presence and presence, has been mostly studied by relying on subjective measures gathered through questionnaires. As a way to address the drawbacks of this approach, we introduce a protocol to gather behavioral measures in the context of co-located mixed reality. As a pair of participants avoid obstacles moving towards them, their errors, gaze, interpersonal distance, and timing are measured. By combining subjective measures gathered through a questionnaire drawing from previous studies on social presence with behavioral measures, we demonstrate new ways to assess how users experience copresence. We illustrate this protocol by evaluating the effect of visual feedback on collaborators&#39; activity. The results of this experiment suggest the capability of our protocol by revealing the effect of visual feedback on both objective and subjective measures.},

  abstract     = {Virtual Reality Video Quality Assessment (VR-VQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of 360-degree videos, which is crucial for ensuring a distortion-free user experience. Traditional VR-VQA methods trained on static datasets with limited distortion diversity struggle to balance correlation and precision. This becomes particularly critical when generalizing to diverse VR content and continually adapting to dynamic and evolving video distribution variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for assessing the perceptual quality of VR videos, Adaptive Score Alignment Learning (ASAL). ASAL integrates correlation loss with error loss to enhance alignment with human subjective ratings and precision in predicting perceptual quality. In particular, ASAL can naturally adapt to continually changing distributions through a feature space smoothing process that enhances generalization to unseen content. To further improve continual adaptation to dynamic VR environments, we extend ASAL with adaptive memory replay as a novel Continul Learning (CL) framework. Unlike traditional CL models, ASAL utilizes key frame extraction and feature adaptation to address the unique challenges of non-stationary variations with both the computation and storage restrictions of VR devices. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for VR-VQA and its CL counterpart, introducing new data splits and evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that ASAL outperforms recent strong baseline models, achieving overall correlation gains of up to 4.78% in the static joint training setting and 12.19% in the dynamic CL setting on various datasets. This validates the effectiveness of ASAL in addressing the inherent challenges of VR-VQA. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/ASAL_CVQA.},

We conducted a 3×2 factorial experiment with 36 participants to examine the effects of these environments on learning performance. Our results show for individual learners, the dynamic and potentially distracting beach environment increased frustration and effort but also heightened their sense of engagement and perceived performance. In contrast, team-based learning in familiar environments like the office significantly reduced frustration and fostered collaboration, leading to improved performance. Interestingly, team-based learning excelled in the baseline environment, whereas individual learners performed better in more challenging settings like the beach. These findings provide practical insights into optimizing virtual environments to enhance both individual and collaborative learning in VR education.},

  abstract     = {Photos taken in unconstrained tourist environments often present challenges for accurate 3D scene reconstruction due to variable appearances and transient occlusions, which can introduce artifacts in novel view synthesis. Recently, in-the-wild 3D scene reconstruction has been achieved realistic rendering with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). With the advancement of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), some methods also attempt to reconstruct 3D scenes from unconstrained photo collections and achieve real-time rendering. However, the rapid convergence of 3DGS is misaligned with the slower convergence of neural network-based appearance encoder and transient mask predictor, hindering the reconstruction efficiency. To address this, we propose a novel sky-aware framework for scene reconstruction from unconstrained photo collection using 3DGS. Firstly, we observe that the learnable per-image transient mask predictor in previous work is unnecessary. By introducing a simple yet efficient greedy supervision strategy, we directly utilize the pseudo mask generated by a pre-trained semantic segmentation network as the transient mask, thereby achieving more efficient and higher quality in-the-wild 3D scene reconstruction. Secondly, we find that separately estimating appearance embeddings for the sky and building significantly improves reconstruction efficiency and accuracy. We analyze the underlying reasons and introduce a neural sky module to generate diverse skies from latent sky embeddings extract from unconstrained images. Finally, we propose a mutual distillation learning strategy to constrain sky and building appearance embeddings within the same latent space, further enhancing reconstruction efficiency and quality. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in novel view and appearance synthesis, offering superior rendering quality with faster convergence and rendering speed.},

  abstract     = {Markerless hand-tracking has become increasingly common on commercially available virtual and mixed reality headsets to improve the naturalness of interaction and immersivity of virtual environments. However, there has been limited examination of the performance of markerless hand-tracking on commercial head-mounted displays. Here, we propose an evaluation methodology that leverages a robotic manipulator to measure the positional accuracy, jitter, and latency of such systems and provides a standardized characterization framework of markerless hand-tracking. We apply this methodology to evaluate the hand-tracking performance of two recent mixed reality devices from Meta: the Quest Pro and Quest 3. Results demonstrate the influence of proximity to the headset, rotation of hand, and joint selected as the tracking feature on hand-tracking performance. We found that hand-tracking error and jitter were lowest for both headsets in conditions where the knuckle was the tracking point compared to the fingertip. Regarding positional accuracy, in best-performing conditions, the Quest Pro outperformed the Quest 3 with 1.22 cm of average error compared to 1.73 cm. The opposite result was true concerning jitter, with results of 1.77 cm and 1.11 cm for the Quest Pro and Quest 3, respectively. We found latency highly variable for the Quest Pro (15.8 - 229.2 ms) and Quest 3 (14.4 - 220.5 ms). This work provides a testing framework for highly systematic and repeatable performance measurements of markerless hand-tracking systems embedded in headsets.},

  abstract     = {The way users interact with Virtual Reality (VR) environments plays a crucial role in shaping their experience when embodying an avatar. How avatars are perceived by users significantly influences their behavior based on stereotypes, a phenomenon known as the Proteus effect. The psychological concept of affordances may also appear relevant when it comes to interact through avatars and is yet underexplored. Indeed, understanding how virtual representations suggest possibilities for action has attracted considerable attention in the human-computer interaction community, but only few studies clearly address the use of affordances. Of particular interest is the fact aesthetic features of avatars may signify false affordances, conflicting with users&#39; expectations and impacting perceived plausibility of the depicted situations. Recent models of congruence and plausibility suggest altering the latter may result in unexpected consequences on other qualia like presence and embodiment. The proposed research initially aimed at exploring the operationalization of affordances as a tool to investigate the impact of congruence and plausibility manipulations on the sense of embodiment. In spite of a long and careful endeavor materialized by a preliminary assessment and two user studies, it appears our participants were primed by other internal processes that took precedence over the perception of the affordances we selected. However, we unexpectedly manipulated the internal congruence following repeated exposures (mixed design), causing a rupture in plausibility and significantly lowering scores of embodiment and task performance. The present research then constitutes a direct proof of a relationship between a break in plausibility and a break in embodiment},

  abstract     = {Robotic ultrasound systems have the potential to improve medical diagnostics, but patient acceptance remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel system that combines an AI-based virtual agent, powered by a large language model (LLM), with three mixed reality visualizations aimed at enhancing patient comfort and trust. The LLM enables the virtual assistant to engage in natural, conversational dialogue with patients, answering questions in any format and offering real-time reassurance, creating a more intelligent and reliable interaction. The virtual assistant is animated as controlling the ultrasound probe, giving the impression that the robot is guided by the assistant. The first visualization employs augmented reality (AR), allowing patients to see the real world and the robot with the virtual avatar superimposed. The second visualization is an augmented virtuality (AV) environment, where the real-world body part being scanned is visible, while a 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the room, excluding the robot, forms the virtual environment. The third is a fully immersive virtual reality (VR) experience, featuring the same 3D reconstruction but entirely virtual, where the patient sees a virtual representation of their body being scanned in a robot-free environment. In this case, the virtual ultrasound probe, mirrors the movement of the probe controlled by the robot, creating a synchronized experience as it touches and moves over the patient&#39;s virtual body. We conducted a comprehensive agent-guided robotic ultrasound study with all participants, comparing these visualizations against a standard robotic ultrasound procedure. Results showed significant improvements in patient trust, acceptance, and comfort. Based on these findings, we offer insights into designing future mixed reality visualizations and virtual agents to further enhance patient comfort and acceptance in autonomous medical procedures},

While VR has the capacity to revolutionize many different industries and fields, the recent Covid-19 pandemic has also increased awareness of hygiene and safety associated with VR usage. Despite the growing commercial availability of both VR headsets and preventive and disinfection solutions, confirmatory studies required to validate both the efficacy and safety of the different solutions are severely lacking. This paper presents the findings of a survey aimed at gathering information about current hygiene practices in various domains, along with the perception of research availability. Cleaning methods varied among respondents (n = 42), but most popular methods consisted of several consecutive solutions. Respondents primarily used anti-bacterial or alcohol disinfection wipes (81%), permanent face covers (leather/silicone) (43%), disposable cover/mask (26%), and UVC light disinfection (26%). 65% of the respondents stated that the Covid-19 pandemic made them change their practices. A majority of respondents remarked that there was a scarcity of research, yet, most respondents were fairly or completely confident that their cleaning protocols were sufficient, despite remarking that it was sometimes not adhered to. The efficacy of VR hygiene solutions and practices remains largely understudied despite the urgent need to establish validated and efficacious cleaning protocols and practices. Current solutions and practices primarily focuses on the inside of the headset, although the outside of the headset may be far more exposed to contaminants through e.g., hand-contact. Further research is needed to define and evaluate context-dependent risk-assessments as well as suitable cleaning protocols for VR-headsets},

However, traditional approaches rely on explicit visual annotations, which often compromise visual clarity and increase user cognitive load. To address this issue, we propose an unobtrusive VG technique based on color vibration, a phenomenon in which rapidly alternating colors at frequencies above 25 Hz are perceived as a single intermediate color. Our work explores a perceptual state that exists between complete color fusion and visible flicker, where color differences remain detectable without conscious awareness of vibration. Through two experimental studies, we first identified the thresholds separating complete fusion, this intermediate perceptual state, and visible flicker by systematically varying color vibration parameters. Subsequently, we applied color vibrations with derived thresholds to natural image regions and validated their attention-guiding capabilities using eye-tracking measurements. The results demonstrate that controlled color vibration successfully directs user attention while maintaining low cognitive demand, providing an effective method for implementing unobtrusive VG in VR and AR systems.},

  abstract     = {Hydropower turbines are large-scale equipment essential to sustainable energy supply chains, and engineers have few opportunities to examine their internal structure. Our Immersive Analytics (IA) application is part of a research project that combines and compares simulated water turbine flows and sensor-measured data, looking for data-driven predictions of the lifetime of the mechanical parts of hydroelectric power plants. Our prototype combines spatial and abstract data in an immersive environment in which the user can navigate through a full-scale model of a water turbine, view simulated water flows of three different energy supply conditions, and visualize and interact with sensor-collected data situated at the reference position of the sensors in the actual turbine. In this paper, we detail our design process, which resulted from consultations with domain experts and a literature review, give an overview of our prototype, and present its evaluation, resulting from semi-structured interviews with experts and qualitative thematic analysis. Our findings confirm the current literature that IA applications add value to the presentation and analysis of situated data, as they show that we advance in the design directions for IA applications for domain experts that combine abstract and spatial data, with conclusions on how to avoid skepticism from such professionals.},

Unlike traditional devices, AR systems augment the physical world, requiring interaction techniques that blend seamlessly with real-world behaviors. This study explores the complexities of multimodal interaction with notifications in AR. We investigated user preferences, usability, workload, and performance during a virtual cooking task, where participants managed customer orders while interacting with notifications. Various interaction techniques were tested: Point and Pinch, Gaze and Pinch, Point and Voice, Gaze and Voice, and Touch. Our findings reveal significant impacts on workload, performance, and usability based on the interaction method used.

  abstract     = {The Point-and-Teleport locomotion in VR allows for instantaneous movement and helps minimize motion sickness. However, precise targeting can be difficult when the intended destination is obscured by an obstruction. This work presents Preview Teleport, an enhanced point-and-teleport technique that incorporates a preview window, enabling users to visualize the landing site behind obstructions in a seamless, single-step process. In a study of 28 participants, we investigated how window position, arc type, camera pose — defined as the three critical design aspects of the preview window — affect user performance. Additionally, we explored the impact of environment familiarity, simulated through a see-through effect. Our findings suggest Preview Teleport boosts efficiency, enhances spatial awareness and reduces fatigue, though it slightly compromises accuracy relative to methods without previews. This drop in accuracy is due to Preview Teleport&#39;s use of a preview window for directly targeting distant, obscured areas. In contrast, no-preview methods typically involve users first teleporting to a nearby visible location, then making a final adjustment to the obscured destination, allowing for more precise targeting. Within preview teleport designs, the window attachment to the controller, the camera pose at user-height, and the use of the standard parabolic-arc pointer are recommended. Notably, the rotated-align arc pointer demonstrates superior accuracy in targeting within familiar environments.},

Utilizing a custom-designed airflow system and a physical surfboard mounted on a 6-Degree of Freedom (DoF) motion platform, we present two studies that evaluate the effect of the different feedback modalities. The first study assesses the impact of variable airflow, which dynamically adjusts to the user&#39;s speed (wind speed) in VR, compared to constant airflow conditions, under both active and passive user engagement scenarios. Results demonstrate that variable airflow significantly enhances immersion and reduces cybersickness, particularly when users are actively engaged in the simulation. The second study evaluates the individual and combined effects of vision, motion, and airflow on acceleration perception, user immersion, and cybersickness, revealing that the integration of all feedback modalities yields the most immersive and comfortable VR experience. This study underscores the importance of synchronized multisensory feedback in dynamic VR environments and provides valuable insights for the design of more immersive and realistic virtual simulations, particularly in aquatic, interactive, and motion-intensive scenarios},

  abstract     = {Virtual Reality (VR) technologies offer compelling experiences by allowing users to immerse themselves in simulated environments interacting through avatars. However, despite its ability to evoke emotional responses, and seeing &#39;through the eyes&#39; of the displayed other, it remains unclear to what extent VR actually fosters perspective-taking (PT) or thinking about others&#39; thoughts and feelings. It might be that the common belief that one can “become someone else” through VR is misleading, and that engaging situations through a different viewpoint does not produce a different cognitive standpoint. To test this, we conducted a 2 (perspective, first-person or third-person) by 2 (perspective-taking task or no task) to examine effects on perspective taking, measured via audio-recordings afforded by the think-aloud protocol. Our data demonstrate that while first-person perspective (1PP) facilitates perceived embodiment, it has no appreciable influence on perspective-taking. Regardless of 1PP or third-person perspective (3PP), perspective-taking was substantially and significantly increased when users were given a specific task prompting them to actively consider a character&#39;s perspective. Without such tasks, it seems that participants default to their own viewpoints. These data highlight the need for intentional design in VR experiences to consider content rather than simply viewpoint as key to authentic perspective-taking. To truly harness VR&#39;s potential as an “empathy machine,” developers must integrate targeted perspective-taking tasks or story prompts, ensuring that cognitive engagement is an active component of the experience},

The parameter settings of Magic-Tap were fine-tuned through Study One, ameliorating its trigger rate, error rate, and trigger time. Furthermore, we compared Magic-Tap with three conventional virtual hand selection techniques (Touch, Dwell-Time, and Pinch) in Study Two.

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian splatting has recently achieved remarkable progress in dynamic scene reconstruction. However, there remain two practical challenges: (1) Existing methods typically employ a strict point-wise deformation structure to model dynamic attributes, while neglecting the uncertain motion correlation in local space, leading to inferior adaptability to complex scenes. (2) The inherent low-frequency bias properties of Gaussians often lead to blurring artifacts due to the insufficient high-frequency learning of variable motions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-aware Uncertainty Gaussian Splatting, termed FUGS, for adaptively reconstructing dynamic scenes in the Fourier space. Specifically, we design an Uncertainty-aware Deformation Model (UDM) that explicitly models motion attributes using learnable uncertainty relations with neighboring Gaussian points. Such a paradigm is capable of facilitating temporal and spatial motion correlation learning, thereby enabling flexible Gaussian deformations. Subsequently, a Dynamic Spectrum Regularization (DSR) is developed to perform coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification through low-to-high frequency filtering. By weighting the gradient with frequency distance, the Gaussian attribute is adaptively adjusted according to the scene complexity. Benefiting from the flexible optimization, our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of complex scenes while enjoying real-time rendering. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our FUGS exhibits significant superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

However, in order to support the future development of efficient and usable AR interactions, there is still a lack of systematic knowledge establishing basic interaction performance across different conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we report a user study measuring the impact of objects&#39; physicalization (object&#39;s set composed of (i) virtual, (ii) real, or (iii) a composite mix of real and virtual objects) and hand appearance (hand&#39;s appearance displayed as (i) the real hand, (ii) an avatar, or (iii) dynamically adapting to the surrounding objects&#39; physicalization) on the speed performance of a pick-and-place task. Overall, our results reveal that objects&#39; physicalization plays a significant role in interaction performance, with the more real objects in a set the better the performance. Moreover, our results also suggest that pick-and-place interaction performances are mostly unaffected by the hand appearance. Interestingly, we also observed that interactions with real objects were less efficient as the object condition required the user to alternate between interactions with virtual and real objects (object condition (iii)), which provides novel insights into an important - mostly AR-specific - factor to consider for designing future AR interactions. Taken together, our results provide a rich characterization of different factors influencing different phases of a pick-and-place interaction, which could be employed to improve the design of future AR applications},

However, traditional foveation methods based solely on eccentricity cannot adequately account for the complex behavior of visual attention. This is one of the main reasons that leads to lower perceived quality compared to non-foveated techniques. In this study, we introduce a novel rendering pipeline that incorporates ocular attention through the use of visual saliency. Based on foveation saliency, our approach facilitates the real-time production of high-quality images utilizing path tracing by distributing samples according to saliency metrics derived from geometric and historical data. To further augment image quality, an adaptive filtering process, aligned with the saliency metrics, is employed to reduce visible artifacts in non-foveal regions. Our experiments prove that this novel approach can demonstrate superior performance compared to previous methods, both in terms of quantitative metrics and perceived visual quality.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative work in large virtual environments often requires transitions from loosely-coupled collaboration at different locations to tightly-coupled collaboration at a common meeting point. Inspired by prior work on the continuum between these extremes, we present two novel interaction techniques designed to share spatial context while collaborating over large virtual distances. The first method replicates the familiar setup of a video conference by providing users with a virtual tablet to share video feeds with their peers. The second method called PASCAL (Parallel Avatars in a Shared Collaborative Aura Link) enables users to share their immediate spatial surroundings with others by creating synchronized copies of it at the remote locations of their collaborators. We evaluated both techniques in a within-subject user study, in which 24 participants were tasked with solving a puzzle in groups of two. Our results indicate that the additional contextual information provided by PASCAL had significantly positive effects on task completion time, ease of communication, mutual understanding, and co-presence. As a result, our insights contribute to the repertoire of successful interaction techniques to mediate between loosely- and tightly-coupled work in collaborative virtual environment},

The user interacts with the virtual environment using a handheld stick and receives haptic feedback from a custom $300 table-top encountered-type haptic device (ETHD). Safety is enforced by avoiding that the user makes contact with the ETHD while the ETHD is moving. Effectiveness is achieved by making sure users feel the physical contact at the same time as they see the contact in the virtual world. The haptic feedback strategy was evaluated in a controlled, within-subject user study (N = 26) with two experiments involving static and moving virtual objects. The results show that dynamic redirection of the virtual stick can satisfy simultaneously the competing goals of safety and effectiveness. Dynamic redirection has a significant advantage over no redirection and over static redirection both in terms of objective and subjective metrics.},

Remote Physical Collaborative Extended Reality (RPC-XR) consists in solving augmented physical tasks with the help of remote collaborators. This paper presents our RPC-AR system and a user study evaluating this system during a network hardware assembly task. Our system offers verbal and non-verbal interpersonal communication functionalities. Users embody avatars and interact with their remote collaborators thanks to hand, head and eye tracking, and voice. Our system also captures an environment spatially, in real-time and renders it in a shared virtual space. We designed it to be lightweight and to avoid instrumenting collaborative environments and preliminary steps. It performs capture, transmission and remote rendering of real environments in less than 250ms. We ran a cascading user study to compare our system with a commercial 2D video collaborative application. We measured mutual awareness, task load, usability and task performance. We present an adapted Uncanny Valley questionnaire to compare the perception of remote environments between systems. We found that our application resulted in better empathy between collaborators, a higher cognitive load and a lower level of usability, remaining acceptable, to the remote user. We did not observe any significant difference in performance. These results are encouraging, as participants&#39; observations provide insights to further improve the performance and usability of RPC-AR.},

  abstract     = {The growing availability of affordable Virtual Reality (VR) hardware and the increasing interest in the Metaverse are driving the expansion of Social VR (SVR) platforms. These platforms allow users to embody avatars in immersive social virtual environments, enabling real-time interactions using consumer devices. Beyond merely replicating real-life social dynamics, SVR platforms offer opportunities to surpass real-world constraints by augmenting these interactions. One example of such augmentation is Artificial Facial Mimicry (AFM), which holds significant potential to enhance social experiences. Mimicry, the unconscious imitation of verbal and non-verbal behaviors, has been shown to positively affect human-agent interactions, yet its role in avatar-mediated human-to-human communication remains under-explored. AFM presents various possibilities, such as amplifying emotional expressions, or substituting one emotion for another to better align with the context. Furthermore, AFM can address the limitations of current facial tracking technologies in fully capturing users&#39; emotions. To investigate the potential benefits of AFM in SVR, an automated AM system was developed. This system provides AFM, along with other kinds of head mimicry (nodding and eye contact), and it is compatible with consumer VR devices equipped with facial tracking. This system was deployed within a test-bench immersive SVR application. A between-dyads user study was conducted to assess the potential benefits of AFM for interpersonal communication while maintaining avatar behavioral naturalness, comparing the experiences of pairs of participants communicating with AFM enabled against a baseline condition. Subjective measures revealed that AFM improved interpersonal closeness, aspects of social attraction, interpersonal trust, social presence, and naturalness compared to the baseline condition. These findings demonstrate AFM&#39;s positive impact on key aspects of social interaction and highlight its potential applications across various SVR domains.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies utilized virtual reality (VR) as an “empathy machine” to mitigate bias towards various social groups. However, studies addressing bias against physical disabilities remain scarce, with inconsistent results based on VR experience design. Moreover, most studies assumed the universal effects of VR simulation on bias reduction, ignoring the potential moderating effects of individual characteristics. This study investigated how experience design components and individual characteristics moderate VR simulation&#39;s effect on changes in bias towards physical disabilities. We designed a VR wheelchair experience, manipulating the situational context (negative, neutral) and whole-body avatar visualization (visible, invisible). Participants&#39; implicit and explicit bias levels were assessed to examine the changes according to VR design components and individual characteristics (gender, preexisting bias level). Results indicated that following the VR intervention, implicit bias was reduced in the group with higher preexisting bias but rather increased in the group with lower preexisting bias. In addition, gender interacted with avatar visualization such that male participants&#39; implicit bias was reduced with invisible avatars but increased with visible avatars. Explicit bias, in contrast, was reduced regardless of conditions, suggesting the potential response bias in self-report measures. These findings underscore the importance of considering the complex interplay between experience design and individual characteristics in understanding VR&#39;s efficacy as an empathy-inducing tool. This study provides insights and guidelines for developing more effective VR interventions to alleviate implicit bias towards physical disabilities.},

Different from the existing approaches, AirtypeLogger considers a scenario in which the users are typing a short text fragment with semantic meaning occasionally under the spy of video cameras. It detects and localizes the air-typing events in video streams and proposes the spatial-temporal representation to encode the keystrokes&#39; relative positions and temporal order. Then, high-precision inference can be achieved by applying a Transformer-based network to the spatial and temporal encodings of the keystroke sequences. Finally, according to our extensive real-world experiments, AirtypeLogger can achieve a Character Error Rate (CER) of less than 0.1 as long as 7 air-typing events are observed, which is impossible for previous approaches that require long-term observation of the typing activities online before launching inference attacks.

  abstract     = {Accurate reconstruction of heterogeneous scenes for high-fidelity rendering in an efficient manner remains a crucial but challenging task in many Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive quality in scene rendering with real-time performance. However, for heterogeneous scenes with many weak-textured regions, the original 3DGS can easily produce numerously wrong floaters with unbalanced reconstruction using redundant 3D Gaussians, which often leads to unsatisfied scene rendering. This paper proposes a novel multi-plane Gaussian Splatting (MPGS), which aims to achieve high-fidelity rendering with compact reconstruction for heterogeneous scenes. The key insight of our MPGS is the introduction of a novel multi-plane Gaussian optimization strategy, which effectively adjusts the Gaussian distribution for both rich-textured and weak-textured regions in heterogeneous scenes. Moreover, we further propose a multi-scale geometric correction mechanism to effectively mitigate degradation of the 3D Gaussian distribution for compact scene reconstruction. Besides, we regularize the Gaussian distributions using normal information extracted from the compact scene learning. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPGS achieves much better rendering quality compared to previous methods, while using less storage and offering more efficient rendering. To our best knowledge, MPGS is a new state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian splatting method for compact reconstruction of heterogeneous scenes, enabling high-fidelity rendering in novel view synthesis, especially improving rendering quality for weak-textured regions. The code will be released at https://github.com/wanglids/MPGS.},

To investigate the interaction between geometric shapes and texture features in visual perception, we establish a comprehensive mesh saliency dataset, capturing saliency distributions for identical 3D models under both non-textured and textured conditions. Additionally, we propose a unified saliency prediction model applicable to various mesh types, providing valuable insights for both detailed modeling and realistic rendering applications. This model effectively analyzes the geometric structure of the mesh while seamlessly incorporating texture features into the topological framework, ensuring coherence throughout appearance-enhanced modeling. Through extensive theoretical and empirical validation, our approach not only enhances performance across different mesh types, but also demonstrates the model&#39;s scalability and generalizability, particularly through cross-validation of various visual features.},

To address this issue, we propose PaRUS, a VR shopping approach that focuses on the context between products and their real usage scenexns. PaRUS begins by rebuilding the virtual scenario of the products&#39; real usage scene through a new semantic scene reconstruction pipeline (manual operation needed), which preserves both the structured scene and textured object models in the scene. Afterwards, intuitive visualization of how the selected products fit the reconstructed virtual scene is provided.

However, the current implementation of co-embodiment learning necessitates the real-time participation of instructors proficient in both virtual reality and co-embodiment, which poses challenges for its widespread adoption. To address this limitation, this study proposed a method for developing instructors trained on human motor data to effectively support motor skill learning through co-embodiment. The AI model was trained using supervised learning on data obtained from human motor learning sessions that employed co-embodiment. To evaluate the performance of the AI instructor, we compared the learning performance in co-embodiment learning with that of the AI instructor, recorded human instructor data, and a human instructor as well as in solo learning. The results showed that practicing with the AI instructor significantly improved learning efficiency compared with practicing alone or with recorded data and was comparable to that achieved by practicing with a human instructor.},

We have developed a lightweight tracking framework that enables real-time pupil region localization and tracking on mobile devices. To effectively leverage the sparse nature of event-streams, we introduce the sparse event-patch representation and the corresponding sparse event patches transformer as key components to reduce computational time. Implemented on Jetson Orin Nano, a low-cost, small-sized mobile device with hybrid GPU and CPU components capable of parallel processing of multiple deep neural networks, EX-Gaze maximizes the computation power of Jetson Orin Nano through sophisticated computation scheduling and offloading between GPUs and CPUs. This enables EX-Gaze to achieve real-time tracking at 2KHz without accumulating latency. Evaluation on public datasets demonstrates that EX-Gaze outperforms other event-based eye tracking methods by striking the best balance between accuracy and efficiency on mobile devices. These results highlight EX-Gaze&#39;s potential as a groundbreaking technology to support XR applications that require high-frequency and real-time eye tracking.

  abstract     = {Integrating biofeedback technology, such as real-time eye-tracking, has revolutionized the landscape of virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation games, offering new opportunities for personalized therapy. Motivated to increase patient focus during rehabilitation, the Focus-Driven Augmented Feedback (FDAF) system was developed to enhance focus and maintain engagement during upper limb VR rehabilitation. This novel approach dynamically adjusts augmented visual feedback based on a patient&#39;s gaze, creating a personalised rehabilitation experience tailored to individual needs. This research aims to develop and comprehensively evaluate the FDAF system to enhance patient focus and maintain engagement in VR rehabilitation environments. The methodology involved three experimental studies, which tested varying levels of augmented feedback with 71 healthy participants and 17 patients requiring upper limb rehabilitation. The results demonstrated that a 30% augmented level was optimal for healthy participants, while a 20% was most effective for patients, ensuring sustained engagement without inducing discomfort. The research&#39;s findings highlight the potential of eye-tracking technology to dynamically customise feedback in VR rehabilitation, leading to more effective therapy and improved patient outcomes.

  abstract     = {Mitigating cybersickness can improve the usability of virtual reality (VR) and increase its adoption. The most widely used technique, dynamic field-of-view (FOV) restriction, mitigates cybersickness by blacking out the peripheral region of the user&#39;s FOV. However, this approach reduces the visibility of the virtual environment. We propose peripheral teleportation, a novel technique that creates a rest frame (RF) in the user&#39;s peripheral vision using content rendered from the current virtual environment. Specifically, the peripheral region is rendered by a pair of RF cameras whose transforms are updated by the user&#39;s physical motion. We apply alternating teleportations during translations, or snap turns during rotations, to the RF cameras to keep them close to the current viewpoint transformation. Consequently, the optical flow generated by RF cameras matches the user&#39;s physical motion, creating a stable peripheral view. In a between-subjects study (N=90), we compared peripheral teleportation with a traditional black FOV restrictor and an unrestricted control condition. The results showed that peripheral teleportation significantly reduced discomfort and enabled participants to stay immersed in the virtual environment for a longer duration of time. Overall, these findings suggest that peripheral teleportation is a promising technique that VR practitioners may consider adding to their cybersickness mitigation toolset.},

However, the impact of such feedback and the different modalities used to communicate it remain underexplored in immersive virtual environments (IVE). This paper presents a study in which 27 participants were divided into three groups to learn a tool manipulation trajectory in an IVE. Two experimental groups received guidance from an expert using visual and/or haptic augmented feedback, while the control group received no feedback. The results indicate that both experimental groups showed significantly greater improvement in tool trajectory performance than the control group from pre- to post-test, with no significant differences between them. Analysis of their learning curves revealed similar performance improvements in tool trajectory across trials, outperforming the control group. Additionally, the visual-haptic feedback condition was linked to lower task load in three out of six dimensions of the NASA-TLX and a higher perceived interdependence with the expert&#39;s actions. These findings suggest that augmented feedback from an expert enhances the learning of tool manipulation skills. Although adding haptic feedback did not lead to better learning outcomes compared to visual feedback alone, it did enhance the overall user experience.

This study developed and evaluated an innovative ArmVR system that combines VR technology with rehabilitation hardware to improve recovery outcomes for stroke patients. Through comprehensive assessments, including neurofeedback, pressure feedback, and subjective feedback, the results suggest that VR technology has the potential to positively support the recovery of cognitive and motor functions. Different VR environments affect rehabilitation outcomes: forest scenarios aid emotional relaxation, while city scenarios better activate motor centers in stroke patients. The study also identified variations in responses among different user groups. Normal users showed significant changes in cognitive function, whereas stroke patients primarily experienced motor function recovery. These findings suggest that VR-integrated rehabilitation systems possess great potential, and personalized design can further enhance recovery outcomes, meet diverse patient needs, and ultimately improve quality of life.},

  abstract     = {Typing with a keyboard is a common task in content production in the workplace. For simulation purposes in VR environments, it is important for users to perform this task accurately, with minimal performance loss, and without distraction. One common approach is using mid-air typing on virtual keyboards. However, this method presents challenges, particularly due to the lack of haptic feedback and spatial awareness. Various solutions have been suggested in the literature to address these challenges, but several design factors that influence performance, behavior, and user experience still need to be explored. This paper investigates the effects of two types of visual feedback (hover and keypress) and three passive haptic feedback conditions (physical keyboard, physical surface, and a mid-air virtual keyboard with no haptic feedback) and the possible interactions between these factors on typing using the two index fingers in VR. Results show that keypress visual feedback enhanced typing speed and reduced workload, while hover feedback lowered error rates but negatively impacted typing speed. Additionally, using a physical keyboard to provide passive haptic feedback increased the error rate. This increase in the error rate could be attributed to inaccuracies in finger and keyboard tracking, which may have caused a misalignment between the physical and virtual environments. Regarding eye gaze behavior, participants spent more time looking at the keyboard with the keypress visual feedback and when no haptic feedback was provided. Finally, participants rated the physical keyboard as the least usable option.},

Virtual Reality (VR) technology can simultaneously stimulate multiple senses such as visual, auditory, and tactile, providing an immersive experience that enhances cognition and understanding. Therefore, this study collects multimodal data to develop evaluation methods for HCI fatigue and further explores the fatigue-relieving effects of VR technology by comparing it with flat video. Using a modular design, electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data in the resting, fatigue-induced, and recovery states, eye movement data in the resting and fatigue-induced states, as well as subjective scale results after each state were collected from the participants. Preprocessing and statistical analysis are performed through data flow architecture. After fatigue induction, it was found that the degree of activation of brain areas, especially the Theta band of prefrontal cortex, occurred significantly higher, the effective connectivity in the Alpha and Theta bands occurred significantly lower, the subjects&#39; pupil diameters decreased, the blink frequency increased, and subjective questionnaire scores increased, which verified the validity of the multimodal data for assessing HCI fatigue. Analyzing fatigue relief through subgroups, it was found that when using the natural grassland scene with soothing music, both flat video and VR had the ability to alleviate fatigue, which was manifested as a significant decrease in the Alpha band in the LPFC brain area and a decrease in the questionnaire score. Moreover, during the recovery state, it was found that compared to the video group, the VR group had significantly higher activation in the Alpha and Theta bands of the prefrontal cortex, while the video group had significantly higher effective connectivity than the VR group in the Alpha band. This study delved deeply into the multidimensional characterization of fatigue and investigated new scenarios for the use of VR, which can help to promote the use of VR and can be migrated to scenarios that require fatigue management and productivity enhancement.},

However, the quantitative relationship between virtual motion and the airflow perceived as consistent with it has not been fully explored. To address this gap, this study conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1, we carried out a series of cross-modal matching tasks to establish the relationship between the speed of virtual motion and the airflow speed perceived as consistent with it, revealing a strong linear correlation. In Experiment 2, we introduced the concept of an “Airflow Gradient” to simulate the bodily sensation of curvilinear motion and examined the relationship between the radius and angular velocity of the motion and the difference in airflow speed between the left and right sides. The results indicated a linear relationship between the radius and the left-right airflow speed difference, while the angular velocity showed a near-quadratic pattern, similar to the centripetal acceleration formula. Based on these findings, Experiment 3 developed a dynamic airflow scheme and compared it with constant airflow and no-airflow conditions during locomotion tasks in a complex urban environment. The results demonstrated that dynamic airflow, which ensures consistency between visual and bodily vection, further reduces motion sickness, enhances presence, and provides a more natural and consistent virtual motion experience},

However, the complexity of XR environments makes it difficult to accurately extract relevant contextual data and scene/object parameters from an overwhelming volume of XR artifacts. It leads to not only increased costs with pay-per-use models, but also elevated levels of generation errors. Moreover, existing approaches focusing on coding script generation are often prone to generation errors, resulting in flawed or invalid scripts, application crashes, and ultimately a degraded user experience. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LLMER, a novel framework that creates interactive XR worlds using JSON data generated by LLMs. Unlike prior approaches focusing on coding script generation, LLMER translates natural language inputs into JSON data, significantly reducing the likelihood of application crashes and processing latency. It employs a multi-stage strategy to supply only the essential contextual information adapted to the user&#39;s request and features multiple modules designed for various XR tasks. Our preliminary user study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed system, with over 80% reduction in consumed tokens and around 60% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) enables beyond-real interactions (BRI) that transcend physical constraints, offering effective user experiences like extending a hand to grasp distant objects. However, adapting to novel mappings of BRI often reduces performance and the sense of embodiment. To address this, we propose using noisy tendon electrical stimulation (n-TES) to decrease proprioceptive precision. Previous studies have suggested that attenuating proprioceptive precision is crucial for sensory-motor adaptations. Thus, we hypothesize that n-TES, which has been shown to reduce proprioceptive precision and induce visual-dependent perception in VR, can enhance user adaptation to BRI. We conducted a user study using go-go interaction, a BRI technique for interacting with distant objects, to assess the effects of n-TES. Given the individual variability in n-TES response, participants first underwent a proprioceptive precision test to determine the optimal stimulation intensity to lower the proprioceptive precision from 5 levels (σ = 0.25 - 1.25 mA). Reaching tasks using a 2x2 within-participants design evaluated the effects of go-go interaction and n-TES on performance, subjective task load, and embodiment. Results from 24 participants showed that go-go interaction increased reaching time and task load while decreasing the sense of embodiment. Contrary to our hypothesis, n-TES did not significantly mitigate most of these negative effects of go-go interaction, except that perceived agency was higher with n-TES during go-go interaction. The limited effectiveness of n-TES may be due to participants&#39; habituation or sensory adaptation during the tasks. Future research should consider the adaptation process to BRI and investigate different BRI scenarios},

  abstract     = {In the real world, the body typically remains within the downward field of view (FOV) irrespective of whether it is consciously or unconsciously observed. However, with head-mounted displays (HMDs) that have restricted viewing angles, users are unable to see their own avatars directly unless they tilt their heads significantly downward. To overcome this, virtual mirrors are commonly employed in virtual environments (VEs) to provide users with a full-body view of their avatars, which ultimately enhances the viewer&#39;s sense of embodiment (SoE). However, positioning users directly in front of a virtual mirror may restrict their movement and reduce their sense of presence. To overcome this limitation, we developed an HMD with an extended downward field of view (FOV) integrated with eye-tracking. We compared the impact of using virtual mirrors alone versus the extended downward FOV in terms of several parameters, including the head pitch angle, perceived SoE, presence, and task difficulty during a reaching task that involves both hand and foot movements. The results demonstrated that the extended downward FOV offered by the proposed HMD improved the users&#39; sense of agency toward their avatars and enhanced their sense of presence compared to when only virtual mirrors are used. In addition, the participants tended to use the virtual mirror for hand movements and relied on the extended downward FOV for foot movements, often maintaining a stable head angle. Both the virtual mirror and extended downward FOV facilitated easier and faster completion of a reaching task while encouraging an upward head angle. However, the combined use of virtual mirrors and extended downward FOV did not have a significant impact on the SoE or presence. Notably, the extended downward FOV alone, without the integration of the virtual mirror, was more effective in increasing both SoE and presence.},

However, few studies directly compared immersive and non-immersive environments. To address this limitation, we developed Abacus, a programming environment that can run in both immersive and non-immersive modes. We conducted a between-subjects study (n=40), with twenty participants assigned to the desktop mode and twenty participants assigned to the VR mode. Participants used a block-based editor to complete two programming tasks: a non-spatial procedural task, and a spatial 3D math task. We found that VR led to higher gains in self-efficacy and that the gain was significant for participants with lower initial levels of experience and spatial skills.},

  abstract     = {Achieving immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences typically requires extensive computational resources to ensure highdefinition visuals, high frame rates, and low latency in stereoscopic rendering. This challenge is particularly pronounced for lower-tier and standalone VR devices with limited processing power. To accelerate rendering, existing supersampling and image reprojection techniques have shown significant potential, yet to date, no previous work has explored their combination to minimize stereo rendering overhead. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight supersampling framework that integrates image projection with spatio-temporal supersampling to accelerate stereo rendering. Our approach effectively leverages the temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in stereo videos, enabling rapid image generation for unshaded viewpoints and providing resolution-enhanced and anti-aliased images for binocular viewpoints. We first blend a rendered low-resolution (LR) frame with accumulated temporal samples to construct an high-resolution (HR) frame. This HR frame is then reprojected to the other viewpoint to directly synthesize a new image. To address disocclusions in reprojected images, we utilize accumulated history data and low-pass filtering for filling, ensuring high-quality results with minimal delay. Extensive evaluations on both the PC and the standalone device confirm that our framework requires short runtime to generate high-fidelity images, making it an effective solution for stereo rendering across various VR platforms.},

However, current XR devices differ in sensor coverage of the face region. Hence, a faithful reconstruction of facial expressions either has to exclude these areas or synthesize missing animation data with model-based approaches, potentially leading to perceivable mismatches between executed and perceived expression. This paper investigates potential effects of the coverage of facial animations (none, partial, or whole) on important factors of self-perception. We exposed 83 participants to their mirrored personalized avatar. They were shown their mirrored avatar face with upper and lower face animation, upper face animation only, lower face animation only, or no face animation. Whole animations were rated higher in virtual embodiment and slightly lower in uncanniness. Missing animations did not differ from partial ones in terms of virtual embodiment. Contrasts showed significantly lower humanness, lower eeriness, and lower attractiveness for the partial conditions. For questions related to self-identification, effects were mixed. We discuss participants&#39; shift in body part attention across conditions. Qualitative results show participants perceived their virtual representation as fascinating yet uncanny.},

However, most existing approaches can not perform novel view rendering and require large storage capacities for maps. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient visual localization method capable of high-quality rendering with fewer parameters. Specifically, our approach leverages 3D Gaussian primitives as the scene representation. To ensure precise 2D-3D correspondences for pose estimation, we develop an unbiased 3D scene-specific descriptor decoder for Gaussian primitives, distilled from a constructed feature volume. Additionally, we introduce a salient 3D landmark selection algorithm that selects a suitable primitive subset based on the saliency score for localization. We further regularize key Gaussian primitives to prevent anisotropic effects, which also improves localization performance. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior or comparable rendering and localization performance to state-of-the-art implicit-based visual localization approaches.

Research suggests that gender differences exist in XR environments including women having a lower sense of subjective presence and being more susceptible to motion sickness. However, the underrepresentation of women both as participants and researchers could lead to potential design biases, impacting the accuracy and inclusivity of XR systems. This work investigates subtle design differences in virtual environments on women&#39;s performance on a cognitive test. Non-male participants (n = 40) completed the Stroop Interference Task in two virtual classroom environments: a neutral and a stereotypically STEM environment. The environments were altered by four wall posters depicting positive gender-neutral and nature posters to science-fiction and positive male figures, such as Albert Einstein. Results support that when participants were in the stereotypical environment they were more distracted and responded more slowly and less accurately than when they were in the neutral environment. Additionally, positive female self-avatars buffered participants from the negative impacts of the stereotypical environment. These results highlight the need for more inclusive research practices. Minor adjustments can significantly improve or harm women&#39;s engagement and performance in XR settings. We emphasize the importance of bias awareness in study design, and recommend that researchers consider how their experiments could impact participants of all demographics, in order to enhance inclusivity and non-biased results.},

One method to accomplish this is through self-representation with embodied personalized avatars or video self-avatars.

We therefore present in this paper an alternative approach: video Pass-Through Embodiment (PTE), which utilizes the per-eye real-time depth map from Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) traditionally used for Augmented Reality features. This method allows the user&#39;s real body to be cut out of the pass-through video stream and be represented in the VR environment without the need for additional hardware. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a between-subjects study involving 40 participants who completed a seated object sorting task using either PTE or a customized avatar. The results show that PTE, despite its limited depth resolution that leads to some visual artifacts, significantly enhances the user&#39;s sense of presence and embodiment. In addition, PTE does not negatively affect task performance, cognitive load, or cause VR sickness. These findings imply that video pass-through embodiment offers a practical and efficient alternative to traditional avatar-based methods in VR.},

The technique also features a contextual record to maintain conversation continuity. We evaluated Whisper through a comparative user study (N = 24) in party and classroom scenarios.

Participants were tasked with transitioning virtual bricks from 3D space onto the screen, then using the mouse to make fine adjustments, such as choosing the colour of the brick and placing decorations, to then transition them back into 3D space to build with.

Immersive virtual reality (VR) displays can further enhance the understanding of complex anatomies. Going beyond the diagnostic quality of traditional 2D slices, they enable interactive 3D evaluation of anatomies, supporting medical education and planning. Rendering high-quality visualizations in real-time, however, is computationally intensive and impractical for compute-constrained devices like mobile headsets. We propose a novel approach utilizing Gaussian Splatting (GS) to create an efficient but static intermediate representation of CT scans. We introduce a layered GS representation, incrementally including different anatomical structures while minimizing overlap and extending the GS training to remove inactive Gaussians. We further compress the created model with clustering across layers. Our approach achieves interactive frame rates while preserving anatomical structures, with quality adjustable to the target hardware. Compared to standard GS, our representation retains some of the explorative qualities initially enabled by immersive path tracing. Selective activation and clipping of layers are possible at rendering time, adding a degree of interactivity to otherwise static GS models. This could enable scenarios where high computational demands would otherwise prohibit using path-traced medical volumes.},

  abstract     = {When walking, our head does not travel on a straight path but oscillates in a swaying pattern. This pattern has been implemented in Virtual Reality (VR) as “viewpoint oscillations” - which can be defined as periodic changes in position and/or orientation of the point of view to enhance walking simulations and make them feel closer to real walking. Viewpoint oscillations are especially beneficial when users cannot physically walk because of limitations of space or hardware, disability, or to avoid fatigue. In this paper, we provide new experimental work on the effects of viewpoint oscillations on walking sensation, as well as cybersickness and virtual embodiment, since such results are scarce in immersive VR, especially when using an avatar in first-person view. To do so, we also propose a technical improvement of viewpoint oscillations in embodied VR. Our technique makes use of an HMD-embedded gaze tracker to artificially add rotations that stabilize the target of the gaze in the users&#39; field of view. We conducted a user study on 24 participants, which showed that our implementation of viewpoint oscillations successfully increased walking sensation and did not impact cybersickness or agency, compared to a linear motion without oscillations. In addition, a novel positive effect of stabilized viewpoint oscillations was found on virtual body ownership. As such, this study demonstrates the feasibility and viability of implementing gaze tracking-based stabilization with standard commercial HMDs, and, taken together, our results promote the use of viewpoint oscillations during walking simulations in embodied VR with an HMD.},

  abstract     = {Music Performance Anxiety (MPA) is highly prevalent among musicians and often debilitating, associated with changes in cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological responses to performance situations. Efforts have been made to create simulated performance environments in conservatoires and Virtual Reality (VR) to assess their effectiveness in managing MPA. Despite these advances, results have been mixed, underscoring the need for controlled experimental designs and joint analyses of performance, physiology, and subjective ratings in these settings. Furthermore, the broader application of simulated performance environments for at-home use and laboratory studies on MPA remains limited. We designed VR scenarios to induce MPA in pianists and embedded them within a controlled within-subject experimental design to systematically assess their effects on performance, physiology, and anxiety ratings. Twenty pianists completed a performance task under two conditions: a public ‘Audition’ and a private ‘Studio’ rehearsal. Participants experienced VR pre-performance settings before transitioning to live piano performances in the real world. We measured subjective anxiety, performance (MIDI data), and heart rate variability (HRV). Compared to the Studio condition, pianists in the Audition condition reported higher somatic anxiety ratings and demonstrated an increase in performance accuracy over time, with a reduced error rate. Additionally, their performances were faster and featured increased note intensity. No concurrent changes in HRV were observed. These results validate the potential of VR to induce MPA, enhancing pitch accuracy and invigorating tempo and dynamics. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach to develop VR-based interventions to mitigate the debilitating effects of MPA.},

  abstract     = {We present Explainable XR, an end-to-end framework for analyzing user behavior in diverse eXtended Reality (XR) environments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data interpretation assistance. Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality – AR, VR, MR – transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users&#39; multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts&#39; perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.},

  abstract     = {Real camera footage is subject to noise, motion blur (MB) and depth of field (DoF). In some applications these might be considered distortions to be removed, but in others it is important to model them because it would be ineffective, or interfere with an aesthetic choice, to simply remove them. In augmented reality applications where virtual content is composed into a live video feed, we can model noise, MB and DoF to make the virtual content visually consistent with the video. Existing methods for this typically suffer two main limitations. First, they require a camera calibration step to relate a known calibration target to the specific cameras response. Second, existing work require methods that can be (differentiably) tuned to the calibration, such as slow and specialized neural networks. We propose a method which estimates parameters for noise, MB and DoF instantly, which allows using off-the-shelf real-time simulation methods from e.g., a game engine in compositing augmented content. Our main idea is to unlock both features by showing how to use modern computer vision methods that can remove noise, MB and DoF from the video stream, essentially providing self-calibration. This allows to auto-tune any black-box real-time noise+MB+DoF method to deliver fast and high-fidelity augmentation consistency.},

However, creating AR services for specific environments such as homes, factories, or buildings remains challenging for users without development skills, as it involves complex 3D editors and advanced coding workflows This paper presents a comparative study of three distinct tools, dedicated to such novice users, for prototyping augmented reality AR services. These tools include desktop, Virtual Reality (VR), and AR editors, focusing on the positioning of AR assets. In a between-subjects design experiment, where each user tested only one editor, we used two scenarios (smart-home and smart-building) to assess performance, usability, induced workload, and global user experience for each tool. Additionally, the two scenarios allowed us to examine the impact of the target environment size on the results, with a fivefold difference between the sizes of the two environments tested. Our observations indicate that the AR and VR tools outperformed the desktop editor in several criteria, such as task completion duration, usability and enjoyment, suggesting they not only provide a viable alternative to desktop editors for novice users but could also be prioritized. The differences induced by the scenario and environment size were minimal, suggesting their low impact. Future studies should explore this further with larger differences in environment size},

  abstract     = {Drawing on social influence and behavioral intention theories, coworkers&#39; risk-taking serves as an “extra motive”—an exogenous factor—for risk-taking behaviors among workers in the workplace. Social influence theories have shown that social factors, such as social pressure and coworker risk-taking, may predict risk-taking behaviors and significantly affect decision-making. While immersive technologies have been widely used to create close-to-real simulations for construction safety-related studies, there is a paucity of research considering the impact of social presence in evaluating workers&#39; risk decision-making within immersive environments. To bridge this gap, this study developed a state-of-the-art Augmented Virtuality (AV) environment to investigate roofers&#39; risk-taking behaviors when exposed to social stressors (working alongside a safe/unsafe peer). In this augmented virtuality environment, a virtual peer with safe and unsafe behaviors was simulated in order to impose peer pressure and increase participants&#39; sense of social presence. Participants were asked to install asphalt shingles on a physical section of a roof (passive haptics) while the rest of the environment was projected virtually. During shingle installation, participants&#39; cognitive and behavioral responses were captured using psychophysiological wearable technologies and self-report measures. The results demonstrated that the developed AV model could successfully enhance participants&#39; sense of presence and social presence while serving as an appropriate platform for assessing individuals&#39; decision-making orientations and behavioral changes in the presence of social stressors. Such information shows the value of immersive technologies to examine the naturalistic responses of individuals without exposing them to actual risks},

  abstract     = {Mixed Reality (MR) systems enable users to perform augmented superpowers that transcend real-world limitations. However, it remains unclear what types of action-outcome mappings can enable users to easily learn, control, and feel a sense of ownership of these augmented superpowers. Humans develop a set of sensorimotor regularities (i.e., image schemas and lawful relations between them) from recurring bodily experiences since early infancy, and use them to predict the outcome of our actions, or choose actions based on the desired outcome. We investigate whether sensorimotor regularities (SRs) can serve as effective design constraints for superpower interactions, by comparing three temporal manipulation methods in MR games: (1) mid-air button control; (2) gestures incongruent with SRs embedded in the concept of temporal manipulation; and (3) gestures congruent with these SRs. A within-subject study with 18 participants reveals that the SRs-congruent method enables significantly improved task performance, lower overall workload, and a greater sense of agency and presence compared to both an SRs-incongruent method and a mid-air button-based method. The SRs-congruent method also enabled faster mastery of the augmented superpower. No significant difference was observed in any of the above-mentioned metrics between the SRs-incongruent and mid-air button-based methods. These results empirically demonstrate multiple benefits of SRs as design constraints for superpower controls in MR, and encourage future research to explore their wider applicability in superpower interaction design.},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) has increasingly become a popular platform for socializing and collaborating remotely because it enables both verbal and nonverbal aspects of communication through the use of embodied avatars. However, such avatars are not typically adjusted to match the proportions of the user, leading to inaccuracies which might diminish experiences involving nonverbal communication. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated the impact that out-of-proportion avatar hands (relative to the user&#39;s hands) have on nonverbal communication and collaboration in VR. We designed an experiment based on the game “charades&quot;, wherein two users nonverbally interact with each other trying to communicate and guess words. In a within-subjects study with 72 participants (36 dyads), participants&#39; avatar hands were scaled to be 25% smaller, the same size, and 25% larger than their own hands. We measured aspects related to task performance, avatar embodiment, communication satisfaction, workload, and user experience. We found that changes in hand size of 25% did not significantly impact any of our measurements when looking at all participants. Interestingly, despite the relatively obvious change in size, less than half of the participants noticed this change. On further inspection, we uncovered significant effects in two of our workload measures when focusing only on the participants who noticed the changes. We conclude that the effects of changes in hand size may be modest for the type of task and hand size manipulations investigated in this work},

  abstract     = {Achieving a high level of immersion and adaptation in virtual reality (VR) requires precise measurement and representation of user state. While extrinsic physical characteristics such as locomotion and pose can be accurately tracked in real-time, reliably capturing mental states is more challenging. Quantitative psychology allows considering more intrinsic features like emotion, attention, or cognitive load. Time perception, in particular, is strongly tied to users&#39; mental states, including stress, focus, and boredom. However, research on objectively measuring the pace at which we perceive the passage of time is scarce. In this work, we investigate the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) as an objective measure of time perception in VR, exploring neural correlates with oscillatory responses and time-frequency analysis. To this end, we implemented a variety of time perception modulators in VR, collected EEG recordings, and labeled them with overestimation, correct estimation, and underestimation time perception states. We found clear EEG spectral signatures for these three states, that are persistent across individuals, modulators, and modulation duration. These signatures can be integrated and applied to monitor and actively influence time perception in VR, allowing the virtual environment to be purposefully adapted to the individual to increase immersion further and improve user experience.

We have designed and evaluated three types of negotiated teleportation techniques: Sector technique for directional control, Distance technique for minimum social distance control, and Area technique for defining circular permissible teleportation areas. These techniques foster a collaborative approach to selecting teleportation points that respect personal space. To evaluate the efficacy of these techniques, we conducted a user study with 20 participants who performed social tasks within a virtual campus environment.

In the context of motor learning and rehabilitation, observing replays of movements has been shown to enhance motor function. The application of hand redirection to these replays by making movements appear larger or smaller than they actually are has the potential to improve motor function. However, the detection threshold for hand redirection, specifically in the context of motion replays, remains unclear, as it has primarily been studied in real-time feedback settings. This study aims to determine the threshold at which hand redirection during post-exercise replay sessions becomes detectable. We conducted two psychophysical experiments to evaluate how much discrepancy between replayed and actual movements can go unnoticed by users, both with hand redirection (N=20) and without (N=18). Our findings reveal a tendency for the amount of movement during replay to be underestimated. Furthermore, compared to conventional real-time hand redirection without replay, replay manipulations involving redirection applied during the preceding reaching task resulted in a significantly larger JND. These insights are crucial for leveraging hand redirection techniques in replay-based motor learning applications.},

Various visual reset user interfaces (UIs) have been proposed to help users perform the correct reset direction according to the improved resetter, but their effectiveness has not been sufficiently verified. In addition, expert interviews conducted to identify the problems in the current reset process revealed that users sometimes fail to recognize the visual reset UI in time. Therefore, we propose a novel visual reset UI using Gauge, which is expected to provide users with an effective and high-quality experience. In Study 1, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gauge UI by comparing it to existing UIs (Direction, End Point, and Arrow Alignment).

  abstract     = {The integration of immersive Virtual Reality (I-VR) technology in education has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing learning experiences. There is a handful of research done to study the impact of I-VR on learning outcomes, comparison of learning using I-VR and other traditional learning methods, and the impact of values such as haptic sensation, and verbal and non-verbal cues on the learning outcomes. However, there is a dearth of research on understanding how learning is happening from the perspective of the behavior of the learners in the Virtual Reality Learning Environment (VRLE). To address this gap, we developed an Interaction Behavioral Data (IBD) logging mechanism to log all the interaction traces that constitute the behavior of the learners in a Virtual Reality Learning Environment (VRLE). We deployed the IBD logging mechanism in a VRLE used to learn electromagnetic induction concepts and conducted a study with 30 undergraduate computer science students. We extract the learners&#39; actions from the logged data and contextualize them based on the action features such as duration (Long and Short), and frequency of occurrence (First and Repeated occurrence). In this paper, we investigate the actions extracted from logged interaction trace data to understand the behaviors that lead to high and low performance in the VRLE. Using Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), we identify differences in prominent actions and co-occurring actions between high and low performers. Additionally, we apply Differential Sequence Mining (DSM) to uncover significant action patterns, involving multiple actions, that are differentially frequent between these two groups. Our findings demonstrate that high performers engage in structured, iterative patterns of experimentation and evaluation, while low performers exhibit less focused exploration patterns. The insights gained from ENA and DSM highlight the behavioral variations between high and low performers in the VRLE, providing valuable information for enhancing learning experiences in VRLEs. These insights gained can be further utilized by the VR content developers to o develop adaptive VR learning content by providing personalized scaffolding leading to the enhancement in the learning process via I-VR},

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly recognized as a powerful educational platform, but the novelty effect–where users experience heightened engagement during initial interactions with new technology–can interfere with learning outcomes. This study investigates how the novelty effect influences learning using a three-wave longitudinal design, tracking changes in information recall and exploratory behavior over three weeks. Our findings reveal that while initial novelty impedes learning, learners&#39; ability to encode educational content improves as they become more familiar with the virtual environment. Additionally, sustained exploratory behavior positively impacts learning over time, reinforcing the importance of active engagement in VR-based education. This study enhances the understanding of VR&#39;s long-term educational impact and provides guidance for improving learning effectiveness in immersive learning environments.},

  abstract     = {Virtual environments (VEs) are pivotal for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality systems. Despite advances in 3D generation and reconstruction, the direct creation of 3D objects within an established 3D scene (represented as NeRF) for novel VE creation remains a relatively unexplored domain. This process is complex, requiring not only the generation of high-quality 3D objects but also their seamless integration into the existing scene. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline featuring an intuitive interface, dubbed GO-NeRF. Our approach takes text prompts and user-specified regions as inputs and leverages the scene context to generate 3D objects within the scene. We employ a compositional rendering formulation that effectively integrates the generated 3D objects into the scene, utilizing optimized 3D-aware opacity maps to avoid unintended modifications to the original scene. Furthermore, we develop tailored optimization objectives and training strategies to enhance the model&#39;s ability to capture scene context and mitigate artifacts, such as floaters, that may occur while optimizing 3D objects within the scene. Extensive experiments conducted on both forward-facing and 360o scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in generating objects that harmonize with surrounding scenes and synthesizing high-quality novel view images.},

  abstract     = {Change detection (CD) is critical in everyday tasks. While current algorithmic approaches for CD are improving, they remain imprecise, often requiring human intervention. Cognitive science research focuses on understanding CD mechanisms, especially through change blindness studies. However, these do not address the primary requirement in real-life CD — detecting changes as effectively as possible. Such a requirement is directly relevant to the visual comparison field — studying visualisation techniques to compare data and identify differences or changes effectively. Recent studies have used Virtual Reality (VR) to improve visual comparison by providing an immersive platform where users can interact with 3D data at a real-life scale, enhancing spatial reasoning. We believe VR could also improve CD performance accordingly. Particularly, VR offers stereoscopic depth perception over traditional displays, potentially enhancing the detection of spatial change. In this paper, we develop and analyse three 3D visual comparison techniques for CD in VR: Sliding Window, 3D Slider, and Switch Back. These techniques are evaluated under synthetic but realistic environments and frequently occurring Perceptual Challenges, including different Changed Object Size, Lighting Variation, and Scene Drift conditions. Experimental results reveal significant differences between the techniques in detection time measures and subjective user experience.},

We pinpoint the challenges of scale control in settings with multiple LoS and evaluate how distinct designs of scaling techniques influence navigation performance and usability. Through a user study, we investigated two pivotal elements of a scaling technique: the input method and the scaling center. Our findings indicate that our scroll-based input method significantly reduces task completion time and error rate and enhances efficiency compared to the most frequently used bi-manual method. Moreover, we found that the choice of scaling center affects the ease of use of the scaling method, especially when paired with specific input methods.},

  abstract     = {As VR technology advances, the demand for multitasking within virtual environments escalates. Negotiating multiple tasks within the immersive virtual setting presents cognitive challenges, where users experience difficulty executing multiple concurrent tasks. This phenomenon highlights the importance of cognitive functions like attention and working memory, which are vital for navigating intricate virtual environments effectively. In addition to attention and working memory, assessing the extent of physical and mental strain induced by the virtual environment and the concurrent tasks performed by the participant is key. While previous research has focused on investigating factors influencing attention and working memory in virtual reality, more comprehensive approaches addressing the prediction of physical and mental strain alongside these cognitive aspects remain. This gap inspired our investigation, where we utilized an open dataset - VRWalking, which included eye and head tracking and physiological measures like heart rate(HR) and galvanic skin response(GSR). The VRwalking dataset has timestamped labeled data for physical and mental load, working memory, and attention metrics. In our investigation, we employed straightforward deep learning models to predict these labels, achieving noteworthy performance with 91%, 96%, 93%, and 91% accuracy in predicting physical load, mental load, working memory, and attention, respectively. Additionally, we conducted SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to identify the most critical features driving these predictions. Our findings contribute to understanding the overall cognitive state of a participant and effective data collection practices for future researchers, as well as provide insights for virtual reality developers. Developers can utilize these predictive approaches to adaptively optimize user experience in real-time and minimize cognitive strain, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness and usability of virtual reality applications.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging real-time eye tracking, foveated rendering optimizes hardware efficiency and enhances visual quality virtual reality (VR). This approach leverages eye-tracking techniques to determine where the user is looking, allowing the system to render high-resolution graphics only in the foveal region—the small area of the retina where visual acuity is highest, while the peripheral view is rendered at lower resolution. However, modern deep learning-based gaze-tracking solutions often exhibit a long-tail distribution of tracking errors, which can degrade user experience and reduce the benefits of foveated rendering by causing misalignment and decreased visual quality. This paper introduces FovealNet, an advanced AI-driven gaze tracking framework designed to optimize system performance by strategically enhancing gaze tracking accuracy. To further reduce the implementation cost of the gaze tracking algorithm, FovealNet employs an event-based cropping method that eliminates over 64.8% of irrelevant pixels from the input image. Additionally, it incorporates a simple yet effective token-pruning strategy that dynamically removes tokens on the fly without compromising tracking accuracy. Finally, to support different runtime rendering configurations, we propose a system performance-aware multi-resolution training strategy, allowing the gaze tracking DNN to adapt and optimize overall system performance more effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that FovealNet achieves at least 1.42× speed up compared to previous methods and 13% increase in perceptual quality for foveated output.

We propose the SummonBrush technique to facilitate easy access to hidden windows while interacting with large XR user interfaces, requiring minimal arm movements. The SummonBrush technique adds a virtual brush to the index fingertip of a user&#39;s hand. Upon making contact with a virtual user interface, the brush bends and diverges and ink starts to diffuse in it. The more the brush bends and diverges, the more the ink diffuses. The user can summon hidden windows or background applications in situ, which is achieved by firstly pressing the brush against the user interface to make ink fully fill the brush and then perform swipe gestures. Also, the user can press the brush against the thumbtails of background applications in situ to quickly cycle them through. Ecological studies showed that SummonBrush significantly reduced the arm movement time by 39% and 34% in summoning hidden windows and activating/closing background applications, respectively, leading to a significant decrease in reported physical demand.},

Additionally, some techniques speed up selection by changing the user&#39;s perspective or modifying the scene context, which may complicate interactions when users plan to resume or manipulate the scene afterward. To address these challenges, we present FocalSelect, a heuristic selection technique that builds 3D disambiguation through head-hand coordination and scoring-based functions. Our interaction design adheres to the principle that the intended selection range is a small sector of the headset&#39;s viewing frustum, allowing optimal targets to be identified within this scope. We also introduce a density-aware adjustable occlusion plane for effective depth culling of rendered objects. Two experiments are conducted to assess the adaptability of FocalSelect across different input modalities and its performance against five selection techniques. The results indicate that FocalSelect enhances selection experiences in occluded and remote scenarios while preserving the spatial context among objects. This preservation helps maintain users&#39; understanding of the original scene and facilitates further manipulation. We also explore potential applications and enhancements to demonstrate more practical implementations of FocalSelect.},

  abstract     = {With the development of eXtended Reality (XR), photo capturing and display technology based on head-mounted displays (HMDs) have experienced significant advancements and gained considerable attention. Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. The assessment for the Quality of Experience (QoE) of XR content is important to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images and the corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) under three display modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Based on our ESIQAD, we propose a novel mamba2-based multi-stage feature fusion model, termed ESIQAnet, which predicts the perceptual quality of egocentric spatial images under the three display modes. Specifically, we first extract features from multiple visual state space duality (VSSD) blocks, then apply cross attention to fuse binocular view information and use transposed attention to further refine the features. The multi-stage features are finally concatenated and fed into a quality regression network to predict the quality score. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ESIQAnet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art IQA models on the ESIQAD under all three display modes. The database and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.},

  abstract     = {The real-time generation of editable mesh animations in XR applications has been a focal point of research in the XR field. However, easily controlling the generated editable meshes remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often suffer from slow generation speeds and suboptimal results, failing to accurately simulate target objects&#39; complex details and shapes, which does not meet user expectations. Additionally, the final generated meshes typically require manual user adjustments, and it is difficult to generate multiple target models simultaneously. To overcome these limitations, a universal control scheme for particles based on the sampling features of the target is proposed. It introduces a spatially adaptive control algorithm for particle coupling by adjusting the magnitude of control forces based on the spatial features of model sampling, thereby eliminating the need for parameter dependency and enabling the control of multiple types of models within the same scene. We further introduce boundary correction techniques to improve the precision in generating target shapes while reducing particle splashing. Moreover, a distance-adaptive particle fragmentation mechanism prevents unnecessary particle accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the method has better performance in controlling complex structures and generating multiple targets at the same time compared to existing methods. It enhances control accuracy for complex structures and targets under the condition of sparse model sampling. It also consistently delivers outstanding results while maintaining high stability and efficiency. Ultimately, we were able to create a set of smooth editable meshes and developed a solution for integrating this algorithm into VR and AR animation applications.},

Zaltman&#39;s Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) leverages metaphors and non-verbal communication to uncover and gain deeper insights into consumers&#39; thoughts and emotions. This paper introduces a novel system that enables consumer researchers (interviewers) to perform a modified version of metaphor elicitation interviews in virtual reality (VR). Consumers (participants) use 3D objects in the virtual environment to express their thoughts and emotions, instead of pictures conventionally used in a ZMET interview. The system features an asymmetric setup where the participant is immersed in VR using a head-mounted display (HMD), while the interviewer views the participant&#39;s perspective on a monitor. We discuss the technical and design aspects of the VR system and present the results of a user study (N = 17) that we conducted to validate the effectiveness of performing the metaphor elicitation interviews in VR. This work also explores the experiences of both participants and interviewers during the interview sessions, aiming to identify potential improvements.

While harassment remained common-including hate speech, virtual stalking, and physical harassment-many find safety features insufficient or inconsistently applied. Reactive tools like muting and blocking are widely used, largely driven by users&#39; familiarity from other platforms. Safety tools are also used to proactively curate individual virtual experiences, protecting users from harassment, but inadvertently leading to fragmented social spaces.

We compare the visual saliency maps generated from this dataset with those from a prior task-dependent experiment (focused on quality assessment) to explore how high-level tasks influence human visual attention. To measure the similarity between these visual saliency maps, we apply the well-known Pearson correlation coefficient and an adapted version of the Earth Mover&#39;s Distance metric, which takes into account both spatial information and the degrees of saliency. Our experimental results provide both qualitative and quantitative insights, revealing significant differences in visual attention due to task influence.

While numerous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon&#39;s reliability, its underlying processes remain poorly understood. This work investigates deindividuation&#39;s hypothesized but unproven role within the Proteus effect. Deindividuated individuals tend to follow situational norms rather than personal ones. Therefore, together with high embodiment and identification processes, deindividuation may lead to a stronger Proteus effect. We present two experimental studies. First, we demonstrated the emergence of the Proteus effect in a real-world academic context: engineering students got better scores in a statistical task when embodying Albert Einstein&#39;s avatar compared to a control one. In the second study, we tested the role of deindividuation by manipulating participants&#39; exposure to different identity cues during the task. While we could not find a significant effect of deindividuation on the participants&#39; performance, our results highlight an unexpected pattern, with embodiment as a negative predictor and identification as a positive predictor of performance. These results open avenues for further research on the processes involved in the Proteus effect, particularly those focused on the relation between the avatar and the nature of the task to be performed.

  abstract     = {One of the pleasures of interacting using avatars in VR is being able to play a character very different to yourself. As the scale of characters change relative to a user, there is a need to retarget user motions onto the character, generally maintaining either the user&#39;s pose or the position of their wrists and ankles. This retargeting can impact both the functional and social information conveyed by the avatar. Focused on 3rd-person (observed) avatars, this paper presents three studies on these varied aspects of communication. It establishes a baseline for near-field avatar pointing, showing an accuracy of about 5cm. This can be maintained using positional hand constraints, but increases if the user&#39;s pose is directly transferred to the character. It is possible to maintain this accuracy with a Semantic Inverse Kinematics formulation that brings the avatar closer to the user&#39;s actual pose, but compensates by adjusting the finger pointing direction. Similar results are shown for conveying spatial information, namely object size. The choice of pose or position based retargeting leads to a small change in the perception of avatar personality, indicating an impact on social communication. This effect was not observed in a task where the users&#39; cognitive load was otherwise high, so may be task dependent. It could also become more pronounced for more extreme proportion changes.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies introduced an avatar body control sharing system known as “virtual co-embodiment,” where control over bodily movements and external events, or agency, of a single avatar is shared among multiple individuals. However, how this virtual co-embodiment experience influences users&#39; perception of agency, both explicitly and implicitly, and the extent to which they are willing to take responsibility for successful or failed outcomes, remains an imminent problem. In this research, we addressed this issue using: (1) explicit agency questionnaires, (2) implicit intentional binding (IB) effect, (3) responsibility attribution measured through financial gain/loss distribution, and (4) interview to evaluate this experience where agency over the right hand&#39;s fingers was fully transferred to a human partner. Given the distinction between two layers of agency (body agency: control over actions, and external agency: action&#39;s effect on external events), we also investigated the impact of sharing only the body-level of agency. In a ball-throwing task involving 24 participants, results showed that sharing body agency over the fingers negatively affected the feeling of having control over both the fingers and the entire right upper limb, as measured by the questionnaire. However, sharing external agency did not significantly diminish the participants&#39; perceived control over the ball-throwing, as indicated by IB. Interestingly, while IB demonstrated that participants felt greater causality for failed ball-throwing attempts, they were reluctant to take responsibility and accept financial penalties. Additionally, responsibility attribution was found to be linked to the participants&#39; personal trait—Locus of Control.},

Nevertheless, these methods often falter with images that exhibit significant information gaps. While incorporating external priors or leveraging reference images can provide supplemental information, these strategies are limited in their practical scope. Alternatively, textual inputs offer greater accessibility and adaptability. In this study, we develop a sophisticated framework enabling users to guide the restoration of deteriorated images via textual descriptions. Utilizing the text-image compatibility feature of CLIP enhances the integration of textual and visual data. Our versatile framework supports multiple restoration activities such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and colorization. Comprehensive testing validates our technique&#39;s efficacy.},

To help analysts retrieve relevant plots more quickly when they are needed, immersive virtual environments (iVEs) provide them with the option to freely arrange scatterplots in the 3D space around them. In this paper, we investigate the impact of different virtual environments on the users&#39; ability to quickly find and retrieve individual scatterplots from a larger collection. We tested three different scenarios, all having in common that users were able to position the plots freely in space according to their own needs, but each providing them with varying numbers of landmarks serving as visual cues: an Empty scene as a baseline condition, a single landmark condition with one prominent visual cue being a Desk, and a multiple landmarks condition being a virtual Office. Results from a between-subject investigation with 45 participants indicate that the time and effort users invest in arranging their plots within an iVE had a greater impact on memory performance than the design of the iVE itself. We report on the individual arrangement strategies that participants used to solve the task effectively and underline the importance of an active arrangement phase for supporting the spatial memorization of scatterplots in iVEs},

  abstract     = {In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual content enhances user experience by providing additional information. However, improperly positioned or designed virtual content can be detrimental to task performance, as it can impair users&#39; ability to accurately interpret real-world information. In this paper we examine two types of task-detrimental virtual content: obstruction attacks, in which virtual content prevents users from seeing real-world objects, and information manipulation attacks, in which virtual content interferes with users&#39; ability to accurately interpret real-world information. We provide a mathematical framework to characterize these attacks and create a custom open-source dataset for attack evaluation. To address these attacks, we introduce ViDDAR (Vision language model-based Task-Detrimental content Detector for Augmented Reality), a comprehensive full-reference system that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and advanced deep learning techniques to monitor and evaluate virtual content in AR environments, employing a user-edge-cloud architecture to balance performance with low latency. To the best of our knowledge, ViDDAR is the first system to employ VLMs for detecting task-detrimental content in AR settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ViDDAR effectively understands complex scenes and detects task-detrimental content, achieving up to 92.15% obstruction detection accuracy with a detection latency of 533 ms, and an 82.46% information manipulation content detection accuracy with a latency of 9.62 s.},

In response, we propose a dual-level PBO framework that integrates global and local color adjustments tailored for VR environments. We design and evaluate a novel context-aware preferential Gaussian Process (GP) to learn contextual preferences for local colors, taking into account the dynamic contexts of previously established global colors. Additionally, recognizing the limitations of desktop-based interfaces for comparing 360-degree images, we design three VR interfaces for color comparison. We conduct a controlled user study to investigate the effectiveness of the three VR interface designs and find that users prefer to be enveloped by one 360-degree image at a time and to compare two rather than four color-graded options.},

Such errors lead users to ignore the agent&#39;s advice and make suboptimal decisions. While agents can offer an apology to repair trust, its effectiveness is often limited because it fails to fully repair the original level of trust. Therefore, we examined the use of social touch, a social interaction involving physical interaction between users and the virtual agent, to enhance the effect of an apology on trust repair and to increase the acceptability of its advice. In a controlled experiment (N=24), participants experienced a robotic arm touching the back of their hands while interacting with the agent before decision-making. The results showed that social touch did not repair participants&#39; trust in agents. However, participants were more likely to accept the agent&#39;s advice when they experienced touch with physical feedback, regardless of the level of trust in the agent.

To answer this question, we conducted a within-subjects study (N = 50) to explore the correlation between presence and reaction time across two interaction scenarios (direct and symbolic) with two tasks (selection and manipulation).

Presence measures immersion, reaction time captures user responsiveness, cognitive load reflects mental effort, and BIP represents moments when attention shifts from the virtual to the real world, breaking immersion. While prior work has established that distractions impact these factors individually, the relationship between these constructs remains underexplored, particularly in MR environments where users engage with both real and virtual stimuli. To address this gap, we have presented a theoretical model to understand how congruent and incongruent distractions affect all these constructs. We conducted a within-subject study (N = 54) where participants performed image-sorting tasks under different distraction conditions. Our findings show that incongruent distractions significantly increase cognitive load, slow reaction times, and elevate BIP frequency, with presence mediating these effects.},

  abstract     = {Humans experience social interactions partly through nonverbal communication, including proxemic behaviors and haptic sensations. Body language, facial expressions, personal spaces, and social touch are multiple factors influencing how a stranger&#39;s approach is experienced. Furthermore, the rise of virtual social platforms raises concerns about virtual harassment and the perception of personal space in VR: harassment is felt much more strongly in virtual spaces, and the psychological effects can be just as severe. While most virtual platforms have a ‘personal bubble’ feature that keeps strangers at a distance, it does not seem to suffice: personal space violations seem influenced by more than simply distance. With this paper, we aim to further clarify the variability of personal spaces. We focus on haptic stimulation, elaborating our hypotheses on the relationship between social touch and the perception of personal spaces. Users wore a haptic compression belt and were immersed in a virtual dark alley. Virtual agents approached them while exhibiting either neutral or threatening body language. In half of all trials, as the agent advanced, the compression belt tightened around the users’ torsos with three different pressures. Participants could press a response button when uncomfortable with the agent&#39;s proximity. Peripersonal space violations occurred 31% earlier on average when the agent was visibly angry and the compression belt activated. A greater tightening pressure also slightly increased the personal sphere radius by up to 13%. Overall, our results are consistent with previous works on peripersonal spaces. They help further define our relationship to personal space boundaries and encourage using haptic devices during simulated social interactions in VR.},

Augmented reality (AR) is a promising tool to address this limitation by providing sensory substitution through visual or vibrotactile feedback. The implementation of visual force feedback requires consideration not only of feedback design but also of positioning. Therefore, we implemented two different visualization types at three different positions and investigated the effects of vibrotactile feedback on these approaches. Furthermore, we examined the effects of multimodal feedback compared to visual or vibrotactile output alone. Our results indicate that sensory substitution eases the interaction in contrast to a feedback-less baseline condition, with the presence of visual support reducing average force errors and being subjectively preferred by the participants. However, the more feedback was provided, the longer users needed to complete their tasks. Regarding visualization design, a 2D bar visualization reduced force errors compared to a 3D arrow concept. Additionally, the visualizations being displayed directly on the ultrasound screen were subjectively preferred. With findings regarding feedback modality and visualization design our work represents an important step toward sensory substitution for touchless human-robot interaction.},

To be more precise, different room models were displayed via HMD while participants had to localize sounds emanating from real loudspeakers. In the first paradigm, we manipulated whether a room was congruent or incongruent to the physical room. In a second paradigm, we manipulated room visibility - displaying either an audiovisual congruent room or a scene containing almost no spatial information- and localization task. Participants indicated distances either by placing a virtual loudspeaker, walking, or verbal report. While audiovisual room incongruence had a detrimental effect on distance perception, no main effect of room visibility was found but an interaction with the task. Overestimation of distances was higher using the placement task in the non-spatial scene.

In this work, we present FlowHON, an approach to construct higher-order networks (HONs) from flow fields. FlowHON captures the inherent higher-order dependencies in flow fields as nodes and estimates the transitions among them as edges. We formulate the HON construction as an optimization problem with three linear transformations. The first two layers correspond to the node generation and the third one corresponds to edge estimation. Our formulation allows the node generation and edge estimation to be solved in a unified framework. With FlowHON, the rich set of traditional graph algorithms can be applied without any modification to analyze flow fields, while leveraging the higher-order information to understand the inherent structure and manage flow data for efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowHON using a series of downstream tasks, including estimating the density of particles during tracing, partitioning flow fields for data management, and understanding flow fields using the node-link diagram representation of networks.},

  abstract     = {In mixed reality (MR) telepresence applications, the differences between participants&#39; physical environments can interfere with effective collaboration. For asymmetric tasks, users might need to access different resources (information, objects, tools) distributed throughout their room. Existing intersection methods do not support such interactions, because a large portion of the telepresence participants&#39; rooms become inaccessible, along with the relevant task resources. We propose MRUnion, a Mixed Reality Telepresence pipeline for asymmetric task-aware 3D mutual scene generation. The key concept of our approach is to enable a user in an asymmetric telecollaboration scenario to access the entire room, while still being able to communicate with remote users in a shared space. For this purpose, we introduce a novel mutual room layout called Union. We evaluated 882 space combinations quantitatively involving two, three, and four combined remote spaces and compared it to a conventional Intersect room layout. The results show that our method outperforms existing intersection methods and enables a significant increase in space and accessibility to resources within the shared space. In an exploratory user study (N=24), we investigated the applicability of the synthetic mutual scene in both MR and VR setups, where users collaborated on an asymmetric remote assembly task. The study results showed that our method achieved comparable results to the intersect method but requires further investigation in terms of social presence, safety and support of collaboration. From this study, we derived design implications for synthetic mutual spaces.},

  abstract     = {Projector-camera systems (ProCams) simulation aims to model the physical project-and-capture process and associated scene parameters of a ProCams, and is crucial for spatial augmented reality (SAR) applications such as ProCams relighting and projector compensation. Recent advances use an end-to-end neural network to learn the project-and-capture process. However, these neural network-based methods often implicitly encapsulate scene parameters, such as surface material, gamma, and white balance in the network parameters, and are less interpretable and hard for novel scene simulation. Moreover, neural networks usually learn the indirect illumination implicitly in an image-to-image translation way which leads to poor performance in simulating complex projection effects such as soft-shadow and interreflection. In this paper, we introduce a novel path tracing-based differentiable projector-camera systems (DPCS), offering a differentiable ProCams simulation method that explicitly integrates multi-bounce path tracing. Our DPCS models the physical project-and-capture process using differentiable physically-based rendering (PBR), enabling the scene parameters to be explicitly decoupled and learned using much fewer samples. Moreover, our physically-based method not only enables high-quality downstream ProCams tasks, such as ProCams relighting and projector compensation, but also allows novel scene simulation using the learned scene parameters. In experiments, DPCS demonstrates clear advantages over previous approaches in ProCams simulation, offering better interpretability, more efficient handling of complex interreflection and shadow, and requiring fewer training samples.

  abstract     = {We propose LAPIG, a language guided projector image generation method with surface adaptation and stylization. LAPIG consists of a projector-camera system and a target textured projection surface. LAPIG takes the user text prompt as input and aims to transform the surface style using the projector. LAPIG&#39;s key challenge is that due to the projector&#39;s physical brightness limitation and the surface texture, the viewer&#39;s perceived projection may suffer from color saturation and artifacts in both dark and bright regions, such that even with the state-of-the-art projector compensation techniques, the viewer may see clear surface texture-related artifacts. Therefore, how to generate a projector image that follows the user&#39;s instruction while also displaying minimum surface artifacts is an open problem. To address this issue, we propose projection surface adaptation (PSA) that can generate compensable surface stylization. We first train two networks to simulate the projector compensation and project-and-capture processes, this allows us to find a satisfactory projector image without real project-and-capture and utilize gradient descent for fast convergence. Then, we design content and saturation losses to guide the projector image generation, such that the generated image shows no clearly perceivable artifacts when projected. Finally, the generated image is projected for visually pleasing surface style morphing effects. The source code and more results are available on the project page: https://Yu-chen-Deng.github.io/LAPIG/.},

We conducted a 2x2 mixed design experiment involving 60 participants who interacted with either synchronously moving virtual humans or independently moving ones, each with self-similar or generic appearances, across two consecutive AR sessions. Participants evaluated their sense of embodiment, self-identification, and body weight perception of the virtual human. Our results show that self-similarity significantly enhanced sense of embodiment, self-identification, and the accuracy of body weight estimates with the virtual human. However, the effects of having motor control over the virtual human movements were notably weaker in these measures than in similar VR studies. Further analysis indicated that not only the virtual human itself but also the participants&#39; body weight, self-esteem, and body shape concerns predict body weight estimates across all conditions. Our work advances the understanding of virtual human body weight perception in AR systems, emphasizing the importance of factors such as coherence with the real-world environment.},

Using multilevel modeling, we studied how different factors of the VR system and user affected their physiological signals. In particular, we studied the effects of redirection gain, trial duration, trial number (i.e., time spent in VR), and participant gender on postural sway, gaze velocity (a proxy for gaze stability), and saccade and blink rate. Our results showed that, in general, physiological signals were significantly positively correlated with the strength of redirection gain, the duration of trials, and the trial number. Gaze velocity was negatively correlated with trial duration. Additionally, we measured users&#39; sensitivity to rotation gains in well-lit (photopic) and dimly-lit (mesopic) virtual lighting conditions.

  abstract     = {Visual Analytics (VA) has become a paramount discipline in supporting data analysis in many scientific domains, empowering the human user with automatic capabilities while keeping the lead in the analysis. At the same time, designing an effective VA solution is not a simple task, requiring its adaptation to the problem at hand and the intended user of the system. In this scenario, the User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology provides the framework to incorporate user needs into the design of a VA solution. On the other hand, its implementation mainly relies on qualitative feedback, with the designer missing tools supporting her in quantitatively reporting the user feedback and using it to hypothesize and test the successive changes to the VA solution. To overcome this limitation, we propose TraVIS, a Visual Analytics solution allowing the loading of a web-based VA system, collecting user traces, and analyzing them with respect to the system at hand. In this process, the designer can leverage the collected traces and relate them to the tasks the VA solution supports and how those can be achieved. Using TraVIS, the designer can identify ineffective interaction paths, analyze the user traces support to task completion, hypothesize corrections to the design, and evaluate the effect of changes. We evaluated TraVIS through experimentation with 11 VA systems from literature, a use case, and user evaluation with five experts. Results show the benefits that TraVIS provides in terms of identifying design problems and efficient support for UCD. TraVIS is available at: https://github.com/XAIber-lab/TraVIS.},

Recently, a growing research trend has been exploring how to assist data storytelling with advanced artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing studies focus more on individual tasks in the workflow of data storytelling and do not reveal a complete picture of humans&#39; preference for collaborating with AI. To address this gap, we conducted an interview study with 18 data workers to explore their preferences for AI collaboration in the planning, implementation, and communication stages of their workflow. We propose a framework for expected AI collaborators&#39; roles, categorize people&#39;s expectations for the level of automation for different tasks, and delve into the reasons behind them.

This study explores redirection approaches in virtual reality (VR) to correct golfers&#39; swing paths through strategic ball shifting. By initiating a forward ball shift just before impact, we aim to prompt golfers to react and modify their swing motion, thereby eliminating undesirable swing habits. Building on recent research, our VR-based methods incorporate a gradual transformation of visuomotor associations to enhance motor skill learning. In this study, we develop three ball shift patterns, including a novel pattern that employs gradual ball shifts with interspersed normal conditions, designed to retain learning effects post-training. A preliminary study, including expert interviews, assesses the feasibility of various ball-shifting directions. Subsequently, a comprehensive user study measures the learning effects across different ball shift modes. The results indicate that our proposed redirection mode effectively corrects swing paths and yields a sustained learning effect.},

In this process, researchers need to explore a set of synthetic reactions to transform starting molecules into intermediates step by step until the target novel molecule is obtained. However, designing synthetic routes presents challenges for researchers. First, researchers need to make decisions among numerous possible synthetic reactions at each step, considering various criteria (e.g., yield, experimental duration, and the count of experimental steps) to construct the synthetic route. Second, they must consider the potential impact of one choice at each step on the overall synthetic route. To address these challenges, we proposed SynthLens, a visual analytics system to facilitate the iterative construction of synthetic routes by exploring multiple possibilities for synthetic reactions at each step of construction. Specifically, we have introduced a tree-form visualization in SynthLens to compare and evaluate all the explored routes at various exploration steps, considering both the exploration step and multiple criteria. Our system empowers researchers to consider their construction process comprehensively, guiding them toward promising exploration directions to complete the synthetic route. We validated the usability and effectiveness of SynthLens through a quantitative evaluation and expert interviews, highlighting its role in facilitating the design process of synthetic routes.

The present experimental work investigates, in the healthy population, the perception of the own body in immersive and embodied VR, as well as the impact of being co-present with virtual humans on such self-perception. Participants were successively presented with different avatars, corresponding to various upper- and lower-body proportions, and were asked to compare them with their perceived own body morphology. To investigate the influence of co-present virtual humans on this judgment, the task was performed in co-presence with virtual agents corresponding to various body appearances. Results show an overall overestimation of one&#39;s leg length and no influence of the co-present agent&#39;s appearance. Importantly, the embodiment scores reflect such body morphology judgment inaccuracy, with participants reporting lower levels of embodiment for avatars with very short legs than for avatars with very long legs.

  abstract     = {Virtual reality (VR) has become a popular tool for studying navigation, providing the experimental control of a laboratory setting but also the potential for immersive and natural experiences that resemble the real world. For VR to be an effective tool to study navigation and be used for training or rehabilitation, it is important to establish whether performance is similar across virtual and real environments. Much of the existing navigation research has focused on young adult performance either in a virtual or a real environment, resulting in an open question regarding the validity of VR for studying age-related effects on spatial navigation. In this paper, young (18-30 years old) and older adults (60 years and older) performed the same navigation task in similar real and virtual environments. They completed a homing task, requiring walking along two legs of a triangle and returning to a home location, under three sensory conditions: visual cues (environmental landmarks present), body-based self-motion cues, and the combination of both cues. Our findings reveal that homing performance in VR demonstrates the same age-related differences as those observed in the real-world task. That said, within-age group differences arise when comparing cue use across environment types. In particular, young adults are less accurate and more variable with self-motion cues than visual cues in VR, while older adults show similar deficits with both cues. However, when both age groups can access multiple sensory cues, navigation performance does not differ between environment types. These results demonstrate that VR effectively captures age-related differences, with navigation performance most closely resembling performance in the real world when navigators can rely on an array of sensory information. Such findings have implications for future research on the aging population, highlighting that VR can be a valuable tool, particularly when multisensory cues are available.},

  abstract     = {Rendering quality and performance greatly affect the user&#39;s immersion in VR experiences. 3D Gaussian Splatting-based methods can achieve photo-realistic rendering with speeds of over 100 fps in static scenes, but the speed drops below 10 fps in monocular dynamic scenes. Foveated rendering provides a possible solution to accelerate rendering without compromising visual perceptual quality. However, 3DGS and foveated rendering are not compatible. In this paper, we propose Fov-GS, a foveated 3D Gaussian splatting method for rendering dynamic scenes in real time. We introduce a 3D Gaussian forest representation that represents the scene as a forest. To construct the 3D Gaussian forest, we propose a 3D Gaussian forest initialization method based on dynamic-static separation. Subsequently, we propose a 3D Gaussian forest optimization method based on deformation field and Gaussian decomposition to optimize the forest and deformation field. To achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering, we present a 3D Gaussian forest rendering method based on HVS models. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher rendering quality in the foveal and salient regions compared to the SOTA methods but also dramatically improves rendering performance, achieving up to 11.33× speedup. We also conducted a user study, and the results prove that the perceptual quality of our method has a high visual similarity with the ground truth.},

  abstract     = {360° images are a popular medium for bringing photography into virtual reality. While users can look in any direction by rotating their heads, 360° images ultimately look flat. That is because they lack depth information and thus cannot create motion parallax when translating the head. To achieve a fully immersive VR experience from a single 360° image, we introduce a novel method to upgrade 360° images to free-viewpoint renderings with 6 degrees of freedom. Alternative approaches reconstruct textured 3D geometry, which is fast to render but suffers from visible reconstruction artifacts, or use neural radiance fields that produce high-quality novel views but too slowly for VR applications. Our 360° 3D photos build on 3D Gaussian splatting as the underlying scene representation to simultaneously achieve high visual quality and real-time rendering speed. To fill plausible content in previously unseen regions, we introduce a novel combination of latent diffusion inpainting and monocular depth estimation with Poisson-based blending. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art visual and depth quality at rendering rates of 105 FPS per megapixel on a commodity GPU.},

  abstract     = {In Virtual Reality (VR), navigating small physical spaces often relies on handheld controllers, such as teleportation and joystick movements, due to the limited space for natural walking. However, walking-based techniques can enhance immersion by enabling more natural movement. This paper presents three room-connection techniques – portals, corridors, and central hubs – that can be used in virtual environments (VEs) to create “impossible spaces”. These spaces use overlapping areas to maximize available physical space, promising for walking even in constrained spaces. We conducted a user study with 33 participants to assess the effectiveness of these techniques within a small physical area (2.5 × 2.5 m). The results show that all three techniques are viable for connecting rooms in VR, each offering distinct characteristics. Each method positively impacts presence, cybersickness, spatial awareness, orientation, and overall user experience. Specifically, portals offer a flexible and straightforward solution, corridors provide a seamless and natural transition between spaces, and central hubs simplify navigation. The primary contribution of this work is demonstrating how these room-connection techniques can be applied to dynamically adapt VEs to fit small, uncluttered physical spaces, such as those commonly available to VR users at home. Applications such as virtual museum tours, training simulations, and emergency preparedness exercises can greatly benefit from these methods, providing users with a more natural and engaging experience, even within the limited space typical in home settings.},

Twenty-five participants (14 with low vision and 11 typically sighted) wore smart glasses and completed a real-world obstacle course under two conditions: with obstacles enhanced using 3D AR markings and without any enhancement (i.e., passthrough only - control condition). Our results reveal that AR enhancements significantly decreased walking time, with the low vision group demonstrating a notable reduction in time. Additionally, the path length was significantly shorter with AR enhancements. The decrease in time and path length did not lead to more collisions, suggesting improved obstacle avoidance. Participants also reported a positive user experience with the AR system, highlighting its potential to enhance mobility for low vision users. These results suggest that AR technology can play a critical role in supporting the independence and confidence of low vision individuals in mobility tasks within complex environments.

One of the essential element that is missing in previous single-view hair reconstruction methods is the clumping effect of hair, which is influenced by scalp secretions and oils, and is a key ingredient for high-quality hair rendering and simulation. Inspired by common practices in industrial production which simulates realistic hair clumping by allowing artists to adjust clumping parameters, we aim to integrate these clumping effects into single-view hair reconstruction. We introduce a hierarchical hair representation that incorporates a clumping modifier into the guide hair and skinning-based hair expressions. This representation utilizes guide strands and skinning weights to express the basic geometric structure of the hair. The clumping modifier allows for the expression of more detailed and realistic clumping effects. Based on this representation, We design a fully differentiable framework integrating a neural measurement of clumping and a line-based rasterization renderer to iteratively solve guide strands positions and clumping parameters. Our method demonstrates superior performance both qualitatively and quantitatively compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

Our findings reveal that avatar modifications are generally viewed as more appropriate when considered from a partner&#39;s perspective, especially for changeable attributes. However, these modifications are perceived as less acceptable in professional settings such as workplaces. Additionally, individuals with high self-monitoring tendencies tend to be more resistant to changes, while those scoring higher on Machiavellianism are more accepting of changes, particularly regarding unchangeable attributes and emotional expressions.

Interpersonal distance—the physical space people maintain between each other—is a key aspect of user experience. Previous work in psychology has shown that breaches of personal space cause stress and discomfort. Thus, effectively managing this distance is crucial in social VR, where social interactions are frequent. Teleportation, a commonly used locomotion method in these environments, involves distinct cognitive processes and requires users to rely on their ability to estimate distance. Despite its widespread use, the effect of teleportation on proximity remains unexplored. To investigate this, we measured the interpersonal distance of 70 participants during interactions with embodied conversational agents, comparing teleportation to natural walking. Our findings revealed that participants maintained closer proximity from the agents during teleportation. Female participants kept greater distances from the agents than male participants, and natural walking was associated with higher agency and body ownership, though co-presence remained unchanged. We propose that differences in spatial perception and spatial cognitive load contribute to reduced interpersonal distance with teleportation. These findings emphasise that proximity should be a key consideration when selecting locomotion methods in social VR, highlighting the need for further research on how locomotion impacts spatial perception and social dynamics in virtual environments.},

The recent development of neural rendering provides new potential for hand-held object reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel neural representation-based framework to recover radiance fields of the two-hand-held object, named H$_{2}$O-NeRF. We first design an object-centric semantic module based on the geometric signed distance function cues to predict 3D object-centric regions and develop the view-dependent visible module based on the image-related cues to label 2D occluded regions. We then combine them to obtain a 2D visible mask that adaptively guides ray sampling on the object for optimization. We also provide a newly collected H$_{2}$O dataset to validate the proposed method. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance on reconstruction completeness and view-consistency synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

To project the implicit representation into an image, NeRF employs volume rendering that approximates the continuous integrals of rays as an accumulation of the colors and densities of the sampled points. Although this approximation enables efficient rendering, it ignores the direction information in point intervals, resulting in ambiguous features and limited reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a learning method that utilizes learnable view-dependent features to improve scene representation and reconstruction. We model the volume rendering integral with a piecewise constant volume density and spherical harmonic-guided view-dependent features, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the rendering efficiency. In addition, we introduce a regularization term that restricts the anisotropic representation effect to be local, with negligible effect on geometry representations, and that encourages recovering the correct geometry. Our method is flexible and can be plugged into NeRF-based frameworks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed representation can boost the rendering quality of various NeRFs and achieve state-of-the-art rendering performance on both synthetic and real-world scenes.},

Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid transformer-convolutional neural network to accomplish two core tasks: capturing the reverberation characteristics of a scene from audio-visual data, and generating spatial sound in an unseen new environment from signals recorded at sparse positions and orientations within the original scene. By learning to represent spatial acoustics in a given environment, our approach enables creation of realistic immersive auditory experiences, thereby enhancing the sense of presence in augmented and virtual reality applications.

  abstract     = {With the increasing complexity of geometry and rendering effects in virtual reality (VR) scenes, existing foveated rendering methods for VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) struggle to meet users&#39; demands for VR scene rendering with high frame rates (≥ 60 f ps for rendering binocular foveated images in VR scenes containing over 50M triangles). Current research validates that auditory content affects the perception of the human visual system (HVS). However, existing foveated rendering methods primarily model the HVS&#39;s eccentricity-dependent visual perception ability on the visual content in VR while ignoring the impact of auditory content on the HVS&#39;s visual perception. In this paper, we introduce an auditory-content-based perceived rendering quality analysis to quantify the impact of visual perception under different auditory conditions in foveated rendering. Based on the analysis results, we propose an audio-visual aware foveated rendering method (AvFR). AvFR first constructs an audio-visual feature-driven perception model that predicts the eccentricity-based visual perception in real time by combining the scene&#39;s audio-visual content, and then proposes a foveated rendering cost optimization algorithm to adaptively control the shading rate of different regions with the guidance of the perception model. In complex scenes with visual and auditory content containing over 1.17M triangles, AvFR renders high-quality binocular foveated images at an average frame rate of 116 f ps. The results of the main user study and performance evaluation validate that AvFR achieves significant performance improvement (up to 1.4× speedup) without lowering the perceived visual quality compared with the state-of-the-art VR-HMD foveated rendering method.},

A knowledge gap exists about how geospatial uncertainty visualization techniques influence human factors measures. This comprehensive review synthesized the current literature on visual representations of uncertainty in geospatial data applications, identifying the breadth of techniques and the relationships between strategies and human performance and perception outcomes. Eligible articles described and evaluated at least one method for representing uncertainty in geographical data with participants, including land, ocean, weather, climate, and positioning data. Forty articles were included. Uncertainty was visualized using multivariate and univariate maps through colours, shapes, boundary regions, textures, symbols, grid noise, and text. There were varying effects, and no definitive superior method was identified. The predominant user focus was on novices. Trends were observed in supporting users understand uncertainty, user preferences, confidence, decision-making performance, and response times for different techniques and application contexts. The findings highlight the impacts of different categorizations within colour and shape techniques, heterogeneity in perception and performance evaluation, performance and perception mismatch, and differences and similarities between novices and experts. Contextual factors and user characteristics, including understanding the decision-maker&#39;s tasks, user type, and desired outcomes for decision-support appear to be important factors influencing the design of effective uncertainty visualizations. Future research on geospatial applications of uncertainty visualizations can expand on the observed trends with consistent and standardized measurement and reporting, further explore human performance and perception impacts with 3-dimensional and interactive uncertainty visualizations, and perform real-world evaluations within various contexts.},

  abstract     = {3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models radiance fields as sparsely distributed 3D Gaussians, providing a compelling solution to novel view synthesis at high resolutions and real-time frame rates. However, deforming objects represented by 3D Gaussians remains a challenging task. Existing methods deform a 3DGS object by editing Gaussians geometrically. These approaches ignore the fact that it is the radiance field that rasterizes and renders the final image. The inconsistency between the deformed 3D Gaussians and the desired radiance field inevitably leads to artifacts in the final results. In this paper, we propose an interactive method for as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) deformation of the Gaussian radiance fields. Specifically, after performing geometric edits on the Gaussians, we further optimize Gaussians to ensure its rasterization yields a similar result as the deformed radiance field. To facilitate this objective, we design radial features to mathematically describe the radial difference before and after the deformation, which are densely sampled across the radiance field. Additionally, we propose an adaptive anisotropic spatial low-pass filter to prevent aliasing issues during sampling and to preserve the field with the varying non-uniform sampling intervals. Users can interactively employ this tool to achieve large-scale ARAP deformations of the radiance field. Since our method maintains the consistency of the Gaussian radiance field before and after deformation, it avoids artifacts that are common in existing 3DGS deformation frameworks. Meanwhile, our method keeps the high quality and efficiency of 3DGS in rendering.},

However, existing approaches struggle to accurately learn the clothing deformation when directly warping the garment from the source pose onto the target pose. To address this, we propose Person-to-Person virtual try-on via Garment UNwrapping, a novel framework dubbed as ViTon-GUN. Specifically, we divide the P2P task into two subtasks: Person-to-Garment (P2G) and Garment-to-Person (G2P). The P2G aims to unwrap the target garment from a source pose to a canonical representation based on A-Pose. In the P2G stage, we enable the implementation of a flow-based P2G scheme by introducing an A-Pose estimator and establishing comprehensive training conditions. Building upon this step-wise strategy, we introduce a novel pipeline for P2P try-on. Once trained, the P2G strategy can serve as a “plug-and-play” module, which efficiently adapts existing diffusion-based pre-trained G2P models to P2P try-on without further training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our ViTon-GUN performs remarkably well on P2P try-on, even for dresses with intricate design details.},

We formalize a notion of distributed control barrier function for multi-robot systems, a safety certificate amenable to a distributed implementation, which provides formal ground to using graph neural networks to learn safe distributed controllers. Further, we observe that learning a distributed controller ignoring delays can severely degrade safety. We finally propose a predictor-based framework to train a safe distributed controller under communication delays, where the current state of nearby robots is predicted from received data and age-of-information. Numerical experiments on multi-robot collision avoidance show that our predictor-based approach can significantly improve the safety of a learned distributed controller under communication delays.

However, finite blocklength coding (FBC) in URLLC makes it challenging to achieve optimal performance in the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC in terms of achievable sum rate (ASR). Firstly, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic data rate. Then, we formulate an ASR maximization problem by jointly considering power allocation and user equipment (UE) clustering. To tackle such an intractable problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., the power allocation problem and the UE clustering problem. A successive convex approximation algorithm is proposed to solve the power allocation problem by transforming it into a series of geometric programming problems. Meanwhile, two algorithms based on graph theory are proposed to solve the UE clustering problem by identifying negative loops. Finally, alternative optimization is performed to find the maximum ASR of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the benchmarks in terms of ASR under various scenarios.},

Although learning-based algorithms have been used to address this problem, they train a model based on one a priori preference to make the offloading decision. When the preference changes, the trained model may not perform well and needs to be retrained. To address this issue, we propose a neural combinatorial optimization method that combines an encoder-decoder model with reinforcement learning. The encoder captures task relationships, while the decoder, equipped with a preference-based attention mechanism, determines offloading decisions for various preferences. Additionally, reinforcement learning is employed to train the encoder-decoder model. Since the proposed method can infer the offloading decision for each preference, it eliminates the need to retrain the model when the preference changes, thus improving real-time performance. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparison with three algorithms on instances of different scales.},

Besides, the centralization of intelligent vehicles management center is susceptible to single point failures and performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a robust and distributed intelligent vehicles management architecture leveraging blockchain technology to resolve security and performance issues lying in the registration, update, and revocation of intelligent vehicles&#39; identity public keys. Then, we leverage certificate-less short signature (CLSS) to achieve the dynamic identity verification of ADS-B system participants while ensuring message integrity, non-repudiation, and compatibility with low-data-bit message packets. Furthermore, to enhance intelligent vehicles transaction process efficiency within the proposed architecture, we develop an Verifiable Random Function-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol (VRBFT) combining threshold signatures. Finally, through a comprehensive security analysis and feasibility assessment, the results indicate that authentication requires less than 30 ms, block generation occurs within 200 ms, and the system exhibits high throughput and low latency. These findings demonstrate that our solution significantly enhances the security of the ADS-B system and offers a practical and promising approach for real-time, large-scale intelligent vehicle management.},

This paper proposes a novel content caching framework tailored to DT-enabled IoVs, where DTs selectively cache on-demand contents on edge devices (i.e., cellular base stations and roadside units) managed by the edge service manager (ESM) along the VUE&#39;s trip to avoid backbone congestion yet save download time. However, ESMs are inherently selfish and reluctant to contribute resources to cache contents without benefits. Furthermore, considering the diverse trajectories of vehicles, it is inefficient to cache data along a single path. To address these challenges, we propose ACDV, which first models the interactions between the ESMs and DTs as a Stackelberg game to incentivize ESMs to actively participate in the content caching process. We then deploy a Markov model to predict the VUE distribution, which enables DTs to cache contents with a focus on predicted trajectories. To save storage costs, we derive an upper bound of content sizes that the VUE can download within a limited network connection time. Considering the lack of network information and users&#39; private utility model in practical scenarios, we further develop a learning-based algorithm to find the optimal pricing scheme and content size strategies of ESMs and DTs. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposal can effectively find the optimal strategy and achieve a fast convergence speed and high-level performance compared to the baselines.},

This work proposes an MR method that employs a clustering analysis of super-constellation in a completely overlapped MU scenario. A super-constellation refers to the mapping of superposed symbols in the I/Q plane. A blind MR for stealthy decoding conversation between two users is considered with parameters like user gain, noise variance etc. being unknown in practical impairments such as carrier frequency offset, timing and phase offsets. The proposed algorithm utilizes agglomerative hierarchical clustering along with various cluster validation techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters and their respective centroids within the super-constellation. Subsequently, amplitude and phase-based features are extracted from these centroids to enable accurate MR. The simulation results demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the proposed method is i) significantly better than the features-based methods like cumulants and higher-order statistics; and ii) comparable with the deep learning-based methods that crucially rely on the availability of training data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the proposed method has significantly lower complexity than the existing techniques.},

This interference significantly impacts the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by vehicles. Moreover, the QoS requirements for vehicles vary widely across different application scenarios, further complicating the design and optimization of resource allocation strategies. To this end, we propose a robust resource allocation method for differentiated QoS in mIoV, leveraging ellipsoid learning and joint interference management. First, a weighted interference hypergraph model is developed to effectively mitigate ACI and CCI experienced by vehicles, while simultaneously addressing the diverse QoS requirements across different vehicle applications. Then, a robust optimization model for vehicle-to-vehicle pair (VP) communications is proposed, and underlying spectrum sharing is adopted to improve spectrum utilization. Furthermore, an ellipsoid-based learning robust algorithm (ELRA) strategy is proposed to address dynamic uncertainties arising from imperfect channel state information (CSI), thereby enhancing the reliability and transmission rate of the communication link. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior network throughput and spectral efficiency performance in densely deployed mIoV.},

Full-duplex-enabled integrated access and backhaul (FD-IAB) emerges as one of the pivotal solutions for ensuring efficient and reliable 6G IoT networks. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is well-suited for innovative multiple access schemes and backhaul networking due to its capability for mode multiplexing. This paper introduces a new FD-IAB network framework utilizing OAM multiplexing, which incorporates multiple uniform circular arrays (MUCA) antennas. Two types of MUCA are suggested, specifically multi-ring-based MUCA (MR-MUCA) and single-ring with subarray based MUCA (SS-MUCA), and their respective performances are analyzed. However, the OAM-based FD system is significantly challenged by various interferences. Primarily, the FD system introduces self-interference (SI), and secondly, OAM multiplexing suffers from inter-mode interference (IMI) due to misalignment between the transceiver antennas. To mitigate SI, antenna configuration method for MUCA is proposed consisting of several subsets, which involves adjusting the space of antenna elements. To reduce IMI, a beam steering matrix (BSM) is utilized to compensate for the misaligned angle at the receiver. Simulation results validate the performance of two types of MUCA and the subset configuration method regarding the impact of SI and IMI in terms of the sum rate and outage probability.},

  abstract     = {Travel demand forecasting (TDF) is a crucial task in route planning, navigation, and scheduling. However, developing models for such tasks requires significant amount of order data, which can pose privacy concerns for users. Federated learning (FL) has addressed privacy concerns related to TDF. However, previous works only consider the data of a single factor to train the model, resulting in a less precise assessment of the demand for on-demand ride services. Moreover, non-independent and identically distributed ( non-IID) data across clients also brings a challenge in personalizing models for TDF tasks when applying FL directly. In this work, a privacy-preserving short-term TDF scheme for non-IID data is proposed to deal with these problems. Our approach analyzes the correlation between various potential influencing factors and travel demand and summarizes the input variables of the FL model to achieve accurate TDF prediction with privacy preservation. Additionally, we provide each client with a personalized model trained on independent and identically distributed (IID) data to compensate for local model weight divergence. Finally, experiments are conducted on the 2022 Shanghai data of the Didi platform as a use case, and the results demonstrate that our scheme effectively improves the model&#39;s performance.},

Firstly, a finite-time command filter is employed to fast approximate the derivative of the virtual control signal, effectively avoiding the computational complexity issue that existed in traditional backstepping design. Subsequently, an error compensation system has been devised to eliminate the errors generated by the filter. Considering the existence of unknown nonlinear dynamics within the system, the fuzzy adaptive control is adopted to handle them. Finally, an event-triggered control with fixed threshold strategy is proposed to reduce the communication and computation burden between the controller and actuator. It has been proven that the tracking errors can converge to a region close to the origin in finite time and without violating full-state constraints. The validity of the control approach has been verified through simulations and experiments.},

  abstract     = {Centralized machine learning algorithms in vehicular networks face privacy and resource constraints. Federated Learning (FL) addresses these by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. To incentivize vehicle participation despite resource constraints, we propose a contract between Roadside Units (RSUs) and vehicles, specifying required computation resources and rewards based on local data quality. The contract is designed to maximize the utility of the RSU, subject to constraints that ensure the participation of the vehicles in the task and truthful reporting of their data quality parameter. However, designing an optimal contract with classical methods is limited to specific utility functions. To extend the design methodology of optimal contracts to a broader range of utility functions, our study proposes a deep learning-based solution. Specifically, we present a novel application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), marking the first instance of applying DNNs in contract theory-based incentive mechanisms to achieve nearoptimal contracts. We design the DNN&#39;s structure to inherently satisfy specific constraints of the optimization problem, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy in determining the optimal contract. We utilize an augmented Lagrangian method to approximate the optimal contract in federated learning tasks. A case study on traffic sign recognition demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of our method. Comparing our approach with the well-known generative diffusion model shows that in the FL scenarios, the DNN results are closer to the optimal contract compared to those of the generative diffusion model.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have been widely investigated, where several physically separated access points (APs) connect to a central processing unit (CPU) via fronthaul links to realize joint signal processing. Although appreciable spatial degrees of freedom can be exploited, the huge interaction overhead between APs and CPU is inevitable and prevents this architecture from being practically implemented. To achieve high signal detection accuracy while reducing interaction overhead, we propose a distributed signal detection scheme with multi-shot weighted combining, where the detected signals are iteratively refined via AP detections and subsequent CPU combining. Specifically, the regularized detection is carried out at the APs by penalizing any discrepancies between the local least-square detected signals at the AP and the weighted combined signals fed back from the CPU. The regularized detections are then collected and combined at the CPU for a refined joint detection. Using the operator-valued free probability theory, the combining weights at the CPU only depend on the statistical channel state information between APs and UEs, which alleviates the interaction overhead of fronthaul links. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed distributed detection with multi-shot combining scheme rapidly converges and achieves improved detection accuracy compared to the detection schemes with one-shot combining.},

Specifically, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system under target reliability, an optimization problem in terms of the transmit precoding of CC, the reflecting coefficients of hybrid RIS, and the allocated blocklength is proposed. To deal with the intractability of the non-convex problem considering the various quality of service (QoS) issues of remote devices such as transmission latency and rate constraints, Dinkelbach&#39;s method is invoked to transform the original problem into a parameterized concave-convex function. Subsequently, efficient algorithms are developed based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and Big-M formulation methods. In addition, the effects of several vital parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme are investigated. Numerical results show that compared to conventional full-passive/active RIS and no-RIS systems, the proposed hybrid RIS offers significant performance advantages. Furthermore, the optimal number and distribution of active/passive elements allocation are demonstrated. It is observed that the proposed hybrid RIS with only a few active elements can achieve higher EE than conventional passive RIS even with infinite blocklength, sufficiently revealing the potential of hybrid RIS to reduce transmission latency, guarantee rewarding reliability, and enhance EE for URLLC services},

In this paper, an improved algorithm for estimating delay-angular parameters of DMC clusters is proposed for processing channel measurement data in indoor office and IIoT scenarios. Statistical properties of SMCs and measured DMCs are analyzed. Then, a novel time-domain non-stationary sixth generation (6 G) standard channel model is proposed based on the extension of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model by including DMCs for indoor scenarios. In the proposed 6 G model, DMCs are incorporated by sharing the same cluster centers with SMCs but exhibiting different intra-cluster parameters, e.g., larger numbers of rays and larger values of intra-cluster delay spread. To accurately describe the cluster birth-death process, a squared sine function is introduced to model power changes of SMCs and DMCs with different rates. Moreover, simulation results of the proposed model are compared with those of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model, 6 G pervasive channel model, and measurement data. The proposed model shows the closest agreement with measurement results.},

Utilizing the DT&#39;s virtualization capability gets the virtual vehicle state and risk analysis for mixed-traffic scenarios to accurately predict vehicle trajectory and driving safety. However, even if a vehicular DT system is perfectly derived, the vehicular DT system might still fail to accurately predict the trajectory and assess driving risk due to its complexity. Under the complexity of the vehicular DT system, small initial state deviations lead to trajectories diverging increasingly from the true trajectory and unpredictably over time. Meanwhile, performing crash risk evaluation services of the vehicular DT system leads to false alarms. This impact is called the butterfly effect of complexity on the trajectory in the vehicular DT system. In this paper, we focus on the effect of complexity on trajectory and risk assessment in the vehicular DT system for mixed-traffic scenarios. Firstly, we consider the communication delay of CAVs and HVs to implement the vehicle model in the vehicular DT system. Then, we verify the existence of complexity in the vehicular DT system. Finally, we evaluate the effect of the complexity on trajectory and risk assessment under initial state deviation in the vehicular DT system. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the control gain of the CAV&#39;s controller is less than (0.075,0.1) by analyzing the butterfly effect of complexity on trajectory prediction and risk assessment in the vehicular DT system. This control gain range avoids the butterfly effect&#39;s impact on vehicle trajectories and risks. This provides an effective decision range to realize the trajectory prediction of high fidelity and driving safety in the vehicular DT system.},

This paper focuses on the multi-user cooperative sensing in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. By utilizing the stochastic geometry, we model the distribution of communication UEs (COM-UEs) as a one-dimensional Matern hard-core point process (1-D MHCP), and derive a closed-form expression for interference power. To further enhance cooperative sensing accuracy while maintaining quality of service (QoS) in communication, we perform waveform optimization by jointly optimizing the weighted range-velocity Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) subject to communication data rate (CDR) and subcarrier power ratio (SPR) constraints. This approach involves selecting the optimal subcarriers for sensing and allocating the corresponding power on each subcarrier for communication and sensing subsystems. By employing the convex relaxation and the cyclic minimization algorithm (CMA), we decompose the complex optimization problem into three sub-problems, simplifying the original NP-hard problem into a solvable one via a cyclic optimization framework. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy, and evaluate the influence of CDR and SPR constraints using the CRLB and root mean square error (RMSE).},

The proposed DSTAnet begins with a temporal feature extractor that combines Transformer Encoder Layers (TEL) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), extracting both long-term teporal dependencies and short-term variations in vehicle trajectories. Next, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are introduced to extract spatial features in dynamically changing interactions, and focus on the most noteworthy vehicles, which are beneficial for modeling interactions between vehicles. Meanwhile, Mixed Density Network (MDN) is used to learn potential trajectory distributions from spatiotemporal features, which enriches the features related to driver intentions, providing a probabilistic understanding of possible future trajectories. By predicting multiple trajectories through random sampling, DSTAnet captures the inherent uncertainty of driver intentions.

The positions of UAVs are modeled by Poisson hole process (PHP). Due to the difficulty of directly solving the user association problem under PHP, the nearest neighbor hole approximation method is introduced. Due to the complex interference caused by multiple communication links in the dual-layer heterogeneous network, we adopt the conditional Laplace transform method to represent interference, deriving expressions for coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Considering the energy constraints of the UAV network, this paper defines the system-level network energy efficiency (EE) as the ratio of the ASE to the average energy consumption per unit area. Utilizing this framework, we jointly optimize the UAV network density and the RSMA power allocation coefficients to maximize EE. The numerical results ultimately validated the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio (CR) empowered 6 G networks are deemed the key candidate technology to achieve ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) with enhanced spectrum utilization efficiency. However, there are several challenges to address in achieving this objective. In particular, the sequential and random sensing performed by secondary users (SUs) to find idle channels within a given band in a CR network (CRN) leads to time and energy consumption, and processing overheads, which consequently cause early depletion of the device&#39;s energy, underutilization of the available spectrum, and prolonged delays in communication. To circumvent this problem, in this paper, a spectrum efficient scheme is proposed based on idle spectrum inference and ranking, which takes into account the devices&#39; heterogeneity as well as their priorities in resource allocation. Based on the probabilistic approach, the scheme uses multiple parameters in a channel&#39;s evaluation and suitability assessment before selection for transmission. Markov chain modeling is leveraged to deal with the users&#39; arrival and departure uncertainties and to derive expressions for core performance metrics, including service capacity and retainability, spectrum utilization efficiency, reliability, network unserviceable and handoff probabilities, channel availability, and communication latency. The scheme is analyzed under various patterns of users&#39; arrivals. The acquired analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art to realize URLLC applications.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation has garnered significant attention in wireless communications, particularly in high-mobility scenarios, due to its exceptional resilience to Doppler shifts. While the delay- Doppler domain channel estimation is mostly considered for reliable communication, it is often hindered by fractional Doppler shifts in complex channel conditions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a model-driven channel estimation network (CENet) for accurate channel estimation in the delay-time (DT) domain, with the initial least-squares (LS) solutions as prior information for training. Specifically, a LS-driven CENet with parallel structure is proposed to efficiently handle the high-dimensional DT domain channel matrix, which enables the row- wise training and estimation with fast convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed CENet significantly outperforms the conventional LS and deep neural network-based methods.},

  abstract     = {To satisfy the growing demand for supporting intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications in remote areas, satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) systems are expected to be widely deployed. Meanwhile, as IoT applications are increasingly diversified, the tasks received by SMEC systems present heterogeneous demands for various resources and quality of service (QoS) metrics, necessitating customized design to accommodate such heterogeneity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint task offloading and resource allocation in SMEC systems with heterogeneous task demands. We first propose a customized task utility model that captures the diversified demands, which is an extension of traditional unified task utility models. Based on the model, we then formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for joint optimization of task offloading, computing resource allocation, transmission power control, and user association, aiming to maximize the sum utility of all tasks. To solve the MINLP, a multi-layer iterative framework is proposed that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, respectively. Simulation results show that, by applying the proposed task utility model, the average utility performance of UEs can be improved by 50% and 100% compared to applying a single metric-based utility model and a typical classification-based utility model, respectively; the proposed task offloading and resource allocation scheme achieves a 30%-80% performance gain compared to benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a millimeter-wave wideband and wide-angle scanning dual-circularly polarized (CP) antenna array based on traveling-wave sequential feeding metasurface (TSF-MS) for vehicular communication systems. The antenna element consists of a dual-layer rectangle metasurface structures fed by a simple two-port traveling-wave sequential stripline through four non-uniform crossed slots. Each crossed slot will be excited twice by the ring strip line, which means the slots are reused. By adjusting the length and width of the crossed slots and strip line, two orthogonal electric fields with equal amplitudes and 90$^{\circ }$ phase difference can be achieved, thereby realizing good right- and left-handed circular polarizations (RHCP, LHCP). The antenna element can achieve a wide impedance bandwidth of 25.8% and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 31%, with a compact size of 0.38 $\lambda _{\mathrm{{mid}}}$, which is far smaller than the other reported CP antenna. Then, based on the newly designed dual-CP antenna element, a 4×4 array is constructed by 2×2 sequentially rotated subarrays. This layout can improve the scanning performance, suppress the cross polarization, and realize modular wiring to simplify the feed network. Benefited from the layout, the array can achieve a wide scanning angle of $\pm$60 over the whole bandwidth with the gain variation and AR less than 3 dB. For demonstration, one prototype is fabricated and the measured results show a good agreement with the simulated results. The dual-CP wide-angle scanning phased array can fully meet the communication needs of vehicular communication systems, indicating a good application prospect.},

We propose a transmission scheme to maximize the overall sum secrecy rate, in which the cooperative jamming technique and coalition formation game are employed, and the UAV endurance is considered. Specifically, a double-layer optimization problem is formulated, including a non-convex optimization problem in the lower layer, and a game theory problem in the upper layer. We use block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation methods to decompose the lower layer problem into UAV deployment and power allocation sub-problems, and convert them into a difference of two convex functions programming problem and a second-order cone programming problem, respectively. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to solve the upper layer problem, obtaining a stable coalition formation.

However, most of the existing research fails to consider the collaboration between video quality and security optimization in wireless offloading, making it less efficient in real-world scenarios with diverse requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel V2V-based secure computation offloading algorithm for video analysis, called radial basis function (RBF)-based multi-objective double deep Q-network (R-MDDQN). We use Wyner&#39;s wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy capacity and ensure that video data cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers. To address the trade-off problem among multiple objectives, we employ an RBF weight network to dynamically adjust the weights by learning the variations of different objective values. Each DDQN agent receives reward evaluations based on different objective functions and effectively and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading strategy. Extensive experiments conducted using real-world datasets from Shenzhen demonstrate that the proposed R-MDDQN reduces latency by approximately 9.32$\%$, decreases energy consumption by around 7.3$\%$, improves video analysis accuracy by about 18.9$\%$, and enhances security capacity by roughly 14.8$\%$ compared to existing task offloading schemes.},

  abstract     = {The synchronization of digital twins (DT) serves as the cornerstone for effective operation of the DT framework. However, the limitations of channel capacity can greatly affect the data transmission efficiency of wireless communication. Unlike traditional communication methods, semantic communication transmits the intended meanings of physical objects instead of raw data, effectively saving bandwidth resource and reducing DT synchronization latency. Hence, we are committed to integrating semantic communication into the DT synchronization framework within the mobile edge computing system, aiming to enhance the DT synchronization efficiency of user devices (UDs). Our goal is to minimize the average DT synchronization latency of all UDs by jointly optimizing the synchronization strategy, transmission power of UDs, and computational resource allocation for both UDs and base station. The formulated problem involves sequential decision-making across multiple coherent time slots. Furthermore, the mobility of UDs introduces uncertainties into the decision-making process. To solve this challenging optimization problem efficiently, we propose a soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize synchronization strategy and resource allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce synchronization latency by up to 13.2% and improve synchronization efficiency compared to other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {The platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has the great potential to significantly improve travel experience in terms of safety, comfortableness, and energy efficiency. However, constrained by sensing range and prediction accuracy, the performance of CAV platoon can not be guaranteed in the scenario of mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This is not only due to the uncertainty of HDVs but also related to the occurrence of various traffic anomalies, such as emergency braking and accidents. In this paper, we aim to investigate an efficient control strategy to guarantee the operation of the platoon in mixed traffic, especially in the case of traffic anomalies. To tackle the problem, an edge-assisted platoon control strategy, called E-CACC, is proposed. First, an error-aware flexible tracking policy is designed to adapt to HDV uncertainties and speed prediction errors. Based on the tracking policy, a zone model predictive control (ZMPC) method is then designed to guarantee travel safety and avoid undesired acceleration. Further, a coordination strategy of CAV platoon and roadside unit (RSU) is proposed to prevent the platoon from potential collision in the case of traffic anomalies, where an event-based communication trigger is designed to determine whether and when the platoon establishes communication links with RSU to acquire exogenous sensing data of anomaly segment. Finally, the evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving travel safety and comfortableness.},

In this system, the first sub-block of each coherence time block encompasses location sensing, beamforming and ISAC, along with a location prediction phase. At the same time, subsequent sub-blocks focus on the latter two phases. During the initial phase, two-dimensional multiple signal classificationbased adaptive location sensing is performed by sensor elements in the distributed HRISs to obtain location information without requiring channel estimation. This information is then used to design optimal beams for enhanced ISAC performance in the subsequent phase. Finally, an extended Kalman filter-based location prediction method generates optimal beams for the following sub-blocks. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of ISAC performance, computational complexity, overhead, and angle estimation accuracy.},

First, a dual-band angular-resolvable wideband channel measurement in an L -shaped hallway is presented and THz channel characteristics at 306-321 GHz and 356-371 GHz are analyzed. Then, a generic L -shaped intersection scenario model is developed, by adapting the ray-tracing (RT)-statistical hybrid channel modeling method THz channel characteristics in the L -shaped scenario. Especially, the spatial consistency of reflected multi-path components (MPCs) in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region is analyzed, and the continuous change of dominant MPCs is statistically modeled, in terms of their power, delay and angles of arrival. As a result, the proposed hybrid approach reduces the computational cost by reducing the determination of dominant MPCs in the NLoS region of the L -shaped scenario. Besides, as conventional close-in and alpha-beta path loss models cannot take good care of large-scale fading in the NLoS case, a modified alpha-beta (M-AB) path loss model for the NLoS region of L -shaped scenarios is proposed and verified 80% more accurate for L -shaped scenarios at different frequency bands.},

Because of the proposed consideration of LoS conditions, mathematically-unavoidable infinite summations are deployed and shown to converge for a finite number of terms, which shows their practicality. Simulation has been deployed to validate the proposed work.},

  abstract     = {Currently, federated learning (FL) is attracting increasing attention in the research of intelligent endogenous 6G networks. However, the increasing number of users and growing model sizes of FL cause considerable communication overhead. To reduce this communication overhead and improve the efficiency of FL, we design a hierarchical blockchain-based FL architecture, which divides a network into edge and center layers and further divides the edge layer into different shards. In addition, due to the massive scales of 6G networks, a main-shard blockchain architecture with IOTA and the practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm are used to ensure the safe sharing of the model and improve the transactions per second (TPS) of the system. Moreover, comprehensively considering the node computing resources, number of training samples, blockchain consensus delay, network communication delay, and FL training delay, we also establish a learning efficiency optimization model for FL and deduce the training round delay for the main and shard chains. Furthermore, the influences of different numbers of shards on the learning efficiency levels of different FL models are analyzed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly improves the learning efficiency, increases the system TPS and reduces the communication overhead by more than 30%.},

The selection procedure typically requires each BS to perform a handshake with user equipment (UE), which becomes increasingly complex as the number of BSs and UEs grows, leading to significant communication overhead. Our article investigates the selection of BS for autonomous vehicles (AV) using deep learning (DL) with light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Two federated learning (FL) approaches are implemented to reduce the communication overhead, where the BS broadcasts its parameters to all connected nodes. A comprehensive comparison of these FL variants is presented. Additionally, the article describes the generation of datasets by ray-tracing approaches and LiDAR data. To evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, transfer learning (TL) is employed across different scenarios, such as varying the number of training samples, the city used for simulation, and the number of BSs involved. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms traditional received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based BS selection by a factor of 1.9 in accuracy while achieving a remarkable 96.38% reduction in data size with FL-based BS selection. Our proposal significantly minimizes communication overhead, validating the efficiency.},

Inspired by Transformer, in this work, we propose a CSI sensing deep neural network, leveraging multi-head attention to learn the environment knowledge from the feedbacks and adjust the precoders adaptively. Moreover, we further consider the impact of feedback quantization, develop a learnable computation-efficient quantizer, and embed it into our proposed adaptive sensing. Numerical results show that our proposed adaptive sensing greatly outperforms existing approaches, and the learnable quantizer can effectively alleviate the performance loss due to feedback quantization.},

Specifically, we maximize the system&#39;s quality-of-experience (QoE) by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, task offloading decision, and user association. Since the problem is non-convex and the jamming behavior is dynamic, an advanced softmax deep double deterministic policy gradients (SD3) based on the prioritized experience replay (PER) algorithm (called PER-SD3) is designed to realize an efficient communication strategy against jamming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PER-SD3 approach can significantly improve the system delay and semantic communication performances compared with baseline approaches in the literature.

To perform online control effectively, a novel online prediction model is proposed, which models the trajectory of UEs as a stochastic Gauss-Markov mobility model and the trajectory of eavesdroppers as a worst-case model based on the current imperfect location information. The online control problem is formulated as a new multi-stage optimization framework, in which we perform online control by solving per-slot prediction problems and a resource allocation problem for the initial point. In the per-slot prediction problem, we jointly optimize the predictive trajectory and transmit power for the upcoming time slot (TS) by maximizing the minimum achievable secrecy rate (ASR) among all UEs. For resource allocation at the initial TS, we optimize transmit power by maximizing the minimum ASR among all UEs. The per-slot prediction problems and the resources allocation problem are all non-convex problems hence they are intractable in terms of computational complexity. To address them, we propose an efficient inner-approximation methods, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) methods and S-procedure as well as Bernstein -type inequality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed online control scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes which include existing offline schemes and online scheme without outage based prediction as well as shortest-path navigation scheme.},

  abstract     = {Designing high-performance routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) is challenging due to the diversity of applications and the dynamics of network topology. The existing general-purpose routing protocols for ad hoc networks often oversimplify mobility patterns and disregard the unequal importance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal routing decisions that are unsuitable for task-oriented FANETs. To break the bottleneck, in this paper we propose a betweenness centrality based dynamic source routing (BC-DSR) protocol for a flying ad hoc network (FANET) in marching formation. Firstly, we introduce a Gauss-Markov group (GMG) mobility model based on the leader-follower pattern, which accurately captures the temporal and spatial correlations of node movements in the realistic marching formation. Besides, we exploit the concept of BC defined in graph theory to measure the structural unequal importance of relay nodes, i.e., to determine link weights, in the particular marching formation topology. The path of least cost is calculated relying on a weighted directed graph constructed. The ns-3 based simulation results demonstrate that our BC-DSR protocol achieves higher packet-delivery ratio and lower average end-to-end latency and routing overhead ratio than representative benchmark protocols used in FANETs, while maintaining a reasonably small network jitter.},

This paper proposes a high spectrum efficiency security scheme using generalized spatial modulation (GSM) and space-time block coding (STBC) for scenarios with imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this scheme, GSM uses RIS block indices as unique identifiers, ideal for secure scenarios. It operates by activating different RIS blocks over two time slots to reflect unmodulated carrier signals, while STBC is designed based on the phase shifts of the RIS. To ensure secure communication, a low-complexity continuous artificial noise (CAN) is transmitted with STBC signals to interfere with eavesdroppers and prevent them from decoding the signals. The ergodic secrecy rate is deduced, and the bit error rate (BER) is validated through experiments. The simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can remarkably improves the security performance of the RIS-assisted wireless communication systems.},

This paper presents a novel trajectory planning framework designed to address these challenges by integrating a dual-layer probabilistic rad-lane intention prediction model with an efficient sampling-based trajectory planner. The proposed dual-layer model comprises three components: short-term vehicle kinematic prediction-based road-level intention inference, Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)-based lane-level intention inference, and target-lane-based trajectory generation. This architecture broadens the application scope and validates the effectiveness of the IMM-based multi-model probabilistic fusion framework in urban intersection scenarios. By incorporating both road-level and lane-level contextual information, the proposed trajectory prediction method significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Additionally, a longitudinal sampling strategy based on predefined maneuver modes is employed to improve the probabilistic completeness of existing parametric curve-based sampling techniques, facilitating rapid and effective obstacle avoidance. A notable advantage of the proposed sampling strategy is its ability to efficiently and probabilistically generate safe and feasible trajectories in challenging intersection scenarios. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of both efficiency and safety in urban intersection vehicle conflict scenarios.},

In some cases, users may not be well-served by RSUs due to congestion, attenuation, or interference. In these cases, vehicular relays associated with RSUs can be used to serve those users. This paper uses stochastic geometry to model and analyze a spatially correlated heterogeneous vehicular network where both RSUs and vehicular relays serve network users such as pedestrians or other vehicles. We present an analytical model where the spatial correlation between roads, RSUs, relays, and users is systematically modeled via Cox point processes. Assuming users are associated with either RSUs or relays, we derive the association probability and the coverage probability of the typical user. Then, we derive the user throughput by considering interactions of links unique to the proposed network. This paper gives practical insights into designing spatially correlated vehicular networks assisted by vehicle relays. For instance, we express network performance such as user association, signal-to-interference (SIR) coverage probability, and network throughput as the functions of network key geometric parameters. In practice, this helps one to optimize the network so as to achieve ultra reliability or maximum user throughput of the vehicular networks by varying key aspects such as the relay density or the bandwidth for relays.},

Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point.

To further explore the channel spectrum on the polarization domain, polarization selectivity is introduced in this work to improve the performance of the beamforming design in mmWave MU-mMIMO systems. By introducing single-port polarization reconfigurable antenna units to the mMIMO antenna arrays, we propose a novel hybrid polarized beamforming structure that can flexibly adjust the polarization distribution of the array. Based on the structure, this paper models the polarization distribution of the subarrays as selection of mask matrices and proposes several optimization schemes to enhance the hybrid polarized beamforming performance, including random combining, conventional genetic algorithm (GA), and optimal perturbation genetic algorithm (OP-GA). In this paper, we enable the Saleh-Velenzuela (S-V) millimeter wave channel model to be applied to the analysis by extending the multipath component (MPC) polarization distribution following the 3GPP and WINNER channel models. Performance analysis on the system sum rate shows that the proposed design significantly outperforms the fixed-polarized system under the same channel distributions.

  abstract     = {We revisit the classic problem of asynchronous time-of-arrival (TOA) based source localization, concentrating now on an expanded, vehicle-related scenario where the source exhibits motion at an unknown constant velocity over a short period of TOA collection. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) study in this field devised a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) formulation and its associated semidefinite programming (SDP) solution. After thorough examination, we pinpoint two avenues for enhancing this benchmark. Firstly, while the SOTA research relies solely on numerical confirmation, we conduct a theoretical mean square error analysis, demonstrating analytically that the CWLS framework indeed allows for estimation accuracy close to the Cramér–Rao bound under moderate noise conditions. Secondly, the CWLS-SDP estimator has two key shortcomings: the high complexity of implementing SDP, and the potential bias introduced due to its approximations and transformations. To tackle these drawbacks, which could be problematic in location-based vehicular applications, we develop a more computationally efficient block majorization–minimization algorithm to directly solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem. This represents our second contribution, and simulations validate its superiority over the SOTA method.},

The former helps integrate sensing and communication technologies, whereas the latter enables delay-Doppler processing in which a doubly dispersive channel appears with almost constant and flat frequencies. We propose a sensing-centric (SC) approach for target detection using communication signals with/without sensing signals. Power allocation is optimized to maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed SC scheme while ensuring a required quality-of-service (QoS) for the communication user equipment (UEs), and adhering to each access point&#39;s (AP&#39;s) power budget. Numerical results show that the proposed SC scheme vastly outperforms a communication-centric method that minimizes the total power consumed at the APs subject to the same constraints.},

However, inevitable timing inconsistencies across participating transceivers lead to signal asynchrony, diminishing the effectiveness of this paradigm. This paper presents a novel coordinated sensing and communication scheme designed to mitigate asynchronous challenges. Specifically, asynchronous errors are jointly estimated alongside target locations, then enabling synchronization corrections for improved coordinated communication. To quantify performance bounds, closed-form expressions of the Cramer-Rao bound and asymptotic communication capacity under given asynchronous levels are derived. On this basis, a two-stage optimization framework is developed to explicitly optimize the coordinated sensing waveform and communication beamforming, further enhancing the resistance to asynchrony. The framework leverages the Schur complement-based semi-definite relaxation to address the non-linear and non-convex challenges in the sensing design. For the communication stage, a conjugate gradient method with penalty terms is proposed to address the high complexity of the multi-variable non-convex problem. These efforts enhance coordinated sensing and communication in asynchronous scenarios, with simulation results provided to verify their effectiveness.},

The IRAC scheme thus helps to reduce the hardware size and improve the resource efficiency of the UAV. To quickly estimate the target&#39;s radial velocity, we propose to use the auto-correlation function implemented at the radar receiver of the UAV. Nevertheless, the use of the auto-correlation function requires the UAV to generate two identical sequences. For this, the UAV copies a part of the original data sequence and adds it to the beginning of the sequence as the two training sequences. Increasing the copied part reduces the radial velocity estimation error. However, this results in longer transmission time, and the stringent latency requirement of the URLLC may not be satisfied. We investigate an optimization problem that optimizes the location of the UAV and the copied part to minimize the radial velocity estimation error while satisfying the latency requirement of the URLLC transmission. To solve the problem, we develop two algorithms, i.e., namely parametric algorithm and a generalized alternating minimization algorithm.

  abstract     = {LEO satellite communication is essential to provide aviation terminal (AT) services. However, due to the relative motion between LEO satellites and ATs, ATs are required to frequently report their current positions to the satellite to guarantee continuous service, which may lead to significant signaling overhead. To overcome this issue, we propose a predictive beamforming approach based on location sensing, whose core idea is to leverage a unified beampattern to enable sensing and data transmission simultaneously. Specifically, Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is adopted to characterize position tracking accuracy under the extended Kalman filtering framework. Then, the concerned problem is formulated to optimize spectral efficiency under transmission power and tracking accuracy constraints. To deal with the problem, we first prove the monotonic relationship between tracking accuracy and the perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the satellite to reformulate the problem, and then it is solved optimally by combining branch-and-reduce-and-bound approach with second-order cone programming. Towards practical application, the primal problem is equivalently reformulated with quadratic transform, and then semidefinite relaxation is adopted for low-complexity beamformer design. Simulation results verify the superior tracking and communication performance of our low-complexity design, and it is shown that it achieves comparable transmission rate and tracking accuracy relative to optimum. Moreover, the average spectral efficiency and tracking accuracy can be improved by up to $60\%$ and $30\%$ relative to other baselines.},

However, its effectiveness in obtaining precise altitude measurements remains constrained by the PI-LDV&#39;s inherent limitation of providing only one-dimensional velocity information. This study addresses this limitation by using the optical path structure of the PI-LDV to construct a frame capable of providing two-dimensional velocity information. To achieve this objective, two innovative integration methods are proposed: a SINS/PI-LDV loosely coupled integration method and a SINS/PI-LDV tightly coupled integration method, both of which consider the influence of potential laser beam fluctuations. Furthermore, a displacement increment measurement model is developed for the SINS/PI-LDV integrated navigation system to maximize the utilization efficiency of PI-LDV measurements while reducing the impact of sensor noise and outliers. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is rigorously validated through a comprehensive series of experimental tests, including: 1) extended-duration, long-distance tests using high-precision inertial measurement units (IMUs); 2) short-duration, limitedrange evaluations using high-precision IMUs; and 3) two additional long-distance verification experiments using both high-precision and medium-precision IMUs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods, particularly in height accuracy. Notably, the performance advantages become more pronounced when implementing the SINS/PI-LDV integrated navigation system with medium-precision IMUs, suggesting enhanced practical applicability in cost-sensitive applications.},

Due to tight coupling and its non-convex nature, the problem is transformed to a Markov decision process (MDP) form, based on which a recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) agent is trained to jointly optimize the UAV flight trajectory, STAR-RIS coefficients, as well as the transmit and receive beamforming at the transceivers. Concerning the frequent displacement of the UAV and thus the considerable dynamism of the system, we further enrich the trained RDPG model for better adapting to the system variations by integrating a meta-learning technique. Numerical results exhibit at least 30% enhancement in average admission rate of sensing targets with the assistance of STAR-RIS. Additionally, the proposed adaptive resource allocation scheme brings about 25% superiority in average, over the existing soft actor-critic (SAC) counterpart available in the literature.},

At first, we propose an array structure referred to as shift-based symmetric coprime planar array (SSCPA). This design acts as a springboard, utilizing shifted coprime arrays to provide a higher uniform DOFs (uDOFs) than existing structures. To address the inherent contradiction between the high uDOFs and the low mutual coupling effect of SSCPA&#39;s parameter selection, we propose an enhanced version named improved shift-based symmetric coprime planar array (ISSCPA), holding smaller weight functions for near separated sensors. This improved design maintains the same uDOFs as offered by SSCPA while improving robustness against mutual coupling.

Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called set-up based merged multicast (SMMC) to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users&#39; locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a fine-tuned SMMC (FT-SMMC) by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed multicast transmission achieves substantial reductions in delivery time, and this performance gain is further enhanced by optimizing set-up time and transmission rates in diverse wireless network scenarios.},

In our system design, the FDA-MIMO radar is developed by transmitting designed phase-coded waveforms with a frequency increment between transmit antenna elements, which provides extra Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOFs) in the range-angle domains for target detection. In specific, for high-speed moving targets, an optimization problem is formulated to devise the phase-coded waveforms with low correlation properties under a constant modulus constraint as well as a similarity constraint involving a known radar waveform with good Doppler tolerance. To tackle such a non-convex optimization problem, the Majorization Minimization-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers projection (MM-ADMM-projection) algorithm is developed in an iterative way, where an MM method is employed by constructing a series of surrogate functions to approximate the optimal solution. Furthermore, by introducing the ADMM method, each surrogate function is separated into linear and quadratic functions, where the constant modulus and similarity constraints are only imposed on the former. Then, a projection method is proposed to remove the non-convex constraints in the feasible region. In particular, the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is implemented to reduce the computational burden, and the local convergence of the proposed method is proved. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed waveform in detecting moving target considering the range ambiguity.},

This mechanism can efficiently reduce the data transmission frequency in the vehicle-cloud communication network, leading to a lower communication load and thus improving the reliability of the system. The STM comprises a set of optimization problems with an adaptive prediction horizon. The optimization problems and threshold design explicitly take the vehicle-cloud communication load into account. Furthermore, a stochastic model predictive control problem with modified constraint tightening and terminal constraint is defined by considering the influence of STM. We develop sufficient conditions to guarantee the closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction in the presence of both adaptive STM and additive disturbances. Then, the recursive feasibility of the optimal control problem and closed-loop stability of the system are investigated.

However, the channel model and communication performance for long-distance inter-satellite laser transmission still require in-depth study. In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies Flag sequences for low-complexity delay-Doppler estimation by exploiting their distinctive peak-curtain ambiguity functions (AFs). Unlike the existing Flag sequence designs that are limited to prime lengths and periodic auto-AFs, we aim to design Flag sequence sets of arbitrary lengths with low (nontrivial) periodic/aperiodic auto- and cross-AFs. Since every Flag sequence consists of a Curtain sequence and a Peak sequence, we first investigate the algebraic design of Curtain sequence sets of arbitrary lengths. Our proposed design gives rise to novel Curtain sequence sets with ideal curtain auto-AFs and zero/near-zero cross-AFs within the delay-Doppler zone of operation. Leveraging these Curtain sequence sets, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the weighted integrated masked sidelobe level (WImSL) of the Flag sequence set. Accelerated parallel partially majorization-minimization algorithms are proposed to jointly optimize the transmit Flag sequences and symmetric/asymmetric reference sequences stored in the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed Flag sequences lead to improved WImSL and peak-to-max-masked-sidelobe ratio compared with the existing Flag sequences. Additionally, our Flag sequences under the Flag method exhibit Mean Squared Errors that approach the Cramér-Rao lower bound and the sampling bound at high signal-to-noise power ratios.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a framework to analyze the impact of user velocity on the distribution of the peak age-of-information (PAoI) for both ground and aerial users by using the dominant interferer-based approximation. We first approximate the SINR meta distribution for the uplink transmission using the distances between the serving base station (BS) and each of the user of interest and the dominant interfering user, which is the interferer that provides the strongest average received power at the tagged BS. We then analyze the spatio-temporal correlation coefficient of the conditional success probability by studying the correlation between the aforementioned two distances. Finally, we choose PAoI as a performance metric to showcase how spatio-temporal correlation or user velocity affect system performance. Our results reveal that ground users exhibit higher spatio-temporal correlations compared to aerial users, resulting in a more pronounced impact of velocity on system performance, such as joint probability of the conditional success probability and distribution of PAoI. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the dominant interferer-based approximation for the SINR meta distribution delivers good matching performance in complex scenarios, such as Nakagami-m fading model, and it can also be effectively utilized in computing spatio-temporal correlation, as this approximation is derived from the distances to the serving BS and the dominant interferer.},

More importantly, a passivity approach is adopted to analyze the disturbance string stability associated with the platoon of adaptive closed-loop vehicle control systems. It is shown that the distributed direct adaptive control law achieves the string stability in the presence of model nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties against the worst-case energy bounded disturbances without known bounds. Further analysis shows that the vehicle platoon under the distributed direct adaptive control law is capable of synchronizing all velocities while maintaining the required safe inter-vehicle distances.

Instead of acquiring S-CSI based on instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), we directly estimate S-CSI by leveraging its clustered sparsity. Specifically, the inherent clustered sparsity of HMIMO S-CSI is characterized by von Mises–Fisher (vMF) distribution, given arbitrary number, position and angular spread of scatterers. The number of parameters to be estimated can be compressed to the order of scatterers&#39; quantities from the order of degrees of freedom (DoFs) of the array. Then, a novel wavenumber-domain expectation-maximization (WD-EM) algorithm is proposed to implement cluster-by-cluster variational inference, which significantly reduces the computational complexity.

Utilizing such arrays often results in a near-field spherical wave transmission environment, enabling the generation of focused beams, which introduces new degrees of freedom for wireless localization. In this paper, we consider a beam-focusing design for localizing multiple sources in the radiating near-field. Our formulation accommodates various expected types of implementations of large antenna arrays, including hybrid analog/digital architectures and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). We consider a direct localization estimation method exploiting curvature-of-arrival of impinging spherical wavefront to obtain user positions. In this regard, we adopt a two-stage approach configuring the array to optimize near-field positioning. In the first step, we focus only on adjusting the array coefficients, assuming actual user positions have been known, to minimize the estimation error. We obtain a closed-form approximate solution based on projection and a better one based on the Riemann gradient algorithm. We then extend this approach to localize and focus the beams simultaneously via a sub-optimal iterative approach that does not rely on such pre knowledge of positions. The simulation results show that near-field localization accuracy based on a hybrid array or DMA can achieve performance close to that of fully digital arrays at a lower cost, and DMAs can attain better performance than hybrid solutions with the same aperture.},

To tackle the dual challenges of attaining rapid charging while guaranteeing safety, a novel safety-enhanced fast charging strategy for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is presented, utilizing a thermal and health-aware safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) approach. Specifically, this work introduces an innovative approach by employing distributional reinforcement learning in LIBs fast charging control, simultaneously optimizing safety constraint issues.

Compared to advanced deep deterministic policy gradient-based and soft actor-critic-based strategies, the proposed method exhibits superior optimality and stability, confirming its significant performance advantages.

  abstract     = {Device-free localization (DFL) represents an emerging technology in autonomous driving assistance systems, sensing targets around a vehicle without requiring them carrying any devices. Current machine learning methodologies for DFL struggle with adaptively extracting discriminative features, resulting in weak robustness. Although dictionary learning techniques have shown potentiality in robust feature extraction for images and signals, their direct application to improving the robustness of DFL presents significant challenges. Specifically, the unsupervised mechanism of dictionary learning complicates the calibration of target location bases. The complex optimization processes also lead to inefficient parameter updating. To address these issues, we propose a deep-supervised dictionary learning (DSDL) approach for enhancing the robustness of DFL. The proposed DSDL method synergizes the advantages of sparse representation and deep learning, incorporating the robustness and interpretability of dictionary learning with the efficient parameter updating characteristic of deep learning. The supervised mechanism enables collaborative labeling of the learned signal bases. Experimental results, derived from an established DFL system, demonstrate that our DSDL outperforms existing techniques in both robustness and accuracy. DSDL maintains strong robustness and achieves high localization accuracy, surpassing 99% on clean data and sustaining over 97% accuracy under 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.

  abstract     = {Fading channels are pivotal in mobile communication, introducing varying levels of distortion that greatly affect transmission performance. While rateless codes like Spinal codes offer enhanced spectral efficiency in time-varying channels, they encounter practical hurdles in fading environments, such as high decoding complexity and the inability to leverage frequency diversity in multi-carrier systems. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an optimized decoding and puncturing scheme. By leveraging equalization results to estimate and classify distortion levels in received symbols, our scheme allows for targeted adjustments to the decoding tree structure. In instances of decoding failure, the scheme selectively includes varying lengths of auxiliary information in the feedback, assisting the sender in making puncturing decisions. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate rate performance increase of 7%-42% and decoding complexity decrease of 23%-70% compared to existing algorithms in severe multi-path scenarios, thereby enhancing the reliability and applicability of Spinal codes in fading channels},

  abstract     = {The vehicular digital twin (VDT) networks are an emerging network paradigm that are facilitating connected and autonomous vehicles. However, autonomous vehicles transmit real-time sensing privacy data to their corresponding digital twin representations through public communication channels within VDT intra-twin communication, thus exposing this communication to various threats of attack and potential data tampering. On this basis, a reliable and efficient data transmission scheme is urgently needed to ensure secure fine-grained data access control. In this context, this article introduced a new authenticated key agreement scheme, termed RSAKA-VDT, to authenticate user identity and enable confidential service data access. In particular, only vehicle users with proper access permissions are allowed to calculate the shared session key. The associated VDTs are deployed on the network edge in the suggested RSAKA-VDT. Identity authentication and session key negotiation are carried out between an autonomous vehicle user and the affiliated edge server. Subsequently, the generated session key encrypts real-time privacy data, ensuring secure data exchange for VDT intra-twin communication. Furthermore, we validated the security features of RSAKA-VDT using the random oracle model, heuristic security analysis, and the “automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications” (AVISPA) software tool. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis of RSAKA-VDT against six closely related user authentication schemes, evaluating security functionality attributes, computational costs, and communication overheads. Comparative performance results show that RSAKA-VDT meets all 18 security evaluation criteria while maintaining a better balance between practical usability and requirements for security functionality.},

With the increasing number of new energy vehicles, handling massive amounts of electricity transaction data has become an urgent problem in need of resolution. Ensuring the security of the vast quantities of electricity transaction data has emerged as a significant challenge. Therefore, two data aggregation schemes are proposed in this paper, both supporting batch verification and privacy protection in centralized and distributed scenarios, respectively. Firstly, an improved Paillier cryptosystem is utilized to achieve lightweight encryption in the proposed schemes. In addition, a novel distributed data aggregation structure that combines a large number of geographically distributed fog nodes with centralized cloud servers is introduced. This structure not only meets the requirements of lightweight encryption and resistance against single point failures but also reduces the communication complexity of distributed data aggregation to $O(n)$. According to the security proofs and experimental analysis, it can be demonstrated that both proposed schemes are effective and secure, meeting the lightweight requirements of modern smart grid systems.},

This paper resolves the following issue: how to minimize the worst-case response time (WCRT) of frame forwarding in TSN under no-wait scenarios to guarantee low-latency transmission, stability, and high success rate for in-vehicle TSN networks? Currently, some work resolves this problem by leveraging integer linear programming, and others apply heuristic methods to avoid the time complexity problem, but the success rate is affected since they are prone to get trapped in local optima. To reach a balance between time-complexity and success rate, a scheme named Frame Dynamic Priority Scheduling Mechanism (FDPSM) is proposed, where the frame dynamic priority levels are set up and frames are scheduled accordingly. The target is to maximize the success rate and minimize the WCRT for in-vehicle networks. We evaluate the proposed mechanism from aspects such as traffic forwarding time, size of windows, number of hops, and the network load, together with success rate and the simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the FDPSM for in-vehicle TSN networks.},

In this paper, we propose a novel visual SLAM system based on multi-task deep neural networks to address this issue. Specifically, we apply multi-task deep neural networks to extract higher quality and more robust oriented local features and perceive dynamic semantic regions, which are used to better remove dynamic points spatially and potential dynamic points semantically in the SLAM system.

In this paper, we consider a multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS downlink communication scenario, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to enhance the performance. Specifically, the delay- Doppler (DD) domain input-output relationship of such a system is first derived, based on which, the joint optimization of the precoding matrices and IRS reflection phase is studied to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) considering user fairness. Note that the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex. To tackle this challenge, we first reformulate the problem into a more traceable equivalent form by the weighted mean minimum square error (WMMSE) approach. Utilizing the characteristics of the DD domain signal relationship, we then decouple the reformulated problem and further transform it into two subproblems, which are solved by the Lagrangian function method and the project-descent-retracting (PDR) algorithm, respectively. The precoding matrices and reflection phase are jointly optimized by alternative optimization to maximize WSR. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with benchmark schemes, the proposed WMMSE-ALT can improve the rate more than 85% in IRS-assisted MU-MIMO-OTFS systems.},

Using PositionNet+, SSRnet is able to recover the sparse signal precisely, outperforming conventional methods, including least-squares (LS) estimation with perfectly known support, by virtue of its denoising behavior, while offering substantially reduced computation. The network is then utilized to perform channel estimation of high-mobility massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal time frequency space (MIMO-OTFS) wireless systems which is cast as a sparse signal recovery problem. In OTFS, data is modulated in the delay-Doppler domain to transform a fast time-varying and frequency-selective fading channel into a quasi-static and sparse channel. To maximize performance, OTFS systems require accurate channel estimation and low pilot signaling which are provided by SSRnet. Simulation and computational comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE), reduces pilot symbol overhead, as well as lowers computational complexity.},

This paper aims to adaptively tune the MPC parameters for an optimal BTM system using reinforcement learning. To achieve this, the nonlinear MPC controller is linearized at nominal operating points and transformed into an adaptive MPC controller. Leveraging a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning agent, the MPC decisive parameters, including weights of the cost function, lengths of the prediction horizon and control horizon, are regulated online. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a 5.8% reduction in energy consumption for BTM, an 18.8% decrease in constraints violation, and a substantial 59% reduction in MPC execution time compared to an MPC controller with fixed parameters. Additionally, the feasibility of the proposed reinforcement learning-driven adaptive MPC has been verified on a dSPACE machine. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of MPC optimization for enhancing battery management systems.},

The paper proposes a High-Altitude Platform aided Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (HAPFOA) as a novel approach to address sub-optimal path planning in dynamic complex environments by leveraging fruit fly&#39;s innate foraging strategies and adapting them to the three-dimensional challenges of UAV navigation at high altitudes. This approach applies the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA), where each UAV is analogous to a ‘fly’ exploring potential pathways. The paths chosen by these UAVs are evaluated using a comprehensive ‘smell’ metric that integrates crucial navigational factors such as closeness to the target, obstacle avoidance, energy utilization, and maneuverability. This process is iterative, with each UAV continuously adjusting its flight path based on the ‘smell’ metric feedback, aiming to find the route with the best possible ‘smell’ score. The algorithm helps to avoid obstacles during the vision phase. Cubic spline interpolation is used to refine and smoothen the UAV trajectories to ensure the practical application of these flight paths, making them more applicable and realistic for risky operations. Based on obstacle warnings from HAPUAV, the simulation results show an efficient route formulation by the proposed model with no idle time and a faster convergence rate. Another advantage of HAPFOA is its ability to preserve more energy than other models.},

This article explores Control Allocation (CA) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) concepts to meet the requirements for both conventional and electrified powertrains such as parallel hybrid electric transmissions. The CA and MPC strategies, previously proposed for the upshift inertia phase, are extended in this article to torque phase to obtain integrated optimal shift control strategies. These strategies optimally coordinate oncoming and off-going clutch torque with engine torque to balance the conflicting shift quality criteria reflecting shift comfort, duration, and efficiency. The designer sets the shift quality requirements through torque and inertia phase durations, reference and constraint profiles, and cost function weights, which facilitates calibration of the control strategy performance. To further improve the performance, the CA strategy is extended with a virtual torque sensor system during the torque phase. Two variants of MPC strategy are proposed and compared: (i) separate MPCs for torque and inertia phase and (ii) integrated MPC whose prediction model in torque phase spreads to the inertia phase. The CA and MPC strategies are realized in the form of constrained quadratic programs and efficiently solved on-line by an interior-point solver. Their performance is demonstrated and compared via nonlinear powertrain model simulations for 1-3 shift, including a system robustness analysis with respect to actuation parameter uncertainties.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes CoDrivingLLM, an interactive and learnable LLM-driven cooperative driving framework for all-scenario and all-CDA applications. First, an environment module updates vehicle positions based on semantic decisions, mitigating errors from LLM-controlled positioning. Second, leveraging the four CDA levels defined in SAE J3216, a centralized-distributed coupled architecture reasoning module is developed to ensure safe and efficient cooperation through centralized negotiation and distributed decision. Finally, by introducing a memory module that employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), CAVs are endowed with the ability to learn from their past experiences to avoid repeating mistakes. Through ablation studies and comparisons with other cooperative driving methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed CoDrivingLLM significantly enhances safety, efficiency, and adaptability across various scenarios.

At the same time, some malicious vehicles send forged motion information, attempting to deceive other CAVs, which poses a severe threat to traffic safety. To address these malicious attacks, we design a Large Language Model (LLM)-selectable misbehavior detection architecture to assess the authenticity of traffic signs and motion information of vehicles. Specifically, we first design a fine-tuning approach that integrates the adapter and LoRA through a gating mechanism for LLMs with fewer than 100 billion parameters and a fine-tuning method that combines local knowledge bases and prompt tuning for LLMs with more than 100 billion parameters. Then, we design detection schemes for false traffic signs and forged motion information, respectively. The former uses distance as the trigger condition, while the latter relies on the results of plausibility analysis. Finally, simulation results show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform traditional methods in misbehavior detection.},

To improve spectrum utilization and throughput, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used to reuse channels. However, different trajectories of UAVs and computing task assignment may lead to various communication delay and energy consumption. Additionally, regarding the high dynamic nature of SAGIN, it often falls into the dilemma of information uncertainty and curse of dimensionality. To overcome the above challenges, a hierarchical network model is designed, where UAVs and satellites collaborate to process users&#39; offloaded computing tasks. Then, a joint UAV trajectory design, task offloading, task assignment and computing resource allocation problem for minimizing system cost is then proposed. Due to the coupling between queue delay constraints and decision-making, Lyapunov optimization is applied to split the issue into three subproblems. Firstly, a UAV trajectory design and task offloading algorithm based on multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) is designed to deal with the curse of dimension issue. Then, the problem of joint task assignment and UAV computing resource allocation is solved via CVX due to that it is convex. Finally, a low-complexity Greedy-based Satellite Computing Resource Allocation (GSCRA) algorithm is proposed to obtain the minimum system cost.

  abstract     = {Vehicular networks face significant challenges in achieving high energy efficiency (EE) while guaranteeing diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements of users, especially under limited bandwidth and power budgets in highly dynamic and dense topologies. To address these challenges, this study formulates a joint resource optimization problem to maximize the average EE of cellular users (CUs) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users by jointly optimizing subchannel assignment, frequency reuse patterns, and power allocation while ensuring the required QoS of both users. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a semi-persistent scheduling (SPS)-based energy-efficient resource allocation scheme that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with network slicing (NS). Specifically, during the frequency reservation phase of SPS periods, CUs are assigned to network slices using the proposed NS grouping strategy, and V2V users are clustered into V2V NOMA clusters using the proposed clustering optimization algorithm. Frequency reuse patterns are then determined for network slices and V2V NOMA clusters. In the subsequent data transmission phase, a centralized energy-efficient iterative power control algorithm is introduced to enhance the average CU EE, and a distributed heuristic power control method is leveraged to improve the average V2V EE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline methods in improving EE and satisfying the required QoS of both CUs and V2V users while avoiding over-allocation of frequency resources.},

To address this and achieve integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) with higher spectral efficiency, in this letter, we propose a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm-aided non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme that enables a communication user and a sensing user to share same time and frequency resources, and extend it to multi-input multi-output (MIMO) scenarios. By using the EM algorithm, communication CSI, sensing CSI, and data symbols are iteratively estimated. Moreover, we introduce a new sensing pattern for highly accurate initial estimation of the communication channel, such that enhanced sensing channel estimation subsequently refines communication channel estimation. The initial sensing channel estimation performance is theoretically analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our approach for both phase shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals over the benchmark scheme.},

However, current research focuses more on fully connected or homogeneous energy consumption scenarios in eco-driving, ignoring the impact of human-driven vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) with high energy efficiency and regenerative braking capabilities. This study proposes a cooperative eco-driving framework for mixed vehicle platoons with heterogeneous energy at a signalized intersection. A Mixed Space-Time-State Network is developed to optimize the trajectory of connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), while predicting and describing the trajectories of human-driven vehicles. Then, a modified dynamic programming algorithm is formulated, which converts the highly nonlinear optimization problem into a state-space search problem. The solving efficiency is further improved by 85% with a feasible state space reduction algorithm, which can meet the real-time computational requirements. The result indicates that cooperation within the mixed platoon can smooth out the trajectory while considering the composition of energy consumption. In addition, the energy efficiency can be improved by 20.39% with a low CAV penetration rate.},

By doing so, the SSK scheme utilizes the activation status of mirror array blocks to transmit information and can avoid excessive utilization of mirror resources while achieving efficient and reliable communication. The fairness of the considered system is improved by introducing a mirror array grouping technique that relies on the channel gains. Concurrently, a novel joint SSK modulation scheme is proposed, whereby the mirror array block is activated in conjunction with the LED. This scheme employs a information bit-based activation technique to enhance spectral efficiency. Additionally, the low complexity orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) detection and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithms are employed.

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-THz communications, foreseen for sixth generation (6G), suffer from high propagation losses which affect the network coverage. Another challenge raised by the adoption of high frequency bands is the use of large bandwidths. In order to deal with this last challenge, a common configuration is to divide a large frequency band into multiple smaller subbands. In this context, we consider a mobile network where signaling related to measurements used for radio resource management is transmitted in one subband centered at frequency $f_{c}$ and data transmission is performed at a different frequency $f_{c} + \Delta f$ based on the measurements taken at $f_{c}$. Here, a challenge is that the array radiation pattern can be frequency dependent and, therefore, lead to beam misalignment, called beam squinting. Thus, in this work, we characterize beam squinting in the context of subband operation and propose a solution where the beam patterns to be employed at a given subband can be adjusted/compensated to mitigate beam squinting. For performance evaluation, we present a case study where our compensation method is employed in a network-controlled repeaters (NCRs)-assisted scenario. NCR, which have been standardized in third generation partnership project Release 18, are considered as cost-efficient solutions for coverage extension in the context of mmWave. Specifically, NCRs are radio frequency repeaters with beamforming capability controlled by the network through side control information. Our results show that, without compensation, the perceived signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and so the throughput can be substantially decreased due to beam squinting. However, with our proposed compensation method, the system is able to support NCR subband signaling operation with similar performance as if signaling and data were transmitted at the same frequency.},

  abstract     = {The GNSS-RTK and MEMS-IMU integrated navigation system is a commonly used high-precision, low-cost solution for outdoor positioning. However, the significant measurement error of MEMS-IMU can rapidly lead to divergence in navigation state predictions based on inertial error propagation models. To overcome this limitation and enhance accuracy, maintaining the continuity of RTK measurement information is crucial. Nevertheless, due to the instability of wireless transmission links and communication equipment, or disruptions in base station observations, differential corrections often experience outages, resulting in a decline in measurement information quality and affecting the accuracy of integrated navigation. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable RTK/MEMS-IMU tightly coupled algorithm. During outages of differential corrections, the proposed algorithm utilizes historical differential corrections from the base station along with real-time rover station information to construct a stable double-difference carrier phase vector. This approach ensures the stability of measurement information and enhances positioning accuracy. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of this method, and land tests have demonstrated that, compared to the traditional RTK/MEMS-IMU tightly coupled algorithm, the position and velocity accuracy of this algorithm during outages of differential corrections have been improved by 29.5% and 18.4%, respectively.},

To exploit the advantages of such space-aerial cooperative transmission, data transmission, and resource allocation should be jointly optimized under constrained resources in dynamic space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, the tight coupling between discrete transmission strategies and continuous resource allocation among users leads to a challenging long-term, large-scale, and non-convex optimization problem. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques have exhibited potential in addressing such problems, their limitations in handling discrete-continuous decisions and ensuring robust multi-agent cooperation often result in significant performance deterioration. In this paper, we propose a new MARL-based Cooperative Transmission Strategy (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. In MCTS, each agent employs a hybrid Actor-Critic (H-AC) algorithm, where the optimal discrete transmission strategy with its associated resource allocation is modeled as parameterized actions and determined by an improved AC structure. To enhance cooperation among agents, a multi-agent cooperation framework is designed based on QMIX, employing a centralized Critic to efficiently guide convergence toward optimal solutions while reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of MCTS over a number of benchmark algorithms and efficiency under various environments, in terms of overall transmitted data and resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced by onboard computing resources and inter-satellite links (ISLs), large-scale satellite networks (SNs) can supplement terrestrial networks, facilitating real-time edge computing and transmission in remote areas at low latency. This capability benefits applications such as real-time remote object tracking, vehicular edge computing, and environmental monitoring. However, different from terrestrial vehicular networks, satellite mobility and the intermittent nature of ISLs often render many computing satellites inaccessible, necessitating efficient scheduling scheme for joint computing and communication resource allocation. To meet this requirement, we investigate joint computing and transmission strategy for real-time computing applications over SNs to reduce end-to-end delays. We formulate the real-time computing and transmission problem over time-varying SNs as an integer linear programming problem. The mathematical optimization method has an exponential time complexity of ${O}(2|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| \cdot (4 |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }| + 4 |\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|)^{2|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|})$ in the worst case, which grows rapidly with the growth of network sizes. Here, $|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|$ and $|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|$ denote the number of nodes and links, respectively, within the time window ${\tau }$. Resorting to the designed $k$-shortest path-based method yields a worst-case complexity of $O(|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|! \cdot |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|^{3})$. While efficient under common scenarios, its running time is still relatively unstable and may become tens of times longer when computing resources become scarce. To enhance efficiency, we further design a graph-based algorithm that leverages the solution space&#39;s unique structure, thereby achieving optimal solutions with polynomial time complexity ${O}(3|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| + (2\log {|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|}+1) |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|)$. Extensive evaluations conducted on the world&#39;s largest Starlink system validate the efficacy of the designed methods and highlight their potential synergy.},

  abstract     = {As the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) evolves, integrating Location-Based Services (LBS) into in-vehicle software has become increasingly common. Consequently, protecting users&#39; location privacy has emerged as a critical concern. Vehicles face the challenge of sending query requests to untrusted Location Service Providers (LSP) through untrusted Roadside Units (RSU) to obtain relevant results. This situation presents two primary risks: (1) the involvement of untrusted RSU increases the likelihood of monitoring vehicle communications with the LSP, and (2) repeated queries to the untrusted LSP increase the risk of privacy breaches during interactions. This paper proposes an innovative location privacy protection scheme for continuous LBS in the IoV, called LPPS-IKHC, which combines improved $k$-anonymity with hybrid cache. The scheme utilizes anonymous techniques and hybrid cache to mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information to untrusted entities. To protect against adversaries, LPPS-IKHC generates specific anonymous sets in the presence of untrusted RSU. Additionally, an anonymous algorithm incorporating trajectory similarity is introduced to protect trajectory privacy, further enhancing user location privacy. Furthermore, by reducing the number of interactions between vehicles and untrusted LSP, hybrid caching helps diminish the risk of privacy disclosure. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the LPPS-IKHC method provides superior privacy protection and lower system overhead compared to existing schemes.},

  abstract     = {Rapid signal fluctuations due to blockage effects cause excessive handovers (HOs) and degrade mobility performance. By reconfiguring line-of-sight (LoS) Links through passive reflections, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has the potential to address this issue. Due to the lack of introducing blocking effects, existing HO analyses cannot capture excessive HOs or exploit enhancements via IRSs. This paper proposes an LoS state transition model enabling analysis of mobility enhancement achieved by IRS-reconfigured LoS links, where LoS link blocking and reconfiguration utilizing IRS during user movement are explicitly modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, the condition for blocking LoS links is characterized as a set of possible blockage locations, the distribution of available IRSs is thinned by the criteria for reconfiguring LoS links. In addition, neighboring BSs are categorized by probabilities of LoS states to enable HO decision analysis. By projecting distinct gains of LoS states onto a uniform equivalent distance criterion, mobility enhanced by IRS is quantified through the compact expression of HO probability. Results show the probability of dropping into non-LoS due to movement decreases by 70% when deploying IRSs with the density of $\rm { 93/km^{2}}$, and HOs decrease by 57% under the optimal IRS distributed deployment parameter.},

  abstract     = {For four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicles (4WID-EVs), the increasing number of actuators and electronic components raises the risk of actuator failure for the vehicle, potentially threatening driving safety. When actuator faults occur, the faulty actuator introduces disturbances to the vehicle system, making the coordinated control of actuators under fault conditions more difficult. To solve this problem, a capability-based hierarchical fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed for 4WID-EVs. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model under fault conditions is established. Secondly, in the upper layer of the control scheme, a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller with nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) is designed to track the reference vehicle states under the impact of disturbances. In the lower layer, the driving capability and steering capability of faulty vehicles are assessed. Subsequently, a capability-based fault-tolerant coordinated distribution approach using fuzzy logic is introduced to dynamically distribute control commands to actuators. Finally, comparative works are conducted through both simulation and experiment. The results demonstrate that, compared with the sliding mode FTC scheme, the proposed scheme reduces RMSE, reflecting an improvement in tracking accuracy by 75% in simulation and 18.6% in experiment. The proposed scheme may serve as a theoretical reference for fault-tolerant control in 4WID-EVs.},

Therefore, this article presents a novel Voice over NTN (VoNTN) mechanism that combines a parametric voice codec and an artificial intelligence (AI) reconstruction model, achieving remarkably low data rate requirements of sub-1 Kbps. The parametric voice codec operates by first compressing and encoding vocal acoustic features at an ultra-low bitrate of 450 bps. These compressed features then enable real-time streaming inference through the AI reconstruction model, which synthesizes high-quality audio waveforms. The reconstruction model has a three-layer neural network specifically engineered for resource-constrained satellite equipment, achieving low inference latency with lightweight computational load. We implement and evaluate VoNTN in our testbed using an actual narrowband satellite. Experimental results show that VoNTN can provide a low-latency and high-fidelity voice service without high-performance computing hardware.},

We propose an easy-to-implement, novel spatial domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) method, where an additional radio-frequency (RF) chain is implemented on the transmitter side of the FD transceiver to perform SIC only. The main idea is to transmit a specific SIC signal through the additional RF chain to the receiver of the FD system to mitigate the self-interference (SI). Based on this approach, we demonstrate that conventional MIMO precoders, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF), can gain SIC capability within our system model, enabling FD operation of the transceiver system. In particular, we show that the ZF precoder outperforms the RZF precoder in terms of SIC. Furthermore, we assess our proposed SIC strategy in terms of energy efficiency (EE) and show through theory and simulation that our method is more energy-efficient than other existing methods for a weakly correlated communication channel. Additionally, our simulation results highlight the influence of the number of antennas dedicated to transmitting the SIC signal in our approach, providing a practical and clear understanding of the SIC performance and EE for both the ZF and RZF precoders.},

As the foundation of blockchain technology, the consensus protocol determines system performance and security. However, the high mobility and limited resources of UAVs render traditional consensus protocols, which require substantial resources, unsuitable for UAV networks. The dynamic nature of UAVs results in topology changes, further exacerbating the network environment&#39;s complexity. Therefore, we propose an adaptive chained byzantine fault tolerance (ACBFT) protocol tailored specifically for UAV network environments. This protocol utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the chain consensus process, enhancing robustness and reducing communication overhead. In addition, we propose several sub-protocols to assist ACBFT in handling unexpected situations, including the rechaining protocol for managing malicious nodes, joining and exiting protocols for dynamic nodes, and strategies for handling accident situations such as UAV loss. Our security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate that ACBFT not only increases throughput and reduces communication overhead, but also ensures security and efficiency},

This paper primarily proposes a category of highprecision Kalman filtering methods to enhance the estimation accuracy of train operation states. Firstly, we establish identification methods for discarding residual terms in the state and measurement models, and design a new type of Extended Kalman Filter, referred to as the Residual-based Extended Kalman Filter (REKF), which incorporates the statistical characteristics of the residual terms in the Kalman filter framework. Furthermore, a REKF-embedded deep neural network (DREKF) is developed to further augment the REKF&#39;s capability in nonlinear systems. Numerical simulations show that the REKF improves the estimation accuracy by more than 5% on average compared to the EKF, and the DREKF estimation accuracy is better than the REKF with higher stability.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a frozen watermarking-based federated learning (FL) framework that protects both model integrity and privacy. The proposed approach integrates frozen watermarking into the global model, ensuring intellectual property security without degrading model accuracy in a continual learning setting. Additionally, we design an incentive mechanism based on a Stackelberg game between the CEC and mobile vehicles (MVs) to encourage participation in FLEVS while maintaining system efficiency. This mechanism derives the optimal information security strategy and determines the closed-form solution for the optimal reward function and local iteration requirements.

To address the proposed NP-hard problem, we decompose it into three subproblems, i.e., the task chain optimization problem, the power optimization problem, and the UAV trajectory optimization problem. We then propose a task chain selection algorithm to more efficiently address the task chain optimization problem by transforming invalid solutions into valid ones.

Each user equipment (UE) encode its message with a practical lattice code, where we suggest a $2^{m}$-ary ring code with symbol-wise bijective mapping to $2^{m}$-PAM. The coded-modulated signal is spread with its designated signature sequence, and all $K$ UEs transmit simultaneously. The LCMA receiver choose some integer coefficients, computes the associated $K$ streams of integer linear combinations (ILCs) of the UEs&#39; messages, and then reconstruct all UEs&#39; messages from these ILC streams. To execute this, we put forth new efficient LCMA soft detection algorithms, which calculate the a posteriori probability of the ILC over the lattice. The complexity is of order no greater than $O(K)$, suitable for massive access of a large $K$. The soft detection outputs are forwarded to $K$ ring-code decoders, which employ $2^{m}$-ary belief propagation to recover the ILC streams. To identify the optimal integer coefficients of the ILCs, a new “ bounded independent vectors problem” (BIVP) is established. We then solve this BIVP by developing a new rate-constraint sphere decoding algorithm, significantly outperforming existing LLL and HKZ lattice reduction methods. Then, we develop optimized signature sequences of LCMA using a new target-switching steepest descent algorithm. With our developed algorithms, LCMA is shown to support a significantly higher load of UEs and exhibits dramatically improved error rate performance over state-of-the-art multiple access schemes such as interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) and sparse-code multiple-access (SCMA). The advances are achieved with just parallel processing and $K$ single-user decoding operations, avoiding the implementation issues of successive interference cancelation and iterative detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in the presence of signal-dependent modulated jamming (SDMJ). Our goal is to suppress jamming while carrying out simultaneous communications and sensing. We minimize the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the mismatch filter output for the transmitted waveform and the integrated level (IL) of the mismatch filter output for the jamming, under the constraints of the loss in-processing gain (LPG) and the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted waveform. Meanwhile, the similarity constraint is introduced for information-bearing transmit waveform. We develop a decoupled majorization minimization (DMM) algorithm to solve the proposed multi-constrained optimization problem. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed algorithm transforms the difficult optimization problem involving two variables into two parallel sub-problems with one variable, thus significantly speeding up the convergence rate. Furthermore, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is introduced to compute the closed-form solution of each sub-problem, giving rise to a greatly reduced computation complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed ISAC system which strikes a proper trade-off among sensing and jamming suppression.},

This paper aims to fill the gap in the theoretical analysis of the optimal pair-wise SDoF of multiple full-duplex node systems from an information theory perspective when the channel state information remains unknown to each node at the beginning of the coherence interval. To this end, we first derive an upper bound of the achievable SDoF of the system using the optimal signal structure of the pair-wise secrecy rate. Then, by demonstrating that the upper bound is achievable using Gaussian signals, the optimal SDoF of the system is derived. The numerical results verify that the obtained optimal pair-wise SDoF extends the existing research with two legitimate nodes and increases the optimal SDoF by adjusting the number of out-of-pair transmit antennas appropriately},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a promising solution for enhancing the reliability and data rate of Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) visible light communication (VLC) systems through the utilization of optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The focus is on the infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) scenario, where streetlights serve as internet access points. The IoV-VLC system is modeled using an advanced non-sequential raytracing approach. A novel closed-form channel model expression is proposed, incorporating transceiver, RIS, and infrastructure parameters. The proposed model is then validated against broadband raytracing simulation results considering different combinations of system parameters, including, receiver aperture size, streetlight pole height, spacing between the poles, and RIS height. Moreover, based on the derived channel model, the error rate and data rate performances of the system are analyzed. The required numbers of RIS elements allocated to each vehicle&#39;s location, to achieve a target error rate and data rate values, are further derived. Finally, this paper demonstrates the impact of various transceiver, RIS, and infrastructure parameters on the system performance. The obtained results reveal that the proposed IoV-VLC system with optimal RIS deployment effectively addresses system outage issues and meets reliability and data speed requirements regardless of the vehicle&#39;s location. The results also shed light on the influence of various factors on system performance. Notably, the total number of required RIS elements is significantly affected by factors such as receiver aperture size, space between the poles, and transmit power budget. For instance, when considering the same power budget and error rate target, the required number of RIS elements for spacing distances of 20 m, 22 m, and 24 m are determined as 132, 244, and 428 elements, respectively. Conversely, the impact of pole height is found to be minimal as long as the space between the poles remains fixed and within the prescribed regulations.},

The multi-user multiple-input multiple output (MU-MIMO) communication and the sensing task of multi-target directions of arrival (MT-DOA) estimation are performed simultaneously within the system. Specifically, we formulate the joint beamforming as a min-max problem, aiming to minimize the maximum Cram&#39;er-Rao bound (CRB) for the MT-DOA estimations while ensuring a threshold of the MU-MIMO communication rates. Existing methods have not been successful in the beamforming design for such systems, and we propose a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) framework for solving the problem. Within the PRMO, a product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) is constructed as the solution space, where the constraints of the precoding matrix and IRS phase shifts are naturally satisfied. The problem is transformed via the penalty method, and the parallel Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (P-RBFGS) algorithm and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method are exploited to find a feasible solution over the PRMS. Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain brought by the optimized IRS and verify the effectiveness of the proposed PRMO compared with other schemes for the CRB minimization problem with communication rate constraints.},

  abstract     = {Gravity gradient-aided navigation is a promising navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), in which matching algorithm is its key technology. Image matching algorithms have higher matching accuracy and information utilization than single point matching and sequence matching. However, the spatial domain image feature matching ability is weak in areas with insignificant feature changes due to the uneven feature distribution in the gravity gradient reference map. To break through this limitation and solve the problem of insufficient spatial domain image feature matching ability, we propose a gravity gradient image matching network (GGIMN) with adaptive adjoint smoothing for AUV navigation and positioning. First, a training set for GGIMN with equal numbers of positive and negative samples is constructed by preparing the gravity gradient reference map and fitting the gravity gradient measured map. Then, the feature extraction part of MatchNet is expanded to construct a deep learning network with five gravity gradient twin towers in parallel. Subsequently, an adaptive adjoint smoothing method that combines the idea of sequence matching is proposed to solve the problem of unsmooth matching trajectory and further improve the matching accuracy. Finally, the GGIMN is trained offline, and the gravity gradient map is matched and positioned online. The results of marine experiments show that the GGIMN has higher matching and positioning accuracy, and the average positioning error is reduced beyond 70% compared with onedimensional matching algorithms such as single-point iteration and sequence matching.},

The proposed detector exploits the characteristics of NTN line-of-sight (LoS) channels, where the path gain of the LoS channel is much stronger than that of the non-LoS (NLoS) channel. Specifically, we adopt multiple detection thresholds to capture PA collisions, allowing the satellite to recognize and notify the PA collision, thereby facilitating fast random access retrials. Also, we leverage multiple root Zadoff-chu (ZC) sequences while suppressing interference, so that the probability of PA collision is significantly reduced. Moreover, we mathematically analyze the performance of the proposed detector in terms of the probability of successful PA collision detection, the probability of false collision alarm, average random access delay, and average random access-success nodes under typical NTN LoS channel conditions. Simulation results verify that the proposed multiple threshold-based early PA collision detector (MT-eCD) achieves significantly improved performance over the conventional early PA collision detection schemes in terms of random access delay, number of random access-success nodes, and resource efficiency, while satisfying the random access requirement.},

  abstract     = {As spectrum utilization becomes increasingly scarce due to the exponential growth of intelligent connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), developing efficient communication protocols with simultaneous improvements in energy and spectrum usage is critical in response to the demands of cost-effective IoT devices. In this work, we propose a hybrid orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple-access protocol in coordinated direct uplink/downlink and relay transmission for low-cost IoT paradigms, where a source node engages in direct transmission with proximate IoT users and relies on a relay node for distant connections. This protocol offers a successive interference cancellation–free approach and does not require any channel disparity for power allocation. Exact and asymptotic analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly improves OP–by 8 folds for the respective proximate users while maintaining the same OP for distant users over classical coordinated non-orthogonal multiple access–and delivers superior EC performance for proximate IoT users at low to moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and distant users at most SNR. Moreover, critical tasks for minimizing the maximal OP and maximizing the ergodic sum capacity have been undertaken to achieve outage fairness and enhance the overall system&#39;s capacity. These non-convex problems are efficiently addressed by applying the analytical asymptotic-inspired alternative optimization.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles, often parked for long periods, are ideally suited to serve as computational nodes to expand the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure, with containerization significantly enhancing the system&#39;s load balancing, self-healing, resource isolation, and security. However, fluctuations in task demand and frequent container image downloads during peak hours create high loads on containerized nodes, as multiple mobile devices offload tasks simultaneously, leading to significant processing delays. Many existing studies make the simplified assumption of predefined patterns of task arrivals, which overlooks this issue and makes suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we consider a Parked Vehicles (PVs)-extended MEC scenario, where multiple devices request services on PVs functioning as edge servers, all controlled by a central base station. Task arrivals follow observed patterns based on long-term trends, such as peak and off-peak periods, resembling realistic arrival patterns rather than predefined ones. To optimize task offloading by identifying these patterns, we propose the Sequence-Aware Task Scheduling (SATS) algorithm, which is a policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning approach that integrates Transformer and LSTM architectures to capture patterns in time-series task arrivals and relationships between nodes in a collaborative and containerized environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of online task scheduling. The primary objective of SATS is to optimize the task offloading policy and minimize delay and energy consumption for all devices and PVs. Extensive numerical comparisons against baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our algorithm.},

Moreover, to further enhance performance, we employ a gradient projection method to mitigate the impact of EMI. The numerical results show that the EMI negatively impacts the outage performance of devices, especially for the near device in the NOMA pair.

The proposed sensing scheme gets rid of the danger and reduces the complexity of sensing processes and train systems because trains do not have to communicate directly with sensors. In this sensing scheme, the RFEHS receives dual polarization (DP) signal, which is all of the base station&#39;s polarizations so that the sensor operation gets more frequent. The harvesting capability of DP and linear polarization (LP) from a real base station is compared. To prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing scheme, the RF energy harvesting was conducted from a base station on the rail track.

While blockchain-based privacy-preserving authentication solutions have been successfully implemented to realize vehicle communication security and protect data privacy, most of these schemes are not directly applicable in real-world scenarios (e.g., blockchain-based solutions face issues such as high authentication overhead, excessive interactions, unreliable shared data, and inconsistent data quality). To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-based reputation system for vehicular networks. Specifically, we combine ring signatures with a reputation mechanism to ensure the reliability of shared data. The security analysis demonstrates that our scheme meets the necessary security and privacy requirements. Performance analysis further shows that our scheme outperforms existing solutions in terms of communication and computational overhead. Extensive experimental results confirm that this scheme is well-suited for deployment in vehicular networks applications.},

Existing MAC protocols are ill-suited for FANETs, which require spatial reuse and real-time adaptation. To address this, we propose the directional physical carrier sensing space division multiple access (DPCS-SDMA) protocol, integrating MIMO-based ISAC with backscatter communication for real-time UAV tracking, directional sensing, and efficient spatial reuse. By eliminating RTS/CTS control frames, our protocol reduces delay, improves throughput, and resolves hidden/exposed terminal issues with multi-directional carrier sensing. Simulations confirm its superior performance in throughput and access delay, making it ideal for large-scale FANETs demanding energy efficiency, low latency, and high adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic systems are becoming increasingly congested, leading to severe exhaust pollution, with intersections acting as bottlenecks in these systems. Fortunately, platoon driving can reduce fuel consumption and emissions on roads while improving intersection throughput. However, due to the complexity of intersections, the application of platoon driving still faces significant challenges. Existing studies often encounter reduced traffic efficiency when multiple platoons wait simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an adaptive platoon control scheme named APC for intersection scenarios to reduce travel time and fuel consumption during the passage through intersections. APC includes two main components: speed trajectory planning and optimal length planning. The speed trajectory planning minimizes delay and fuel consumption at intersections, and the optimal length planning ensures correct platoon maneuvers before intersection passage. Simulation experiments on the open-source platform VENTOS show that APC reduces travel time and fuel consumption by 20.30% and 13.99%, respectively, compared to similar methods. Particularly in high-density traffic, APC reduces travel time and fuel consumption by 23.08% and 19.58%, respectively. The code is available at: https://github.com/crashcar/APC-Demo/tree/main},

  abstract     = {The complexity and suddenness of secondary geological disasters make it difficult to predict the risks in advance. Therefore, implementing rapid and sustainable monitoring of these hazards is crucial. However, due to the variability of geological disasters across regions and their evolution over time, ensuring timely data collection and the ability to respond flexibly to disaster conditions presents a significant challenge. This paper designs a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture for secondary disaster monitoring scenarios, including the follower UAV (FUAV) and the collector UAV (CUAV). Based on this architecture, a reinforcement learning-based low-delay data collection scheme (RLDC) is introduced. The scheme prioritizes the data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) with higher importance and dynamically plans the paths of UAVs to adapt to environmental changes. First, to address the challenge of data delay caused by the inability to precisely locate SNs, a path search algorithm based on fuzzy SN location is proposed. Second, to reduce data transmission delay between the FUAV and the CUAV, a load status update algorithm for FUAV is presented. Lastly, considering the dynamic changes in the importance of SNs, a bidirectional long short-term memory network multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient path planning algorithm (BMADDPG) is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the scheme can adapt to dynamic secondary geological disaster monitoring scenarios and achieve low-delay data collection from SNs.},

Subsequently, a novel prescribed-time distributed observer with low data transfer is developed, which is capable of estimating the states of leader UAV without the acceleration boundary of the leader UAV. Then, next by using the prescribed performance control technique to facilitate transform error, a prescribed-time formation control method is constructed to guarantee the collision avoidance among UAVs. The developed control method enables the formated follower UAVs to track the trajectory of the leader UAV within a prescribed-time, and obstacles can be effectively circumvented without disrupting the predefined formation.

This paper proposes line process model for IRS-assisted vehicular networks and analyzes system performance via stochastic geometry, where base stations (BSs), IRSs and obstacles are distributed according to one-dimensional (1D) Poisson point process (PPP) and IRS will provide virtual LOS link when V2I link is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, the difference between IRS perfect reflecting gain and random scattering is taken into account, where the signal from the serving BS is reflecting beamformed by IRS while the interference from the neighboring BSs is randomly scattered. In addition, the blockage effect is modeled by Bernoulli variable and the trade-off between IRS deployment and obstacle density can be exploited. Theoretical results show that, system coverage probability is significantly improved by 81$\%$ with the optimal deployment density of IRS compared with no IRS scenario.},

The generalized joined coupler (GJC) matrix is a promising candidate for JCAS, offering a compact design and the ability to generate independently scannable multiple beams. However, the GJC matrix suffers from severe beam splitting problems when one beam approaches or overlaps with another, due to anti-phases among elements caused by its inherent structure. In this paper, the beam splitting issue of the GJC matrix is investigated. Reconfigurable directional couplers are adopted and configured with two different sets of values depending on whether there is beam overlapping. A joint scanning multibeam optimization (JSMO) method is developed to eliminate the beam splitting for the Blass-like GJC matrix by optimizing the coupler coefficients using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. It allows for simultaneous consideration of multiple potential beam overlapping scenarios in the optimization. Moreover, for the Nolen-like GJC matrix, an improved JSMO (IJSMO) method is developed by incorporating an alternating coupler and phase optimization (ACPO) strategy into the JSMO method. Representative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the JSMO and IJSMO methods in addressing the beam splitting issue. For the first time, continuous multibeam scanning has been enabled for GJC matrices without beam splitting, making them well-suited for JCAS.},

This shift, however, introduces severe sensing-communication coupling interference. Due to the openness nature of the wireless medium, ISAC enabled IoV faces more significant security concerns. Centered at the communication interference, traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes aim to maximize the channel quality difference between legitimate and eavesdropping channels to ensure the perfect secrecy. However, transforming directly current PLS methods into secure communication in ISAC-assisted IoV systems faces two significant challenges, because of sensing-communication coupling interference and strong directional beamforming caused by higher frequency bands. To address these challenges, this paper formulates an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the average secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmission power allocation and radar sensing power allocation, while ensuring the desired sensing accuracy and transmission reliability. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to optimizing transmission power or radar sensing power individually, joint optimization significantly improves the average secrecy rate upon convergence, with increases of at least 265% and 441%, respectively.},

To this end, the vehicle dynamics model is firstly established with consideration of the influence of wheel speed. Then, the DMPC scheme is designed, including the formulation of the optimization problem for the node vehicles and the implementation process of the predictive controller. The sufficient condition of asymptotic stability for the platoon is derived by taking the sum of the cost functions of node vehicles as the Lyapunov function. Finally, the proposed control scheme is evaluated by simulations both in high and low adhesion road conditions. The results show that the proposed integrated control scheme of vehicular platoon can effectively ensure the asymptotic stability of the platoon in a broad range of operation conditions. Furthermore, incorporating wheel speed error can enhance the holistic following performance by 44% and 23% under high and low adhesion road conditions.},

  abstract     = {With the help of communication technology and intelligent transportation system, smart parking has been further upgrading. Compared with traditional parking, smart parking alleviates users from finding available parking slots, through notifying users of available slot locations in advance. However, existing schemes on non-reservation smart parking may cause parking competition, because users will compete for the common known available slots. Although the reservation-based smart parking alleviates parking competition through reserving at slot for users in advance, it may cause parking difficulty when there are no available slots for reserving. A comprehensive parking service is urgently needed, to reduce parking competition under non-reservation smart parking and parking difficulty under reservation-based smart parking. Hence, we propose the CRPark, to manage both the reservation and competition smart parking services. Through the Gaussian Mixture model and heuristic algorithm, we determine the optimal parking lot reservation management strategy, to reduce both parking competition and parking difficulty. Besides, the parking competition analysis helps to estimate the parking cost accurately, so that parking cost can be reduced. Through simulation experiments, our scheme outperforms other schemes on reducing parking cost and balancing parking demand.},

In the temporal domain, a frame is systematically divided into distinct segments for sensing and communication. Notably, this architecture allows for differentiated power allocations between these two functional segments, satisfying the corresponding performance requirements. Then, simultaneous time and power optimization problems with the objective of enhancing sensing and communication subject to the maximum transmitted power and sensing or rate constraints are formulated Subsequently, the maximum sensing range is determined under these dual constraints. A critical threshold of the sensing range is identified, enabling the optimal use of maximum power and a single time slot for sensing to achieve superior communication rate performance while guaranteeing the sensing requirements.

Multi-BS cooperation can effectively address this issue by leveraging the LoS paths from other BSs. However, applying traditional single-BS BA schemes to multi-BS cooperation scenarios leads to a substantial training overhead. To address this, we propose a sensing-aided simultaneous multi-BS BA (SSMBA) strategy in this paper. In the first phase, compressed sensing (CS) is utilized to enable simultaneous multi-beam training across multiple BSs, significantly reducing training overhead. In the second phase, leveraging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities, a sensing-aided beam refinement technique is introduced to further increase BA accuracy and beamforming gain.

Addressing these challenges, we propose an adaptive filtering framework for DOA estimation that effectively tackles convergence speed, sparsity promotion, and array thinning. Typically, the complex Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is employed for error minimization of the adaptive process. In this work, we propose a sparsity constrained complex normalized LMS (NLMS) method for DOA estimation, which introduces faster convergence compared to the conventional complex LMS and NLMS adaptive methods. The sparsity constrained formulation of the proposed method is converted into an unconstrained problem by using a variable penalty factor (VPF). The update rules of the DOA filter weight and the VPF of the proposed complex VPF NLMS algorithm are derived. Further, we introduce a complex convex VPF NLMS algorithm that uses a convex combination of two complex VPF NLMS filters to further enhance the DOA estimation performance. We also present a theoretical derivation of the condition for mean square convergence of the proposed complex VPF NLMS adaptive algorithm. The performances of the proposed algorithms have been assessed through different simulations that highlight their effectiveness. Since the proposed algorithm promotes sparsity in the DOA weight vector, we also examine its performance in scenarios of array thinning, where not all sensors are utilized for DOA estimation.},

However, channel estimation (CE) in RIS-assisted wireless communication systems faces many challenges due to the limited signal processing capability of the RIS. Existing methods often fail to fully capture the non-uniform sparsity of mmWave channels. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive sparse CE scheme involving two progressive algorithms, i.e., normalized least mean squares–log sum (NLMS-LOG) and normalized least mean squares–normalized least mean fourth–log sum (NLMS-NLMF-LOG), for RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO systems. The proposed scheme selectively adjusts the channel coefficients to improve the accuracy of the estimation, enabling more efficient exploitation of the inherent non-uniform sparsity in mmWave channels. The NLMS-LOG algorithm innovatively incorporates a log-sum penalty term into the cost function of the NLMS algorithm, thereby increasing the convergence rate. Building upon NLMS-LOG, the NLMS-NLMF-LOG algorithm employs a mixed error function to achieve superior performance across different SNR conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods, such as the NLMS, sparse exponential forgetting window least mean square, and sparse hybrid adaptive filtering algorithms, in terms of CE accuracy and convergence speed.},

However, existing TL frameworks cannot react well to the heterogeneous feature dimensions of fingerprints caused by the topology variations of base stations (BSs) in evolving long-term environments. To address this issue, we propose a spatial feature topology-based heterogeneous knowledge transfer framework tailored for long-term fingerprint positioning (SFTP). Firstly, we partition the heterogeneous features into common and domain-specific (including source and target-specific) features from static and dynamic environmental components perspectives, respectively. Notably, we observe that the features captured from BSs with significant spatial distances differ across all samples, while those from BSs with close spatial distances show higher similarity. Based on these observations, we approximate the cross-domain mapping for each domain-specific feature by integrating the mappings of similar common features, which are easy to achieve using deep neural networks (DNNs). Subsequently, the heterogeneous feature spaces are effectively transformed into homogeneous counterparts, and a deep adaptation network (DAN) is utilized to further predict the positions for testing samples. Hence, SFTP is capable of capturing evolutionary environmental information for long-term positioning. Finally, real-world experimental results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed framework.},

However, their passive nature, non-diagonal reflection matrix, and the large number of coupled reflecting elements complicate the channel state information (CSI) estimation process. The challenge further escalates in scenarios with fast-varying channels. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing novel joint channel estimation and prediction strategies with low overhead and high accuracy for two different RIS architectures in a BD-RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output system under correlated fast-fading environments with channel aging. The channel estimation procedure utilizes the Tucker2 decomposition with bilinear alternative least squares, which is exploited to decompose the cascade channels of the BD-RIS-assisted system into effective channels of reduced dimension. The channel prediction framework is based on a convolutional neural network combined with an autoregressive predictor. The estimated/predicted CSI is then utilized to optimize the RIS phase shifts aiming at the maximization of the downlink sum rate. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is robust to channel aging, and exhibits a high estimation accuracy. Moreover, our scheme can deliver a high average downlink sum rate, outperforming other state-of-the-art channel estimation methods. The results also reveal a remarkable reduction in pilot overhead of up to 98% compared to baseline schemes, all imposing low computational complexity.},

Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian learning (BL) framework for determining both the analog and digital components of the hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) from the FDBF. The above designs are subsequently extended to employing eigenvector perturbation theory for constructing the robust TPC for the cell-free mmWave MIMO downlink, where the users have multiple receive antennas (RAs). Furthermore, the multi-dimensional covariance fitting (MCF) framework is harnessed for designing the robust TPC of the corresponding uplink. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed TPC designs is evaluated by simulation results both in terms of their ability to mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI), and improving the spectral efficiency achieved.

Notably, the key parameters in the LCR are reduced to closed-form, which are shown to be the generalizations of the previously reported ones from the two-ring model. The good agreement between the theoretical and the simulated LCRs/AFDs demonstrates not only the usefulness of the simulation models but also the correctness of the theoretical derivations. Based on those analytical expressions, the impacts of some unique model parameters are studied on the LCR, and the burst error rate of the U2U Rician fading channels is analyzed via the AFD.},
