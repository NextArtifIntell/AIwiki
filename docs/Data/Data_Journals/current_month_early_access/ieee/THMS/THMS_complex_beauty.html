  abstract     = {Virtual fixture is a powerful tool to improve safety and efficiency for co-manipulation tasks. However, traditional virtual fixtures with constant stiffness are inadequate for scenarios where robots need to leave the constraints to perform tasks. To address this, we propose an adaptive virtual fixture based on the motion refinement tube, which dynamically adjusts the guiding force according to the distribution of trajectories. To prevent tube deformation in the Cartesian space due to the neglect of off-diagonal elements of covariance matrices, the refinement tube radii and nonlinear stiffness terms are computed in local coordinate systems based on the decomposed covariance matrix. An energy-tank-based passivity controller is designed to ensure system stability when employing the virtual fixture with state-dependent stiffness terms. In the validation tests with 18 participants, the proposed method showed improvements in task efficiency (18.69% increase) and collision avoidance (97.87% reduction) for a typical pick-and-place task with scattered materials. It also provided better subjective experiences of the users than traditional virtual fixtures. Meanwhile, compared with the method that neglects off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix, the proposed method exhibited a 4.28% efficiency improvement and a 40.42% decrease in collision occurrences.},

The immersive nature of VR often results in decreased eye blinking and movement, putting users at risk of developing conditions such as dry eye syndrome and eye strain. In this article, we propose visual interfaces to induce temporary eye blinks or movements by drawing users&#39; attention temporarily in order to mitigate the negative effects of VR on eye health. Our proposed interfaces can induce eye blinking and movement, which are known to mitigate eye problems in VR. The experimental results confirmed that our interfaces increase the frequency of eye blinking and movement in VR users.},

  abstract     = {Present machine learning approaches to steer generative models rely on the availability of manual human input. We propose an alternative approach to supervising generative machine learning models by directly detecting task-relevant information from brain responses. That is, requiring humans only to perceive stimulus and react to it naturally. Brain responses of participants (N=30) were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) while they perceived artificially generated images of faces and were instructed to look for a particular semantic feature, such as “smile” or “young”. A supervised adversarial autoencoder was trained to disentangle semantic image features by using EEG data as a supervision signal. The model was subsequently conditioned to generate images matching users&#39; intentions without additional human input. The approach was evaluated in a validation study comparing brain-conditioned models to manually conditioned and randomly conditioned alternatives. Human assessors scored the saliency of images generated from different models according to the target visual features (e.g., which face image is more “smiling” or more “young”). The results show that brain-supervised models perform comparably to models trained with manually curated labels, without requiring any manual input from humans.},

  abstract     = {Measuring cognitive workload (CWL) is crucial for dynamic task reallocation (i.e., adaptation) between a human and a machine in a human-machine system (HMS). A conventional measurement of the CWL is based on subjectively reported scores about the six factors of the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire. The questionnaire cannot however capture real-time fluctuations of the factors for an objective quantification. Additionally, each of the factors is associated with distinct activities and can be influenced by individual characteristics and/or task contexts. Such HMS adaptation should thus consider the objective quantification of each factor. So far, the quantification remains largely unexplored, while existing studies reveal a potential use of an electroencephalography (EEG) in measuring the CWL levels (e.g., high, medium, and low). Herein, we presented a pioneering study to propose EEG features for quantifying the factors. The pertinence of the features was demonstrated by their strong correlations with the scores of the factors across three distinct cases of visuomotor tasks. The pertinence is the stepping stone toward factor-based interventions in enabling HMS adaptation.},

Based on 101 academic papers published from 1996–2024, this article identifies research themes using thematic analysis, technological analysis, comparative analysis, and knowledge integration. The results show that academic interest and attention to H-AI have gradually increased since 2020. Through the results of thematic analysis, this article synthesizes five applications of H-AI domains: industry field, medical field, entertainment field, transportation field, and other fields. By analyzing the impact of H-AI on the integration of the virtual and real world, the role of H-AI in both the virtual and real worlds and the improvements over artificial intelligence will be outlined. This article also identifies challenges and responses that need further attention: disputes over responsibility ownership, bubble issues, lack of trust, and high-cost issues. This article looks ahead to add new skills to the metaverse platform, drive the metaverse as the next wave of the digital economy, promote the new field of metaverse combined with traditional, increase metaverse assistance to people with disabilities, and promote the systematization of the metaverse. This article helps enhance researchers&#39; and practitioners&#39; understanding of H-AI in the metaverse while raising awareness about the current research frontiers and potential future directions.},

  abstract     = {This study considered the speed hump as a spring, inducing psychological pressure on the rider to regulate their speed. The experiments were conducted on a motorized two-wheeler simulator in a randomized order in four situations: 1) normal, 2) distraction, 3) time pressure, and 4) distraction under time pressure. Naturalistic riding data was also collected to validate the results in normal riding conditions. First, seven latent classes were developed to understand the variation in speed of the rider along the road stretch as the rider approached or departed away from the speed hump. Further, using the spring-mass block theory, the riders&#39; speed was considered to be the combination of constant base speed and varying simple harmonic motion speed. The spring-mass block theory was validated by developing univariate Bayesian regression models. Finally, the impact of inadequate marking and driving assistance systems such as advanced warning, individual vehicle attributes, lifestyle, and road crash history on the speed profile has been quantified using linear mixed effect models. Furthermore, the speed profile equations were validated using field data. The results revealed that unmarked speed humps were less detectable as the riders responded seven meters late to inadequately visible speed humps compared to marked speed humps. The advanced warning helped in smoothening the speed profile of the rider, which is crucial in avoiding crashes due to the speed hump. Overall, this study can further help in improving the adaptability of the advanced driver assistance systems and evidence-based policy making of speed hump placement to minimize road crashes.},
