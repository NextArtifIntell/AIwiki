  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as valuable tools in intelligent transportation systems, offering potential for real-time traffic monitoring and emergency response. However, the limited flight endurance of UAVs restricts their ability to collect large amounts of traffic event data crucial for data-driven models. While simulation platforms provide an alternative data source, a significant visual gap persists between synthetic and real images. Given the unique characteristics of UAV perspectives, where objects typically appear smaller, and the challenges faced by existing generative approaches in maintaining structural and semantic consistency, this paper proposes a novel generative approach. Our method integrates semantic mask guidance with a style-modulated Transformer-based GAN architecture to address these issues. Our approach first utilizes the Segment-Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to extract semantic masks from GTA V simulated images. Subsequently, we introduce Spatially-Attentive Denormalization Modules (SADM) within the generator. These modules incorporate semantic mask statistics to enhance image quality and maintain consistency. Furthermore, we develop a perceptual discriminator incorporating a “memory bank” mechanism to more effectively evaluate image realism and stabilize the training process. To further enhance the quality of generated images, we develop a comprehensive training strategy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative metrics (i.e., FID and KID) and qualitative visual assessments, thus highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. Overall, our approach offers a robust solution for generating highly realistic traffic event images from UAV perspectives, effectively addressing the scarcity of real-world UAV-recorded traffic event data.},

  abstract     = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are referred to as self-driving vehicles that will become an essential component of future intelligent transportation systems. These CAVs will be equipped with various sensors for perceiving their surroundings and onboard computing capabilities to process sensor data in real-time. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is one of the essential sensors used for detecting objects and accurate distance estimation. However, LiDAR sensors are susceptible to several types of attacks. Adversaries can exploit LiDAR sensors either physically, by sending signals directly to the sensor, or digitally, by manipulating LiDAR data after gaining access to the in-vehicle network. Over the past few years, there has been significant research on the vulnerabilities, attack models, and security of LiDAR sensors. However, to our knowledge, no comprehensive survey exists that addresses these aspects of autonomous vehicle security. This paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting an overview of LiDAR-based perception, data processing, threat models, and defense mechanisms for LiDAR sensors in CAVs. We believe this paper will serve as a valuable reference for researchers, providing a clear understanding of cyber-physical attacks and defense strategies related to LiDAR sensors in autonomous vehicles and related fields.},

Despite these successes, federal investigations have been opened into both companies for safety concerns, and Cruise is attempting to reinstate its permit after a near-fatal pedestrian crash. An analysis of these three companies&#39; crash data from required reporting illustrates that many areas of self-driving need improvement. The most significant crash type for Waymo and Zoox are struck-from-behind events, while Cruise struggled most with unexpected actions by others. Computer vision systems are very brittle and likely play an outsized role in crashes. Self-driving cars also struggle to reason under uncertainty, and simulations are not effectively bridging the physical-to-real-world testing gap.

  abstract     = {Highly automated vehicles are complex systems, and ensuring their safe operation within their Operational Design Domain (ODD) presents significant challenges. Diagnosing failure modes and updating these systems are even more demanding tasks. This paper introduces a method to assist with assessing, diagnosing, and updating these systems by developing a stochastic model that predicts safety outcomes (collision, near-miss, or safe state) with quantified uncertainty in any parametrized scenario. The approach uses bootstrapping aggregation to create an ensemble of predictive models, leveraging fully connected feed-forward neural networks. These networks are designed with a flexible number of trainable parameters and hidden layers, requiring minimal computational resources. The model is trained on a small set of examples obtained through direct simulations that randomly sample the parametric scenario, bypassing the traditional test matrix definition. Once trained, the bootstrapped model serves as an identity card for the system under test, allowing continuous performance evaluation across the parametric scenario. The paper demonstrates applications, including safety assessment, failure mode identification, and developing a safe speed recommendation function. The model&#39;s compact size ensures rapid execution, facilitating extensive post-analysis for safety argumentation and diagnosis and real-time online use to extend the system&#39;s abilities.},

We developed and validated a simulation model to handle door-opening interruptions in a real EV. Using the developed model, we compared four heating controllers: (i) the proposed hierarchical nonlinear model predictive controller, incorporating a unique coolant-dividing layer and a component for regulating cabin air inflow based on door-opening signals; (ii) a single model predictive controller (MPC) for coolant division combined with a rule-based cabin air controller; (iii) a rule-based coolant-dividing controller integrated with a cabin air inflow MPC; and (iv) a conventional rule-based controller. Under ambient temperatures of 0, 10, and 20 ${}^{\circ }$ C, our hierarchical controller reduced the temperature drops by 7.2, 9.5, and 10.92 ${}^{\circ }$ C, respectively, in the cabin section where door-opening occurred, compared with the worst-performing controller in each scenario. Furthermore, our strategy significantly reduced temperature overshooting during recovery, achieving reductions of 84–87%, 60.8–83.8%, and 57.7–66.9% at 0, 10, and 20 ${}^{\circ }$ C, respectively, in various cabin sections. These results demonstrate the potential of our strategy to enhance passenger thermal comfort across the vehicle, providing valuable insights for future thermal management strategies in commercial EVs.},

Recent UDA methods have progressed significantly, yet they often rely on strategies customized for synthetic single-source datasets (e.g., GTA5), which limits their generalisation to multi-source datasets. Conversely, synthetic multi-source datasets hold promise for advancing the last mile of UDA but remain underutilized in current research. Thus, we propose DEC, a flexible UDA framework for multi-source datasets. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, DEC simplifies the task by categorizing semantic classes, training models for each category, and fusing their outputs by an ensemble model trained exclusively on synthetic datasets to obtain the final segmentation mask. DEC can integrate with existing UDA methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, BDD100K, and Mapillary Vistas, significantly narrowing the syn-to-real domain gap.},

To overcome these limitations, we propose PC-FusionMap, a novel approach that generates point cloud modality data and fuses multi-modal and temporal features for accurate and efficient online HD map construction. Our method addresses the shortcomings of existing approaches by leveraging an improved depth estimation module and a supervised labeling strategy to generate point cloud data. We also introduce a multi-modal feature fusion architecture (CFMB) and a temporal fusion network (TFC) to effectively integrate multi-modal and temporal information. The CFMB architecture uses a query mechanism and cross-attention to enhance the complementary performance between modalities, simplifying the fusion process and improving accuracy. The TFC Network models dynamic changes in time series data, further enhancing the accuracy and robustness of online HD map construction. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes and the Argoverse2 datasets, surpassing baseline models in both accuracy and stability. Additionally, incorporating our method into existing HD map generation models can lead to substantial performance gains.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) face considerable challenges when interacting with their environment, especially during lane changes. Enhancing decision-making and planning processes with prediction regarding the intentions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles can significantly improve lane change performance. However, prediction accuracy is limited by both the technology used and environmental variability. Utilizing low-confidence predictive data can adversely impact the safety and comfort of AV operations. This paper proposes a novel dual-model framework for lane change decision-making and planning of AVs (LC-Dual), which dialectically uses predictive data and provides redundant safety measures in parallel. In Model I, the optimal end-state trajectory for lane changes is planned using predictive information from the upper layer. In Model II, a redundant lane change trajectory is quickly generated based on a spatio-temporal safety corridor constructed from real perception data. Ultimately, the selection of the lane change model and trajectory is determined by rule-based decision-making, factoring in prediction confidence and computational efficiency. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the LC-Dual framework yields more adaptive trajectories in scenarios with accurate predictions and effective switches between lane change models in cases of inaccurate predictions. The LC-Dual framework markedly improves safety and efficiency in lane change operations, thereby facilitating broader AV adoption.},

Towards a comprehensive catalog of scenario types, expert-defined scenario types are complemented with types derived from real traffic data. Recorded traffic contains instances of different scenario types: By clustering these instances, a scenario type can be associated with each cluster. This involves adding semantics to recorded scenario instances, our clusters&#39; elements, in the form of maneuver-based descriptions of the behavior of scenario participants. Several works offer approaches to derive such instance descriptions. These approaches are often automated. The quality of the generated descriptions matters, given that subsequent steps build upon them. How to derive good descriptions automatically has not been addressed until now. In our work, (1) we approximate a description&#39;s quality by measuring the Frechet distance between the trajectories obtained by simulating ´ a description and the original trajectories in the dataset; (2) we introduce a quality threshold as to what makes a good description and, based on this threshold, we identify inadequate descriptions; (3) we build upon these evaluation results to modify identified inadequate descriptions automatically. In experiments, we extract and describe a set of 843 scenario instances from the inD intersection dataset: the average reconstruction quality in terms of a description&#39;s aggregated Frechet distance of 0.67 and ´ a ratio of 54% (459) of adequate descriptions improves to 0.34, and 97% (819).

To address this gap, we compared pedestrian road-crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings in Germany and Japan. We presented four types of machine learning models to predict gap selection behavior, zebra crossing usage, and their trajectories using simulator data collected from both countries. When comparing the differences between countries, pedestrians from the study conducted in Japan are more cautious, selecting larger gaps compared to those in Germany. We evaluate and analyze model transferability. Our results show that neural networks outperform other machine learning models in predicting gap selection and zebra crossing usage, while random forest models perform best on trajectory prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and transferability. We develop a transferable model using an unsupervised clustering method, which improves prediction accuracy for gap selection and trajectory prediction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of pedestrian crossing behaviors in different countries and offer valuable insights into model transferability.},

The algorithm distinguishes itself from others by depending only on radar data for generating synthetic aperture radar images for estimating traversed trajectory and building a visual representation. In our algorithm, ego-velocity (estimated using only radar data) is used for generating synthetic aperture radar images. The generated radar images are used for rotation estimation in the odometry step as well as for place recognition by exploiting the Fourier-Radon image registration approach. After the trajectory is optimized, we combine coherent and incoherent processing over the radar data for generating a map of the traversed area. The proposed concept was evaluated over multiple sequences comprising heterogeneous and dynamic environments. The results show high performance of the algorithm in terms of place recognition, attaining a balanced f-score in the range of 0.86–0.96. Moreover, the algorithm also achieves good results in terms of simultaneous localization and mapping. For example, it achieves an absolute trajectory error of 0.11 m for a trajectory of length 340 m, and 0.43 m for a trajectory of length 1092 m. Finally, we also include a case study in which we show the capability of the radar-only localization and mapping solution in operating under scenarios that are challenging for global navigation satellite systems.},

  abstract     = {For Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) systems operating in diverse environments, redundant localization techniques are essential to ensure continuous and safe mission execution. In this study, we propose a 3D place recognition and pose estimation method for AAM using a hemispherical light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The proposed approach includes a feature extraction method that leverages height differences in surrounding objects, a method for generating local and global descriptors from feature distances, and an efficient geometric verification and localization process through correspondence calculation. Additionally, the method incorporates a process to create a virtual descriptor database using a point cloud map, enabling robust localization in unvisited areas. All procedures are handcrafted, and the performance of the proposed method is validated through comparison with state-of-the-art methods using datasets generated in a simulator. The proposed method achieved over 99.16% average precision (AP) and a 99.99% F1 score in loop closure detection. In pose estimation, it achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.836 meters or less for position and 0.195 degrees or less for heading. Furthermore, a time analysis on both a general PC and an embedded device confirmed the real-time capability of the proposed method, with an average pose estimation time of 21.70 milliseconds on the embedded device, demonstrating its feasibility for real-time localization in low-power environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on intelligent driving technologies, with a special emphasis on Automatic Emergency Collision Avoidance Technology (AECA) and Collaborative Stability Control (CSC). These technologies play a crucial role in the active safety of vehicles. AECA proactively detects and responds to potential collisions, and CSC enhances vehicle stability by integrating various systems across multiple driving scenarios. The synergy between AECA and CSC is essential for improving passenger safety and the overall efficiency of traffic systems. This review delves into the application of AECA and CSC, particularly under conditions that might compromise vehicle stability, emphasizing the crucial balance between safety and stability in collision avoidance scenarios. The paper discusses the challenges faced by intelligent vehicles, such as the strong coupling nonlinearity in vehicle dynamics, unpredictable environmental conditions, and the increasing complexity of control systems. It examines strategies in braking, steering, and the coordination of multiple systems to achieve effective collision avoidance and stability control. Additionally, the review provides a forward-looking perspective on potential developments and insights for ongoing research in domains of AECA and CSC within intelligent technologies. The goal is to present a structured overview of the current state of research, highlight significant findings, and identify critical areas where future research could significantly advance the field of intelligent driving systems.},

  abstract     = {The rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the global pursuit of energy efficiency and carbon neutrality necessitates effective strategies to mitigate their carbon footprint and enhance operational stability. Similarly, in order to achieve Sustainability Development Goals, a promising solution toward green mobility, which is gaining ground nowadays, constitutes Automated Vehicles (AVs), which are EVs having the capability to move autonomously, without the need for a driver. One of the most critical factors regarding energy efficiency is the optimal management of energy consumption of AVs. This research study explores the application of machine learning (ML) models for State-of-Charge (SoC) forecasting in AVs, crucial for addressing challenges such as range anxiety and grid overloading. Leveraging real-life EV data from automated minibuses in Gothenburg, Sweeden, a comprehensive pipeline is proposed for data pre-processing, feature selection, and model training. With a focus on predicting SoC several minutes ahead, various ML techniques, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic-net regression are embedded in a pipeline specifically developed to overcome the challenge of training time-series models on discontinuous data segments, corresponding to discharge cycles. This pipeline is called Cross-Segment-Leakage-Free (CSLF). The results demonstrate the efficacy of CSLF, with the best-performing model achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.92 in a forecasting horizon of 30 minutes, representing a significant improvement over baseline models. The study underscores the importance of meaningful pre-processing and model selection in SoC consumption forecasting for AVs, offering insights into future research directions and deployment strategies for enhancing EV efficiency and grid stability.},

Adaptive compensation control strategies are developed to attenuate perturbation-induced impacts on the position and attitude tracking subsystems of the quadrotor UAVs. To minimize communication resources and actuation of actuators, eventtriggered control techniques with novel triggering mechanisms are introduced to adapt control inputs based on the developed adaptive finite-time compensation control strategies. For the purpose of guaranteeing the absence of Zeno phenomenon in the quadrotor UAVs, bounds on the inter-event execution time are defined. By incorporating the event-triggering conditions, bounded and asymptotic trajectory tracking results of position and attitude UAV subsystems are achieved respectively by utilizing Lyapunov stability theory under the influence of general perturbations. The effectiveness of the presented control strategies is validated through comparative simulation results of a quadrotor UAV system.},

The fundamental principles of the approach are derived from well-known distributed command governor concepts, which are here expanded to enforce a minimum spanning tree for safe communication between the vehicles. The edges of this tree may be adjusted in real-time to enhance overall performance. Additionally, the on-line distributed determination of particular separation hyper-planes is employed to reduce the inherent nonconvexity of obstacle avoidance constraints. In order to assist the implementation in actual vehicles, a practical implementation of the control architecture on the Robot Operating System (ROS) is discussed, together with conditions that formally ensure the feasibility of the suggested method. Simulations on coordinating marine autonomous surface vehicles are offered using the Gazebo simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, a real-world experiment on marine surface vehicles showcases the implementability of the proposed strategy.},

Despite advancements, existing methods struggle with key challenges, particularly in modeling the complex spatio-temporal interactions and addressing the inherent multi-modality and multitask nature of the problem. In this paper, we introduce TAME, a novel model that integrates a Non-Autoregressive Transformer with Attention Mechanism and Mixture of Experts to address these limitations. TAME features a temporal attention network, a spatial attention interaction network, and a multi-task prediction network. For temporal relation modeling, we leverage a hybrid attention mechanism that simultaneously captures both intravehicle temporal dependencies and the inter-vehicle temporal interactions. Spatial interaction is modeled through a crossattention mechanism, enabling a more refined capture of the spatial dependencies between the target vehicle and its surrounding entities, thereby enhancing spatial awareness. To effectively handle multi-modal and multi-task predictions, we incorporate a mixture of experts framework within a non-autoregressive transformer, allowing for diverse future trajectories to be predicted in parallel without the compounding errors typical in autoregressive models. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets NGSIM and HighD demonstrate that TAME outperforms stateof-the-art methods in motion prediction tasks, achieving over 28% average improvement.},
