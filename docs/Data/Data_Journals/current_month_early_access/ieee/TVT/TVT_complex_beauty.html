  abstract     = {Safe operation of multi-robot systems is critical, especially in communication-degraded environments such as underwater for seabed mapping, underground caves for navigation, and in extraterrestrial missions for assembly and construction. We address safety of networked autonomous systems where the information exchanged between robots incurs communication delays. We formalize a notion of distributed control barrier function for multi-robot systems, a safety certificate amenable to a distributed implementation, which provides formal ground to using graph neural networks to learn safe distributed controllers. Further, we observe that learning a distributed controller ignoring delays can severely degrade safety. We finally propose a predictor-based framework to train a safe distributed controller under communication delays, where the current state of nearby robots is predicted from received data and age-of-information. Numerical experiments on multi-robot collision avoidance show that our predictor-based approach can significantly improve the safety of a learned distributed controller under communication delays.

  abstract     = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) has been considered a promising technology to fulfill the strict quality of service requirements for ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). However, finite blocklength coding (FBC) in URLLC makes it challenging to achieve optimal performance in the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC in terms of achievable sum rate (ASR). Firstly, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic data rate. Then, we formulate an ASR maximization problem by jointly considering power allocation and user equipment (UE) clustering. To tackle such an intractable problem, we decompose it into two sub-problems, i.e., the power allocation problem and the UE clustering problem. A successive convex approximation algorithm is proposed to solve the power allocation problem by transforming it into a series of geometric programming problems. Meanwhile, two algorithms based on graph theory are proposed to solve the UE clustering problem by identifying negative loops. Finally, alternative optimization is performed to find the maximum ASR of the NOMA-aided CFmMIMO system with FBC. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the benchmarks in terms of ASR under various scenarios.},

This paper explores multiobjective task offloading, aiming to minimize energy consumption and latency simultaneously. Although learning-based algorithms have been used to address this problem, they train a model based on one a priori preference to make the offloading decision. When the preference changes, the trained model may not perform well and needs to be retrained. To address this issue, we propose a neural combinatorial optimization method that combines an encoder-decoder model with reinforcement learning. The encoder captures task relationships, while the decoder, equipped with a preference-based attention mechanism, determines offloading decisions for various preferences. Additionally, reinforcement learning is employed to train the encoder-decoder model. Since the proposed method can infer the offloading decision for each preference, it eliminates the need to retrain the model when the preference changes, thus improving real-time performance. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparison with three algorithms on instances of different scales.},

However, the unauthenticated channels expose the ADS-B system to a high risk of attacks. Besides, the centralization of intelligent vehicles management center is susceptible to single point failures and performance bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a robust and distributed intelligent vehicles management architecture leveraging blockchain technology to resolve security and performance issues lying in the registration, update, and revocation of intelligent vehicles&#39; identity public keys. Then, we leverage certificate-less short signature (CLSS) to achieve the dynamic identity verification of ADS-B system participants while ensuring message integrity, non-repudiation, and compatibility with low-data-bit message packets. Furthermore, to enhance intelligent vehicles transaction process efficiency within the proposed architecture, we develop an Verifiable Random Function-based Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol (VRBFT) combining threshold signatures. Finally, through a comprehensive security analysis and feasibility assessment, the results indicate that authentication requires less than 30 ms, block generation occurs within 200 ms, and the system exhibits high throughput and low latency. These findings demonstrate that our solution significantly enhances the security of the ADS-B system and offers a practical and promising approach for real-time, large-scale intelligent vehicle management.},

This paper proposes a novel content caching framework tailored to DT-enabled IoVs, where DTs selectively cache on-demand contents on edge devices (i.e., cellular base stations and roadside units) managed by the edge service manager (ESM) along the VUE&#39;s trip to avoid backbone congestion yet save download time. However, ESMs are inherently selfish and reluctant to contribute resources to cache contents without benefits. Furthermore, considering the diverse trajectories of vehicles, it is inefficient to cache data along a single path. To address these challenges, we propose ACDV, which first models the interactions between the ESMs and DTs as a Stackelberg game to incentivize ESMs to actively participate in the content caching process. We then deploy a Markov model to predict the VUE distribution, which enables DTs to cache contents with a focus on predicted trajectories. To save storage costs, we derive an upper bound of content sizes that the VUE can download within a limited network connection time. Considering the lack of network information and users&#39; private utility model in practical scenarios, we further develop a learning-based algorithm to find the optimal pricing scheme and content size strategies of ESMs and DTs. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposal can effectively find the optimal strategy and achieve a fast convergence speed and high-level performance compared to the baselines.},

The existing literature has introduced several MR methods for single-user scenarios but few papers have studied multi-user MR. This work proposes an MR method that employs a clustering analysis of super-constellation in a completely overlapped MU scenario. A super-constellation refers to the mapping of superposed symbols in the I/Q plane. A blind MR for stealthy decoding conversation between two users is considered with parameters like user gain, noise variance etc. being unknown in practical impairments such as carrier frequency offset, timing and phase offsets. The proposed algorithm utilizes agglomerative hierarchical clustering along with various cluster validation techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters and their respective centroids within the super-constellation. Subsequently, amplitude and phase-based features are extracted from these centroids to enable accurate MR. The simulation results demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the proposed method is i) significantly better than the features-based methods like cumulants and higher-order statistics; and ii) comparable with the deep learning-based methods that crucially rely on the availability of training data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the proposed method has significantly lower complexity than the existing techniques.},

This interference significantly impacts the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by vehicles. Moreover, the QoS requirements for vehicles vary widely across different application scenarios, further complicating the design and optimization of resource allocation strategies. To this end, we propose a robust resource allocation method for differentiated QoS in mIoV, leveraging ellipsoid learning and joint interference management. First, a weighted interference hypergraph model is developed to effectively mitigate ACI and CCI experienced by vehicles, while simultaneously addressing the diverse QoS requirements across different vehicle applications. Then, a robust optimization model for vehicle-to-vehicle pair (VP) communications is proposed, and underlying spectrum sharing is adopted to improve spectrum utilization. Furthermore, an ellipsoid-based learning robust algorithm (ELRA) strategy is proposed to address dynamic uncertainties arising from imperfect channel state information (CSI), thereby enhancing the reliability and transmission rate of the communication link. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior network throughput and spectral efficiency performance in densely deployed mIoV.},

Full-duplex-enabled integrated access and backhaul (FD-IAB) emerges as one of the pivotal solutions for ensuring efficient and reliable 6G IoT networks. Orbital angular momentum (OAM) is well-suited for innovative multiple access schemes and backhaul networking due to its capability for mode multiplexing. This paper introduces a new FD-IAB network framework utilizing OAM multiplexing, which incorporates multiple uniform circular arrays (MUCA) antennas. Two types of MUCA are suggested, specifically multi-ring-based MUCA (MR-MUCA) and single-ring with subarray based MUCA (SS-MUCA), and their respective performances are analyzed. However, the OAM-based FD system is significantly challenged by various interferences. Primarily, the FD system introduces self-interference (SI), and secondly, OAM multiplexing suffers from inter-mode interference (IMI) due to misalignment between the transceiver antennas. To mitigate SI, antenna configuration method for MUCA is proposed consisting of several subsets, which involves adjusting the space of antenna elements. To reduce IMI, a beam steering matrix (BSM) is utilized to compensate for the misaligned angle at the receiver. Simulation results validate the performance of two types of MUCA and the subset configuration method regarding the impact of SI and IMI in terms of the sum rate and outage probability.},

  abstract     = {Travel demand forecasting (TDF) is a crucial task in route planning, navigation, and scheduling. However, developing models for such tasks requires significant amount of order data, which can pose privacy concerns for users. Federated learning (FL) has addressed privacy concerns related to TDF. However, previous works only consider the data of a single factor to train the model, resulting in a less precise assessment of the demand for on-demand ride services. Moreover, non-independent and identically distributed ( non-IID) data across clients also brings a challenge in personalizing models for TDF tasks when applying FL directly. In this work, a privacy-preserving short-term TDF scheme for non-IID data is proposed to deal with these problems. Our approach analyzes the correlation between various potential influencing factors and travel demand and summarizes the input variables of the FL model to achieve accurate TDF prediction with privacy preservation. Additionally, we provide each client with a personalized model trained on independent and identically distributed (IID) data to compensate for local model weight divergence. Finally, experiments are conducted on the 2022 Shanghai data of the Didi platform as a use case, and the results demonstrate that our scheme effectively improves the model&#39;s performance.},

Subsequently, an error compensation system has been devised to eliminate the errors generated by the filter. Considering the existence of unknown nonlinear dynamics within the system, the fuzzy adaptive control is adopted to handle them. Finally, an event-triggered control with fixed threshold strategy is proposed to reduce the communication and computation burden between the controller and actuator. It has been proven that the tracking errors can converge to a region close to the origin in finite time and without violating full-state constraints.

  abstract     = {Centralized machine learning algorithms in vehicular networks face privacy and resource constraints. Federated Learning (FL) addresses these by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. To incentivize vehicle participation despite resource constraints, we propose a contract between Roadside Units (RSUs) and vehicles, specifying required computation resources and rewards based on local data quality. The contract is designed to maximize the utility of the RSU, subject to constraints that ensure the participation of the vehicles in the task and truthful reporting of their data quality parameter. However, designing an optimal contract with classical methods is limited to specific utility functions. To extend the design methodology of optimal contracts to a broader range of utility functions, our study proposes a deep learning-based solution. Specifically, we present a novel application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), marking the first instance of applying DNNs in contract theory-based incentive mechanisms to achieve nearoptimal contracts. We design the DNN&#39;s structure to inherently satisfy specific constraints of the optimization problem, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy in determining the optimal contract. We utilize an augmented Lagrangian method to approximate the optimal contract in federated learning tasks. A case study on traffic sign recognition demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of our method. Comparing our approach with the well-known generative diffusion model shows that in the FL scenarios, the DNN results are closer to the optimal contract compared to those of the generative diffusion model.},

Although appreciable spatial degrees of freedom can be exploited, the huge interaction overhead between APs and CPU is inevitable and prevents this architecture from being practically implemented. To achieve high signal detection accuracy while reducing interaction overhead, we propose a distributed signal detection scheme with multi-shot weighted combining, where the detected signals are iteratively refined via AP detections and subsequent CPU combining. Specifically, the regularized detection is carried out at the APs by penalizing any discrepancies between the local least-square detected signals at the AP and the weighted combined signals fed back from the CPU. The regularized detections are then collected and combined at the CPU for a refined joint detection. Using the operator-valued free probability theory, the combining weights at the CPU only depend on the statistical channel state information between APs and UEs, which alleviates the interaction overhead of fronthaul links. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed distributed detection with multi-shot combining scheme rapidly converges and achieves improved detection accuracy compared to the detection schemes with one-shot combining.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architecture incorporating both passive and active elements, to enhance the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services between a central controller (CC) and remote devices in mission-critical scenarios. Specifically, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system under target reliability, an optimization problem in terms of the transmit precoding of CC, the reflecting coefficients of hybrid RIS, and the allocated blocklength is proposed. To deal with the intractability of the non-convex problem considering the various quality of service (QoS) issues of remote devices such as transmission latency and rate constraints, Dinkelbach&#39;s method is invoked to transform the original problem into a parameterized concave-convex function. Subsequently, efficient algorithms are developed based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and Big-M formulation methods. In addition, the effects of several vital parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme are investigated. Numerical results show that compared to conventional full-passive/active RIS and no-RIS systems, the proposed hybrid RIS offers significant performance advantages. Furthermore, the optimal number and distribution of active/passive elements allocation are demonstrated. It is observed that the proposed hybrid RIS with only a few active elements can achieve higher EE than conventional passive RIS even with infinite blocklength, sufficiently revealing the potential of hybrid RIS to reduce transmission latency, guarantee rewarding reliability, and enhance EE for URLLC services},

  abstract     = {Wireless channel measurements in both indoor office and industrial Internet of things (IIoT) scenarios reveal the presence of not only specular multipath components (SMCs) but also dense multipath components (DMCs). However, existing standard channel models including the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model lack the capability to characterize DMCs in these indoor scenarios. In this paper, an improved algorithm for estimating delay-angular parameters of DMC clusters is proposed for processing channel measurement data in indoor office and IIoT scenarios. Statistical properties of SMCs and measured DMCs are analyzed. Then, a novel time-domain non-stationary sixth generation (6 G) standard channel model is proposed based on the extension of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model by including DMCs for indoor scenarios. In the proposed 6 G model, DMCs are incorporated by sharing the same cluster centers with SMCs but exhibiting different intra-cluster parameters, e.g., larger numbers of rays and larger values of intra-cluster delay spread. To accurately describe the cluster birth-death process, a squared sine function is introduced to model power changes of SMCs and DMCs with different rates. Moreover, simulation results of the proposed model are compared with those of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model, 6 G pervasive channel model, and measurement data. The proposed model shows the closest agreement with measurement results.},

Utilizing the DT&#39;s virtualization capability gets the virtual vehicle state and risk analysis for mixed-traffic scenarios to accurately predict vehicle trajectory and driving safety. However, even if a vehicular DT system is perfectly derived, the vehicular DT system might still fail to accurately predict the trajectory and assess driving risk due to its complexity. Under the complexity of the vehicular DT system, small initial state deviations lead to trajectories diverging increasingly from the true trajectory and unpredictably over time. Meanwhile, performing crash risk evaluation services of the vehicular DT system leads to false alarms. This impact is called the butterfly effect of complexity on the trajectory in the vehicular DT system. In this paper, we focus on the effect of complexity on trajectory and risk assessment in the vehicular DT system for mixed-traffic scenarios. Firstly, we consider the communication delay of CAVs and HVs to implement the vehicle model in the vehicular DT system. Then, we verify the existence of complexity in the vehicular DT system. Finally, we evaluate the effect of the complexity on trajectory and risk assessment under initial state deviation in the vehicular DT system. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the control gain of the CAV&#39;s controller is less than (0.075,0.1) by analyzing the butterfly effect of complexity on trajectory prediction and risk assessment in the vehicular DT system. This control gain range avoids the butterfly effect&#39;s impact on vehicle trajectories and risks. This provides an effective decision range to realize the trajectory prediction of high fidelity and driving safety in the vehicular DT system.},

However, improving the cooperative sensing capabilities of multiple ISAC user equipments (ISAC-UEs) in complex interference environment presents a significant research challenge. This paper focuses on the multi-user cooperative sensing in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. By utilizing the stochastic geometry, we model the distribution of communication UEs (COM-UEs) as a one-dimensional Matern hard-core point process (1-D MHCP), and derive a closed-form expression for interference power. To further enhance cooperative sensing accuracy while maintaining quality of service (QoS) in communication, we perform waveform optimization by jointly optimizing the weighted range-velocity Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) subject to communication data rate (CDR) and subcarrier power ratio (SPR) constraints. This approach involves selecting the optimal subcarriers for sensing and allocating the corresponding power on each subcarrier for communication and sensing subsystems. By employing the convex relaxation and the cyclic minimization algorithm (CMA), we decompose the complex optimization problem into three sub-problems, simplifying the original NP-hard problem into a solvable one via a cyclic optimization framework. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy, and evaluate the influence of CDR and SPR constraints using the CRLB and root mean square error (RMSE).},

To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory Distribution-aware Spatio-Temporal Attention network (DSTAnet) for vehicle trajectory prediction. The proposed DSTAnet begins with a temporal feature extractor that combines Transformer Encoder Layers (TEL) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), extracting both long-term teporal dependencies and short-term variations in vehicle trajectories. Next, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are introduced to extract spatial features in dynamically changing interactions, and focus on the most noteworthy vehicles, which are beneficial for modeling interactions between vehicles. Meanwhile, Mixed Density Network (MDN) is used to learn potential trajectory distributions from spatiotemporal features, which enriches the features related to driver intentions, providing a probabilistic understanding of possible future trajectories. By predicting multiple trajectories through random sampling, DSTAnet captures the inherent uncertainty of driver intentions. Finally, the INTERACTION dataset is adopted to estimate the model performance and results indicate that the proposed method outperforms others.},

Considering the repulsion characteristics between UAVs&#39; positions and terrestrial base stations (BSs), UAVs are deployed in non-hole areas outside the BSs. The positions of UAVs are modeled by Poisson hole process (PHP). Due to the difficulty of directly solving the user association problem under PHP, the nearest neighbor hole approximation method is introduced. Due to the complex interference caused by multiple communication links in the dual-layer heterogeneous network, we adopt the conditional Laplace transform method to represent interference, deriving expressions for coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Considering the energy constraints of the UAV network, this paper defines the system-level network energy efficiency (EE) as the ratio of the ASE to the average energy consumption per unit area. Utilizing this framework, we jointly optimize the UAV network density and the RSMA power allocation coefficients to maximize EE. The numerical results ultimately validated the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Through simulation analysis, this paper explores the impact of network deployment parameters on system performance and provided the UAV network density and RSMA power allocation scheme that maximizes EE.},

Simulation results demonstrate the superior EDoF performance of UPA- and ULA-based XL-MIMO-OFDM systems. Moreover, the intercarrier interference resulting from train movement increases with speed, and the degradation in signal quality caused by this interference can be mitigated by configuring the XL-MIMO-OFDM system.

  abstract     = {Cognitive radio (CR) empowered 6 G networks are deemed the key candidate technology to achieve ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) with enhanced spectrum utilization efficiency. However, there are several challenges to address in achieving this objective. In particular, the sequential and random sensing performed by secondary users (SUs) to find idle channels within a given band in a CR network (CRN) leads to time and energy consumption, and processing overheads, which consequently cause early depletion of the device&#39;s energy, underutilization of the available spectrum, and prolonged delays in communication. To circumvent this problem, in this paper, a spectrum efficient scheme is proposed based on idle spectrum inference and ranking, which takes into account the devices&#39; heterogeneity as well as their priorities in resource allocation. Based on the probabilistic approach, the scheme uses multiple parameters in a channel&#39;s evaluation and suitability assessment before selection for transmission. Markov chain modeling is leveraged to deal with the users&#39; arrival and departure uncertainties and to derive expressions for core performance metrics, including service capacity and retainability, spectrum utilization efficiency, reliability, network unserviceable and handoff probabilities, channel availability, and communication latency. The scheme is analyzed under various patterns of users&#39; arrivals. The acquired analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art to realize URLLC applications.},

To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a model-driven channel estimation network (CENet) for accurate channel estimation in the delay-time (DT) domain, with the initial least-squares (LS) solutions as prior information for training. Specifically, a LS-driven CENet with parallel structure is proposed to efficiently handle the high-dimensional DT domain channel matrix, which enables the row- wise training and estimation with fast convergence.

Meanwhile, as IoT applications are increasingly diversified, the tasks received by SMEC systems present heterogeneous demands for various resources and quality of service (QoS) metrics, necessitating customized design to accommodate such heterogeneity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint task offloading and resource allocation in SMEC systems with heterogeneous task demands. We first propose a customized task utility model that captures the diversified demands, which is an extension of traditional unified task utility models. Based on the model, we then formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for joint optimization of task offloading, computing resource allocation, transmission power control, and user association, aiming to maximize the sum utility of all tasks. To solve the MINLP, a multi-layer iterative framework is proposed that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, respectively. Simulation results show that, by applying the proposed task utility model, the average utility performance of UEs can be improved by 50% and 100% compared to applying a single metric-based utility model and a typical classification-based utility model, respectively; the proposed task offloading and resource allocation scheme achieves a 30%-80% performance gain compared to benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript presents a millimeter-wave wideband and wide-angle scanning dual-circularly polarized (CP) antenna array based on traveling-wave sequential feeding metasurface (TSF-MS) for vehicular communication systems. The antenna element consists of a dual-layer rectangle metasurface structures fed by a simple two-port traveling-wave sequential stripline through four non-uniform crossed slots. Each crossed slot will be excited twice by the ring strip line, which means the slots are reused. By adjusting the length and width of the crossed slots and strip line, two orthogonal electric fields with equal amplitudes and 90$^{\circ }$ phase difference can be achieved, thereby realizing good right- and left-handed circular polarizations (RHCP, LHCP). The antenna element can achieve a wide impedance bandwidth of 25.8% and axial ratio (AR) bandwidth of 31%, with a compact size of 0.38 $\lambda _{\mathrm{{mid}}}$, which is far smaller than the other reported CP antenna. Then, based on the newly designed dual-CP antenna element, a 4×4 array is constructed by 2×2 sequentially rotated subarrays. This layout can improve the scanning performance, suppress the cross polarization, and realize modular wiring to simplify the feed network. Benefited from the layout, the array can achieve a wide scanning angle of $\pm$60 over the whole bandwidth with the gain variation and AR less than 3 dB. For demonstration, one prototype is fabricated and the measured results show a good agreement with the simulated results. The dual-CP wide-angle scanning phased array can fully meet the communication needs of vehicular communication systems, indicating a good application prospect.},

Specifically, a double-layer optimization problem is formulated, including a non-convex optimization problem in the lower layer, and a game theory problem in the upper layer. We use block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation methods to decompose the lower layer problem into UAV deployment and power allocation sub-problems, and convert them into a difference of two convex functions programming problem and a second-order cone programming problem, respectively. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to solve the upper layer problem, obtaining a stable coalition formation.

  abstract     = {Real-time analytics on video data requires substantial computational resources and high energy consumption, and computational offloading has emerged as a promising solution to support such resource-intensive services. However, most of the existing research fails to consider the collaboration between video quality and security optimization in wireless offloading, making it less efficient in real-world scenarios with diverse requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel V2V-based secure computation offloading algorithm for video analysis, called radial basis function (RBF)-based multi-objective double deep Q-network (R-MDDQN). We use Wyner&#39;s wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy capacity and ensure that video data cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers. To address the trade-off problem among multiple objectives, we employ an RBF weight network to dynamically adjust the weights by learning the variations of different objective values. Each DDQN agent receives reward evaluations based on different objective functions and effectively and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading strategy. Extensive experiments conducted using real-world datasets from Shenzhen demonstrate that the proposed R-MDDQN reduces latency by approximately 9.32$\%$, decreases energy consumption by around 7.3$\%$, improves video analysis accuracy by about 18.9$\%$, and enhances security capacity by roughly 14.8$\%$ compared to existing task offloading schemes.},

  abstract     = {The synchronization of digital twins (DT) serves as the cornerstone for effective operation of the DT framework. However, the limitations of channel capacity can greatly affect the data transmission efficiency of wireless communication. Unlike traditional communication methods, semantic communication transmits the intended meanings of physical objects instead of raw data, effectively saving bandwidth resource and reducing DT synchronization latency. Hence, we are committed to integrating semantic communication into the DT synchronization framework within the mobile edge computing system, aiming to enhance the DT synchronization efficiency of user devices (UDs). Our goal is to minimize the average DT synchronization latency of all UDs by jointly optimizing the synchronization strategy, transmission power of UDs, and computational resource allocation for both UDs and base station. The formulated problem involves sequential decision-making across multiple coherent time slots. Furthermore, the mobility of UDs introduces uncertainties into the decision-making process. To solve this challenging optimization problem efficiently, we propose a soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize synchronization strategy and resource allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce synchronization latency by up to 13.2% and improve synchronization efficiency compared to other benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {The platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has the great potential to significantly improve travel experience in terms of safety, comfortableness, and energy efficiency. However, constrained by sensing range and prediction accuracy, the performance of CAV platoon can not be guaranteed in the scenario of mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This is not only due to the uncertainty of HDVs but also related to the occurrence of various traffic anomalies, such as emergency braking and accidents. In this paper, we aim to investigate an efficient control strategy to guarantee the operation of the platoon in mixed traffic, especially in the case of traffic anomalies. To tackle the problem, an edge-assisted platoon control strategy, called E-CACC, is proposed. First, an error-aware flexible tracking policy is designed to adapt to HDV uncertainties and speed prediction errors. Based on the tracking policy, a zone model predictive control (ZMPC) method is then designed to guarantee travel safety and avoid undesired acceleration. Further, a coordination strategy of CAV platoon and roadside unit (RSU) is proposed to prevent the platoon from potential collision in the case of traffic anomalies, where an event-based communication trigger is designed to determine whether and when the platoon establishes communication links with RSU to acquire exogenous sensing data of anomaly segment. Finally, the evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving travel safety and comfortableness.},

To overcome this, we propose a distributed hybrid RIS (HRIS)-aided V2X ISAC system featuring a predesigned transmission protocol that improves ISAC performance while minimizing channel estimation overhead and algorithmic complexity. In this system, the first sub-block of each coherence time block encompasses location sensing, beamforming and ISAC, along with a location prediction phase. At the same time, subsequent sub-blocks focus on the latter two phases. During the initial phase, two-dimensional multiple signal classificationbased adaptive location sensing is performed by sensor elements in the distributed HRISs to obtain location information without requiring channel estimation. This information is then used to design optimal beams for enhanced ISAC performance in the subsequent phase. Finally, an extended Kalman filter-based location prediction method generates optimal beams for the following sub-blocks. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of ISAC performance, computational complexity, overhead, and angle estimation accuracy.},

First, a dual-band angular-resolvable wideband channel measurement in an L -shaped hallway is presented and THz channel characteristics at 306-321 GHz and 356-371 GHz are analyzed. Then, a generic L -shaped intersection scenario model is developed, by adapting the ray-tracing (RT)-statistical hybrid channel modeling method THz channel characteristics in the L -shaped scenario. Especially, the spatial consistency of reflected multi-path components (MPCs) in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region is analyzed, and the continuous change of dominant MPCs is statistically modeled, in terms of their power, delay and angles of arrival. As a result, the proposed hybrid approach reduces the computational cost by reducing the determination of dominant MPCs in the NLoS region of the L -shaped scenario. Besides, as conventional close-in and alpha-beta path loss models cannot take good care of large-scale fading in the NLoS case, a modified alpha-beta (M-AB) path loss model for the NLoS region of L -shaped scenarios is proposed and verified 80% more accurate for L -shaped scenarios at different frequency bands.},

In addition, due to the massive scales of 6G networks, a main-shard blockchain architecture with IOTA and the practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm are used to ensure the safe sharing of the model and improve the transactions per second (TPS) of the system. Moreover, comprehensively considering the node computing resources, number of training samples, blockchain consensus delay, network communication delay, and FL training delay, we also establish a learning efficiency optimization model for FL and deduce the training round delay for the main and shard chains. Furthermore, the influences of different numbers of shards on the learning efficiency levels of different FL models are analyzed.

  abstract     = {Considering an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided multi-user system with multiple mobile eavesdroppers, this paper aims to develop an outage-aware online control strategy to counter the imperfect information of mobile user equipments (UEs) and mobile eavesdroppers. To perform online control effectively, a novel online prediction model is proposed, which models the trajectory of UEs as a stochastic Gauss-Markov mobility model and the trajectory of eavesdroppers as a worst-case model based on the current imperfect location information. The online control problem is formulated as a new multi-stage optimization framework, in which we perform online control by solving per-slot prediction problems and a resource allocation problem for the initial point. In the per-slot prediction problem, we jointly optimize the predictive trajectory and transmit power for the upcoming time slot (TS) by maximizing the minimum achievable secrecy rate (ASR) among all UEs. For resource allocation at the initial TS, we optimize transmit power by maximizing the minimum ASR among all UEs. The per-slot prediction problems and the resources allocation problem are all non-convex problems hence they are intractable in terms of computational complexity. To address them, we propose an efficient inner-approximation methods, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) methods and S-procedure as well as Bernstein -type inequality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed online control scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes which include existing offline schemes and online scheme without outage based prediction as well as shortest-path navigation scheme.},

  abstract     = {With cooperative perception, autonomous vehicles can wirelessly share sensor data and representations to overcome sensor occlusions, improving situational awareness. Securing such data exchanges is crucial for connected autonomous vehicles. Existing, automated reputation-based approaches often suffer from a delay between detection and exclusion of misbehaving vehicles, while majority-based approaches have communication overheads that limits scalability. In this paper, we introduce CATS, a novel automated system that blends together the best traits of reputation-based and majority-based detection mechanisms to secure vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications for cooperative perception, while preserving the privacy of cooperating vehicles. Our evaluation with city-scale simulations on realistic traffic data shows CATS&#39;s effectiveness in rapidly identifying and isolating misbehaving vehicles, with a low false negative rate and overheads, proving its suitability for real world deployments.},

  abstract     = {Designing high-performance routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) is challenging due to the diversity of applications and the dynamics of network topology. The existing general-purpose routing protocols for ad hoc networks often oversimplify mobility patterns and disregard the unequal importance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal routing decisions that are unsuitable for task-oriented FANETs. To break the bottleneck, in this paper we propose a betweenness centrality based dynamic source routing (BC-DSR) protocol for a flying ad hoc network (FANET) in marching formation. Firstly, we introduce a Gauss-Markov group (GMG) mobility model based on the leader-follower pattern, which accurately captures the temporal and spatial correlations of node movements in the realistic marching formation. Besides, we exploit the concept of BC defined in graph theory to measure the structural unequal importance of relay nodes, i.e., to determine link weights, in the particular marching formation topology. The path of least cost is calculated relying on a weighted directed graph constructed. The ns-3 based simulation results demonstrate that our BC-DSR protocol achieves higher packet-delivery ratio and lower average end-to-end latency and routing overhead ratio than representative benchmark protocols used in FANETs, while maintaining a reasonably small network jitter.},

This paper proposes a high spectrum efficiency security scheme using generalized spatial modulation (GSM) and space-time block coding (STBC) for scenarios with imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this scheme, GSM uses RIS block indices as unique identifiers, ideal for secure scenarios. It operates by activating different RIS blocks over two time slots to reflect unmodulated carrier signals, while STBC is designed based on the phase shifts of the RIS. To ensure secure communication, a low-complexity continuous artificial noise (CAN) is transmitted with STBC signals to interfere with eavesdroppers and prevent them from decoding the signals. The ergodic secrecy rate is deduced, and the bit error rate (BER) is validated through experiments. The simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can remarkably improves the security performance of the RIS-assisted wireless communication systems.},

This paper presents a novel trajectory planning framework designed to address these challenges by integrating a dual-layer probabilistic rad-lane intention prediction model with an efficient sampling-based trajectory planner. The proposed dual-layer model comprises three components: short-term vehicle kinematic prediction-based road-level intention inference, Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)-based lane-level intention inference, and target-lane-based trajectory generation. This architecture broadens the application scope and validates the effectiveness of the IMM-based multi-model probabilistic fusion framework in urban intersection scenarios. By incorporating both road-level and lane-level contextual information, the proposed trajectory prediction method significantly enhances prediction accuracy. Additionally, a longitudinal sampling strategy based on predefined maneuver modes is employed to improve the probabilistic completeness of existing parametric curve-based sampling techniques, facilitating rapid and effective obstacle avoidance. A notable advantage of the proposed sampling strategy is its ability to efficiently and probabilistically generate safe and feasible trajectories in challenging intersection scenarios. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in terms of both efficiency and safety in urban intersection vehicle conflict scenarios.},

To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a low-complexity Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based Zero Forcing (FTZF) detector for m-MIMO systems. By using FFT, the need to compute and invert the Gram matrix directly is eliminated.

In some cases, users may not be well-served by RSUs due to congestion, attenuation, or interference. In these cases, vehicular relays associated with RSUs can be used to serve those users. This paper uses stochastic geometry to model and analyze a spatially correlated heterogeneous vehicular network where both RSUs and vehicular relays serve network users such as pedestrians or other vehicles. We present an analytical model where the spatial correlation between roads, RSUs, relays, and users is systematically modeled via Cox point processes. Assuming users are associated with either RSUs or relays, we derive the association probability and the coverage probability of the typical user. Then, we derive the user throughput by considering interactions of links unique to the proposed network. This paper gives practical insights into designing spatially correlated vehicular networks assisted by vehicle relays. For instance, we express network performance such as user association, signal-to-interference (SIR) coverage probability, and network throughput as the functions of network key geometric parameters. In practice, this helps one to optimize the network so as to achieve ultra reliability or maximum user throughput of the vehicular networks by varying key aspects such as the relay density or the bandwidth for relays.},

Our objective is to maximize the communication secrecy gap by jointly optimizing the analog and digital beamformers, IRS reflection coefficients, and radar scaling factor, subject to constraints on beampattern similarity, total transmit power budget, and the constant modulus of both the analog beamformer and IRS reflection coefficients. This secrecy gap maximization problem is generally non-convex. To address this, we incorporate the exterior penalty method by adding the radar constraint as a penalty term in the objective function. We then propose an efficient approach based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework to solve the reformulated problem, featuring closed-form solutions at each step and guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-ISAC system with HB architecture in balancing performance and hardware costs.},

  abstract     = {An appropriate hybrid beamforming scheme is essential for millimeter wave (mmWave) multi-user massive Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MU-mMIMO) communication architectures, as it ensures both the advantages of digital processing and the efficacy of analog technology. To further explore the channel spectrum on the polarization domain, polarization selectivity is introduced in this work to improve the performance of the beamforming design in mmWave MU-mMIMO systems. By introducing single-port polarization reconfigurable antenna units to the mMIMO antenna arrays, we propose a novel hybrid polarized beamforming structure that can flexibly adjust the polarization distribution of the array. Based on the structure, this paper models the polarization distribution of the subarrays as selection of mask matrices and proposes several optimization schemes to enhance the hybrid polarized beamforming performance, including random combining, conventional genetic algorithm (GA), and optimal perturbation genetic algorithm (OP-GA). In this paper, we enable the Saleh-Velenzuela (S-V) millimeter wave channel model to be applied to the analysis by extending the multipath component (MPC) polarization distribution following the 3GPP and WINNER channel models. Performance analysis on the system sum rate shows that the proposed design significantly outperforms the fixed-polarized system under the same channel distributions. This paper underscores the importance of polarization optimization and provides a reference for enhancing the performance of mmWave MU-mMIMO systems.},

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) study in this field devised a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) formulation and its associated semidefinite programming (SDP) solution. After thorough examination, we pinpoint two avenues for enhancing this benchmark. Firstly, while the SOTA research relies solely on numerical confirmation, we conduct a theoretical mean square error analysis, demonstrating analytically that the CWLS framework indeed allows for estimation accuracy close to the Cramér–Rao bound under moderate noise conditions. Secondly, the CWLS-SDP estimator has two key shortcomings: the high complexity of implementing SDP, and the potential bias introduced due to its approximations and transformations. To tackle these drawbacks, which could be problematic in location-based vehicular applications, we develop a more computationally efficient block majorization–minimization algorithm to directly solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem. This represents our second contribution, and simulations validate its superiority over the SOTA method.},

This paper presents a novel coordinated sensing and communication scheme designed to mitigate asynchronous challenges. Specifically, asynchronous errors are jointly estimated alongside target locations, then enabling synchronization corrections for improved coordinated communication. To quantify performance bounds, closed-form expressions of the Cramer-Rao bound and asymptotic communication capacity under given asynchronous levels are derived. On this basis, a two-stage optimization framework is developed to explicitly optimize the coordinated sensing waveform and communication beamforming, further enhancing the resistance to asynchrony. The framework leverages the Schur complement-based semi-definite relaxation to address the non-linear and non-convex challenges in the sensing design. For the communication stage, a conjugate gradient method with penalty terms is proposed to address the high complexity of the multi-variable non-convex problem. These efforts enhance coordinated sensing and communication in asynchronous scenarios, with simulation results provided to verify their effectiveness.},

The IRAC scheme thus helps to reduce the hardware size and improve the resource efficiency of the UAV. To quickly estimate the target&#39;s radial velocity, we propose to use the auto-correlation function implemented at the radar receiver of the UAV. Nevertheless, the use of the auto-correlation function requires the UAV to generate two identical sequences. For this, the UAV copies a part of the original data sequence and adds it to the beginning of the sequence as the two training sequences. Increasing the copied part reduces the radial velocity estimation error. However, this results in longer transmission time, and the stringent latency requirement of the URLLC may not be satisfied. We investigate an optimization problem that optimizes the location of the UAV and the copied part to minimize the radial velocity estimation error while satisfying the latency requirement of the URLLC transmission. To solve the problem, we develop two algorithms, i.e., namely parametric algorithm and a generalized alternating minimization algorithm.

  abstract     = {LEO satellite communication is essential to provide aviation terminal (AT) services. However, due to the relative motion between LEO satellites and ATs, ATs are required to frequently report their current positions to the satellite to guarantee continuous service, which may lead to significant signaling overhead. To overcome this issue, we propose a predictive beamforming approach based on location sensing, whose core idea is to leverage a unified beampattern to enable sensing and data transmission simultaneously. Specifically, Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is adopted to characterize position tracking accuracy under the extended Kalman filtering framework. Then, the concerned problem is formulated to optimize spectral efficiency under transmission power and tracking accuracy constraints. To deal with the problem, we first prove the monotonic relationship between tracking accuracy and the perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the satellite to reformulate the problem, and then it is solved optimally by combining branch-and-reduce-and-bound approach with second-order cone programming. Towards practical application, the primal problem is equivalently reformulated with quadratic transform, and then semidefinite relaxation is adopted for low-complexity beamformer design. Simulation results verify the superior tracking and communication performance of our low-complexity design, and it is shown that it achieves comparable transmission rate and tracking accuracy relative to optimum. Moreover, the average spectral efficiency and tracking accuracy can be improved by up to $60\%$ and $30\%$ relative to other baselines.},

  abstract     = {The strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) and pitch-independent laser Doppler velocimeter (PI-LDV) integration represents a traditional navigation architecture. However, its effectiveness in obtaining precise altitude measurements remains constrained by the PI-LDV&#39;s inherent limitation of providing only one-dimensional velocity information. This study addresses this limitation by using the optical path structure of the PI-LDV to construct a frame capable of providing two-dimensional velocity information. To achieve this objective, two innovative integration methods are proposed: a SINS/PI-LDV loosely coupled integration method and a SINS/PI-LDV tightly coupled integration method, both of which consider the influence of potential laser beam fluctuations. Furthermore, a displacement increment measurement model is developed for the SINS/PI-LDV integrated navigation system to maximize the utilization efficiency of PI-LDV measurements while reducing the impact of sensor noise and outliers. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is rigorously validated through a comprehensive series of experimental tests, including: 1) extended-duration, long-distance tests using high-precision inertial measurement units (IMUs); 2) short-duration, limitedrange evaluations using high-precision IMUs; and 3) two additional long-distance verification experiments using both high-precision and medium-precision IMUs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional methods, particularly in height accuracy. Notably, the performance advantages become more pronounced when implementing the SINS/PI-LDV integrated navigation system with medium-precision IMUs, suggesting enhanced practical applicability in cost-sensitive applications.},

To analyze the performance of this system, an admission control problem is formulated that aims to maximize the number of served sensing targets. Due to tight coupling and its non-convex nature, the problem is transformed to a Markov decision process (MDP) form, based on which a recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (RDPG) agent is trained to jointly optimize the UAV flight trajectory, STAR-RIS coefficients, as well as the transmit and receive beamforming at the transceivers. Concerning the frequent displacement of the UAV and thus the considerable dynamism of the system, we further enrich the trained RDPG model for better adapting to the system variations by integrating a meta-learning technique. Numerical results exhibit at least 30% enhancement in average admission rate of sensing targets with the assistance of STAR-RIS. Additionally, the proposed adaptive resource allocation scheme brings about 25% superiority in average, over the existing soft actor-critic (SAC) counterpart available in the literature.},

In this paper, an innovative sparse planar array geometry is introduced for two-dimensional (2-D) direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, leveraging the difference co-array (DCA) technique to generate a virtual array with large consecutive co-arrays. At first, we propose an array structure referred to as shift-based symmetric coprime planar array (SSCPA). This design acts as a springboard, utilizing shifted coprime arrays to provide a higher uniform DOFs (uDOFs) than existing structures. To address the inherent contradiction between the high uDOFs and the low mutual coupling effect of SSCPA&#39;s parameter selection, we propose an enhanced version named improved shift-based symmetric coprime planar array (ISSCPA), holding smaller weight functions for near separated sensors. This improved design maintains the same uDOFs as offered by SSCPA while improving robustness against mutual coupling. Compared with existing array structures, simulation results confirm that our proposed structure performs better in terms of resolution and accuracy for 2-D DOA estimation.},

  abstract     = {The surge in wireless devices and data traffic volume necessitates more efficient transmission methods. Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called set-up based merged multicast (SMMC) to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users&#39; locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a fine-tuned SMMC (FT-SMMC) by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed multicast transmission achieves substantial reductions in delivery time, and this performance gain is further enhanced by optimizing set-up time and transmission rates in diverse wireless network scenarios.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the problem of transmit waveform design in a Frequency Diverse Array (FDA)-Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar for moving target detection against Doppler frequency shift and range ambiguity. In our system design, the FDA-MIMO radar is developed by transmitting designed phase-coded waveforms with a frequency increment between transmit antenna elements, which provides extra Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOFs) in the range-angle domains for target detection. In specific, for high-speed moving targets, an optimization problem is formulated to devise the phase-coded waveforms with low correlation properties under a constant modulus constraint as well as a similarity constraint involving a known radar waveform with good Doppler tolerance. To tackle such a non-convex optimization problem, the Majorization Minimization-Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers projection (MM-ADMM-projection) algorithm is developed in an iterative way, where an MM method is employed by constructing a series of surrogate functions to approximate the optimal solution. Furthermore, by introducing the ADMM method, each surrogate function is separated into linear and quadratic functions, where the constant modulus and similarity constraints are only imposed on the former. Then, a projection method is proposed to remove the non-convex constraints in the feasible region. In particular, the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is implemented to reduce the computational burden, and the local convergence of the proposed method is proved. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed waveform in detecting moving target considering the range ambiguity.},

Unlike the conventional periodical sampling approach, a self-triggered mechanism (STM) with adaptive prediction horizon is developed to determine the next sampling time instant and inter-sampling control inputs at each sampling time instant. This mechanism can efficiently reduce the data transmission frequency in the vehicle-cloud communication network, leading to a lower communication load and thus improving the reliability of the system. The STM comprises a set of optimization problems with an adaptive prediction horizon. The optimization problems and threshold design explicitly take the vehicle-cloud communication load into account. Furthermore, a stochastic model predictive control problem with modified constraint tightening and terminal constraint is defined by considering the influence of STM. We develop sufficient conditions to guarantee the closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction in the presence of both adaptive STM and additive disturbances. Then, the recursive feasibility of the optimal control problem and closed-loop stability of the system are investigated. Finally, we illustrate the benefits and effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples in vehicle path following control problem.},

They offer advantages such as high-throughput data transfer and reduced size, weight, and power requirements compared to traditional radio frequency transmission.

In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.},

Since every Flag sequence consists of a Curtain sequence and a Peak sequence, we first investigate the algebraic design of Curtain sequence sets of arbitrary lengths. Our proposed design gives rise to novel Curtain sequence sets with ideal curtain auto-AFs and zero/near-zero cross-AFs within the delay-Doppler zone of operation. Leveraging these Curtain sequence sets, two optimization problems are formulated to minimize the weighted integrated masked sidelobe level (WImSL) of the Flag sequence set. Accelerated parallel partially majorization-minimization algorithms are proposed to jointly optimize the transmit Flag sequences and symmetric/asymmetric reference sequences stored in the receiver. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed Flag sequences lead to improved WImSL and peak-to-max-masked-sidelobe ratio compared with the existing Flag sequences. Additionally, our Flag sequences under the Flag method exhibit Mean Squared Errors that approach the Cramér-Rao lower bound and the sampling bound at high signal-to-noise power ratios.},

We then analyze the spatio-temporal correlation coefficient of the conditional success probability by studying the correlation between the aforementioned two distances. Finally, we choose PAoI as a performance metric to showcase how spatio-temporal correlation or user velocity affect system performance. Our results reveal that ground users exhibit higher spatio-temporal correlations compared to aerial users, resulting in a more pronounced impact of velocity on system performance, such as joint probability of the conditional success probability and distribution of PAoI. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the dominant interferer-based approximation for the SINR meta distribution delivers good matching performance in complex scenarios, such as Nakagami-m fading model, and it can also be effectively utilized in computing spatio-temporal correlation, as this approximation is derived from the distances to the serving BS and the dominant interferer.},

Utilizing such arrays often results in a near-field spherical wave transmission environment, enabling the generation of focused beams, which introduces new degrees of freedom for wireless localization. In this paper, we consider a beam-focusing design for localizing multiple sources in the radiating near-field. Our formulation accommodates various expected types of implementations of large antenna arrays, including hybrid analog/digital architectures and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). We consider a direct localization estimation method exploiting curvature-of-arrival of impinging spherical wavefront to obtain user positions. In this regard, we adopt a two-stage approach configuring the array to optimize near-field positioning. In the first step, we focus only on adjusting the array coefficients, assuming actual user positions have been known, to minimize the estimation error. We obtain a closed-form approximate solution based on projection and a better one based on the Riemann gradient algorithm. We then extend this approach to localize and focus the beams simultaneously via a sub-optimal iterative approach that does not rely on such pre knowledge of positions. The simulation results show that near-field localization accuracy based on a hybrid array or DMA can achieve performance close to that of fully digital arrays at a lower cost, and DMAs can attain better performance than hybrid solutions with the same aperture.},

To tackle the dual challenges of attaining rapid charging while guaranteeing safety, a novel safety-enhanced fast charging strategy for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is presented, utilizing a thermal and health-aware safe deep reinforcement learning (SDRL) approach. Specifically, this work introduces an innovative approach by employing distributional reinforcement learning in LIBs fast charging control, simultaneously optimizing safety constraint issues.

Compared to advanced deep deterministic policy gradient-based and soft actor-critic-based strategies, the proposed method exhibits superior optimality and stability, confirming its significant performance advantages. Furthermore, in contrast to model predictive control-based charging strategies, it offers superior real-time adaptability and proves more efficient in practical charging scenarios.

Despite this progress, the specific challenges faced by electric taxis (ETs) as a vital component of sustainable urban transport have received limited attention. This study formulates a joint optimization problem to determine optimal pricing for charging stations (CSs) while guiding plug-in pure electric taxi (PPET) drivers toward the most profitable charging options. The proposed model aims to maximize the overall utility of CSs under cooperative relationships and provide the optimal charging strategy for ETs. To guarantee that the behaviors of both CS and ET drivers do not interfere with the smooth operation of the system, we incorporate a credit mechanism. We propose an algorithm to simultaneously optimize charging prices at each CS and charging selections for ET drivers.

  abstract     = {Device-free localization (DFL) represents an emerging technology in autonomous driving assistance systems, sensing targets around a vehicle without requiring them carrying any devices. Current machine learning methodologies for DFL struggle with adaptively extracting discriminative features, resulting in weak robustness. Although dictionary learning techniques have shown potentiality in robust feature extraction for images and signals, their direct application to improving the robustness of DFL presents significant challenges. Specifically, the unsupervised mechanism of dictionary learning complicates the calibration of target location bases. The complex optimization processes also lead to inefficient parameter updating. To address these issues, we propose a deep-supervised dictionary learning (DSDL) approach for enhancing the robustness of DFL. The proposed DSDL method synergizes the advantages of sparse representation and deep learning, incorporating the robustness and interpretability of dictionary learning with the efficient parameter updating characteristic of deep learning. The supervised mechanism enables collaborative labeling of the learned signal bases. Experimental results, derived from an established DFL system, demonstrate that our DSDL outperforms existing techniques in both robustness and accuracy. DSDL maintains strong robustness and achieves high localization accuracy, surpassing 99% on clean data and sustaining over 97% accuracy under 30 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. This work highlights the potential of existing WiFi infrastructure to provide cost-efficiency solutions for target localization, paving the way for future applications of wireless sensing.},

To overcome these challenges, this paper presents an optimized decoding and puncturing scheme. By leveraging equalization results to estimate and classify distortion levels in received symbols, our scheme allows for targeted adjustments to the decoding tree structure. In instances of decoding failure, the scheme selectively includes varying lengths of auxiliary information in the feedback, assisting the sender in making puncturing decisions.

  abstract     = {The vehicular digital twin (VDT) networks are an emerging network paradigm that are facilitating connected and autonomous vehicles. However, autonomous vehicles transmit real-time sensing privacy data to their corresponding digital twin representations through public communication channels within VDT intra-twin communication, thus exposing this communication to various threats of attack and potential data tampering. On this basis, a reliable and efficient data transmission scheme is urgently needed to ensure secure fine-grained data access control. In this context, this article introduced a new authenticated key agreement scheme, termed RSAKA-VDT, to authenticate user identity and enable confidential service data access. In particular, only vehicle users with proper access permissions are allowed to calculate the shared session key. The associated VDTs are deployed on the network edge in the suggested RSAKA-VDT. Identity authentication and session key negotiation are carried out between an autonomous vehicle user and the affiliated edge server. Subsequently, the generated session key encrypts real-time privacy data, ensuring secure data exchange for VDT intra-twin communication. Furthermore, we validated the security features of RSAKA-VDT using the random oracle model, heuristic security analysis, and the “automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications” (AVISPA) software tool. Finally, we conducted a comparative analysis of RSAKA-VDT against six closely related user authentication schemes, evaluating security functionality attributes, computational costs, and communication overheads. Comparative performance results show that RSAKA-VDT meets all 18 security evaluation criteria while maintaining a better balance between practical usability and requirements for security functionality.},

Firstly, an improved Paillier cryptosystem is utilized to achieve lightweight encryption in the proposed schemes. In addition, a novel distributed data aggregation structure that combines a large number of geographically distributed fog nodes with centralized cloud servers is introduced. This structure not only meets the requirements of lightweight encryption and resistance against single point failures but also reduces the communication complexity of distributed data aggregation to $O(n)$.

This paper resolves the following issue: how to minimize the worst-case response time (WCRT) of frame forwarding in TSN under no-wait scenarios to guarantee low-latency transmission, stability, and high success rate for in-vehicle TSN networks? Currently, some work resolves this problem by leveraging integer linear programming, and others apply heuristic methods to avoid the time complexity problem, but the success rate is affected since they are prone to get trapped in local optima. To reach a balance between time-complexity and success rate, a scheme named Frame Dynamic Priority Scheduling Mechanism (FDPSM) is proposed, where the frame dynamic priority levels are set up and frames are scheduled accordingly. The target is to maximize the success rate and minimize the WCRT for in-vehicle networks. We evaluate the proposed mechanism from aspects such as traffic forwarding time, size of windows, number of hops, and the network load, together with success rate and the simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the FDPSM for in-vehicle TSN networks.},

  abstract     = {Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed as a promising technique to achieve high-reliability communications in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper, we consider a multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS downlink communication scenario, where an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is deployed to enhance the performance. Specifically, the delay- Doppler (DD) domain input-output relationship of such a system is first derived, based on which, the joint optimization of the precoding matrices and IRS reflection phase is studied to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) considering user fairness. Note that the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex. To tackle this challenge, we first reformulate the problem into a more traceable equivalent form by the weighted mean minimum square error (WMMSE) approach. Utilizing the characteristics of the DD domain signal relationship, we then decouple the reformulated problem and further transform it into two subproblems, which are solved by the Lagrangian function method and the project-descent-retracting (PDR) algorithm, respectively. The precoding matrices and reflection phase are jointly optimized by alternative optimization to maximize WSR. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with benchmark schemes, the proposed WMMSE-ALT can improve the rate more than 85% in IRS-assisted MU-MIMO-OTFS systems.},

  abstract     = {A deep learning-based sparse signal recovery network $\text{SSRnet}$ is designed. This network is built on the proposed neural network $\mathrm{PositionNet+}$, which takes the received signal as input and obtains the support of the desired sparse matrix without requiring a sensing matrix. Using PositionNet+, SSRnet is able to recover the sparse signal precisely, outperforming conventional methods, including least-squares (LS) estimation with perfectly known support, by virtue of its denoising behavior, while offering substantially reduced computation. The network is then utilized to perform channel estimation of high-mobility massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal time frequency space (MIMO-OTFS) wireless systems which is cast as a sparse signal recovery problem. In OTFS, data is modulated in the delay-Doppler domain to transform a fast time-varying and frequency-selective fading channel into a quasi-static and sparse channel. To maximize performance, OTFS systems require accurate channel estimation and low pilot signaling which are provided by SSRnet. Simulation and computational comparisons demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and normalized mean squared error (NMSE), reduces pilot symbol overhead, as well as lowers computational complexity.},

Model Predictive Control (MPC) stands as a promising technique for achieving this objective. However, conventional MPC approaches employing fixed parameters often restrict the control performance. This paper aims to adaptively tune the MPC parameters for an optimal BTM system using reinforcement learning. To achieve this, the nonlinear MPC controller is linearized at nominal operating points and transformed into an adaptive MPC controller. Leveraging a soft actor-critic reinforcement learning agent, the MPC decisive parameters, including weights of the cost function, lengths of the prediction horizon and control horizon, are regulated online. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a 5.8% reduction in energy consumption for BTM, an 18.8% decrease in constraints violation, and a substantial 59% reduction in MPC execution time compared to an MPC controller with fixed parameters. Additionally, the feasibility of the proposed reinforcement learning-driven adaptive MPC has been verified on a dSPACE machine. These outcomes underscore the significant potential of MPC optimization for enhancing battery management systems.},

  abstract     = {In uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, one of the foremost challenges is devising efficient flight paths that navigate complex environments while conserving energy and avoiding obstacles. The paper proposes a High-Altitude Platform aided Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (HAPFOA) as a novel approach to address sub-optimal path planning in dynamic complex environments by leveraging fruit fly&#39;s innate foraging strategies and adapting them to the three-dimensional challenges of UAV navigation at high altitudes. This approach applies the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA), where each UAV is analogous to a ‘fly’ exploring potential pathways. The paths chosen by these UAVs are evaluated using a comprehensive ‘smell’ metric that integrates crucial navigational factors such as closeness to the target, obstacle avoidance, energy utilization, and maneuverability. This process is iterative, with each UAV continuously adjusting its flight path based on the ‘smell’ metric feedback, aiming to find the route with the best possible ‘smell’ score. The algorithm helps to avoid obstacles during the vision phase. Cubic spline interpolation is used to refine and smoothen the UAV trajectories to ensure the practical application of these flight paths, making them more applicable and realistic for risky operations. Based on obstacle warnings from HAPUAV, the simulation results show an efficient route formulation by the proposed model with no idle time and a faster convergence rate. Another advantage of HAPFOA is its ability to preserve more energy than other models.},

This article explores Control Allocation (CA) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) concepts to meet the requirements for both conventional and electrified powertrains such as parallel hybrid electric transmissions. The CA and MPC strategies, previously proposed for the upshift inertia phase, are extended in this article to torque phase to obtain integrated optimal shift control strategies. These strategies optimally coordinate oncoming and off-going clutch torque with engine torque to balance the conflicting shift quality criteria reflecting shift comfort, duration, and efficiency. The designer sets the shift quality requirements through torque and inertia phase durations, reference and constraint profiles, and cost function weights, which facilitates calibration of the control strategy performance. To further improve the performance, the CA strategy is extended with a virtual torque sensor system during the torque phase. Two variants of MPC strategy are proposed and compared: (i) separate MPCs for torque and inertia phase and (ii) integrated MPC whose prediction model in torque phase spreads to the inertia phase. The CA and MPC strategies are realized in the form of constrained quadratic programs and efficiently solved on-line by an interior-point solver. Their performance is demonstrated and compared via nonlinear powertrain model simulations for 1-3 shift, including a system robustness analysis with respect to actuation parameter uncertainties.},

While cooperative driving improves CAV performance by leveraging vehicle collaboration, its lack of interaction and continuous learning limits current applications to single scenarios and specific Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA). To address these issues, this paper proposes CoDrivingLLM, an interactive and learnable LLM-driven cooperative driving framework for all-scenario and all-CDA applications. First, an environment module updates vehicle positions based on semantic decisions, mitigating errors from LLM-controlled positioning. Second, leveraging the four CDA levels defined in SAE J3216, a centralized-distributed coupled architecture reasoning module is developed to ensure safe and efficient cooperation through centralized negotiation and distributed decision. Finally, by introducing a memory module that employs Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), CAVs are endowed with the ability to learn from their past experiences to avoid repeating mistakes. Through ablation studies and comparisons with other cooperative driving methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed CoDrivingLLM significantly enhances safety, efficiency, and adaptability across various scenarios.

However, some malicious attacks utilize diffusion models to generate fake traffic signs, confusing the vehicle&#39;s perception system, and leading to accidents. At the same time, some malicious vehicles send forged motion information, attempting to deceive other CAVs, which poses a severe threat to traffic safety. To address these malicious attacks, we design a Large Language Model (LLM)-selectable misbehavior detection architecture to assess the authenticity of traffic signs and motion information of vehicles. Specifically, we first design a fine-tuning approach that integrates the adapter and LoRA through a gating mechanism for LLMs with fewer than 100 billion parameters and a fine-tuning method that combines local knowledge bases and prompt tuning for LLMs with more than 100 billion parameters. Then, we design detection schemes for false traffic signs and forged motion information, respectively. The former uses distance as the trigger condition, while the latter relies on the results of plausibility analysis. Finally, simulation results show that fine-tuned LLMs outperform traditional methods in misbehavior detection.},

To improve spectrum utilization and throughput, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is used to reuse channels. However, different trajectories of UAVs and computing task assignment may lead to various communication delay and energy consumption. Additionally, regarding the high dynamic nature of SAGIN, it often falls into the dilemma of information uncertainty and curse of dimensionality. To overcome the above challenges, a hierarchical network model is designed, where UAVs and satellites collaborate to process users&#39; offloaded computing tasks. Then, a joint UAV trajectory design, task offloading, task assignment and computing resource allocation problem for minimizing system cost is then proposed. Due to the coupling between queue delay constraints and decision-making, Lyapunov optimization is applied to split the issue into three subproblems. Firstly, a UAV trajectory design and task offloading algorithm based on multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) is designed to deal with the curse of dimension issue. Then, the problem of joint task assignment and UAV computing resource allocation is solved via CVX due to that it is convex. Finally, a low-complexity Greedy-based Satellite Computing Resource Allocation (GSCRA) algorithm is proposed to obtain the minimum system cost.

To address these challenges, this study formulates a joint resource optimization problem to maximize the average EE of cellular users (CUs) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) users by jointly optimizing subchannel assignment, frequency reuse patterns, and power allocation while ensuring the required QoS of both users. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a semi-persistent scheduling (SPS)-based energy-efficient resource allocation scheme that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with network slicing (NS). Specifically, during the frequency reservation phase of SPS periods, CUs are assigned to network slices using the proposed NS grouping strategy, and V2V users are clustered into V2V NOMA clusters using the proposed clustering optimization algorithm. Frequency reuse patterns are then determined for network slices and V2V NOMA clusters. In the subsequent data transmission phase, a centralized energy-efficient iterative power control algorithm is introduced to enhance the average CU EE, and a distributed heuristic power control method is leveraged to improve the average V2V EE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the baseline methods in improving EE and satisfying the required QoS of both CUs and V2V users while avoiding over-allocation of frequency resources.},

The solving efficiency is further improved by 85% with a feasible state space reduction algorithm, which can meet the real-time computational requirements. The result indicates that cooperation within the mixed platoon can smooth out the trajectory while considering the composition of energy consumption. In addition, the energy efficiency can be improved by 20.39% with a low CAV penetration rate.},

  abstract     = {In the mirror array-assisted indoor visible light communication (VLC) system, activating all mirrors simultaneously can result in a complex system design and excessive consumption of resources. To address this issue and enhance the spectral efficiency, this paper proposes a joint space shift keying (SSK) technique, which is achieved by jointly utilizing the mirror array grouping and LED activation procedures in indoor VLC systems. By doing so, the SSK scheme utilizes the activation status of mirror array blocks to transmit information and can avoid excessive utilization of mirror resources while achieving efficient and reliable communication. The fairness of the considered system is improved by introducing a mirror array grouping technique that relies on the channel gains. Concurrently, a novel joint SSK modulation scheme is proposed, whereby the mirror array block is activated in conjunction with the LED. This scheme employs a information bit-based activation technique to enhance spectral efficiency. Additionally, the low complexity orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) detection and the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detection algorithms are employed. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes has been confirmed through extensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) and sub-THz communications, foreseen for sixth generation (6G), suffer from high propagation losses which affect the network coverage. Another challenge raised by the adoption of high frequency bands is the use of large bandwidths. In order to deal with this last challenge, a common configuration is to divide a large frequency band into multiple smaller subbands. In this context, we consider a mobile network where signaling related to measurements used for radio resource management is transmitted in one subband centered at frequency $f_{c}$ and data transmission is performed at a different frequency $f_{c} + \Delta f$ based on the measurements taken at $f_{c}$. Here, a challenge is that the array radiation pattern can be frequency dependent and, therefore, lead to beam misalignment, called beam squinting. Thus, in this work, we characterize beam squinting in the context of subband operation and propose a solution where the beam patterns to be employed at a given subband can be adjusted/compensated to mitigate beam squinting. For performance evaluation, we present a case study where our compensation method is employed in a network-controlled repeaters (NCRs)-assisted scenario. NCR, which have been standardized in third generation partnership project Release 18, are considered as cost-efficient solutions for coverage extension in the context of mmWave. Specifically, NCRs are radio frequency repeaters with beamforming capability controlled by the network through side control information. Our results show that, without compensation, the perceived signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and so the throughput can be substantially decreased due to beam squinting. However, with our proposed compensation method, the system is able to support NCR subband signaling operation with similar performance as if signaling and data were transmitted at the same frequency.},

The proposed method enables us to decode all user messages within this single polar decoder. Then, a Monte-Carlo construction is utilized to optimize the nested user codes of the extended-length polar code. Furthermore, to eliminate the interference between user layers of the PA-MU-SM, an iterative polarization-aided (I-PA) scheme is designed and can theoretically achieve MU-SM channel capacity via a four-stage channel transform.

The RBORP algorithm has been theoretically proven to be capable of minimizing the upper bound of the actual amplitude response at the DOAs of jamming signals when the steering vectors are mismatched. Numerical results show that the RBORP algorithm exceeds the comparative beamformers with regard to the output SINR, and is capable of controlling the beampattern to shape precise and deep nulls at the DOAs of jamming signals.

  abstract     = {The GNSS-RTK and MEMS-IMU integrated navigation system is a commonly used high-precision, low-cost solution for outdoor positioning. However, the significant measurement error of MEMS-IMU can rapidly lead to divergence in navigation state predictions based on inertial error propagation models. To overcome this limitation and enhance accuracy, maintaining the continuity of RTK measurement information is crucial. Nevertheless, due to the instability of wireless transmission links and communication equipment, or disruptions in base station observations, differential corrections often experience outages, resulting in a decline in measurement information quality and affecting the accuracy of integrated navigation. Therefore, this paper proposes a stable RTK/MEMS-IMU tightly coupled algorithm. During outages of differential corrections, the proposed algorithm utilizes historical differential corrections from the base station along with real-time rover station information to construct a stable double-difference carrier phase vector. This approach ensures the stability of measurement information and enhances positioning accuracy. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of this method, and land tests have demonstrated that, compared to the traditional RTK/MEMS-IMU tightly coupled algorithm, the position and velocity accuracy of this algorithm during outages of differential corrections have been improved by 29.5% and 18.4%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied as aerial relays for satellite-to-terrestrial transmission so that data packets can be delivered either directly from satellites to user equipments (UEs) or relayed via UAVs. To exploit the advantages of such space-aerial cooperative transmission, data transmission, and resource allocation should be jointly optimized under constrained resources in dynamic space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). However, the tight coupling between discrete transmission strategies and continuous resource allocation among users leads to a challenging long-term, large-scale, and non-convex optimization problem. While existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques have exhibited potential in addressing such problems, their limitations in handling discrete-continuous decisions and ensuring robust multi-agent cooperation often result in significant performance deterioration. In this paper, we propose a new MARL-based Cooperative Transmission Strategy (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. In MCTS, each agent employs a hybrid Actor-Critic (H-AC) algorithm, where the optimal discrete transmission strategy with its associated resource allocation is modeled as parameterized actions and determined by an improved AC structure. To enhance cooperation among agents, a multi-agent cooperation framework is designed based on QMIX, employing a centralized Critic to efficiently guide convergence toward optimal solutions while reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of MCTS over a number of benchmark algorithms and efficiency under various environments, in terms of overall transmitted data and resource utilization.},

  abstract     = {Enhanced by onboard computing resources and inter-satellite links (ISLs), large-scale satellite networks (SNs) can supplement terrestrial networks, facilitating real-time edge computing and transmission in remote areas at low latency. This capability benefits applications such as real-time remote object tracking, vehicular edge computing, and environmental monitoring. However, different from terrestrial vehicular networks, satellite mobility and the intermittent nature of ISLs often render many computing satellites inaccessible, necessitating efficient scheduling scheme for joint computing and communication resource allocation. To meet this requirement, we investigate joint computing and transmission strategy for real-time computing applications over SNs to reduce end-to-end delays. We formulate the real-time computing and transmission problem over time-varying SNs as an integer linear programming problem. The mathematical optimization method has an exponential time complexity of ${O}(2|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| \cdot (4 |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }| + 4 |\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|)^{2|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|})$ in the worst case, which grows rapidly with the growth of network sizes. Here, $|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|$ and $|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }|$ denote the number of nodes and links, respectively, within the time window ${\tau }$. Resorting to the designed $k$-shortest path-based method yields a worst-case complexity of $O(|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|! \cdot |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|^{3})$. While efficient under common scenarios, its running time is still relatively unstable and may become tens of times longer when computing resources become scarce. To enhance efficiency, we further design a graph-based algorithm that leverages the solution space&#39;s unique structure, thereby achieving optimal solutions with polynomial time complexity ${O}(3|\mathcal {L}^{\tau }| + (2\log {|\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|}+1) |\mathcal {V}^{\tau }|)$.

  abstract     = {As the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) evolves, integrating Location-Based Services (LBS) into in-vehicle software has become increasingly common. Consequently, protecting users&#39; location privacy has emerged as a critical concern. Vehicles face the challenge of sending query requests to untrusted Location Service Providers (LSP) through untrusted Roadside Units (RSU) to obtain relevant results. This situation presents two primary risks: (1) the involvement of untrusted RSU increases the likelihood of monitoring vehicle communications with the LSP, and (2) repeated queries to the untrusted LSP increase the risk of privacy breaches during interactions. This paper proposes an innovative location privacy protection scheme for continuous LBS in the IoV, called LPPS-IKHC, which combines improved $k$-anonymity with hybrid cache. The scheme utilizes anonymous techniques and hybrid cache to mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information to untrusted entities. To protect against adversaries, LPPS-IKHC generates specific anonymous sets in the presence of untrusted RSU. Additionally, an anonymous algorithm incorporating trajectory similarity is introduced to protect trajectory privacy, further enhancing user location privacy. Furthermore, by reducing the number of interactions between vehicles and untrusted LSP, hybrid caching helps diminish the risk of privacy disclosure. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the LPPS-IKHC method provides superior privacy protection and lower system overhead compared to existing schemes.},

By reconfiguring line-of-sight (LoS) Links through passive reflections, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has the potential to address this issue. Due to the lack of introducing blocking effects, existing HO analyses cannot capture excessive HOs or exploit enhancements via IRSs. This paper proposes an LoS state transition model enabling analysis of mobility enhancement achieved by IRS-reconfigured LoS links, where LoS link blocking and reconfiguration utilizing IRS during user movement are explicitly modeled as stochastic processes. Specifically, the condition for blocking LoS links is characterized as a set of possible blockage locations, the distribution of available IRSs is thinned by the criteria for reconfiguring LoS links. In addition, neighboring BSs are categorized by probabilities of LoS states to enable HO decision analysis. By projecting distinct gains of LoS states onto a uniform equivalent distance criterion, mobility enhanced by IRS is quantified through the compact expression of HO probability. Results show the probability of dropping into non-LoS due to movement decreases by 70% when deploying IRSs with the density of $\rm { 93/km^{2}}$, and HOs decrease by 57% under the optimal IRS distributed deployment parameter.},

When actuator faults occur, the faulty actuator introduces disturbances to the vehicle system, making the coordinated control of actuators under fault conditions more difficult. To solve this problem, a capability-based hierarchical fault-tolerant control (FTC) scheme is proposed for 4WID-EVs. Firstly, the vehicle dynamics model under fault conditions is established. Secondly, in the upper layer of the control scheme, a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller with nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) is designed to track the reference vehicle states under the impact of disturbances. In the lower layer, the driving capability and steering capability of faulty vehicles are assessed. Subsequently, a capability-based fault-tolerant coordinated distribution approach using fuzzy logic is introduced to dynamically distribute control commands to actuators. Finally, comparative works are conducted through both simulation and experiment. The results demonstrate that, compared with the sliding mode FTC scheme, the proposed scheme reduces RMSE, reflecting an improvement in tracking accuracy by 75% in simulation and 18.6% in experiment. The proposed scheme may serve as a theoretical reference for fault-tolerant control in 4WID-EVs.},

Therefore, this article presents a novel Voice over NTN (VoNTN) mechanism that combines a parametric voice codec and an artificial intelligence (AI) reconstruction model, achieving remarkably low data rate requirements of sub-1 Kbps. The parametric voice codec operates by first compressing and encoding vocal acoustic features at an ultra-low bitrate of 450 bps. These compressed features then enable real-time streaming inference through the AI reconstruction model, which synthesizes high-quality audio waveforms. The reconstruction model has a three-layer neural network specifically engineered for resource-constrained satellite equipment, achieving low inference latency with lightweight computational load. We implement and evaluate VoNTN in our testbed using an actual narrowband satellite.

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) full-duplex (FD) communication system. We propose an easy-to-implement, novel spatial domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) method, where an additional radio-frequency (RF) chain is implemented on the transmitter side of the FD transceiver to perform SIC only. The main idea is to transmit a specific SIC signal through the additional RF chain to the receiver of the FD system to mitigate the self-interference (SI). Based on this approach, we demonstrate that conventional MIMO precoders, such as zero-forcing (ZF) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF), can gain SIC capability within our system model, enabling FD operation of the transceiver system. In particular, we show that the ZF precoder outperforms the RZF precoder in terms of SIC. Furthermore, we assess our proposed SIC strategy in terms of energy efficiency (EE) and show through theory and simulation that our method is more energy-efficient than other existing methods for a weakly correlated communication channel. Additionally, our simulation results highlight the influence of the number of antennas dedicated to transmitting the SIC signal in our approach, providing a practical and clear understanding of the SIC performance and EE for both the ZF and RZF precoders.},

  abstract     = {The integration of blockchain technology with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents significant potential, offering prospects for enhanced cybersecurity and fostering innovation within the UAV industry. As the foundation of blockchain technology, the consensus protocol determines system performance and security. However, the high mobility and limited resources of UAVs render traditional consensus protocols, which require substantial resources, unsuitable for UAV networks. The dynamic nature of UAVs results in topology changes, further exacerbating the network environment&#39;s complexity. Therefore, we propose an adaptive chained byzantine fault tolerance (ACBFT) protocol tailored specifically for UAV network environments. This protocol utilizes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the chain consensus process, enhancing robustness and reducing communication overhead. In addition, we propose several sub-protocols to assist ACBFT in handling unexpected situations, including the rechaining protocol for managing malicious nodes, joining and exiting protocols for dynamic nodes, and strategies for handling accident situations such as UAV loss. Our security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrate that ACBFT not only increases throughput and reduces communication overhead, but also ensures security and efficiency},

  abstract     = {In the actual operating environment of trains, the state model often exhibits nonlinear characteristics, and the Kalman filter and its related theories are commonly used for accurate estimation of position and velocity. However, in the filtering process of nonlinear systems, the performance of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is severely affected by the influence of linearization rounding errors, which can lead to performance degradation and even divergence as the rounding errors increase. This paper primarily proposes a category of highprecision Kalman filtering methods to enhance the estimation accuracy of train operation states. Firstly, we establish identification methods for discarding residual terms in the state and measurement models, and design a new type of Extended Kalman Filter, referred to as the Residual-based Extended Kalman Filter (REKF), which incorporates the statistical characteristics of the residual terms in the Kalman filter framework. Furthermore, a REKF-embedded deep neural network (DREKF) is developed to further augment the REKF&#39;s capability in nonlinear systems. Numerical simulations show that the REKF improves the estimation accuracy by more than 5% on average compared to the EKF, and the DREKF estimation accuracy is better than the REKF with higher stability.},

However, existing FLEVS systems face critical challenges, including energy constraints, privacy risks, and intellectual property protection for car enterprise cloud (CEC) trained models. To address these issues, this paper proposes a frozen watermarking-based federated learning (FL) framework that protects both model integrity and privacy. The proposed approach integrates frozen watermarking into the global model, ensuring intellectual property security without degrading model accuracy in a continual learning setting. Additionally, we design an incentive mechanism based on a Stackelberg game between the CEC and mobile vehicles (MVs) to encourage participation in FLEVS while maintaining system efficiency. This mechanism derives the optimal information security strategy and determines the closed-form solution for the optimal reward function and local iteration requirements. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances privacy protection and system sustainability while preserving model accuracy and efficiency.},

To address the proposed NP-hard problem, we decompose it into three subproblems, i.e., the task chain optimization problem, the power optimization problem, and the UAV trajectory optimization problem. We then propose a task chain selection algorithm to more efficiently address the task chain optimization problem by transforming invalid solutions into valid ones. The other two subproblems are both solved by the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Based on these three algorithms, an inner-outer iterative optimization (IOIO) algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve the original problem with polynomial time complexity.

  abstract     = {This paper studies a $K$-user lattice-code based multiple-access (LCMA) scheme. Each user equipment (UE) encode its message with a practical lattice code, where we suggest a $2^{m}$-ary ring code with symbol-wise bijective mapping to $2^{m}$-PAM. The coded-modulated signal is spread with its designated signature sequence, and all $K$ UEs transmit simultaneously. The LCMA receiver choose some integer coefficients, computes the associated $K$ streams of integer linear combinations (ILCs) of the UEs&#39; messages, and then reconstruct all UEs&#39; messages from these ILC streams. To execute this, we put forth new efficient LCMA soft detection algorithms, which calculate the a posteriori probability of the ILC over the lattice. The complexity is of order no greater than $O(K)$, suitable for massive access of a large $K$. The soft detection outputs are forwarded to $K$ ring-code decoders, which employ $2^{m}$-ary belief propagation to recover the ILC streams. To identify the optimal integer coefficients of the ILCs, a new “ bounded independent vectors problem” (BIVP) is established. We then solve this BIVP by developing a new rate-constraint sphere decoding algorithm, significantly outperforming existing LLL and HKZ lattice reduction methods. Then, we develop optimized signature sequences of LCMA using a new target-switching steepest descent algorithm. With our developed algorithms, LCMA is shown to support a significantly higher load of UEs and exhibits dramatically improved error rate performance over state-of-the-art multiple access schemes such as interleave-division multiple-access (IDMA) and sparse-code multiple-access (SCMA). The advances are achieved with just parallel processing and $K$ single-user decoding operations, avoiding the implementation issues of successive interference cancelation and iterative detection.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a promising solution for enhancing the reliability and data rate of Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) visible light communication (VLC) systems through the utilization of optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The focus is on the infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) scenario, where streetlights serve as internet access points. The IoV-VLC system is modeled using an advanced non-sequential raytracing approach. A novel closed-form channel model expression is proposed, incorporating transceiver, RIS, and infrastructure parameters. The proposed model is then validated against broadband raytracing simulation results considering different combinations of system parameters, including, receiver aperture size, streetlight pole height, spacing between the poles, and RIS height. Moreover, based on the derived channel model, the error rate and data rate performances of the system are analyzed. The required numbers of RIS elements allocated to each vehicle&#39;s location, to achieve a target error rate and data rate values, are further derived. Finally, this paper demonstrates the impact of various transceiver, RIS, and infrastructure parameters on the system performance. The obtained results reveal that the proposed IoV-VLC system with optimal RIS deployment effectively addresses system outage issues and meets reliability and data speed requirements regardless of the vehicle&#39;s location. The results also shed light on the influence of various factors on system performance. Notably, the total number of required RIS elements is significantly affected by factors such as receiver aperture size, space between the poles, and transmit power budget. For instance, when considering the same power budget and error rate target, the required number of RIS elements for spacing distances of 20 m, 22 m, and 24 m are determined as 132, 244, and 428 elements, respectively. Conversely, the impact of pole height is found to be minimal as long as the space between the poles remains fixed and within the prescribed regulations.},

Within the PRMO, a product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) is constructed as the solution space, where the constraints of the precoding matrix and IRS phase shifts are naturally satisfied. The problem is transformed via the penalty method, and the parallel Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (P-RBFGS) algorithm and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method are exploited to find a feasible solution over the PRMS.

  abstract     = {Gravity gradient-aided navigation is a promising navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), in which matching algorithm is its key technology. Image matching algorithms have higher matching accuracy and information utilization than single point matching and sequence matching. However, the spatial domain image feature matching ability is weak in areas with insignificant feature changes due to the uneven feature distribution in the gravity gradient reference map. To break through this limitation and solve the problem of insufficient spatial domain image feature matching ability, we propose a gravity gradient image matching network (GGIMN) with adaptive adjoint smoothing for AUV navigation and positioning. First, a training set for GGIMN with equal numbers of positive and negative samples is constructed by preparing the gravity gradient reference map and fitting the gravity gradient measured map. Then, the feature extraction part of MatchNet is expanded to construct a deep learning network with five gravity gradient twin towers in parallel. Subsequently, an adaptive adjoint smoothing method that combines the idea of sequence matching is proposed to solve the problem of unsmooth matching trajectory and further improve the matching accuracy. Finally, the GGIMN is trained offline, and the gravity gradient map is matched and positioned online. The results of marine experiments show that the GGIMN has higher matching and positioning accuracy, and the average positioning error is reduced beyond 70% compared with onedimensional matching algorithms such as single-point iteration and sequence matching.},

The proposed detector exploits the characteristics of NTN line-of-sight (LoS) channels, where the path gain of the LoS channel is much stronger than that of the non-LoS (NLoS) channel. Specifically, we adopt multiple detection thresholds to capture PA collisions, allowing the satellite to recognize and notify the PA collision, thereby facilitating fast random access retrials. Also, we leverage multiple root Zadoff-chu (ZC) sequences while suppressing interference, so that the probability of PA collision is significantly reduced. Moreover, we mathematically analyze the performance of the proposed detector in terms of the probability of successful PA collision detection, the probability of false collision alarm, average random access delay, and average random access-success nodes under typical NTN LoS channel conditions. Simulation results verify that the proposed multiple threshold-based early PA collision detector (MT-eCD) achieves significantly improved performance over the conventional early PA collision detection schemes in terms of random access delay, number of random access-success nodes, and resource efficiency, while satisfying the random access requirement.},

In this work, we propose a hybrid orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple-access protocol in coordinated direct uplink/downlink and relay transmission for low-cost IoT paradigms, where a source node engages in direct transmission with proximate IoT users and relies on a relay node for distant connections. This protocol offers a successive interference cancellation–free approach and does not require any channel disparity for power allocation. Exact and asymptotic analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC) are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly improves OP–by 8 folds for the respective proximate users while maintaining the same OP for distant users over classical coordinated non-orthogonal multiple access–and delivers superior EC performance for proximate IoT users at low to moderate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and distant users at most SNR. Moreover, critical tasks for minimizing the maximal OP and maximizing the ergodic sum capacity have been undertaken to achieve outage fairness and enhance the overall system&#39;s capacity. These non-convex problems are efficiently addressed by applying the analytical asymptotic-inspired alternative optimization.},

The constellation design is trained to adapt to specific channel conditions, offering flexible control over the communication-sensing performances by adjusting a radar weighting factor. Simulation results show that this design outperforms conventional constellation formats such as 64-QAM and 64-PSK in symbol error rate (SER), while outperforming the 64-QAM in sensing error.

  abstract     = {Intelligent vehicles, often parked for long periods, are ideally suited to serve as computational nodes to expand the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) infrastructure, with containerization significantly enhancing the system&#39;s load balancing, self-healing, resource isolation, and security. However, fluctuations in task demand and frequent container image downloads during peak hours create high loads on containerized nodes, as multiple mobile devices offload tasks simultaneously, leading to significant processing delays. Many existing studies make the simplified assumption of predefined patterns of task arrivals, which overlooks this issue and makes suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we consider a Parked Vehicles (PVs)-extended MEC scenario, where multiple devices request services on PVs functioning as edge servers, all controlled by a central base station. Task arrivals follow observed patterns based on long-term trends, such as peak and off-peak periods, resembling realistic arrival patterns rather than predefined ones. To optimize task offloading by identifying these patterns, we propose the Sequence-Aware Task Scheduling (SATS) algorithm, which is a policy gradient-based deep reinforcement learning approach that integrates Transformer and LSTM architectures to capture patterns in time-series task arrivals and relationships between nodes in a collaborative and containerized environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of online task scheduling. The primary objective of SATS is to optimize the task offloading policy and minimize delay and energy consumption for all devices and PVs. Extensive numerical comparisons against baselines demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our algorithm.},

Moreover, to further enhance performance, we employ a gradient projection method to mitigate the impact of EMI. The numerical results show that the EMI negatively impacts the outage performance of devices, especially for the near device in the NOMA pair. In addition, the gradient projection method improves outage performance by adjusting the phase of STAR-IOS based on EMI statistics.},

In this sensing scheme, the RFEHS receives dual polarization (DP) signal, which is all of the base station&#39;s polarizations so that the sensor operation gets more frequent. The harvesting capability of DP and linear polarization (LP) from a real base station is compared. To prove the feasibility of the proposed sensing scheme, the RF energy harvesting was conducted from a base station on the rail track. As a result, rail temperature data were obtained using DP-RFEHS in the proposed sensing scheme, which has low-complexity and is a safer solution for autonomous trains.},

Fortunately, platoon driving can reduce fuel consumption and emissions on roads while improving intersection throughput. However, due to the complexity of intersections, the application of platoon driving still faces significant challenges. Existing studies often encounter reduced traffic efficiency when multiple platoons wait simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an adaptive platoon control scheme named APC for intersection scenarios to reduce travel time and fuel consumption during the passage through intersections. APC includes two main components: speed trajectory planning and optimal length planning. The speed trajectory planning minimizes delay and fuel consumption at intersections, and the optimal length planning ensures correct platoon maneuvers before intersection passage. Simulation experiments on the open-source platform VENTOS show that APC reduces travel time and fuel consumption by 20.30% and 13.99%, respectively, compared to similar methods. Particularly in high-density traffic, APC reduces travel time and fuel consumption by 23.08% and 19.58%, respectively. The code is available at: https://github.com/crashcar/APC-Demo/tree/main},

Therefore, implementing rapid and sustainable monitoring of these hazards is crucial. However, due to the variability of geological disasters across regions and their evolution over time, ensuring timely data collection and the ability to respond flexibly to disaster conditions presents a significant challenge. This paper designs a heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) system architecture for secondary disaster monitoring scenarios, including the follower UAV (FUAV) and the collector UAV (CUAV). Based on this architecture, a reinforcement learning-based low-delay data collection scheme (RLDC) is introduced. The scheme prioritizes the data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) with higher importance and dynamically plans the paths of UAVs to adapt to environmental changes. First, to address the challenge of data delay caused by the inability to precisely locate SNs, a path search algorithm based on fuzzy SN location is proposed. Second, to reduce data transmission delay between the FUAV and the CUAV, a load status update algorithm for FUAV is presented. Lastly, considering the dynamic changes in the importance of SNs, a bidirectional long short-term memory network multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient path planning algorithm (BMADDPG) is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the scheme can adapt to dynamic secondary geological disaster monitoring scenarios and achieve low-delay data collection from SNs.},

Subsequently, a novel prescribed-time distributed observer with low data transfer is developed, which is capable of estimating the states of leader UAV without the acceleration boundary of the leader UAV. Then, next by using the prescribed performance control technique to facilitate transform error, a prescribed-time formation control method is constructed to guarantee the collision avoidance among UAVs. The developed control method enables the formated follower UAVs to track the trajectory of the leader UAV within a prescribed-time, and obstacles can be effectively circumvented without disrupting the predefined formation.

This paper proposes line process model for IRS-assisted vehicular networks and analyzes system performance via stochastic geometry, where base stations (BSs), IRSs and obstacles are distributed according to one-dimensional (1D) Poisson point process (PPP) and IRS will provide virtual LOS link when V2I link is blocked by obstacles. Specifically, the difference between IRS perfect reflecting gain and random scattering is taken into account, where the signal from the serving BS is reflecting beamformed by IRS while the interference from the neighboring BSs is randomly scattered. In addition, the blockage effect is modeled by Bernoulli variable and the trade-off between IRS deployment and obstacle density can be exploited. Theoretical results show that, system coverage probability is significantly improved by 81$\%$ with the optimal deployment density of IRS compared with no IRS scenario.},

By utilizing user positioning information, LE-CLN first calculates user-localized over-complete angular measurements. It then investigates the correlation between LiDAR and CSI, transforming raw LiDAR data into a low-complexity format embedded with signal propagation characteristics. LE-CLN also adapts the use of LiDAR based on channel conditions through attention mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Joint communication and radar/radio sensing (JCAS) is envisioned as a promising capability in various future vehicular platforms, such as smart cars. The generalized joined coupler (GJC) matrix is a promising candidate for JCAS, offering a compact design and the ability to generate independently scannable multiple beams. However, the GJC matrix suffers from severe beam splitting problems when one beam approaches or overlaps with another, due to anti-phases among elements caused by its inherent structure. In this paper, the beam splitting issue of the GJC matrix is investigated. Reconfigurable directional couplers are adopted and configured with two different sets of values depending on whether there is beam overlapping. A joint scanning multibeam optimization (JSMO) method is developed to eliminate the beam splitting for the Blass-like GJC matrix by optimizing the coupler coefficients using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. It allows for simultaneous consideration of multiple potential beam overlapping scenarios in the optimization. Moreover, for the Nolen-like GJC matrix, an improved JSMO (IJSMO) method is developed by incorporating an alternating coupler and phase optimization (ACPO) strategy into the JSMO method. Representative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the JSMO and IJSMO methods in addressing the beam splitting issue. For the first time, continuous multibeam scanning has been enabled for GJC matrices without beam splitting, making them well-suited for JCAS.},

  abstract     = {The urgent need for higher sensing accuracy and transmission reliability in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), along with the limited availability of spectrum resources, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tends to operate in higher frequency bands. This shift, however, introduces severe sensing-communication coupling interference. Due to the openness nature of the wireless medium, ISAC enabled IoV faces more significant security concerns. Centered at the communication interference, traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes aim to maximize the channel quality difference between legitimate and eavesdropping channels to ensure the perfect secrecy. However, transforming directly current PLS methods into secure communication in ISAC-assisted IoV systems faces two significant challenges, because of sensing-communication coupling interference and strong directional beamforming caused by higher frequency bands. To address these challenges, this paper formulates an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the average secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmission power allocation and radar sensing power allocation, while ensuring the desired sensing accuracy and transmission reliability. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to optimizing transmission power or radar sensing power individually, joint optimization significantly improves the average secrecy rate upon convergence, with increases of at least 265% and 441%, respectively.},

To solve it, a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) strategy integrating platoon characteristics and node vehicle dynamics is designed to promote the platoon following performance under critical driving conditions, wherein the regulation of wheel rational dynamics of node vehicles is simultaneously incorporated into the platoon control. To this end, the vehicle dynamics model is firstly established with consideration of the influence of wheel speed. Then, the DMPC scheme is designed, including the formulation of the optimization problem for the node vehicles and the implementation process of the predictive controller. The sufficient condition of asymptotic stability for the platoon is derived by taking the sum of the cost functions of node vehicles as the Lyapunov function. Finally, the proposed control scheme is evaluated by simulations both in high and low adhesion road conditions. The results show that the proposed integrated control scheme of vehicular platoon can effectively ensure the asymptotic stability of the platoon in a broad range of operation conditions. Furthermore, incorporating wheel speed error can enhance the holistic following performance by 44% and 23% under high and low adhesion road conditions.},

To address this challenge, our method incorporates a tube-based model predictive control (MPC) framework. This innovative approach effectively compensates for the delays associated with cloud control processes. In our solution, the DCMPC algorithm, which is computationally demanding, is executed in the cloud. Simultaneously, a feedback compensator is implemented at the vehicle edge to improve the robustness of the system and ensure coordinated platoon control. We validate the proposed algorithm through simulation experiments involving heterogeneous vehicle platoons.

The methods and strategies of injecting such information and their impact on system performance are studied. To assure robust performance under falsified data, we propose mitigate solutions: a mitigation solution named Time-evolving Anomaly Detection (TAD). Furthermore, we model the system performance regarding the density and magnitude of falsified information, focusing on realistic scenarios where the adversary is resource-constrained.

However, existing schemes on non-reservation smart parking may cause parking competition, because users will compete for the common known available slots. Although the reservation-based smart parking alleviates parking competition through reserving at slot for users in advance, it may cause parking difficulty when there are no available slots for reserving. A comprehensive parking service is urgently needed, to reduce parking competition under non-reservation smart parking and parking difficulty under reservation-based smart parking. Hence, we propose the CRPark, to manage both the reservation and competition smart parking services.

  abstract     = {Beam alignment (BA), a core component of beamforming, is essential for achieving optimal directional gain in high-frequency communications. However, in single base station (BS) scenarios, BA may fail when the line-of-sight (LoS) path is obstructed. Multi-BS cooperation can effectively address this issue by leveraging the LoS paths from other BSs. However, applying traditional single-BS BA schemes to multi-BS cooperation scenarios leads to a substantial training overhead. To address this, we propose a sensing-aided simultaneous multi-BS BA (SSMBA) strategy in this paper. In the first phase, compressed sensing (CS) is utilized to enable simultaneous multi-beam training across multiple BSs, significantly reducing training overhead. In the second phase, leveraging integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities, a sensing-aided beam refinement technique is introduced to further increase BA accuracy and beamforming gain. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SSMBA strategy has advantages in both reducing the training overhead and increasing beamforming gain.},

  abstract     = {Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation using sensor arrays is a challenging task in noisy environments, especially when rapid convergence and efficient utilization of array elements are required. Addressing these challenges, we propose an adaptive filtering framework for DOA estimation that effectively tackles convergence speed, sparsity promotion, and array thinning. Typically, the complex Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is employed for error minimization of the adaptive process. In this work, we propose a sparsity constrained complex normalized LMS (NLMS) method for DOA estimation, which introduces faster convergence compared to the conventional complex LMS and NLMS adaptive methods. The sparsity constrained formulation of the proposed method is converted into an unconstrained problem by using a variable penalty factor (VPF). The update rules of the DOA filter weight and the VPF of the proposed complex VPF NLMS algorithm are derived. Further, we introduce a complex convex VPF NLMS algorithm that uses a convex combination of two complex VPF NLMS filters to further enhance the DOA estimation performance. We also present a theoretical derivation of the condition for mean square convergence of the proposed complex VPF NLMS adaptive algorithm. The performances of the proposed algorithms have been assessed through different simulations that highlight their effectiveness. Since the proposed algorithm promotes sparsity in the DOA weight vector, we also examine its performance in scenarios of array thinning, where not all sensors are utilized for DOA estimation.},

  abstract     = {The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems holds significant promise for future wireless communication methods aiming to achieve high-speed data transmission and expand communication coverage. However, channel estimation (CE) in RIS-assisted wireless communication systems faces many challenges due to the limited signal processing capability of the RIS. Existing methods often fail to fully capture the non-uniform sparsity of mmWave channels. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive sparse CE scheme involving two progressive algorithms, i.e., normalized least mean squares–log sum (NLMS-LOG) and normalized least mean squares–normalized least mean fourth–log sum (NLMS-NLMF-LOG), for RIS-assisted mmWave massive MIMO systems. The proposed scheme selectively adjusts the channel coefficients to improve the accuracy of the estimation, enabling more efficient exploitation of the inherent non-uniform sparsity in mmWave channels. The NLMS-LOG algorithm innovatively incorporates a log-sum penalty term into the cost function of the NLMS algorithm, thereby increasing the convergence rate. Building upon NLMS-LOG, the NLMS-NLMF-LOG algorithm employs a mixed error function to achieve superior performance across different SNR conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods, such as the NLMS, sparse exponential forgetting window least mean square, and sparse hybrid adaptive filtering algorithms, in terms of CE accuracy and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {Transfer learning (TL) is effective for addressing distribution discrepancies in fingerprint positioning. However, existing TL frameworks cannot react well to the heterogeneous feature dimensions of fingerprints caused by the topology variations of base stations (BSs) in evolving long-term environments. To address this issue, we propose a spatial feature topology-based heterogeneous knowledge transfer framework tailored for long-term fingerprint positioning (SFTP). Firstly, we partition the heterogeneous features into common and domain-specific (including source and target-specific) features from static and dynamic environmental components perspectives, respectively. Notably, we observe that the features captured from BSs with significant spatial distances differ across all samples, while those from BSs with close spatial distances show higher similarity. Based on these observations, we approximate the cross-domain mapping for each domain-specific feature by integrating the mappings of similar common features, which are easy to achieve using deep neural networks (DNNs). Subsequently, the heterogeneous feature spaces are effectively transformed into homogeneous counterparts, and a deep adaptation network (DAN) is utilized to further predict the positions for testing samples. Hence, SFTP is capable of capturing evolutionary environmental information for long-term positioning. Finally, real-world experimental results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed framework.},

First, we consider that the communication signal from the UAV is hided under the cover of noise uncertainty in the presence of sensing signal. Then, to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all users with the required sensing performance and covertness, an efficient iterative solution is designed by jointly optimizing the power allocation, trajectory and communication scheduling of UAV.

  abstract     = {With the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in rescue and logistics delivery, safe and feasible path planning in dense environments becomes particularly important. Responding to the challenge, this paper proposes a hybrid enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, namely GEPSO. The algorithm first enhances the PSO algorithm with three strategies to improve its convergence speed and adaptability and then combines it with the gravitational search algorithm (GSA). In this process, the acceleration of GSA is used as a new component for velocity update in the enhanced PSO, thereby strengthening the optimization ability of the algorithm and effectively balancing the capabilities of exploitation and exploration. In addition, this study employs cubic spline interpolation to fit the flight path, making the path smoother and more in line with the flight characteristics of UAVs. The experiments are simulated in a three-dimensional environment, compared with algorithms such as the PSO, GSA, spherical vector particle swarm optimization (SPSO), and differential evolution cylindrical vector particle swarm optimization (DEPSO), and the results show that the GEPSO algorithm can plan paths with higher stability and better quality in complex three-dimensional environments.},

  abstract     = {Novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures, known as beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs), have been proposed to enhance reflection efficiency and expand RIS capabilities. However, their passive nature, non-diagonal reflection matrix, and the large number of coupled reflecting elements complicate the channel state information (CSI) estimation process. The challenge further escalates in scenarios with fast-varying channels. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing novel joint channel estimation and prediction strategies with low overhead and high accuracy for two different RIS architectures in a BD-RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output system under correlated fast-fading environments with channel aging. The channel estimation procedure utilizes the Tucker2 decomposition with bilinear alternative least squares, which is exploited to decompose the cascade channels of the BD-RIS-assisted system into effective channels of reduced dimension. The channel prediction framework is based on a convolutional neural network combined with an autoregressive predictor. The estimated/predicted CSI is then utilized to optimize the RIS phase shifts aiming at the maximization of the downlink sum rate. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is robust to channel aging, and exhibits a high estimation accuracy. Moreover, our scheme can deliver a high average downlink sum rate, outperforming other state-of-the-art channel estimation methods. The results also reveal a remarkable reduction in pilot overhead of up to 98% compared to baseline schemes, all imposing low computational complexity.},

To begin with, a second-order cone program (SOCP)-based robust fully-digital beamformer (FDBF) is designed for minimizing the worst-case interference for the downlink of multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems. Subsequently, we develop a Bayesian learning (BL) framework for determining both the analog and digital components of the hybrid transmit precoder (TPC) from the FDBF. The above designs are subsequently extended to employing eigenvector perturbation theory for constructing the robust TPC for the cell-free mmWave MIMO downlink, where the users have multiple receive antennas (RAs). Furthermore, the multi-dimensional covariance fitting (MCF) framework is harnessed for designing the robust TPC of the corresponding uplink. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed TPC designs is evaluated by simulation results both in terms of their ability to mitigate the multi-user interference (MUI), and improving the spectral efficiency achieved. Additionally, the proposed designs are shown to be computationally efficient and equivalent to a minimum variance hybrid beamformer.},
