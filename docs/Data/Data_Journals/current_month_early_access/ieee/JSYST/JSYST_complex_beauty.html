  abstract     = {Recent research has shown it is possible for groups of robots to automatically “bootstrap” their own collective motion behaviors, particularly movement in a group. However, existing work has primarily provided proof of concept in regular, open arenas without obstacles. For practical applications on real robots, multiple collective motion skills are required. This article proposes a novel, multitask deep reinforcement learning algorithm and domain transfer architecture permitting multiple collective motion skills to be bootstrapped automatically and applied to real robots. The proposed approach is tested for tuning two collective motion skills for grouped movement and obstacle avoidance, without requiring a map of the environment. We show that our approach can tune obstacle avoidance parameters while maintaining high-quality swarming collective behavior when an obstacle is detected. Furthermore, learned collective motion skills can be transferred from a point mass simulation onto real mobile robots using our domain transfer architecture, without loss of quality. Transferability is comparable to that of an evolutionary algorithm run in a high-fidelity simulator.},

  abstract     = {This research investigates a supervisory interval type-2 fuzzy predictive control (SIT2FPC) technique to propose a novel control method for the automatic generation control (AGC) problem in interconnected power systems. The proposed control method comprises two main components: the interval type-2 fuzzy control (IT2FC) technique, employing a proportional integral derivative approach, and a supervisory predictive controller. IT2FC sets are considered for a multiarea interconnected power network, followed by the implementation of a supervisory predictive control method for the entire system. It is demonstrated that the SIT2FPC method effectively addresses the challenges within the overall system. By incorporating a predictive controller as a robust supervisory control technique, the proposed method can effectively handle unexpected problems that may arise within the IT2FC units. In order to evaluate the efficiency and validity of the proposed robust SIT2FPC technique, it is applied to address the AGC problem in a four-area interconnected power grid. Also, the IEEE 39-bus power system is considered as a case study to validate the proposed AGC method. The outcomes of six different simulation scenarios clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust control method.},

In this context, systems of systems (SoS) governance emerges as a promising paradigm to address these multifaceted challenges and optimize system-wide performance. This article conducts a comprehensive scoping review of SoS governance frameworks, focusing on their applicability to healthcare systems. Through a rigorous review process, 45 studies were selected from three major databases, yielding 37 distinct governance frameworks. The review analyzes publication trends, research objectives, applied frameworks, domains of application, and methodologies, providing a multifaceted understanding of the SoS governance landscape. The study highlights one framework that aligns closely with our proposed construct for healthcare system governance, and the alignment is discussed. In addition, technical components and variations across frameworks are identified and discussed, revealing the complexity and diversity of approaches in SoS governance.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) is essential for both military and civilian applications, but the docking phase poses significant safety risks due to complex environmental conditions that cannot be fully captured by precise mathematical models. This article proposes a data-driven docking predictive model that integrates variational mode decomposition (VMD), sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. First, a comprehensive simulation platform for the entire AAR docking system is established to generate reliable data. Then, to address the complex nature of AAR docking signals, VMD decomposes the data into modes with distinct natural frequencies, enhancing input accuracy. SSA optimizes the LSTM parameters, improving prediction accuracy and avoiding local minima. Based on these predictions, a docking safety evaluation network is developed to assess docking safety and prevent failures or collisions. Finally, the performance comparison with other models demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in diverse scenarios.},

The planning algorithm works in multipassages environment containing obstacles with different shapes and dimensions. The shape of the formation is determined optimally to handle nonconvex constraints like obstacle avoidance, intercollision avoidance between agents and allowable range of cable forces for minimal swing motion. The optimization algorithm also considers the response of the system dynamics and ability of controllers in tracking the optimal path and formation shape. Three types of optimization-based path planning methods are presented called simultaneously all waypoints, waypoint by waypoint (WBW), and waypoints in risk. It is shown that the WBW method presents the best performance in terms of adjustment of the formation shape for passing through narrow passages in complex environment without external or internal collision.},

  abstract     = {Distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems (DHMASs) link geographically dispersed agents through networks, harnessing information technology to foster collaboration. Considering the mainstream status of wireless communication in modern multiagent systems and the differences in the performance of interagent communication devices, we believe that it is appropriate to use directed heterogeneous networks (DHNs) to model distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems. This model not only reflects the directionality of interagent communication but also reflects the complexity of communication due to performance differences, thus providing a more accurate framework for understanding and optimizing system behavior. The study of disintegration in DHNs is vital for enhancing the decision-making agility of DHMAS. We introduce Directed heterogeneous network Attack sequence inference through graph attention MAtrix Generation Embedding and reinforcement learning (DAMAGE), an algorithm that integrates graph neural networks and reinforcement learning within an inductive reasoning framework. DAMAGE is designed to optimize the generation of disintegration strategies, improving the efficiency of network breakdown processes. Our approach includes a directed network embedding technique with a graph attention matrix generation module, which enhances the utilization of imperfect network structure information. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that DAMAGE not only increases the effectiveness of network disintegration under perfect topological conditions but also maintains robustness in scenario with imperfect topological information.},

This article addresses these challenges by introducing a novel permutation-based firmware attestation mechanism. Our method leverages edge servers as verifiers, low-cost memory, randomized permutations, and avalanche criteria for optimized security and efficiency. Rigorous formal and informal security analysis, coupled with performance evaluation, demonstrates superior performance against various attacks, achieving over 90% detection probability and effectively mitigating both remote and mobile software attacks.
