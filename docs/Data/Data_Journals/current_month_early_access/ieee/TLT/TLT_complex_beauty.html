  abstract     = {Much research has applied automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems to English writing instruction; however, understanding how students internalize and apply this feedback to reduce writing errors is difficult, largely due to the personal and private nature of this process. Therefore, this research utilized eye-tracking technology to explore the AWE system&#39;s effectiveness in reducing the writing errors of English major students. A total of 118 higher vocational college students majoring in English in China participated in this eight-week study. The experimental group studied with and received feedback from both the AWE system (Pigai) and the teacher, whereas the control group studied without the AWE system and only received teacher feedback. Eye-tracking experiments were conducted before and after the writing instruction. Participants&#39; responses during the eye-tracking experiment, first-person eye movement video data, and corresponding gaze data were collected. Leveraging the application of neural network technology in optical character recognition (OCR), combined with data from an eye-tracking device, we developed a system that can transform first-person eye movement video data and gaze data into heatmaps and eye-tracking indices conducive to analysis. Various data analysis methods were employed, including neural network algorithms, heatmap analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, independent-samples t-test, and Welch&#39;s t-test. The results for the post-eye-tracking experiment responses, heatmaps, and eye-tracking indices indicate the advantages of using the AWE system, which effectively enhances students&#39; ability to recognize writing errors while reducing processing time, by facilitating the internalization of writing errors through continuous feedback on such errors, and enabling them to apply this knowledge to new materials, thereby recognizing writing errors more quickly and accurately, and thus helping them to reduce writing errors. The pedagogical implications are fully discussed.},

  abstract     = {With technological advancements, the Metaverse is being used to enhance learning effects and learning experience to ensure quality education. However current empirical studies have produced varying results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was executed, leveraging the capabilities of Version 3 of the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software to effectively synthesize the data, drawing insights from 34 studies published prior to October 2024. The goal was to analyze the effects of the Metaverse on quality education, and to investigate the moderating influences of four variables: metaverse tools, educational stages, subject area, and treatment duration. The results showed that the overall effect sizes for learning effects and learning experience were .922 and 1.153, respectively, suggesting that the Metaverse substantially influences educational effects and learning experience. The four moderating variables all play a significant role in shaping the influence of the Metaverse on both learning effects and experience. This meta-analysis highlights a striking trend: the Metaverse&#39;s effects were especially pronounced for elementary and secondary school students, but less so for university students. Additionally, the Metaverse&#39;s effects were most significant in science disciplines.},

  abstract     = {Mastering the visually complex characters of the Chinese language poses significant challenges for students. The situation is even worse in Hong Kong, where students with different backgrounds, including students with/without dyslexia and non-Chinese speaking students (NCS), are placed in the same class. Interactive design has been proven effective in enhancing students&#39; learning performance and engagement. However, developing a learning tool for students with diverse backgrounds is challenging. This study proposes a robot-assisted Chinese learning system (RACLS) for those with diverse backgrounds and investigates its impact on learning motivation by a comparison study. In particular, 39 students participate in a five-day robot-led training program, while another 39 students received traditional teacher-led training. The comparison results show that RACLS can enhance the emotional engagement of students with dyslexia and strengthen the behavioural engagement of students without dyslexia. Interestingly, the learning motivation of NCS students in the experimental and control groups is enhanced similarly.},

  abstract     = {Properly predicting students&#39; academic performance is crucial for elevating educational outcomes in various disciplines. Through precise performance prediction, schools can quickly pinpoint students facing challenges and provide customized educational materials suited to their specific learning needs. The reliance on teachers&#39; experience to predict students&#39; academic performance has proven to be less accurate and efficient than desired. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed a marked surge in employing machine learning and data mining techniques to forecast students&#39; performance. However, the academic community has yet to agree on the most effective algorithm for predicting academic outcomes. Nonetheless, conducting an analysis and comparison of the existing algorithms in this field remains meaningful. Furthermore, recommendations for selecting an appropriate algorithm will be provided to interested researchers and educators based on their specific requirements. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature on academic performance predictions using machine-learning approaches in recent years. It details the variables analyzed, the algorithms implemented, the datasets utilized, and the evaluation metrics applied to assess model efficacy. What makes this work different is that relevant surveys in the past 10 years are also analyzed and compared, highlighting their contributions and review methods. Additionally, we compared the accuracy of various machine learning models using popular open-access datasets and determined the best-performing algorithms among them. Our dataset and source codes are released for future algorithm comparisons and evaluations in this community.},

  abstract     = {The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), exemplified by ChatGPT, has introduced both new opportunities and challenges in STEM and entrepreneurship education. This exploratory quasi-experimental study examined the effects of ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning on students&#39; learning performance, AI awareness, critical thinking, and cognitive load. 36 sophomore undergraduates participated in an eight-week instructional experiment, dedicating 3 hours per week to applying STEM and entrepreneurship knowledge in the creation of cultural products. The experimental group (N = 21) participated in ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (CCL), while the control group (N = 15) engaged in Non-ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (NCCL). The results indicated that the CCL group outperformed the NCCL group in terms of learning performance, AI awareness, and cognitive load, while the NCCL group excelled in critical thinking. The findings confirm that ChatGPT offers significant potential and advantages in addressing complex problems within group collaboration and stimulating group creativity, providing new insights into fostering students&#39; entrepreneurial spirit and skills. However, over-reliance on and misuse of ChatGPT may hinder student learning outcomes. Future research should focus on the co-creative problem-solving mechanisms between humans and machines in entrepreneurial education, particularly the interplay of knowledge, thinking, emotions, and actions in collaborative processes involving generative artificial intelligence.},
