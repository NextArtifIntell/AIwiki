  abstract     = {In graph-theoretical terms, an edge in a graph connects two vertices while a hyperedge of a hypergraph connects any more than one vertices. If the hypergraph&#39;s hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this paper, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher-order Lotka-Volterra population dynamics system and a higher-order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {The distributed identification of network systems under local observation has recently become one of the research hot spots. Due to the unobservable influence of other subsystems and the noise, it is difficult for local subsystems to achieve convergent identification under local observations. This paper proposes a distributed identification algorithm for local subsystems to identify their parameter matrices under local observation with a guarantee of convergence. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of local identification. We prove that by injecting an independent random signal to the local subsystem, which is easy to implement, using a simple least-squares method to identify local systems can achieve convergent identification for a certain probability. Meanwhile, we give the minimal level of variance of the injected signal that can still guarantee the convergence of the identification. Next, we add the designed input as a vector of Gaussian noises with decreasing variance to a known controller, proving that it can converge to the original controller. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting the underlying structure of optimization programs has unlocked computational gains and, in some cases, enabled distributed solution methods. One should expect that this structure can be similarly exploited for other important tasks like differentiation. Differentiating through optimization programs has in fact attracted much interest and led to numerous applications, from optimization-based layers in machine learning models to complex design problems formulated as bilevel programs. However, existing differentiation methodologies rarely leverage problem structure. In this work, we propose an efficient framework for computing gradients of constraint-coupled optimization problems. Gradients are decomposed into local components—computed in a distributed manner—and a coupling term—handled by a central coordinator. This centralized framework achieves significant computational gains, especially for large systems, and we provide sufficient conditions to ensure its validity. Building on this, we develop a decentralized algorithm—eliminating the need for a central coordinator–by leveraging the exponential decay of sensitivities in graph-structured problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the decentralized scheme allows for accurate and efficient estimation of important emissions metrics on large dynamic power system models.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a distributed algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium in a class of non-cooperative convex games with partial-decision information. Our method employs a distributed projected gradient play approach alongside consensus dynamics, with individual agents minimizing their local costs through gradient steps and local information exchange with neighbors via a time-varying directed communication network. Addressing time-varying directed graphs presents significant challenges. Existing methods often circumvent this by focusing on static graphs or specific types of directed graphs or by requiring the stepsizes to scale with the Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors. In contrast, we establish novel results that provide a contraction property for the mixing terms associated with time-varying row-stochastic weight matrices. Our approach explicitly expresses the contraction coefficient based on the characteristics of the weight matrices and graph connectivity structures, rather than implicitly through the second-largest singular value of the weight matrix as in prior studies. The established results facilitate proving geometric convergence of the proposed algorithm and advance convergence analysis for distributed algorithms in time-varying directed communication networks. Numerical results on a Nash-Cournot game demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

For the heterogeneous agents involving nonlinear underactuated coupled dynamics and limited communication capabilities, a unified event-triggered data-driven control method is proposed including a distributed event-triggered observer for interaction data recovery under DoS attacks and robust controllers to achieve distributed formation. The control policies and disturbances including couplings and external disturbances are modeled as performance optimizers and adversarial players in the zero-sum game. Robust optimal policies are obtained by developing off-policy reinforcement learning without information on system dynamical parameters. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under DoS attacks, and Zeno behavior for all agents can be excluded. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is validated by presenting two simulation examples of a distributed heterogeneous formation.},

The network topology among all AUVs is modeled by a directed graph containing a spanning tree, and the target is only known to one AUV. Estimator-based approaches with the backstepping technique are proposed for cases with or without communication. First, in communication-based networks, AUVs are allowed to transmit information via communication devices. A dynamic control law consisting of a distributed estimator is proposed. By analyzing with perturbed system method, the multi-vehicle system achieves global exponential stability instead of asymptotic stability. Second, in communication-denied networks, AUVs depend only on the relative measurements from the onboard sensors. A dynamic control law consisting of a decentralized estimator is proposed. By small-gain analysis, the global asymptotic stability for the multi-vehicle system is established. To demonstrate effectiveness, simulation results are presented.},

Compared to existing results, which require the form of the gradient function to be known, the proposed distributed feedback optimization coordinators considered only need partial information related to the actual input-output of the local objective functions. This partial information is used to estimate the gradient values at each moment. The overall closed-loop system is an interconnected system involving the module of optimal coordinators and the heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems with different timescales and thus is studied by using singular perturbation theory.

To tackle such a problem, the model-based distributed control scheme is developed via distributed continuous observer design. Subsequently, the data-driven distributed control scheme is proposed, which comprises a compensation term, an optimal feedback term, and a feedforward term. Specifically, a new kind of distributed adaptive continuous observers is first constructed based on the adaptive control theory to estimate the leader&#39;s state, output, and plant matrices, the off-policy learning method is then employed to seek the optimal control gain and identify the unknown system dynamics, thereby facilitating the construction of the control protocols.

To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed- feedback systems, ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if, and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed- feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.},

We first formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), then propose an efficient polynomial time relaxation-adjustment-rounding algorithm for solving the problem. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment step, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal points of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries in the solution. We establish mathematically that our algorithm yields solutions that are near optimal for a finite number of loads and with its sub-optimality independent of the number of loads. Consequently, the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in a per-load cost sense when the number of loads increases. Despite the gap between the MICP and its convex relaxation, we establish that the solution of the proposed algorithm can be decentralized by marginal prices of the convex relaxation. We also develop and analyze variants of the proposed algorithm for settings with uncertainty and with time-varying realistic load shapes. Finally, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm in a case study for the non-preemptive scheduling of electric vehicles charging loads.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a distributed safety-critical optimal flocking control algorithm for the multi-agent system. In general, safety (i.e., collision avoidance) could be guaranteed by the use of a control barrier function (CBF) as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, the existence of conflicting safety constraints from multiple agents could lead to a feasibility problem (i.e., the absence of a feasible control command) in distributed optimal flocking control algorithms. To deal with this issue, we propose two effective feasibility enhancement approaches. First, we develop a high-order CBF associated with the collision risk to alleviate the burden of distributed safety constraints on agents with a high risk of collision. Second, to enhance feasibility, a relaxation method is used to enlarge the allowable control space of agents. In particular, to decrease the number of optimization variables in the relaxation method, a selective strategy is adopted. This involves applying the relaxation method only to specific CBF based on the decision variable related to the overlap of admissible control spaces among agents. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority and validity of the proposed optimal flocking algorithm compared with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the centroid and formation control problem of multi–agent robotic systems. The proposed solution is based on a leader–follower scheme, where only a subset of agents, i.e., the leaders, knows the desired trajectories for the centroid and the formation of the system, while the other agents, i.e., the followers, are required to estimate them through a dynamic consensus scheme. The leaders perform trajectory scaling in order to cope with velocity limits of the single robots. Once the trajectories for the centroid and the formation are estimated, each agent can compute its own reference trajectory and a local control loop is designed to track it. An approach to map the velocity constraints of each agent to the velocity limits at the task level is developed. Then, a trajectory scaling algorithm is adopted to ensure velocity constraints fulfillment. The stability and performance properties are rigorously analyzed under two different assumptions about the planned trajectories. Finally, both simulation and experiments are run on Robotarium platform to show the effectiveness of the approach and the effect of parameter tuning on the achieved performance.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we consider remotely maneuvered differential-drive robots whose tracking controller is implemented on-board while the desired reference signal is generated by a remote control center and transmitted using a wireless communication channel potentially prone to cyber-attacks. Here, we develop a novel networked control architecture that allows the robot to track a given reference signal while enabling, on the robot&#39;s side, the detection of false data injections on the setpoint (reference) signal. The proposed solution takes advantage of a feedback linearized model of the vehicle kinematic model, a detector unit, and the coupled actions of two distributed predictive command governor modules installed at the two ends of the communication channel. We show that the resulting architecture guarantees constraints fulfillment and the absence of stealthy setpoint attacks. Laboratory experiments on a Khepera IV robot testify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

With the help of a cloud repository, a cloud-based differentially private DAC (cloud-DPDAC) control scheme is proposed. Agents&#39; states are added noises, and combined states are constructed. With combined state errors, a self-triggered rule for a cloud access schedule is proposed in a cloud framework. With this proposed scheme, the related system consensus accuracy and privacy-preserving index are analyzed. Furthermore, the relationship, between privacy-preserving index and parameters in a cloud access scheduling rule, is investigated. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme.},

  abstract     = {Networked control systems, facilitating state estimation through wireless multi-sensor data transmission, encounter challenges with spatial out-of-order issues, where data transmitted to the fusion center lack identifiable sources. This scenario, analogous to post office boxes receiving letters without addresses, complicates state estimation and affects system accuracy and reliability. To address this, we explore two spatial out-of-order scenarios, focusing on enhancing state estimation precision. For the random out-of-order scenario, characterized by unpredictable sensor data sequences, we propose an accumulative measurement approach and introduce two algorithms to restore data order, thereby improving state estimation accuracy. In the fixed out-of-order scenario, where a consistent but unknown pattern exists, our two algorithms efficiently restore measurement order within a limited time frame. Numerical examples and simulations substantiate the effectiveness of our methods, confirming their utility in maintaining accurate system state estimation.},

The divergence caused by nonconvexity is handled by utilizing a momentum-based system, and the distributed computation of nonlinearly-coupled optimization information as well as the distributed comparison of global function values is dealt with by introducing estimation state variables. Then, combined with time-base generators, the proposed multi-agent system is proven to be stable at a local optimal solution within a predefined time. The simulations of a chiller system and a numerical example are elaborated to verify and demonstrate the enhanced stability, predefined-time convergence, and distributed computation capability of the proposed multi-agent approach.},
