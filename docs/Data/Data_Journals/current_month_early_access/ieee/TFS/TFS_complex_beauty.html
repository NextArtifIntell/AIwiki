  abstract     = {Co-clustering algorithms separate a data matrix in blocks, by grouping, simultaneously, objects according to variables and variables according to objects, and has gained widespread attention in the last few years. At the same time, kernel-based clustering is a well-developed topic of research. These methods can efficiently group non-linear clusters through transformations in the data space. The research involving co-clustering and kernel function is still in the initial stage. In this paper, we proposed the first kernel-based algorithms that can learn the width hyperparameter of the Gaussian kernel automatically for hard and fuzzy co-clustering. The main advantages of the proposed methods are that there is no need for a previous additional step to tune the width hyperparameter, and we consider width hyperparameters that are the same for all clusters, varying only with respect to objects or variables (global methods), or they can also vary across clusters (local methods). As a consequence, our methods can rescale the objects and variables separately, according to their distribution, and in the local case, also according to the distribution in each variable cluster and object cluster, respectively. Experiments conducted over 14 real data sets, and compared with traditional clustering methods and previous state-of-the-art co-clustering algorithms, showed the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Biselection (feature and sample selection) enhances the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning models when handling large-scale data. Fuzzy rough sets, an uncertainty mathematics model known for its excellent interpretability, are widely used in machine learning, particularly for feature selection. While the consistent matrix has significantly improved the computational efficiency and scalability of feature selection, like most fuzzy rough set-based methods, it focuses only on feature selection and seldom incorporates sample selection. This feature-centric approach can limit classification performance, particularly in noisy and large-scale datasets where both features and samples require judicious selection. To overcome these limitations, this article explores the integration of sample selection with feature selection. First, we introduce a $\beta$-consistent granulation method to generate more accurate and concise fuzzy information granules, reducing the impact of noisy samples. In addition, a novel membership function is employed to distinguish noise while simultaneously evaluating both features and samples. As a result, a biselection algorithm with linear computation complexity is proposed to select high-quality features and samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to eleven representative algorithms, our proposed method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 9.66% and a 933-fold increase in efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Industrial time series prediction is highly important for the predictive maintenance of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. Deep learning methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the field of time series prediction. However, time series data from complex industrial scenarios often contain substantial uncertainty. This makes it difficult for deterministic deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions. Moreover, existing static methods often fail to meet the real-time requirements of industrial environments. To address the challenges, this study introduces fuzzy learning into deep learning models to overcome the drawbacks of fixed model representations. Therefore, we propose a fuzzy dynamic transformer (FDformer) that can adaptively adjust network depth according to the complexity of individual samples. Subsequently, we design a fuzzy feature extraction mechanism to capture feature information within the fuzzy membership degree, enabling the feature-level fusion of the fuzzy representation with the dynamic depth representation. Finally, we propose a training method for dynamically allocating loss weights, emphasizing the contribution of various samples to different exits, thereby improving the performance of time-series dynamic networks. Experiments on multiple datasets indicate that FDformer achieves minimal computational costs and excellent prediction accuracy across multiple datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.},

The objective is to leverage data mining methodologies to pinpoint anomalies within datasets, thereby revealing crucial and enlightening information. Herein, we introduce a groundbreaking outlier detection methodology, ODMGIS, that seamlessly integrates multi-granularity representation and information set concepts to devise the multi-granularity information set (MGIS) model. This model adeptly characterizes the distribution patterns of data points. Firstly, we employ entropy function and their complementary function as measurement tools to accurately quantify the inherent uncertainty in data with different distributions, and considers the sum of the two as a comprehensive representation of the overall uncertainty of the information source. Subsequently, an outlier score model is constructed based on MGIS, which can deeply characterize the degree of outlierness of samples, thereby effectively identifying abnormal points in the dataset. During validation, ODMGIS was rigorously tested on practical datasets from medicine and bioinformatics, and its performance was benchmarked against both traditional and the state-of-the-art algorithms, showcasing substantial benefits. This research not only contributes a fresh perspective to outlier detection but also sparks innovative avenues for exploring and advancing the granular computing theory.},

Subsequently, with the help of the prescribed-time scaling function and the barrier function, the problem of deferred output constraint is reformulated as a boundedness problem of the new variable. By introducing several useful lemmas, the designed controller can ensure that the closed-loop signals are bounded in the presence of actuator fault in the system. In addition, through the designed fuzzy control algorithm, it can strictly guarantee that the system output converges within the ideal range after the settling time.

This paper proposes a method for high-dimensional data regression using a Hierarchical Fuzzy Topological System (HFTS). The HFTS adopts a modular design, where each layer consists of an independent fuzzy logic system, enabling flexible operation based on feature distribution and output requirements. It utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based hierarchical feature classification approach to group high-dimensional data, mapping features into nodes and establishing edges based on similarity. This process creates a topological structure that facilitates high-density feature representation through neighborhood aggregation. HFTS introduces a cross-layer rule-sharing mechanism and an interpolation expansion algorithm to smooth fuzzy rules, thereby reducing interaction complexity. Additionally, an adaptive weight adjustment strategy dynamically optimizes feature importance, enhancing both robustness and predictive accuracy. When applied to eleven KEEL regression datasets, HFTS demonstrates superior accuracy, effectively addressing high-dimensional interactions while maintaining a balance between interpretability and performance},

To deal with the difficulty where the attack-induced topologies may destabilize the NE seeking performance, a novel prescribed-time function together with a resetting mechanism is delicately designed. Then, a PT-FDNES with adaptive gains is developed by incorporating the resetting mechanism to search for the NE independent of any global information. Subsequently, a novel PT fuzzy adaptive tracking control law is designed in the celebrated backstepping structure. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, we prove that actions of the MAS converge to the NE within the prescribed time and all the closed-loop system signals remain bounded.

This article introduces a label-informed outlier detection method for heterogeneous data based on Granular Computing and Fuzzy Sets, namely Granule Density-based Outlier Factor (GDOF). Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers.

  abstract     = {The twin support vector machine (TWSVM) classifier and its fuzzy variant (FTSVM) have received considerable attention due to their low computational complexity. However, their performance often deteriorates when the input data is affected by noise. To overcome this limitation, this study leverages the robustness of granular-ball computing (GBC) against noise to develop more effective classification models by integrating GBC with TWSVM and FTSVM. First, we introduce the granular-ball twin support vector machine (GBTWSVM) classifier, which incorporates GBC with the TWSVM framework. By replacing traditional point-wise inputs with granular-ball representations, we derive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBTWSVM classifier by solving a quadratic programming problem. Afterwards, we develop the granular-ball fuzzy twin support vector machine (GBFTSVM) classifier, where the membership and non-membership functions of granular-balls are defined using Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFS), enabling a more nuanced differentiation of the contributions of granular-balls from distinct regions within the input space. By incorporating these functions into the FTSVM framework, we derive a pair of non-parallel hyperplanes for the GBFTSVM classifier through the solution of a quadratic programming problem. Finally, we present algorithms for the GBTWSVM and GBFTSVM classifiers and evaluate their performance on 21 benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior scalability, computational efficiency, and robustness of the proposed classifiers in pattern recognition, highlighting their potential as advanced tools for noise-tolerant classification.},

This approach yields a comprehensive similarity measure that effectively captures both probabilistic and hesitant fuzzy aspects of PHFSs.M Building on this framework, we refine traditional set—based similarity measures—Jaccard, Dice, and Cosine—for PHFSs and introduce Layered Set—based Similarity Measures (LSSM), which externally integrate distinct semantic components. The effectiveness of LSSM is demonstrated by extending the CRITIC technique for decision—making, allowing for the determination of criteria weights even when information is incomplete or uncertain. We further validate the proposed measures using Spearman&#39;s correlation coefficient to analyze ranking stability and context sensitivity, facilitating their selection for specific decision scenarios. Finally, we apply the developed measures to optimize electric vehicle charging infrastructure in a large—scale problem, showcasing their practical applicability.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a novel fractional exponent-based looped- Lyapunov functional (FEBLLF) is proposed to analyze the stochastic stability (SS) criteria of a nonlinear Markovian jump systems under a mode-dependent sampled-data control through T-S fuzzy approach. A fractional exponent (FE), represented by an exponential function with a fractional parameter, is introduced to define looped FEs (LFEs) $\mathbf {\mathsf {(1-e^{-\hat{\alpha }(\epsilon _{1}(t))})}}$ and $\mathbf {\mathsf {(1-e^{-\hat{\alpha }(\epsilon _{2}(t))})}}$ where $\mathbf {\epsilon _{1}(\mathsf {t})= \mathsf {{t}-{t_{k}}},}$ $\mathbf {\epsilon _{2}(\mathsf {t})= \mathsf {{t_{k+1}}-{t}},}$ $\mathbf {\hat{\alpha } \in (0,1)}$. These LFEs are utilized to construct a novel FEBLLF and to partition the sampling interval into four distinct sampling subintervals, providing detailed information about the state within each subinterval. Subsequently, the sampling-dependent sufficient conditions are obtained as linear matrix inequalities to ensure the SS of the T-S fuzzy Markovian jump systems with $\mathscr {H}_{\infty }$ performance level $\gamma$ and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results, a nonlinear mass-spring system is assessed. Additionally, comparative examples are discussed to illustrate the better conservative results of the proposed approaches.},

  abstract     = {Manipulability optimization plays a crucial role in the motion control of omni-directional mobile redundant manipulator (OMRM), since it can reduce the risk of the OMRM to enter into singular postures. However, manipulability is a nonlinear nonconvex function with respect to the joint variables, and thus its efficient optimization is a challenge. In addition, existing manipulability optimization methods rarely consider obstacle avoidance. To solve these limitations, a time-varying quadratic programming problem (TVQP)-based manipulability-optimized obstacle avoidance (MOOA) scheme is proposed, which no longer approximates obstacles as a single point and avoids singularity in the motion control process. To address the problem that the traditional neural network with fixed convergence parameters is not accurate enough for system disturbance or external noise, this paper proposes an anti-noise disturbance fuzzy neural dynamics (AND-FND) model. The model adapts the fuzzy parameters and convergence rate based on error fluctuations, enhancing both robustness and adaptability. Notably, the AND-FND model utilizes membership functions and rules to describe controller parameter variations due to external disturbances and operational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the AND-FND model possesses global convergence and strong robustness. Numerical results and physical experiments demonstrate the practicability and advantages of the proposed method compared to the existing techniques.},

Compared with the existing method to deal with the mismatched double fuzzy summation inequality, the proposed one is less conservative and does not introduce additional decision variables. Three examples including the mismatched membership functions of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control system in the discrete-time case, the continuous-time case and the interval type-2 fuzzy system under state feedback control mechanism are used to show that the new result is less conservative than the existing one.},

  abstract     = {Online streaming feature selection is an effective approach for handling large-scale streaming data in real-world applications. However, many existing online streaming feature selection studies do not effectively leverage the correlation and hidden information in the label space. The measures used in streaming feature selection often face challenges such as computational complexity and insufficient information exploitation. To address these issues, we propose an online streaming feature selection method based on label enhancement and fuzzy synergistic discrimination information. Firstly, we define a novel label enhancement method based on label correlation, which does not require any prior knowledge of feature space. Secondly, we propose a new measure to evaluate the discriminative ability of multiple feature subsets for labels in fuzzy environment, called fuzzy synergistic discrimination information. It is bounded and has many interesting properties. The fuzzy synergistic discrimination information is computed directly based on fuzzy similarity relations, so the calculation is relatively simple. Thirdly, based on label enhancement and proposed fuzzy synergistic discrimination information, we construct a three-stage online multi-label streaming feature selection method, including online significance analysis, online relevance analysis and online redundancy analysis. Finally, comparative experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The influences of different feature sequences and these components on the algorithm&#39;s performance are further analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) in sustainable manufacturing faces challenges due to the diverse, complex, and highly similar objects in manufacturing environments. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often require extensive annotations and high computational costs, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a Fuzzy Optimization Feature Fusion Model (FOFFM) based on Vision Transformer, designed to enhance FGVC accuracy and efficiency. FOFFM addresses challenges such as information loss during image-to-token mapping and high category similarity by optimizing classification token capabilities and leveraging Contrastive Loss. By enhancing resource efficiency and reducing redundant computations, FOFFM contributes to lower energy consumption and operational costs, directly supporting sustainable manufacturing practices. Experimental results on the NABirds dataset demonstrate FOFFM&#39;s competitive performance with a streamlined, resource-efficient end-to-end training process. Unlike other methods, such as TransFG, FOFFM reduces computational complexity while maintaining robust accuracy, making it highly suitable for practical applications in sustainable manufacturing, particularly in optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact. This work provides valuable insights for manufacturing data analysis and contributes to advancing FGVC in sustainable manufacturing contexts.},
