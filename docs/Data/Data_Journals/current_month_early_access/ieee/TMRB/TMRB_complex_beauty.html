  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel continual learning algorithm that incrementally improves the performance of deep-learning-based walking speed estimators during level-ground walking with a powered knee-ankle prosthesis. While user-dependent (DEP) estimators generally outperform user-independent (IND) estimators, they require the pre-collection of DEP training data. In contrast, our real-time algorithm adapts IND estimators to self-labeled DEP data generated during walking, eliminating the need for pre-collected datasets. The algorithm also features a biomimetic scaling mechanism that adjusts prosthetic assistance based on speed estimates. We evaluated our algorithm on novel subjects (N=10) with unilateral above-knee amputations during treadmill and overground walking. For treadmill trials, when adapted with estimated and ground truth labels, estimators achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074 0.023 (mean, standard deviation) and 0.074 0.018 m/s, respectively, reflecting a significant 28% (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in MAE compared to non-adapted estimators. For overground trials, treadmill-adapted estimators demonstrated a significant 18% (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in MAE compared to non-adapted estimators. Our algorithm significantly reduced speed estimation errors within one minute of walking and delivered biomimetic assistance (r = 0.91) across speeds. This approach allows off-the-shelf powered prostheses to seamlessly adapt to new users, delivering biomimetic assistance through precise, real-time walking speed estimation.},

  abstract     = {Optical navigation is the mainstream technology used in intraoperative navigation for the orthopedic surgical robot. The information loss problem in optical navigation system (OTS) seriously affects the surgical process. Different from the conventional orthopedic surgical robot systems, we propose to use an additional navigation robot to adjust the viewpoint of the OTS. In this navigation-operation dual-robot collaborative robotic system for orthopedic surgery (NOR2CORS), a comprehensive range of functions are realized, including CT image segmentation, path planning, intraoperative operation, and active navigation. In this paper, pedicle screw placement is adopted as an example to assess the effectiveness and performance of the NOR2CORS. An assessment criterion is also proposed to assess the accuracy of pedicle screw placement based on the widely-used Gertzbein and Robbins classification. Experiments are conducted on a human spine model (24 pedicles) and ex-vivo porcine spine (10 pedicles). According to the proposed assessment criterion, 96% pedicles on human spine model can be classified as grade A and 4% grade B, with 67% of them as grade A2 and above. In the ex-vivo porcine spine experiment, all pedicle screw placements can be classified as grade A, with 80% of them as grade A2 and above. In the surgical process, all positioning targets can be observed without any interruption in navigation. These results demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of the NOR2CORS.},

Robots can enhance therapy by systematically delivering support in gait training, but often use one-size-fits-all control methods, which can be suboptimal. Here, we describe a model-based optimisation method for designing and fine-tuning personalised robotic controllers. As a case study, we formulate the objective of providing assistance as needed as an optimisation problem, and we demonstrate how musculoskeletal modelling can be used to develop personalised interventions. Eighteen healthy participants (age = 26 ± 4) were recruited and the personalised control parameters for each were obtained to provide assistance as needed during a unilateral tracking task. A comparison was carried out between the personalised controller and the non-personalised controller. In simulation, a significant improvement was predicted when the personalised parameters were used. Experimentally, responses varied: six subjects showed significant improvements with the personalised parameters, eight subjects showed no obvious change, while four subjects performed worse. High interpersonal and intra-personal variability was observed with both controllers. This study highlights the importance of personalised control in robot-assisted gait training, and the need for a better estimation of human-robot interaction and human behaviour to realise the benefits of model-based optimisation.},

  abstract     = {For many decades, developments of knee prostheses have shown a dichotomy regarding fundamental working principles. The industry has mainly emphasized on quasi-passive hydraulic solutions, whereas most research works have focused on powered devices, employing electric actuation. The former have an energetically passive effect at the knee joint, for which they often lack in providing versatility and movement robustness for the wearer. Powered prostheses can address these deficiencies, but are often rejected as they struggle to fulfill other user needs (e.g., weight and acoustic noise). Correspondingly, recent studies have emerged that attempt to significantly attenuate the deficiencies of fully powered prosthesis knees, partially sacrificing on device versatility. Recognizing the state-of-the art difficulties in balancing active assistance and user needs fulfilment, this work analyses human-centered design perspectives and their prospects for prosthetic development, in light of the often diverging user needs. We conclude that various types of both explored and yet unexplored semi-powered solutions may have the potential to provide the better trade-off between quasi-passive and fully powered prosthetic devices.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive mitral valve repair offers significant advantages over traditional open-heart surgery, yet it remains a complex procedure that exposes both patients and medical staff to radiation. To address these challenges, a significant research interest is growing in automating these manual procedures. Continuum robots represent a promising approach, thanks to their ability to navigate confined spaces. However, their nonlinear behavior presents challenges in modeling and control. In this study, we developed a robust position control method for a variable-length tendon-driven continuum robot. We designed a control system that effectively tracks the desired target positions by employing a constant curvature model and a Jacobian-based control algorithm with real-time position feedback. We assessed the stability of our system through Lyapunov analysis, demonstrating reliable convergence to these target positions. Experimental validation conducted in a cardiovascular phantom demonstrated significant improvements with respect to the state of the art. Our method achieved a trajectory following error of approximately 2.43 mm 1.63, 3.23 and a target position error of about 1.92 mm 1.73, 3.13. Moreover, the computation time per trajectory point was reduced to approximately 0.04 seconds, highlighting enhanced computational efficiency. These results showcase improved accuracy and efficiency in minimally invasive mitral valve repair procedures.},

To assess the performance of our orthosis, various tests are conducted to evaluate its efficiency in terms of tibiofemoral contact load reduction. For this purpose, a robotic test-bench, equipped with a robotic arm, emulates upper leg motion under applied forces (hybrid force-motion control). A pseudo-leg is attached to the robot end-effector, and the orthosis is mounted onto it. The test bench is instrumented with two six degrees of freedom force-torque sensors. Using these force sensors as ground truth, tibiofemoral contact force measurements are obtained with and without our orthosis and compared. A pair of cams is fabricated based on data from a patient whose information is retrieved from the Orthoload database. Experimental results demonstrate a contact force reduction of up to 100 force range corresponding to the robot’s maximum capacity.},

  abstract     = {Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) employing surface electromyography (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals has garnered increasing interest in areas of bionic prostheses and human-machine interaction. However, existing multimodal approaches predominantly extract global specificity at a single temporal scale, which neglects local dynamic characteristics. This limitation hinders the effective capture of global-local temporal information, resulting in restricted performance and frequent misclassification of dynamic gestures. To this end, we propose a novel global-local Fusion model, termed Temporal-spatial Dependence Fusion (TsdFusion), for sEMG-ACC-based HGR. TsdFusion harnesses temporal-spatial dependencies (Tsd) from multi-time scale handcrafted features and employs a Convolution-Transformer framework for global-local fusion, thus enriching local dynamic information while preserving global insights. Specifically, the Tsd inputs are independently constructed from sEMG and ACC through multi-time scale window segmentation and feature engineering. Furthermore, the global and local temporal-spatial correlations within unimodal Tsd inputs are characterized by the unimodal transformer and dimension-wise convolution modules, respectively. Subsequently, a Convolution-coupled-transformer progressive hierarchical fusion module effectively integrates intramodal specificity and intermodal hierarchical relationship for final prediction. Evaluations on four public datasets, including transradial amputees and healthy subjects, demonstrate TsdFusion outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal HGR methods. The TsdFusion effectively recognizes dynamic gestures, facilitating promising HGR-based interaction for prostheses or assistance robotics.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a leader-follower robotic system featuring a novel 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) Remote Center of Motion (RCM) mechanism, tailored to address the limitations associated with traditional posterior segment ocular microsurgery. The proposed 4-DOF mechanism employs parallelogram motion replication to relocate the bulky instrument insertion drive from the end-effector to the proximal linkage on the base, minimizing obstruction to the microscope’s field of view and the surgical environment. The mechanism’s orthogonal or coincident arranged degrees of freedom, paired with independent drive units, facilitate calibration and enhance control accuracy. A minimized internal constraint force optimization method was proposed to improve RCM point stability and tip positioning accuracy. The mechanism’s configuration and parameters were optimized through an analytical mechanics model, effectively reducing the constraint force on the internal components under the same external loads, thereby minimizing deformation and maintaining accuracy. To enhance robot compatibility, modular surgical instruments with a quick-change coupler were developed based on the analysis of traditional instruments’ characteristics. The prototype was built and kinematically calibrated to reduce manufacturing and assembly errors and thus improve accuracy. Following kinematic calibration to minimize manufacturing and assembly errors, experimental validation revealed positioning accuracies of 49 ± 23 μ m and 22 ± 13 μ m, repeatabilities of 25 ± 10 μ m and 9 ± 4 μ m, and RCM deviations of 13 ± 10 μ m and 18 ± 11 μ m on the X-Z and Y-Z planes, respectively. The cannulation experiment further demonstrates the prototype’s potential for robot-assisted vitreoretinal microsurgery.},

  abstract     = {Lung ultrasound scanning is essential for diagnosing lung diseases. The scan effectiveness critically depends on both longitudinal and transverse scans through intercostal spaces to reduce rib shadowing interference, as well as maintaining the probe perpendicular to pleura for pathological artifact generation. Achieving this level of scan quality often depends heavily on the experience of doctors. Robotic ultrasound scanning shows promise, but currently lacks a direct path planning method for intercostal scanning, and probe orientation does not consider imaging differences between lungs and solid organs. In this paper, we aim to fully automate two fundamental operations in lung ultrasound scanning: longitudinal and transverse scans. We propose pioneering path planning methods along intercostal spaces and innovative solutions for adaptive probe posture adjustment using real-time pleural line feedback, specifically addressing the unique characteristics of lung ultrasound scanning. This ensures the acquisition of high-quality, diagnostically meaningful ultrasound images. In addition, we develop a robotic lung ultrasound system to validate the proposed methods. Extensive experimental results on two volunteers and a chest phantom confirm the efficacy of our methods, and demonstrate the system’s feasibility in automated lung ultrasound examinations. Our work lays a solid foundation for automated robotic complete lung scanning.},

However, surgeons require advanced techniques, and several studies have evaluated surgical skills through motion measurements to improve skill proficiency. However, existing measurement systems have a low tolerance for occlusion and are difficult to use in operating rooms with many obstacles. Therefore, a hybrid measurement system was developed for laparoscopic surgery. This system consists of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a distance sensor, and an optical motion capture (MoCap). When MoCap data are unavailable, surgical instrument motion is calculated using the IMU and distance sensor data, and when it is available, the IMU drift is corrected using MoCap data. The MoCap markers were arranged individually, thus facilitating the measurement of multiple instruments simultaneously. The validation experiment in the wet-lab training confirmed that the error was smaller than that measured using MoCap alone, and the subjects expressed that the subjective disturbance caused by the sensors was very small during the procedure. The measurement experiment was conducted in cadaver surgical training, and 15 cases of nephrectomy were successfully recorded. This system facilitated highly accurate measurements during practical surgical training and surgical skills analysis.},

  abstract     = {In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the twist steering of the flexible endoscope plays an important role in tracking the preoperative path during cavity intervention. However, the flexible endoscope’s twisting motion has high nonlinearity and uncertainty, which bring challenges for accurate modeling and controller design. In this study, a novel active modeling-based improved control (AMIC) scheme is proposed, which achieves precise control of the robotic flexible endoscope’s twisting motion. First, the Coleman-Hodgdon (C-H) model is modified to serve as the reference model to describe the twist steering. Then, the model error in the C-H model is introduced as an extended state. Upon this, an active modeling algorithm is developed by using the unscented Kalman filter. The proposed model estimates both the twisting angle and the model error in real time. Based on the proposed model, the AMIC strategy is developed to enhance the tracking performance of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller for a reference trajectory. Finally, comparative experiments were conducted on a self-built robotic flexible endoscope under various insertion depths and tip-part configurations. Compared to the PID controller, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AMIC scheme achieves a 63.1% reduction in tracking error under a sinusoidal trajectory.},

  abstract     = {Tissue retraction, one of the basic steps in orthopedic surgery, is related to the smooth entry of surgical instruments into the surgical area and provides a clear surgical perspective for surgeons. This work introduces the first robot-assisted retraction system (RARS) specifically designed for orthopedic surgery. The RARS allows surgeons to set a safe retraction force and roughly set the posture of the retraction device at the beginning. To ensure that the RARS automatically completes the task in a safe manner, we propose a safety control framework that employs iterative enhanced control based on interaction model to handle the retraction interaction problem, and avoids interference with the operation of surgeons through null-space optimization. First, we performed a performance test of the RARS on a phantom model, and the results showed that the maximum tracking error of the retraction force was 0.51N, demonstrating satisfactory tracking performance. Second, we validated the effectiveness of null-space optimization by observing the evolution of joint positions. Finally, we conducted experiments on in-vivo animal and the results showed that the proposed RARS exhibited superior performance in safe retraction force tracking accuracy and tissue damage compared to traditional manual retractions.},

  abstract     = {Despite continuous advances in three-dimensional (3D) fusion imaging, two-dimensional (2D) X-ray-based fluoroscopy is still the gold standard intra-operative image guidance tool in endovascular interventions. The adoption of robotic technology offers the potential to bring intra-operative radiation exposure down to a minimum, or even eliminate it. Non-ionizing approaches, such as Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), are progressively explored as standalone or fluoroscopy-adjunct techniques for 3D vasculature reconstruction. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of real-time 3D Main Vessel (MV) modeling from the fusion of IVUS and EM pose data obtained from sensors embedded at the tip of a robotic catheter. This paper proposes to advance MV modeling towards a comprehensive radiation-free 3D guidance framework by means of intra-operative Side Branch (SB) detection and modeling. Two models are proposed to approximate the geometry of SB vessel ostia: a sphere and a cylinder. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) recursively estimates the state of these models considering the MV model, while the catheters navigates through the vessel. In silico and in vitro validation results show the potential clinical value of the proposed strategy for facilitating safer robotic catheter steering.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a robust myoelectric intention recognition framework to recognize human locomotion mode and detect irrelevant locomotion intention. The framework is integrated into the control system of the lower limb exoskeleton robot for experimental validation. Most conventional electromyography(EMG) intention detection methods aim to accurately detect the target motion intentions but ignore the possible effects of irrelevant intentions. In traditional action intention recognition strategies, most researchers did not consider entering irrelevant action intentions into the model during training. Therefore, when using a classification model, if irrelevant action intentions are input, the model will still recognize it as a type of target action intention. That can lead to incorrect recognition results, which will cause the robot to perform wrong movements and pose a safety risk to the wearer. To detect and reject irrelevant motion intentions, we first used the dual-purpose autoencoder-guided temporal convolution network (DA-TCN) to obtain discriminative features of the surface EMG signal. Autoencoders (AE)/Variable Autoencoders (VAE) are then trained for each of the seven deep features of the target motion intention. In addition, irrelevant motion intentions are detected according to the value of their reconstruction error. The recall rate of this method for the detection of irrelevant motion intentions exceeds 99% and the accuracy rate exceeds 99%.At the same time, we replaced the TCN with the LSTM model and compared the performance of the two after adding irrelevant motion discrimination. We collected data on seven goals and three unrelated motor intentions from seven experimenters for testing and completed an online experimental validation. The motion recognition accuracy of all the experimenters can be maintained above 86%.},

  abstract     = {The nasopharyngeal (NP) swab test is a method for collecting cultures to diagnose for different types of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Delegating this task to robots would be beneficial in terms of reducing infection risks and bolstering the healthcare system, but a critical component of the NP swab test is having the swab aligned properly with the nasal cavity so that it does not cause excessive discomfort or injury by traveling down the wrong passage. Existing research towards robotic NP swabbing typically assumes the patient’s head is held within a fixture. This simplifies the alignment problem, but is also dissimilar to clinical scenarios where patients are typically free-standing. Consequently, our work creates a vision-guided pipeline to allow an instrumented robot arm to properly position and orient NP swabs with respect to the nostrils of free-standing patients. The first component of the pipeline is a precomputed joint lookup table to allow the arm to meet the patient’s arbitrary position in the designated workspace, while avoiding joint limits. Our pipeline leverages semantic face models from computer vision to estimate the Euclidean pose of the face with respect to a monocular RGB-D camera placed on the end-effector. These estimates are passed into an unscented Kalman filter on manifolds state estimator and a pose based visual servo control loop to move the swab to the designated pose in front of the nostril. Our pipeline was validated with human trials, featuring a cohort of 25 participants. The system is effective, reaching the nostril for 84% of participants, and our statistical analysis did not find significant demographic biases within the cohort.},

  abstract     = {Robotic ultrasound (US) scanning of the spine is becoming an increasingly viable radiation-free alternative to CT scans and fluoroscopy. However, due to the complex shape of the vertebra, three-dimensional (3D) US reconstructions generated from two-dimensional (2D) US scans often lack important anatomic information, such as the spinous process. This paper investigates scanning strategies that reorient the probe during US scanning to improve surface coverage of 3D US reconstructions. A two-scan procedure with a path re-planning algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm uses information from a first exploratory scan to generate an improved imaging trajectory whereby the US probe is near-perpendicular to the targeted bone surface. The results show a 30.4%, 42.3%, and 75.0% improvement in surface coverage on a synthetic phantom, cadaver, and human volunteers, respectively, achieving up to 56% surface coverage on human volunteers. These results emphasise the value of exploiting information about the underlying anatomy to optimise the scanning trajectory. The increased surface coverage of the 3D US reconstructions will provide higher quality radiationfree visualisation, extending the role of US as a complementary imaging modality for safe and effective diagnosis and spine interventions.},

As wearable robots become more intelligent and automated, anticipatory control is limited for amputees because they lack prior knowledge of the timing and nature of changes in the robot’s motion, making human-machine collaboration more challenging. This study addresses the need for improved wearable robot transparency by enhancing a prosthetic controller to provide users with advanced notifications of locomotion mode changes. Five transfemoral amputees (TFA) wore our designed knee prosthesis and walked on a treadmill. We simulated a terrain misrecognition error by switching the locomotion mode from treadmill walking to stair ascent. Our study focused on three main questions: 1.) What is the ideal timing that the TFAs need to mitigate for machine errors? 2.) How do TFAs compensate for prosthetic knee errors? And 3.) How does the robotic prosthetic leg respond to the TFAs’ corrective actions? We found that the enhanced transparency system helps TFAs anticipate changes and adjust their gait to compensate for the terrain misrecognition error. Specifically, providing notifications about 650 milliseconds before a locomotion mode change significantly reduced the effect of robot errors. Although the error compensation from TFAs resulted in a larger magnitude of error induced by the prosthetic knee, the TFAs were able to tolerate it and improve balance stability. According to questionnaires on user preferences, with notification of prosthetic knee motion, the TFAs could trust the device more even though the devices might have occasional errors. This study demonstrates that simple notifications of the robot’s movement intent enhance the predictability of prosthetic motion, facilitating anticipatory adjustments that improve safety and user trust.},

  abstract     = {Motor-powered ankle exoskeletons have been shown to improve walking and rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with and without gait impairments (e.g., cerebral palsy (CP)). To date, ankle exoskeleton designs have either placed the motors on the shanks (direct or quasi-direct drive) or around the waist with Bowden cable transmissions. The former offers better transmission efficiency, while the latter reduces added mass biomechanical penalty. The biomechanical effects of motor placement may be magnified for individuals with CP due to weakened lower limb strength. To date, no study has compared how motor placement alters the biomechanical responses and user perceptions of individuals with or without gait impairment (e.g., CP). In this study involving 7 individuals with CP and 9 unimpaired individuals, we compared their metabolic cost of transport, lower limb muscle activities, and user perceptions when using ankle exoskeletons with either waist-mounted motors (and Bowden cables) or shank-mounted motors that were otherwise identical. Despite changes in lower leg muscle recruitment, results showed no statistical differences in the metabolic cost of transport. Shank-mounted motors were preferred by more participants in both cohorts (e.g., 6/7 in CP). These results help inform the ergonomics and mechanical designs of ankle exoskeletons and how they may be perceived.},

The proposed design is a constrained cable robot with a vertical workspace, capable of supporting and measuring the motion of a stroke survivor’s arm and hand during therapy activities, with a modular end effector design to simulate a variety of activities of daily living. The technical requirements of the design are described and linked to research on therapy activities, activities of daily living, and anthropometry. The kinematic and dynamic requirements for the design are validated in experiments. Potential improvements for the design include adding powered hand modules to assist users with hand impairments, adding a third rotational degree of freedom, and investigating parallel-spring motor designs that could reduce power consumption.},

  abstract     = {Exoskeletons used for rehabilitation must operate together with the patient to adapt to the biomechanical-inspired movements of the regular human gait cycle rather than operate by following a predefined trajectory without considering the human-robot interaction effects. This work presents the assessment of a lower limb exoskeleton whose motion is performed according to a collaborative approach given the movements of the human user and the relative force concerning the exoskeleton structure. The OpensimTM software serves to define the force and position reference trajectories to follow during the gait cycle, which serves as a reference for the hybrid control. These forces and movements are compared to the results of a virtual model that considers the interaction between the user and the exoskeleton in two possible scenarios. The first scenario contemplates the implementation of a position controller to generate interaction-independent movement of the exoskeleton. The second scenario considers the force exerted by the exoskeleton on the patient to trigger a force-based controller after trespassing a predefined value. This leads to a hybrid control scheme, which considers the position restrictions in the closed-loop feedback control strategy. Using this approach, the exoskeleton can collaborate actively with the user and provide motion as required, responding to position-controlled motion if the user is not opposed to the exoskeleton motion. This novel strategy permits the evaluation of a hybrid position-force controller for wearing the active orthosis. Numeric simulations show the performance of the proposed system. These outcomes confirm the supposed advantages of the proposed controller.},
