  abstract = {Over the last decades, photoreceptive proteins were extensively studied with biophysical methods to gain a fundamental understanding of their working mechanisms and further guide the development of optogenetic tools. Time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the key methods to access their functional non-equilibrium processes with high temporal resolution but has the major drawback that experimental data are usually highly complex. Linking the spectral response to specific molecular events is a major obstacle. Here, we investigate a cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptor with a combined approach of transient absorption spectroscopy in the visible and IR spectral regions. We obtain kinetic information in both spectral regions by analysis with two different fitting methods: global multiexponential fitting and lifetime analysis. We investigate the ground state dynamics that follow photoexcitation in both directions of the bi-stable photocycle (Pr * and Pg * ) in the nanosecond and microsecond time regimes. We find two ground state intermediates associated with the decay of Pr * and four with Pg * and report the macroscopic time constants of their interconversions. One of these processes is assigned to a structural change in the protein backbone.},

We found that the Gruneisen parameter varied in the range of 2.1–3.1 and was significantly higher than typically observed experimentally in real polymers. In the glass, a theory was developed for γ using a cell model in which the beads are harmonically bound to their respective cell centers. The resulting Gruneisen parameter is predicted to increase slightly with temperature. Above the glass transition temperature, we employed the generalized Flory dimer equation-of-state and the polymer reference interaction model theory to calculate γ. In these calculations, we found that γ decreased with temperature in the liquid. The theoretical predictions for γ were found to be in good qualitative agreement with our MD simulations, without any adjustable parameters, both above and below T g . In experiments on real polymers, γ undergoes a sharp discontinuity at the glass transition. By contrast, in our MD simulations, γ varies smoothly over a broad transition region.},

  abstract = {Polymers are desirable optoelectronic materials, stemming from their solution processability, tunable electronic properties, and large absorption coefficients. An exciting development is the recent discovery that singlet fission (SF), the conversion of a singlet exciton to a pair of triplet states, can occur along the backbone of an individual conjugated polymer chain. Compared to other intramolecular SF compounds, the nature of the triplet pair state in SF polymers remains poorly understood, hampering the development of new materials with optimized excited state dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of solvent polarity on the triplet pair dynamics in the SF polymer polybenzodithiophene-thiophene-1,1-dioxide. We use transient emission measurements to study isolated polymer chains in solution and use the change in the solvent polarity to investigate the role of charge transfer character in both the singlet exciton and the triplet pair multiexciton. We identify both singlet fluorescence and direct triplet pair emission, indicating significant symmetry breaking. Surprisingly, the singlet emission peak is relatively insensitive to solvent polarity despite its nominal “charge-transfer” nature. In contrast, the redshift of the triplet pair energy with increasing solvent polarity indicates significant charge transfer character. While the energy separation between singlet and triplet pair states increases with solvent polarity, the overall SF rate constant depends on both the energetic driving force and additional environmental factors. The triplet pair lifetime is directly determined by the solvent effect on its overall energy. The dominant recombination channel is a concerted, radiationless decay process that scales as predicted by a simple energy gap law.},

The Hamiltonian is represented in a diabatic basis consisting of Frenkel-like donor and acceptor fragment excitations as well as charge-transfer (CT) excitations between neighboring fragments. States are coupled to each other through electron and hole transfer as well as Coulombically, through interacting fragment transition dipole moments. Local vibronic coupling involving the prominent aromatic-quinoidal vibrational mode, which is responsible for pronounced vibronic progressions in most conjugated oligomers and polymers, is also included. The DAD repeat unit is shown to behave like a J-aggregate trimer, driven by both the sizable in-phase electron and hole transfer integrals between donor and acceptor fragments as well as negative Coulomb coupling between donor and acceptor fragment excitations. The J-aggregate behavior is enhanced in the polymer limit through inter-repeat unit coupling, with the 0–0 vibronic peak significantly enhanced in the lowest-energy near-IR band. In addition, the radiative rate is enhanced by the number of coherently connected repeat units. The near-IR band is shown to possess roughly equal admixtures of CT and Frenkel-like excitations. Applications are made to the polymer PffBT4T-2DT, with the simulated absorption spectrum quantitatively capturing the salient features of the measured spectrum.},

  abstract = {Metal alloys are ubiquitous in many branches of heterogeneous catalysis, and it is now fairly well established that the local atomic structure of an alloy can have a profound influence on its chemical reactivity. While these effects can be difficult to probe in nanoparticle catalysts, model studies using well defined single crystal surfaces alloyed with dopants enable these structure–function correlations to be drawn. The first step in this approach involves understanding the alloying mechanism and the type of ensembles formed. In this study, we examined the atomic structure of RhCu single-atom alloys formed on Cu(111), Cu(100), and Cu(110) surfaces. Our results show a striking difference between Rh atoms alloying in Cu(111) vs the more open Cu(100) and Cu(110) surface facets. Unlike Cu(111) on which Rh atoms preferentially place-exchange with Cu atoms in the local regions above step edges leaving the majority of the Cu surface free of Rh, highly dispersed, homogeneous alloys are formed on the Cu(100) and (110) surfaces. These dramatically different alloying mechanisms are understood by quantifying the energetic barriers for atomic hopping, exchange, swapping, and vacancy filling events for Rh atoms on different Cu surfaces through theoretical calculations. Density functional theory results indicate that the observed differences in the alloying mechanism can be attributed to a faster hopping rate, relatively high atomic exchange barriers, and stronger binding of Rh atoms in the vicinity of step edges on Cu(111) compared to Cu(110) and Cu(100). These model systems will serve as useful platforms for examining structure sensitive chemistry on single-atom alloys.},

Our results suggest that M = Sc, Ti, and V are the best candidates for gas storage applications, while Ni and Co seem particularly promising with respect to activation of the C–H bond in methane. We find a strong and linear correlation between the adsorption energy of methane and the degree of back-donation of electrons from occupied metal d -states to antibonding methane states. A similar correlation is found between the elongation of C–H bonds and electron back-donation. An important role is played by the graphene substrate in enhancing the binding of methane on metal atoms, compared to the negligible binding observed on isolated metal atoms.},

The root mean square error for the predicted hydration free energies is within 1 kJ/mol of experimental measurements of Ben-Naim et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 81 (4), 2016–2027 (1984)]. The good prediction of hydration free energies is particularly noteworthy, as it is an important fundamental property. Similar hydration free energies of ethane relative to methane and of ethanol relative to methanol are attributed to a near cancellation of cavitation penalty and favorable contributions from dispersion and Coulombic interactions as a result of the additional methyl group.},

The results of our simulations reveal that water presents a non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius diffusion crossover.

  abstract = {In some binary alloys, the solute exhibits high or fast diffusion with low activation energy. In order to understand this, diffusion of solute atoms through a lattice of body centered cubic solvent atoms has been investigated with molecular dynamics technique. Surprisingly, solutes exhibit two distinct diffusivity maxima. Solutes migrate through the lattice mainly by diffusion from one tetrahedral void to another ( tt ) and, less frequently, by diffusion from a tetrahedral to an octahedral void ( to ) or reverse jumps ( ot ). Solutes with maximum diffusivity show smooth decay of the velocity autocorrelation function without backscattering. The average force on the solutes of various diameters correlates well with the position and intensity of the diffusivity maxima exhibited by the solutes. This suggests that the explanation for the diffusivity maxima lies in the levitation effect, which suggests a lowered force on the solute at the diffusivity maxima. The activation energy computed for the solutes of different sizes confirms this interpretation as it is lower for the solutes at the diffusivity maxima. Calculations with blocking of octahedral voids show that the second diffusivity maximum has significant contributions from the to diffusion path. These findings obtained here explain the fast solute/impurity atom diffusivity and low activation energies seen in the literature in many of the alloys, such as Co in γ -U and β -Zr, Cu in Pr, or Au in Th.},

Specifically, it is exploited that NMR experiments in homogeneous and gradient magnetic fields provide access to local and diffusive motions, respectively, and that the isotope selectivity of the method allows us to characterize the dynamics of the water molecules and the lithium ions separately. We find that the silica confinements cause a slowdown of the dynamics on all length scales, which is stronger at lower temperatures and in narrower pores and is more prominent for the lithium ions than the water molecules. However, we do not observe a temperature-dependent decoupling of short-range and long-range dynamics inside the pores. 7 Li NMR correlation functions show bimodal decays when the pores are sufficiently wide ( d &gt; 3 nm) so that bulk-like ion dynamics in the pore centers can be distinguished from significantly retarded ion dynamics at the pore walls, possibly in a Stern layer. However, we do not find evidence for truly immobile fractions of water molecules or lithium ions and, hence, for the existence of a static Stern layer in any of the studied silica pores.},

  abstract = {Functional group substituents are a ubiquitous tool in ground-state organic chemistry often employed to fine-tune chemical properties and obtain desired chemical reaction outcomes. Their effect on photoexcited electronic states, however, remains poorly understood. To help build an intuition for these effects, we have studied ethylene, substituted with electron acceptor (cyano) and/or electron donor (methoxy) substituents, both theoretically and experimentally: using ab initio quantum molecular dynamics and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results show the consistent trend that photo-induced ethylenic dynamics is primarily localized to the carbon with the greater electron density. For doubly substituted ethylenes, the trend is additive when both substituents are located on opposite carbons, whereas the methoxy group (in concert with steric effects) dominates when both substituents are located on a single carbon atom. These results point to the development of rules for structure–dynamics correlations; in this case, a novel mechanistic ultrafast photochemistry for conjugated carbon chains employing long-established chemical concepts.},

The nature and the dynamics of the multiexciton state are tuned by altering the through-bond electronic couplings in the ground and excited states and by changing the solvent environment. Our results show that controlling the electronic coupling between the two chromophores by an appropriate choice of linker can result in independent triplet state formation, even though the initial correlated triplet pair state is confined to a dimer. Moreover, even in polar solvents, if the electronic coupling is strong, the correlated triplet pair state is observed prior to symmetry-breaking charge separation. These results point out the close relationship between the singlet, correlated triplet pair, and charge transfer states in molecular dimers.},

The mass spectra of the clusters after photofragmentation reveal marked drops in the intensity of AgAu 8 + , AgAu 14 + , and AgAu 34 + , indicating a higher relative stability of these sizes. This is confirmed by the calculated AgAu N −1 + ( N ≤ 17) dissociation energies peaking for AgAu 6 + , AgAu 8 + , and AgAu 14 + . While the stability of AgAu 6 + and AgAu 8 + can be explained by the accepted electronic shell model for metal clusters, density of states analysis shows that the geometry plays an important role in the higher relative stability of AgAu 14 + . For this size, there is a degeneracy lifting of the 1 D shell, which opens a relatively large HOMO–LUMO gap with a subshell-closed 1 S 2 1 P 4 1 P 2 1 D 6 electronic configuration.},

In this report, we continue these investigations by measuring the scattering behavior of the NO–H 2 system in the previously unexplored 0.4 cm −1 –10 cm −1 region for the parity changing de-excitation channel of NO. We study state-specific inelastic collisions with both para - and ortho -H 2 in a crossed molecular beam experiment involving Stark deceleration and velocity map imaging. We are able to resolve resonance features in the measured integral and differential cross sections. Results are compared to predictions from two previously available potential energy surfaces, and we are able to clearly discriminate between the two potentials. We furthermore identify the partial wave contributions to these resonances and investigate the nature of the differences between collisions with para - and ortho -H 2 . Additionally, we tune the energy spreads in the experiment to our advantage to probe scattering behavior at energies beyond our mean experimental limit.},

The fact that newly calculated DFT/B3LYP energies for the main stationary points are close to the coupled-cluster single-double-triple [CCSD(T)] values, recently reported in the literature, provides reassurance about the accuracy of the constructed PES. Eight conformers and numerous saddle points are identified and characterized by describing geometries, relative stability, and harmonic frequencies. Stochastic and dynamical approaches are employed to study the vibrational ground state. Specifically, diffusion Monte Carlo simulations and approximate quantum dynamics, performed by means of the adiabatic switching semiclassical initial value representation technique, provide zero-point energies in excellent agreement with each other. The PES we report is sufficiently complete to permit spectroscopic and dynamical studies on glycine, which may be of interest to the biochemical and astrochemistry communities.},

  abstract = {We develop a theoretical framework for a class of pulse sequences in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of rotating solids, which are applicable to nuclear spins with anisotropic interactions substantially larger than the spinning frequency, under conditions where the radiofrequency amplitude is smaller than or comparable to the spinning frequency. The treatment is based on average Hamiltonian theory and allows us to derive pulse sequences with well-defined relationships between the pulse parameters and spinning frequency for exciting specific coherences without the need for any detailed calculations. This framework is applied to the excitation of double-quantum spectra of 14 N and is used both to evaluate the existing low-power pulse schemes and to predict the new ones, which we present here. It is shown that these sequences can be designed to be γ -encoded and therefore allow the acquisition of sideband-free spectra. It is also shown how these new double-quantum excitation sequences are incorporated into heteronuclear correlation NMR, such as 1 H– 14 N dipolar double-quantum heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation spectroscopy. The new experiments are evaluated both with numerical simulations and experiments on glycine and N-acetylvaline, which represent cases with “moderate” and “large” quadrupolar interactions, respectively. The analyzed pulse sequences perform well for the case of a “moderate” quadrupolar interaction, however poorly with a “large” quadrupolar interaction, for which future work on pulse sequence development is necessary.},

  abstract = {[ n ]Cycloparaphenylene ([ n ]CPP) molecules have attracted broad interests due to their unique properties resulting from the distorted and strained aromatic hoop structures. In this work, we apply sub-nanometer resolved tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to investigate the adsorption configurations and structural deformations of [12]CPP molecules on metal substrates with different crystallographic orientations. The TERS spectra for a [12]CPP molecule adsorbed on the isotropic Cu(100) surface are found to be essentially the same over the whole nanohoop, indicating an alternately twisted structure that is similar to the [12]CPP molecule in free space. However, when the [12]CPP molecules are adsorbed on the anisotropic Ag(110) surface, the molecular shape is found to be severely deformed into two types of adsorption configurations: one showing an interesting “Möbius-like” feature and the other showing a symmetric bending structure. Their TERS spectral features are found to be site-dependent over the hoop and even show peak splitting for the out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations. The deformed structural models gain strong support from the spatial distribution of “symmetric” TERS spectra at different positions on the hoop. Further TERS imaging, with a spatial resolution down to ∼2 Å, provides a panoramic view on the local structural deformations caused by different tilting of the benzene units in real space, which offers insights into the subtle changes in the aromatic properties over the deformed hoop owing to inhomogeneous molecule−substrate interactions. The ability of TERS to probe the molecular structure and local deformation at the sub-molecular level, as demonstrated here, is important for understanding surface science as well as molecular electronics and optoelectronics at the nanoscale.},

While the interaction with light is included up to the second order, the treatment of the excitation–environment coupling is exact and results in an exact expression for the reduced excitonic density matrix that is manifestly related to the spectroscopic picture of the photoexcitation process. This expression takes fully into account the environmental reorganization processes triggered by the two interactions with light. This is particularly important for slow environments and/or strong excitation–environment coupling. Within the exponential decomposition scheme, we demonstrate how our result can be recast as the hierarchy of equations of motion (HEOM) that explicitly and consistently includes the photoexcitation step. We analytically describe the environmental reorganization dynamics triggered by a delta-like excitation of a single chromophore and demonstrate how our HEOM, in appropriate limits, reduces to the Redfield equations comprising a pulsed photoexcitation and the nonequilibrium Förster theory. We also discuss the relation of our formalism to the combined Born–Markov–HEOM approaches in the case of excitation by thermal light.},

We carefully consider how compressible hPF-MD compares to its mean-field counterpart for two particular EOS, adopted from the Cell Model for polymers and the Carnahan–Starling expression for hard spheres. Here, we performed a very basic analysis for a single-component system, focusing on the significance of various particle-based parameters and the particle-to-field projection. Our results illustrate the key role of the particle density per field grid cell and show that projection based on a Gaussian kernel is preferred over the standard cloud-in-cell projection. They also suggest that the behavior of hPF-MD close to the critical point is non-classical, i.e., in agreement with a critical exponent for a pure particle description, despite the mean-field origin of the method.},

The observed kinetics are site-averages, typically dominated by a small fraction of highly active sites. Standard sampling methods require expensive ab initio calculations at an intractable number of sites to converge on the site-averaged kinetics. We present a new method that efficiently estimates the site-averaged turnover frequency (TOF). The new estimator uses the same importance learning algorithm [Vandervelden et al. , React. Chem. Eng. 5 , 77 (2020)] that we previously used to compute the site-averaged activation energy. We demonstrate the method by computing the site-averaged TOF for a simple disordered lattice model of an amorphous catalyst.

Specifically, by exploiting the connection between the work statistics of time-reversed protocol pairs, we develop near-equilibrium approximations for moments of the excess work and analyze the dominant contributions to the precision and accuracy of standard nonequilibrium free-energy estimators. Within linear response, minimum-dissipation protocols follow the geodesics of the Riemannian metric induced by the Stokes friction tensor. We find that the next-order contribution arises from the rank-3 supra-Stokes tensor that skews the geometric structure such that minimum-dissipation protocols follow the geodesics of a generalized cubic Finsler metric. Thus, near equilibrium, the supra-Stokes tensor determines the leading-order contribution to the bias of bidirectional free-energy estimators.},

  abstract = {We utilize first-principles theory to investigate photo-induced excited-state dynamics of functionalized perylene diimide. This class of materials is highly suitable for solar energy conversion because of the strong optical absorbance, efficient energy transfer, and chemical tunability. We couple time-dependent density functional theory to a recently developed time-resolved non-adiabatic dynamics approach based on a semi-empirical description. By studying the monomer and dimer, we focus on the role stacking plays on the time-scales associated with excited-state non-radiative relaxation from a high excitonic state to the lowest energy exciton. We predict that the time-scale for energy conversion in the dimer is significantly faster than that in the monomer when equivalent excited states are accounted for. Additionally, for the dimer, the decay from the second to the nearly degenerate lowest energy excited-state involves two time-scales: a rapid decay on the order of ∼10 fs followed by a slower decay of ∼100 fs. Analysis of the spatial localization of the electronic transition density during the internal conversion process points out the existence of localized states on individual monomers, indicating that the strength of thermal fluctuations exceeds electronic couplings between the states such that the exciton hops between localized states throughout the simulation.},

  abstract = {Understanding and managing the influence that either external forces or non-equilibrated environments may have on chemical processes is essential for the current and future development of theoretical chemistry. One of the central questions to solve is how to generalize the transition state theory in order to make it applicable in far from equilibrium situations. In this sense, here we propose a way to generalize Eyring’s equation based on the definition of an effective thermal energy (temperature) emerging from the coupling of both fast and slow dynamic variables analyzed within the generalized Langevin dynamics scheme. This coupling makes the energy distribution of the fast degrees of freedom not equilibrate because they have been enslaved to the dynamics of the corresponding slow degrees. However, the introduction of the effective thermal energy enables us to restore an effective adiabatic separation of timescales leading to a renormalization of the generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Hence, this procedure opens the possibility to deal with systems far away from equilibrium. A significant consequence of our results is that Eyring’s equation is generalized to treat systems under the influence of strong external forces.},

  abstract = {Efficient implementations of the orbital-optimized coupled-cluster doubles (or simply “optimized CCD,” OCCD, for short) method and its analytic energy gradients with the density-fitting (DF) approach, denoted by DF-OCCD, are presented. In addition to the DF approach, the Cholesky-decomposed variant (CD-OCCD) is also implemented for energy computations. The computational cost of the DF-OCCD method (available in a plugin version of the DFOCC module of PSI 4 ) is compared with that of the conventional OCCD (from the Q - CHEM package). The OCCD computations were performed with the Q - CHEM package in which OCCD are denoted by OD. In the conventional OCCD method, one needs to perform four-index integral transformations at each of the CCD iterations, which limits its applications to large chemical systems. Our results demonstrate that DF-OCCD provides dramatically lower computational costs compared to OCCD, and there are almost eightfold reductions in the computational time for the C 6 H 14 molecule with the cc-pVTZ basis set. For open-shell geometries, interaction energies, and hydrogen transfer reactions, DF-OCCD provides significant improvements upon DF-CCD. Furthermore, the performance of the DF-OCCD method is substantially better for harmonic vibrational frequencies in the case of symmetry-breaking problems. Moreover, several factors make DF-OCCD more attractive compared to CCSD: (1) for DF-OCCD, there is no need for orbital relaxation contributions in analytic gradient computations; (2) active spaces can readily be incorporated into DF-OCCD; (3) DF-OCCD provides accurate vibrational frequencies when symmetry-breaking problems are observed; (4) in its response function, DF-OCCD avoids artificial poles; hence, excited-state molecular properties can be computed via linear response theory; and (5) symmetric and asymmetric triples corrections based on DF-OCCD [DF-OCCD(T)] have a significantly better performance in near degeneracy regions.},

  abstract = {Simulation of electronic dynamics in realistically large molecular systems is a demanding task that has not yet achieved the same level of quantitative prediction already realized for its static counterpart. This is particularly true for processes occurring beyond the Born–Oppenheimer regime. Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations suffer from two convoluted sources of error: numerical algorithms for dynamics and electronic structure calculations. While the former has gained increasing attention, particularly addressing the validity of ad hoc methodologies, the effect of the latter remains relatively unexplored. Indeed, the required accuracy for electronic structure calculations to reach quantitative agreement with experiment in dynamics may be even more strict than that required for static simulations. Here, we address this issue by modeling the electronic energy transfer in a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) molecular light harvesting system using fewest switches surface hopping NAMD simulations. In the studied system, time-resolved experimental measurements deliver complete information on spectra and energy transfer rates. Subsequent modeling shows that the calculated electronic transition energies are “sufficiently good” to reproduce experimental spectra but produce over an order of magnitude error in simulated dynamical rates. We further perform simulations using artificially shifted energy gaps to investigate the complex relationship between transition energies and modeled dynamics to understand factors affecting non-radiative relaxation and energy transfer rates.},

Here, we present a detailed analysis of the TCC wave function based on model systems, which require an accurate description of both static and dynamic correlation. We investigate the reliability of the TCC approach with respect to the exact wave function. In addition to the error in the electronic energy and standard coupled cluster diagnostics, we exploit the overlap of TCC and full configuration interaction wave functions as a quality measure. We critically review issues, such as the required size of the active space, size-consistency, symmetry breaking in the wave function, and the dependence of TCC on the reference wave function. We observe that possible errors caused by symmetry breaking can be mitigated by employing the determinant with the largest weight in the active space as reference for the TCC calculation. We find the TCC model to be promising in calculations with active orbital spaces which include all orbitals with a large single-orbital entropy, even if the active spaces become very large and then may require modern active-space approaches that are not restricted to comparatively small numbers of orbitals. Furthermore, utilizing large active spaces can improve on the TCC wave function approximation and reduce the size-consistency error because the presence of highly excited determinants affects the accuracy of the coefficients of low-excited determinants in the active space.},

  abstract = {Markov processes provide a popular approach to construct low-dimensional dynamical models of a complex biomolecular system. By partitioning the conformational space into metastable states, protein dynamics can be approximated in terms of memory-less jumps between these states, resulting in a Markov state model (MSM). Alternatively, suitable low-dimensional collective variables may be identified to construct a data-driven Langevin equation (dLE). In both cases, the underlying Markovian approximation requires a propagation time step (or lag time) δt that is longer than the memory time τ M of the system. On the other hand, δt needs to be chosen short enough to resolve the system timescale τ S of interest. If these conditions are in conflict (i.e., τ M &gt; τ S ), one may opt for a short time step δt = τ S and try to account for the residual non-Markovianity of the data by optimizing the transition matrix or the Langevin fields such that the resulting model best reproduces the observables of interest. In this work, rescaling the friction tensor of the dLE based on short-time information in order to obtain the correct long-time behavior of the system is suggested. Adopting various model problems of increasing complexity, including a double-well system, the dissociation of solvated sodium chloride, and the functional dynamics of T4 lysozyme, the virtues and shortcomings of the rescaled dLE are discussed and compared to the corresponding MSMs.},

  abstract = {Excited state electron and hole transfer underpin fundamental steps in processes such as exciton dissociation at photovoltaic heterojunctions, photoinduced charge transfer at electrodes, and electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers. Diabatic states corresponding to charge or excitation localized species, such as locally excited and charge transfer states, provide a physically intuitive framework to simulate and understand these processes. However, obtaining accurate diabatic states and their couplings from adiabatic electronic states generally leads to inaccurate results when combined with low-tier electronic structure methods, such as time-dependent density functional theory, and exorbitant computational cost when combined with high-level wavefunction-based methods. Here, we introduce a density functional theory (DFT)-based diabatization scheme that directly constructs the diabatic states using absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMOs), which we denote as Δ -ALMO(MSDFT2). We demonstrate that our method, which combines ALMO calculations with the ΔSCF technique to construct electronically excited diabatic states and obtains their couplings with charge-transfer states using our MSDFT2 scheme, gives accurate results for excited state electron and hole transfer in both charged and uncharged systems that underlie DNA repair, charge separation in donor–acceptor dyads, chromophore-to-solvent electron transfer, and singlet fission. This framework for the accurate and efficient construction of excited state diabats and evaluation of their couplings directly from DFT thus offers a route to simulate and elucidate photoinduced electron and hole transfer in large disordered systems, such as those encountered in the condensed phase.},

  abstract = {We formulate a comprehensive theoretical description of excitation harvesting in molecular aggregates photoexcited by weak incoherent radiation. An efficient numerical scheme that respects the continuity equation for excitation fluxes is developed to compute the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) arising from the interplay between excitation generation, excitation relaxation, dephasing, trapping at the load, and recombination. The NESS is most conveniently described in the so-called preferred basis in which the steady-state excitonic density matrix is diagonal. The NESS properties are examined by relating the preferred-basis description to the descriptions in the site or excitonic bases. Focusing on a model photosynthetic dimer, we find that the NESS in the limit of long trapping time is quite similar to the excited-state equilibrium in which the stationary coherences originate from the excitation–environment entanglement. For shorter trapping times, we demonstrate how the properties of the NESS can be extracted from the time-dependent description of an incoherently driven but unloaded dimer. This relation between stationary and time-dependent pictures is valid, provided that the trapping time is longer than the decay time of dynamic coherences accessible in femtosecond spectroscopy experiments.},

Because spin–orbit coupling changes the energies of the ground and excited states, it can affect the strong field ionization rate for molecules containing heavy atoms. Configuration interaction with single excitations (CIS) has been employed for strong field ionization of closed shell systems. Single and double excitation configuration interaction with ionization (CISD-IP) has been used to treat ionization of degenerate states of cations on an equal footing. The CISD-IP wavefunction consists of ionizing single (one hole) and double (two hole/one particle) excitations from the neutral atom. Spin–orbit coupling has been implemented using an effective one electron spin–orbit coupling operator. The effective nuclear charge in the spin–orbit coupling operator has been optimized for Ar + , Kr + , Xe + , HX + (X = Cl, Br, and I). Spin–orbit effects on angular dependence of the strong field ionization have been studied for HX and HX + . The effects of spin–orbit coupling are largest for ionization from the π orbitals of HX + . In a static field, oscillations are seen between the 2 Π 3/2 and 2 Π 1/2 states of HX + . For ionization of HX + by a two cycle circularly polarized pulse, a single peak is seen when the maximum in the carrier envelope is perpendicular to the molecular axis and two peaks are seen when it is parallel to the axis. This is the result of the greater ionization rate for the π orbitals than for the σ orbitals.},

  abstract = {Markov chains can accurately model the state-to-state dynamics of a wide range of complex systems, but the underlying transition matrix is ill-conditioned when the dynamics feature a separation of timescales. Graph transformation (GT) provides a numerically stable method to compute exact mean first passage times (MFPTs) between states, which are the usual dynamical observables in continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). Here, we generalize the GT algorithm to discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs), which are commonly estimated from simulation data, for example, in the Markov state model approach. We then consider the dimensionality reduction of CTMCs and DTMCs, which aids model interpretation and facilitates more expensive computations, including sampling of pathways. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of existing methods to compute the optimal reduced CTMC, given a partitioning of the network into metastable communities (macrostates) of nodes (microstates). We show that approaches based on linear algebra encounter numerical problems that arise from the requisite metastability. We propose an alternative approach using GT to compute the matrix of intermicrostate MFPTs in the original Markov chain, from which a matrix of weighted intermacrostate MFPTs can be obtained. We also propose an approximation to the weighted-MFPT matrix in the strongly metastable limit. Inversion of the weighted-MFPT matrix, which is better conditioned than the matrices that must be inverted in alternative dimensionality reduction schemes, then yields the optimal reduced Markov chain. The superior numerical stability of the GT approach therefore enables us to realize optimal Markovian coarse-graining of systems with rare event dynamics.},

This collective emission only occurs if there is an entanglement between the molecules in their ground and excited state and can, therefore, serve as a macroscopic measure of coherence in the ensemble. Reported here are wave packet propagations for various pyrazine models of increasing complexity and molecular ensembles thereof. We show that ensemble coherence upon photoexcitation can prevail up to relatively long time scales although the effect can diminish quickly with increasing ensemble size. Coherence can also build up over time and even reemerge after the molecules have passed through a conical intersection. The effect of the pump pulse characteristics on the collective response of the molecular ensemble is also studied. A broadband pulse imprints a large amount of initial coherence to the system, as compared to a longer pulse with a smaller spread in the frequency domain. However, the differential effects arising from a different pulse duration and coherent bandwidth become less prominent if the emission of light from the ensemble takes place after a non-adiabatic decay process.},

Two features of the mapping facilitate lattice-switch Monte Carlo and related diabat methods for computing polymorph free energy differences. First, the mapping is unitary so that its Jacobian does not complicate the free energy calculations. Second, the mapping is easily implemented for molecular crystals of arbitrary complexity. We demonstrate the mapping by computing free energy differences between polymorphs of benzene and carbamazepine. Free energy calculations for thermodynamic cycles, each involving three independently computed polymorph free energy differences, all return to the starting free energy with a high degree of precision. The calculations thus provide a force field independent validation of the method and allow us to estimate the precision of the individual free energy differences.},

  abstract = {Remarkable interest is associated with the interpretation of the Prodan fluorescent spectrum. A sequential hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics method was used to establish that the fluorescent emission occurs from two different excited states, resulting in a broad asymmetric emission spectrum. The absorption spectra in several solvents were measured and calculated using different theoretical models presenting excellent agreement. All theoretical models [semiempirical, time dependent density functional theory and and second-order multiconfigurational perturbation theory] agree that the first observed band at the absorption spectrum in solution is composed of three electronic excitations very close in energy. Then, the electronic excitation around 340 nm–360 nm may populate the first three excited states (π–π * L b , n–π * , and π–π * L a ). The ground state S 0 and the first three excited states were analyzed using multi-configurational calculations. The corresponding equilibrium geometries are all planar in vacuum. Considering the solvent effects in the electronic structure of the solute and in the solvent relaxation around the solute, it was identified that these three excited states can change the relative order depending on the solvent polarity, and following the minimum path energy, internal conversions may occur. A consistent explanation of the experimental data is obtained with the conclusive interpretation that the two bands observed in the fluorescent spectrum of Prodan, in several solvents, are due to the emission from two independent states. Our results indicate that these are the n–π * S 2 state with a small dipole moment at a lower emission energy and the π–π * L b S 1 state with large dipole moment at a higher emission energy.},

  abstract = {Two methods for estimating the correlation energy of molecules and other electronic systems are discussed based on the assumption that the correlation energy can be partitioned between atomic regions. In the first method, the electron density is expanded in terms of atomic contributions using rigorous electron repulsion bounds, and in the second method, correlation contributions are associated with basis function pairs. These methods do not consider the detailed nature of localized excitations but instead define a correlation energy per electron factor that is unique to a specific atom. The correlation factors are basis function dependent and are determined by configuration interaction (CI) calculations on diatomic and hydride molecules. The correlation energy estimates are compared with the results of high-level CI calculations for a test set of 27 molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments (average error of 2.6\%). An extension based on truncated CI calculations in which d-type and hydrogen p -type functions are eliminated from the virtual space combined with estimates of dynamical correlation contributions using atomic correlation factors is discussed and applied to the dissociation of several molecules.},

Formally, we elucidate the relationship between OUDCT and orbital-optimized unitary coupled cluster theory and show the existence of near-zero denominators in the stationarity conditions for both the exact and some approximate OUDCT methods. We implement methods of the OUDCT Ansatz restricted to double excitations for numerical study, up to the fifth commutator in the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff expansion. We find that methods derived from the Ansatz beyond the previously known ODC-12 method tend to be less accurate for equilibrium properties and less reliable when attempting to describe H 2 dissociation.

  abstract = {The self-assembly of fibrils is a subject of intense interest, primarily due to its relevance to the formation of pathological structures. Some fibrils develop branches via the so-called secondary nucleation. In this paper, we use the master equation approach to model the kinetics of formation of branched fibrils. In our model, a branched fibril consists of one mother branch and several daughter branches. We consider five basic processes of fibril formation, namely, nucleation, elongation, branching, fragmentation, and dissociation of the primary nucleus of fibrils into free monomers. Our main focus is on the effect of the directionality of growth on the kinetics of fibril formation. We consider several cases. At first, the mother branch may elongate from one or from both ends, while the daughter branch elongates only from one end. We also study the case of branched fibrils with bidirectionally growing daughter branches, tangentially to the main stem, which resembles the intertwining process. We derive a set of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the number concentration of fibrils, which can be solved numerically. Assuming that the primary nucleus of fibrils dissociates with the fragmentation rate, in the limit of the zero branching rate, our model reproduces the results of a previous model that considers only the three basic processes of nucleation, elongation, and fragmentation. We also use the experimental parameters for the fibril formation of Huntingtin fragments to investigate the effect of unidirectional vs bidirectional elongation of the filaments on the kinetics of fibrillogenesis.},

Here, we study the statistics of particles’ squared displacements δr 2 between equilibrium liquid configurations at temperature T and their underlying inherent states, using computer simulations of 11 different computer glass formers. We show that the relative fluctuations of δr 2 are nonmonotonic in T , exhibiting a maximum whose location defines the crossover temperature T X ⁠ . Therefore, T X marks the point of maximal heterogeneity during the process of tumbling down the energy landscape, starting from an equilibrium liquid state at temperature T down to its underlying inherent state. We extract T X for the 11 employed computer glasses, ranging from tetrahedral glasses to packs of soft elastic spheres, and demonstrate its usefulness in putting the elastic properties of different glasses on the same footing. Interestingly, we further show that T X marks the crossover between two distinct regimes of the mean ⟨ δr 2 ⟩: a high temperature regime in which ⟨ δr 2 ⟩ scales approximately as T 0.5 and a deeply supercooled regime in which ⟨ δr 2 ⟩ scales approximately as T 1.3 .

  abstract = {Knowledge of protein structure is paramount to the understanding of biological function, developing new therapeutics, and making detailed mechanistic hypotheses. Therefore, methods to accurately elucidate three-dimensional structures of proteins are in high demand. While there are a few experimental techniques that can routinely provide high-resolution structures, such as x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-EM, which have been developed to determine the structures of proteins, these techniques each have shortcomings and thus cannot be used in all cases. However, additionally, a large number of experimental techniques that provide some structural information, but not enough to assign atomic positions with high certainty have been developed. These methods offer sparse experimental data, which can also be noisy and inaccurate in some instances. In cases where it is not possible to determine the structure of a protein experimentally, computational structure prediction methods can be used as an alternative. Although computational methods can be performed without any experimental data in a large number of studies, inclusion of sparse experimental data into these prediction methods has yielded significant improvement. In this Perspective, we cover many of the successes of integrative modeling, computational modeling with experimental data, specifically for protein folding, protein–protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. We describe methods that incorporate sparse data from cryo-EM, NMR, mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, small-angle x-ray scattering, Förster resonance energy transfer, and genetic sequence covariation. Finally, we highlight some of the major challenges in the field as well as possible future directions.},

Considering an absorbing boundary placed at x a 0), it eventually reaches the origin. Resetting accelerates such first-passage when ν 3. A resetting transition is therefore observed at ν = 3, and we provide a comprehensive analysis of the same.

  abstract = {With simplified interactions and degrees of freedom, coarse-grained (CG) simulations have been successfully applied to study the translational and rotational diffusion of proteins in solution. However, in order to reach larger lengths and longer timescales, many CG simulations employ an oversimplified model for proteins or an implicit-solvent model in which the hydrodynamic interactions are ignored, and thus, the real kinetics are more or less unfaithful. In this work, we develop a CG model based on the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) that can be universally applied to different types of proteins. The proteins are modeled as a group of rigid DPD beads without conformational changes. The fluids (including solvent and ions) are also modeled as DPD beads. The electrostatic interactions between charged species are explicitly considered by including charge distributions on DPD particles. Moreover, a surface friction between the protein and fluid beads is applied to control the slip boundary condition. With this model, we investigate the self-diffusion of a single globular protein in bulk solution. The translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of the protein can be tuned by the surface frictional constant to fit the predictions of the Stokes–Einstein (SE) relation. We find that both translational and rotational diffusion coefficients that meet with the prediction of the SE relation based on experimental results of the hydrodynamic radius are reached at almost the same frictional constant for different types of proteins. Such scaling behavior indicates that the model can be applied to simulate the translational and rotational diffusion together for various types of proteins.},

In the late 1990s, Wolf and collaborators developed an alternative route to describe the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions; from a computational perspective, this method provides a more efficient and straightforward way to implement long-range electrostatic interactions than the Ewald method. Despite these advantages, the validity of the Wolf potential to account for the electrostatic contribution in charged fluids remains controversial. To alleviate this situation, in this contribution, we implement the Wolf summation method to both electrolyte solutions and charged colloids with moderate size and charge asymmetries in order to assess the accuracy and validity of the method. To this end, we verify that the proper selection of parameters within the Wolf method leads to results that are in good agreement with those obtained through the standard Ewald method and the theory of integral equations of simple liquids within the so-called hypernetted chain approximation. Furthermore, we show that the results obtained with the original Wolf method do satisfy the moment conditions described by the Stillinger–Lovett sum rules, which are directly related to the local electroneutrality condition and the electrostatic screening in the Debye–Hückel regime. Hence, the fact that the solution provided by the Wolf method satisfies the first and second moments of Stillinger–Lovett proves, for the first time, the reliability of the method to correctly incorporate the electrostatic contribution in charge-stabilized fluids. This makes the Wolf method a powerful alternative compared to more demanding computational approaches.},

Herein, an efficient borrowing strategy based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been developed to investigate the adsorption behavior of CO at the gas–solid interface. A composite SERS substrate with high uniformity was fabricated by electrochemical deposition of optimal Pt over-layers onto an Au nanoparticle film. The results indicated that the linearly bonded mode follows the Langmuir adsorption curve (type I), while the multiply bonded did not. It took a longer time for the C–O M vibration to reach the adsorption equilibrium than that of C–O L . The variation tendency toward the Pt–CO L frequency was in opposition to that of C–O L , caused by the chemical and dipole–dipole coupling effects. The increase in dynamic coupling effects of the CO molecules caused a blue shift in ν CO and a red shift of the Pt–CO band, while its shielding effect on SERS intensity cannot be ignored. Additionally, higher pressure is more conducive for linear adsorption to achieve saturation. Density functional theory calculations were employed to explore the adsorption mechanisms. It should also be noted that the substrate with good recycling performance greatly expands its practical application value. The present study suggested that the SERS-based borrowing strategy shows sufficient even valuable capacity to investigate gas adsorption kinetics behavior.},

  abstract = {Newly synthesized nanocars have shown great potential to transport molecular payloads. Since wheels of nanocars dominate their motion, the study of the wheels helps us to design a suitable surface for them. We investigated C 60 thermal diffusion on the hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) monolayer as the wheel of nanocars. We calculated C 60 potential energy variation during the translational and rotational motions at different points on the substrate. The study of the energy barriers and diffusion coefficients of the molecule at different temperatures indicated three noticeable changes in the C 60 motion regime. C 60 starts to slide on the surface at 30 K–40 K, slides freely on the boron-nitride monolayer at 100 K–150 K, and shows rolling motions at temperatures higher than 500 K. The anomaly parameter of the motion reveals that C 60 has a diffusive motion on the boron-nitride substrate at low temperatures and experiences superdiffusion with Levy flight motions at higher temperatures. A comparison of the fullerene motion on the boron-nitride and graphene surfaces demonstrated that the analogous structure of the graphene and hexagonal boron-nitride led to similar characteristics such as anomaly parameters and the temperatures at which the motion regime changes. The results of this study empower us to predict that fullerene prefers to move on boron-nitride sections on a hybrid substrate composed of graphene and boron-nitride. This property can be utilized to design pathways or regions on a surface to steer or trap the C 60 or other molecular machines, which is a step toward directional transportation at the molecular scale.},

  abstract = {The structure of nanoconfined fluids is particularly non-uniform owing to the wall interaction, resulting in the distinctive characteristic of thermal transport compared to bulk fluids. We present the molecular simulations on the thermal transport of water confined in nanochannels with a major investigation of its spatial distribution under the effects of wall interaction. The results show that the thermal conductivity of nanoconfined water is inhomogeneous and its layered distribution is very similar to the density profile. The layered thermal conductivity is the coupling result of inhomogeneous density and energy distributions that are generally diametrical, and their contributions to the thermal conductivity compensate with each other. However, the accumulative effect of water molecules is really dominating, resulting in a high thermal conductivity in the high-density layers with the low-energy molecules, and vice versa. Moreover, it is found that the adsorptive and repulsive interactions from solid walls have different roles in the hierarchical thermal transport in nanoconfined water. The adsorptive interaction is only responsible for the layered distribution of thermal conductivity, while the repulsive interaction is responsible for the overall thermal conductivity; accordingly, the thermal conductivity is independent of the strength of water–solid interactions. The identified hierarchical thermal transport in nanoconfined water and its underlying mechanisms have a great significance for the understanding of nanoscale thermal transport and even the mass and energy transport of nanoconfined fluids.},

  abstract = {The quantizer problem is a tessellation optimization problem where point configurations are identified such that the Voronoi cells minimize the second moment of the volume distribution. While the ground state (optimal state) in 3D is almost certainly the body-centered cubic lattice, disordered and effectively hyperuniform states with energies very close to the ground state exist that result as stable states in an evolution through the geometric Lloyd’s algorithm [M. A. Klatt et al. Nat. Commun. 10 , 811 (2019)]. When considered as a statistical mechanics problem at finite temperature, the same system has been termed the “Voronoi liquid” by Ruscher, Baschnagel, and Farago [Europhys. Lett. 112 , 66003 (2015)]. Here, we investigate the cooling behavior of the Voronoi liquid with a particular view to the stability of the effectively hyperuniform disordered state. As a confirmation of the results by Ruscher et al. , we observe, by both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, that upon slow quasi-static equilibrium cooling, the Voronoi liquid crystallizes from a disordered configuration into the body-centered cubic configuration. By contrast, upon sufficiently fast non-equilibrium cooling (and not just in the limit of a maximally fast quench ), the Voronoi liquid adopts similar states as the effectively hyperuniform inherent structures identified by Klatt et al. and prevents the ordering transition into a body-centered cubic ordered structure. This result is in line with the geometric intuition that the geometric Lloyd’s algorithm corresponds to a type of fast quench.},

  abstract = {The temperature-dependent fluorescence spectrum, decay rate, and spin quantum beats are examined in single tetracene crystals to gain insight into the mechanism of singlet fission. Over the temperature range of 250 K–500 K, the vibronic lineshape of the emission indicates that the singlet exciton becomes localized at 400 K. The fission process is insensitive to this localization and exhibits Arrhenius behavior with an activation energy of 550 ± 50 cm −1 . The damping rate of the triplet pair spin quantum beats in the delayed fluorescence also exhibits an Arrhenius temperature dependence with an activation energy of 165 ± 70 cm −1 . All the data for T &gt; 250 K are consistent with direct production of a spatially separated 1 (T⋯T) state via a thermally activated process, analogous to spontaneous parametric downconversion of photons. For temperatures in the range of 20 K–250 K, the singlet exciton continues to undergo a rapid decay on the order of 200 ps, leaving a red-shifted emission that decays on the order of 100 ns. At very long times (≈1 µ s), a delayed fluorescence component corresponding to the original S 1 state can still be resolved, unlike in polycrystalline films. A kinetic analysis shows that the redshifted emission seen at lower temperatures cannot be an intermediate in the triplet production. When considered in the context of other results, our data suggest that the production of triplets in tetracene for temperatures below 250 K is a complex process that is sensitive to the presence of structural defects.},

  abstract = {The origin of stretched exponential relaxation in supercooled glass-forming liquids is one of the central questions regarding the anomalous dynamics of these fluids. The dominant explanation for this phenomenon has long been the proposition that spatial averaging over a heterogeneous distribution of locally exponential relaxation processes leads to stretching. Here, we perform simulations of model polymeric and small-molecule glass-formers in the isoconfigurational ensemble to show that stretching instead emerges from a combination of spatial averaging and locally nonexponential relaxation. The results indicate that localities in the fluid exhibiting faster-than-average relaxation tend to exhibit locally stretched relaxation, whereas slower-than-average relaxing domains exhibit more compressed relaxation. We show that local stretching is predicted by loose local caging, as measured by the Debye–Waller factor, and vice versa. This phenomenology in the local relaxation of in-equilibrium glasses parallels the dynamics of out of equilibrium under-dense and over-dense glasses, which likewise exhibit an asymmetry in their degree of stretching vs compression. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that local stretching and compression in equilibrium glass-forming liquids results from evolution of particle mobilities over a single local relaxation time, with slower particles tending toward acceleration and vice versa. In addition to providing new insight into the origins of stretched relaxation, these results have implications for the interpretation of stretching exponents as measured via metrologies such as dielectric spectroscopy: measured stretching exponents cannot universally be interpreted as a direct measure of the breadth of an underlying distribution of relaxation times.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous relaxation dynamics often characterizes deep eutectic solvents. Extensive and molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out in the temperature range, 303 ≤ T / K ≤ 370, for studying the anion and temperature dependencies of heterogeneous dynamics of three different ionic acetamide deep eutectics: acetamide + LiX, X being bromide (Br − ), nitrate ( ⁠ NO 3 − ⁠ ), and perchlorate ( ⁠ ClO 4 − ⁠ ). These systems are chosen because the fractional viscosity dependence of average relaxation rates reported by various measurements has been attributed to the heterogeneous dynamics of these systems. Simulations performed here attempt to characterize the heterogeneous relaxation dynamics in terms of correlated time and length scales and understand the solution inhomogeneity in microscopic terms. Additionally, simulation studies for pure molten acetamide have been performed to understand the impact of ions on motional features of acetamide in these ionic deep eutectic systems. The computed radial distribution functions suggest microheterogeneous solution structure and dependence upon anion identity and temperature. A significant plateau in the simulated time dependent mean squared displacements indicates pronounced cage-rattling and inhomogeneity in relaxation dynamics. Simulated diffusion coefficients for acetamide and ions show decoupling from the simulated viscosities of these deep eutectics. Calculated two- and four-point correlation functions reveal the presence of dynamic heterogeneity even at ∼180 K above the measured thermodynamic glass transition temperature ( T g ). Further analyses reveal the existence of multiple timescales that respond strongly to the rise in solution temperature. The simulated dynamic structure factor and overlap function relaxations show strong stretched exponential relaxations. The simulation results support the experimental observation that the bromide system is the most dynamically heterogeneous among these three systems. Correlated length scales show much weaker anion and temperature dependencies with an estimated length of ∼1 nm, suggesting formation of clusters at the local level as the origin for the micro-heterogeneous nature of these ionic deep eutectics.},

Moreover, we calculate the polarization time-correlation function.

This method is applied to 98 molecular systems containing a 14 N quadrupolar nucleus using data from more than 40 years of rotational spectroscopy and comparing the performance of three levels of theory from quantum-chemical computations. From this extensive dataset, we have analyzed chemical properties of molecules, such as the hybridization of the atom, and we could quantify the extent of polarization and resonance processes as well as physical characteristics of the quadrupolar nucleus, such as eQq . This is a constant, which represents the interaction in the hypothetical case of having a single electron in an electronic orbital at the isolated nucleus, and its value has been under debate for a long time. Here, the eQq value has been determined for the 14 N nucleus, and the methodology to calculate it for other nuclei is provided.},

  abstract = {We present an experimental investigation of the hydrogen nuclear momentum distribution in biphenyl using deep inelastic neutron scattering. Our experimental results suggest that the local potential affecting hydrogen is both harmonic and isotropic within experimental uncertainties. This feature is interpreted as a consequence of the central limit theorem, whereby the three-dimensional momentum distribution is expected to become a purely Gaussian function as the number of independent vibrational modes in a system increases. We also performed ab initio phonon calculations on biphenyl and other saturated hydrocarbons, from methane to decane. From the results of the simulations, one can observe that the nuclear momentum distribution becomes more isotropic as the number of atoms and normal modes in the molecule increases. Moreover, the predicted theoretical anisotropy in biphenyl is clearly larger than in the experiment. The reason is that the total number of normal modes necessary to reproduce the experimental results is much larger than the number of normal modes encompassed by a single unit cell due to the presence of structural disorder and intermolecular interactions in the real crystal, as well as coupling of different normal modes. Finally, experimental data were collected, over a subset of detectors on the VESUVIO spectrometer at ISIS, with a novel setup to increase the count rate and signal-to-background ratio. We envision that such an optimized experimental setup can provide faster measurements and more stringent constraints for phonon calculations.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have had indubitable impact across the sciences through the ability to extract relevant information from raw data. Recently, AI has also found use in enhancing the efficiency of molecular simulations, wherein AI derived slow modes are used to accelerate the simulation in targeted ways. However, while typical fields where AI is used are characterized by a plethora of data, molecular simulations, per construction, suffer from limited sampling and thus limited data. As such, the use of AI in molecular simulations can suffer from a dangerous situation where the AI-optimization could get stuck in spurious regimes, leading to incorrect characterization of the reaction coordinate (RC) for the problem at hand. When such an incorrect RC is then used to perform additional simulations, one could start to deviate progressively from the ground truth. To deal with this problem of spurious AI-solutions, here, we report a novel and automated algorithm using ideas from statistical mechanics. It is based on the notion that a more reliable AI-solution will be one that maximizes the timescale separation between slow and fast processes. To learn this timescale separation even from limited data, we use a maximum caliber-based framework. We show the applicability of this automatic protocol for three classic benchmark problems, namely, the conformational dynamics of a model peptide, ligand-unbinding from a protein, and folding/unfolding energy landscape of the C-terminal domain of protein G. We believe that our work will lead to increased and robust use of trustworthy AI in molecular simulations of complex systems.},

  abstract = {Local optimization of adsorption systems inherently involves different scales: within the substrate, within the molecule, and between the molecule and the substrate. In this work, we show how the explicit modeling of different characteristics of the bonds in these systems improves the performance of machine learning methods for optimization. We introduce an anisotropic kernel in the Gaussian process regression framework that guides the search for the local minimum, and we show its overall good performance across different types of atomic systems. The method shows a speed-up of up to a factor of two compared with the fastest standard optimization methods on adsorption systems. Additionally, we show that a limited memory approach is not only beneficial in terms of overall computational resources but can also result in a further reduction of energy and force calculations.},

These approaches allow us to extend δt of MD simulations under an isothermal–isobaric condition up to 5 fs with a velocity Verlet integrator. Here, we further improve the isothermal–isobaric MD integration by introducing the group-based evaluations of system temperature and pressure to our previous approach. The group-based scheme increases the accuracy even using inaccurate temperature and pressure evaluations by neglecting the high-frequency vibrational motions of hydrogen atoms. It also improves the overall performance by avoiding iterations in thermostat and barostat updates and by allowing a multiple time step integration such as r-RESPA (reversible reference system propagation algorithm) with our proposed high-precision evaluations of temperature and pressure. Now, the improved integration scheme conserves physical properties of lipid bilayer systems up to δt = 5 fs with velocity Verlet as well as δt = 3.5 fs for fast motions in r-RESPA, respectively.},

In the current version of this approach, the size of the SPF basis is fixed at the outset so that singularities in the working equations resulting from unoccupied functions have to be removed by a regularization procedure. Here, an alternative protocol is presented, in which we gradually increase the number of unoccupied SPFs on-the-fly (i.e., spawning) and optimize their shape by variationally minimizing the error made by the finite size of the basis. An initial estimate for the respective new expansion coefficients is also computed, thus avoiding the need to regularize the equations of motion. The advantages of employing the new algorithm are tested and discussed in some illustrative examples.},

In its current implementation, the method yields a PES in the so-called Tucker sum-of-products form, but it is not restricted to this specific ansatz . The novelty of our algorithm lies in the fact that the fit is performed in terms of a direct product of a Schmidt basis, also known as natural potentials . These encode in a non-trivial way all the physics of the problem and, hence, circumvent the usual extra ad hoc and a posteriori adjustments (e.g., damping functions) of the fitted PES. Moreover, we avoid the intermediate refitting stage common to other tensor-decomposition methods, typically used in the context of nuclear quantum dynamics. The resulting SOP-FBR PES is analytical and differentiable ad infinitum . Our ansatz is fully general and can be used in combination with most (molecular) dynamics codes. In particular, it has been interfaced and extensively tested with the Heidelberg implementation of the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree quantum dynamical software package.},

Phys. 151 , 154116 (2019)] is presented. The general framework developed for time-independent vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) calculations has been extended to the time-dependent context. This results in an efficient implementation of TDVCC with general coupling levels in the cluster operator and Hamiltonian. Thus, the convergence of the TDVCC[ k ] hierarchy toward the complete-space limit can be studied for any sum-of-product Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a scheme for including selected higher-order excitations for a subset of modes is introduced and studied numerically. Three different definitions of the TDVCC autocorrelation function (ACF) are introduced and analyzed in both theory and numerical experiments. Example calculations are presented for an array of systems including imidazole, formyl fluoride, formaldehyde, and a reduced-dimensionality bithiophene model. The results show that the TDVCC[ k ] hierarchy converges systematically toward the full-TDVCC limit and that the implementation allows accurate quantum-dynamics simulations of large systems to be performed. Specifically, the intramolecular vibrational-energy redistribution of the 21-dimensional imidazole molecule is studied in terms of the decay of the ACF. Furthermore, the importance of product separability in the definition of the ACF is highlighted when studying non-interacting subsystems.},

  abstract = {The modeling of coupled electron–ion dynamics including a quantum description of the nuclear degrees of freedom has remained a costly and technically difficult practice. The kinetic model for electron–phonon interaction provides an efficient approach to this problem, for systems evolving with low amplitude fluctuations, in a quasi-stationary state. In this work, we propose an extension of the kinetic model to include the effect of coherences, which are absent in the original approach. The new scheme, referred to as Liouville–von Neumann + Kinetic Equation (or LvN + KE), is implemented here in the context of a tight-binding Hamiltonian and employed to model the broadening, caused by the nuclear vibrations, of the electronic absorption bands of an atomic wire. The results, which show close agreement with the predictions given by Fermi’s golden rule (FGR), serve as a validation of the methodology. Thereafter, the method is applied to the electron–phonon interaction in transport simulations, adopting to this end the driven Liouville–von Neumann equation to model open quantum boundaries. In this case, the LvN + KE model qualitatively captures the Joule heating effect and Ohm’s law. It, however, exhibits numerical discrepancies with respect to the results based on FGR, attributable to the fact that the quasi-stationary state is defined taking into consideration the eigenstates of the closed system rather than those of the open boundary system. The simplicity and numerical efficiency of this approach and its ability to capture the essential physics of the electron–phonon coupling make it an attractive route to first-principles electron–ion dynamics.},

We computed the entropy produced by a spin system strongly coupled to a non-Markovian heat bath for various temperatures. We showed that when changes to the external perturbation occurred sufficiently slowly, the system always reached thermal equilibrium. Thus, we calculated the Boltzmann entropy and the von Neumann entropy for an isothermal process, as well as various thermodynamic variables, such as changes in internal energies, heat, and work, for a system in quasi-static equilibrium based on the HEOM. We found that although the characteristic features of the system entropies in the Boltzmann and von Neumann cases as a function of the system–bath coupling strength are similar, those for the total entropy production are completely different. The total entropy production in the Boltzmann case is always positive, whereas that in the von Neumann case becomes negative if we chose a thermal equilibrium state of the total system (an unfactorized thermal equilibrium state) as the initial state. This is because the total entropy production in the von Neumann case does not properly take into account the contribution of the entropy from the system–bath interaction. Thus, the Boltzmann entropy must be used to investigate entropy production in the fully quantum regime. Finally, we examined the applicability of the Jarzynski equality.},

Sufficient sampling of such processes with molecular dynamics simulations is challenging and often requires accelerating slow transitions using external biasing potentials. Different dynamic reweighting algorithms have been proposed in the past few years to recover the unbiased kinetics from biased systems. However, it remains an open question if and how these dynamic reweighting approaches are connected. In this work, we establish the link between the two main reweighting types, i.e., path-based and energy-based reweighting. We derive a path-based correction factor for the energy-based dynamic histogram analysis method, thus connecting the previously separate reweighting types. We show that the correction factor can be used to combine the advantages of path-based and energy-based reweighting algorithms: it is integrator independent, more robust, and at the same time able to reweight time-dependent biases. We can furthermore demonstrate the relationship between two independently derived path-based reweighting algorithms. Our theoretical findings are verified on a one-dimensional four-well system. By connecting different dynamic reweighting algorithms, this work helps to clarify the strengths and limitations of the different methods and enables a more robust usage of the combined types.},

  abstract = {Accurate thermodynamic simulations of correlated fermions using path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) methods are of paramount importance for many applications such as the description of ultracold atoms, electrons in quantum dots, and warm-dense matter. The main obstacle is the fermion sign problem (FSP), which leads to an exponential increase in computation time both with an increase in the system size and with a decrease in the temperature. Very recently, Hirshberg et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 171102 (2020)] have proposed to alleviate the FSP based on the Bogoliubov inequality. In the present work, we extend this approach by adding a parameter that controls the perturbation, allowing for an extrapolation to the exact result. In this way, we can also use thermodynamic integration to obtain an improved estimate of the fermionic energy. As a test system, we choose electrons in 2 D and 3 D quantum dots and find in some cases a speed-up exceeding 10 6 , as compared to standard PIMC, while retaining a relative accuracy of ∼0.1\%. Our approach is quite general and can readily be adapted to other simulation methods.},

  abstract = {A full configuration interaction calculation (FCI) ultimately defines the innate molecular orbital description of a molecule. Its density matrix and the natural orbitals obtained from it quantify the difference between having N-dominantly occupied orbitals in a reference determinant for a wavefunction to describe N-correlated electrons and how many of those N-electrons are left to the remaining virtual orbitals. The latter provides a measure of the multi-determinantal character (MDC) required to be in a wavefunction. MDC is further split into a weak correlation part and a part that indicates stronger correlation often called multi-reference character (MRC). If several virtual orbitals have high occupation numbers, then one might argue that these additional orbitals should be allowed to have a larger role in the calculation, as in MR methods, such as MCSCF, MR-CI, or MR-coupled-cluster (MR-CC), to provide adequate approximations toward the FCI. However, there are problems with any of these MR methods that complicate the calculations compared to the uniformity and ease of application of single-reference CC calculations (SR-CC) and their operationally single-reference equation-of-motion (EOM-CC) extensions. As SR-CC theory is used in most of today’s “predictive” calculations, an assessment of the accuracy of SR-CC at some truncation of the cluster operator would help to quantify how large an issue MRC actually is in a calculation, and how it might be alleviated while retaining the convenient SR computational character of CC/EOM-CC. This paper defines indices that identify MRC situations and help assess how reliable a given calculation is.},

The approach entails the use of repetitive rectangular-shaped excitation waveforms as a stimulus, with durations comparable to triplet lifetimes. We observe unique dynamics signatures that can be directly related to relaxation of multi-exciton states involved over the entire effective time of singlet fission in the presence and absence of an excitation light stimulus. In particular, time-dependent fluorescence yields display an abrupt decay followed by slower rise dynamics appearing as a prominent “dip” feature in responses. The initial fast decrease in the fluorescence yield arises from the formation of triplet pairs and separated triplets that do not produce emission resembling a complete ground state bleach effect. However, relaxation of one separated triplet allows the system to absorb, and in some cases, this increases the fluorescence yield, causing rise dynamics in the emissive response. Our approach also permits extrapolation of all multi-exciton state population dynamics up to steady state conditions in addition to the ability to explore consequences of alternative relaxation channels. The results demonstrate that it is possible to resolve unique signatures of singlet fission events from dynamic fluorescence studies, which can augment detection capabilities and extend sensitivity limits and accessible time scales.},

The identity of RPA and EOM-CC based on the ring coupled cluster doubles is established with numerical results, which was proved previously on theoretical grounds. We then introduce new approximations in EOM-CC and RPA family of methods, assess their numerical performance, and explore a way to reap the benefits of such a connection to improve on excitation energies.

  abstract = {This work explores the possibility of simulating an electron transfer process between a donor and an acceptor in real time using time-dependent density functional theory electron dynamics. To achieve this objective, a central issue to resolve is the definition of the initial state. This must be a non-equilibrium electronic state able to trigger the charge transfer dynamics; here, two schemes are proposed to prepare such states. One is based on the combination of the density matrices of the donor and acceptor converged separately with appropriate charges (for example, −1 for the donor and +1 for the acceptor). The second approach relied on constrained DFT to localize the charge on each fragment. With these schemes, electron transfer processes are simulated in different model systems of increasing complexity: an atomic hydrogen dimer, a polyacetylene chain, and the active site of the T. cruzi hybrid type A heme peroxidase, for which two possible electron transfer paths have been postulated. For the latter system, the present methodology applied in a hybrid Quantum Mechanics - Molecular Mechanics framework allows us to establish the relative probabilities of each path and provides insight into the inhibition of the electron transfer provoked by the substitution of tryptophan by phenylalanine in the W233F mutant.},

  abstract = {Living organisms are characterized by the ability to process energy (all release heat). Redox reactions play a central role in biology, from energy transduction (photosynthesis, respiratory chains) to highly selective catalyzed transformations of complex molecules. Distance and scale are important: electrons transfer on a 1 nm scale, hydrogen nuclei transfer between molecules on a 0.1 nm scale, and extended catalytic processes (cascades) operate most efficiently when the different enzymes are under nanoconfinement (10 nm–100 nm scale). Dynamic electrochemistry experiments (defined broadly within the term “protein film electrochemistry,” PFE) reveal details that are usually hidden in conventional kinetic experiments. In PFE, the enzyme is attached to an electrode, often in an innovative way, and electron-transfer reactions, individual or within steady-state catalytic flow, can be analyzed in terms of precise potentials, proton coupling, cooperativity, driving-force dependence of rates, and reversibility (a mark of efficiency). The electrochemical experiments reveal subtle factors that would have played an essential role in molecular evolution. This article describes how PFE is used to visualize and analyze different aspects of biological redox chemistry, from long-range directional electron transfer to electron/hydride (NADPH) interconversion by a flavoenzyme and finally to NADPH recycling in a nanoconfined enzyme cascade.},

Both methods yield good agreement, and the ∼10\% larger static solutal roll-off wavevector coincides with a similar observation reported in the literature. The thermal diffusivity of the solution and the diffusion, thermodiffusion, and Soret coefficients of the polymer can be obtained from the q -dependence of the relaxation times and from the thermal and solutal roll-off wavevectors without explicit knowledge of the optical contrast factors.

To make microemulsions, a judicious choice of surfactant molecules must be made, which significantly limits their potential use. Nanoparticle surfactants, on the other hand, are a promising alternative because the surface chemistry needed to make them bind to a liquid–liquid interface is both well flexible and understood. Here, we derive a thermodynamic model predicting the conditions in which nanoparticle surfactants drive spontaneous emulsification that agrees quantitatively with experiments using Noria nanoparticles. This new class of microemulsions inherits the mechanical, chemical, and optical properties of the nanoparticles used to form them, leading to novel applications.},

Model systems consisting of pyridines and silver clusters are studied using time dependent density functional theory to understand the enhancement mechanisms of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The Raman bonds in the molecule, the inter-fragment bond, and the cluster are mapped to the enhancement contributions of the molecular resonance mechanism, the charge transfer mechanism, and the electromagnetic mechanism. The mapping quantifies the interference among the coupled mechanisms and interprets the electromagnetic mechanism as charge flow modulations in the metal. The dependence of the enhancement on the incident frequency, the molecule–metal bonding, and the applied electric field is interpreted and quantified. The Raman bond framework offers an intuitive and quantitative interpretation of SERS mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The surface plasmon response of a cross-sectional segment of a wrinkled gold film is studied using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). EELS data demonstrate that wrinkled gold structures act as a suitable substrate for surface plasmons to propagate. The intense surface variations in these structures facilitate the resonance of a wide range of surface plasmons, leading to the broadband surface plasmon response of these geometries from the near-infrared to visible wavelengths. The metallic nanoparticle boundary element method toolbox is used to simulate plasmon eigenmodes in these structures. Eigenmode simulations show how the diverse morphology of the wrinkled structure leads to its high spectral complexity. Micron-sized structural features that do not provide interactions between segments of the wrinkle have only a small effect on the surface plasmon resonance response, whereas nanofeatures strongly affect the resonant modes of the geometry. According to eigenmode calculations, different eigenenergy shifts around the sharp folds contribute to the broadband response and infrared activity of these structures; these geometrical features also support higher energy (shorter wavelength) symmetric and anti-symmetric plasmon coupling across the two sides of the folds. It is also shown that additional plasmon eigenstates are introduced from hybridization of modes across nanogaps between structural features in close proximity to each other. All of these factors contribute to the broadband response of the wrinkled gold structures.},

The results show a qualitatively consistent long-ranged layer-by-layer propagation of the atomic structure, irrespective of whether the substrate is soft, solid, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic. The capillary-wave fluctuation of a water layer upon air or oil diverges with long wavelength but is truncated upon solid substrates by an effective field, which exhibits a long-ranged decay but its strength is almost irrelevant with substrate chemistry. The distinction in the water structure and atomic dynamics due to substrate specificity is mostly limited to the outmost layer. We conclude a long-ranged layering organization and a short-ranged substrate-dependent specificity for interfacial water.},

  abstract = {Reactions of molecules on metal surfaces are notoriously difficult to simulate accurately. Density functional theory can be utilized to generate a potential energy surface, but with presently available functionals, the results are not yet accurate enough. To provide benchmark barrier heights with a high-quality method, diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is applied to H 2 + Al(110). Barrier heights have been computed for six geometries. Our present goal is twofold: first, to provide accurate barrier heights for the two lowest lying transition states of the system, and second, to assess whether density functionals are capable of describing the variation of barrier height with molecular orientation and impact site through a comparison with DMC barriers. To this end, barrier heights computed with selected functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-GGA levels are compared to the DMC results. The comparison shows that all selected functionals yield a rather accurate description of the variation of barrier heights with impact site and orientation, although their absolute values may not be accurate. RPBE-vdW-DF and BEEF-vdW were found to perform quite well even in terms of absolute numbers. Both functionals provided barrier heights for the energetically lowest lying transition state that are within 1 kcal/mol of the DMC value.},

The α -relaxation shows a fragile to strong crossover about 20° higher than that in the bulk water phase and 15° higher than that in lysozyme hydration water without trehalose. The protein hydration water without trehalose was found to show a second slower relaxation exhibiting a strong to strong crossover coupled with the protein dynamical transition. This slower relaxation time importantly appears enormously slowed down in our cryoprotectant solution. On the other hand, this long-relaxation in the presence of trehalose is also connected with a stronger damping of the protein structural fluctuations than that found when the protein is in contact with the pure hydration water.

In liquids, however, the overlap involves a tolerance, typically of a fraction a / σ of the inter-particle distance, associated with how precisely similar two configurations must be for belonging to the same physically relevant “state.” Here, we systematically investigate the dependence of the overlap fluctuations and of the resulting phase diagram when the tolerance is varied over a large range. We show that while the location of the dynamical and thermodynamic glass transitions (if present) is independent of a / σ , that of the critical point associated with a transition between a low- and a high-overlap phase in the presence of an applied source nontrivially depends on the value of a / σ . We rationalize our findings by using liquid-state theory and the hypernetted-chain approximation for correlation functions. In addition, we confirm the theoretical trends by studying a three-dimensional glass-former by computer simulations. We show, in particular, that a range of a / σ below what is commonly considered maximizes the temperature of the critical point, pushing it up in a liquid region where viscosity is low and computer investigations are easier due to a significantly faster equilibration.},

  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulation of octane (C 8 ) and nonadecane (C 19 ), we probe the mechanism of n -alkane surface freezing, the appearance of a crystalline monolayer above the liquid at a temperature T sf above the bulk freezing point T f . Formation of a crystalline monolayer occurs robustly in these systems. When T f &gt; T sf , the surface frozen phase is metastable with respect to the solid but persists for long periods for study in simulations. Surface freezing of both C 8 and C 19 is driven by significant energy-lowering when alkane chains become ordered along the surface normal, and we elucidate the origins of this phenomenon. The degree of configurational disorder in the surface frozen layer relative to the solid is much larger for C 8 compared to C 19 . From the Gibbsian viewpoint, we extract the excess energy and entropy of the liquid and surface frozen phases. We also consider the surface frozen layer as an intervening third phase, the viewpoint taken in previous theoretical analyses. Here, we find significantly increased entropy of the surface frozen phase of C 8 associated with configurational disorder, while the energy and entropy of the surface frozen phase of C 19 are marginally different from the bulk solid. Finally, by combining our previously determined solid–vapor surface free energies of C 8 and C 19 with liquid–vapor surface tensions from this work, we eliminate wetting as a possible mechanism for C 8 surface freezing, but it remains a possibility for C 19 . We analyze the molecular structure of the liquid, surface frozen, and solid surfaces and discuss its relevance to thermodynamic properties.},

  abstract = {We study the generation of electronic ring currents in the presence of nonadiabatic coupling using circularly polarized light. For this, we introduce a solvable model consisting of an electron and a nucleus rotating around a common center and subject to their mutual Coulomb interaction. The simplicity of the model brings to the forefront the non-trivial properties of electronic ring currents in the presence of coupling to the nuclear coordinates and enables the characterization of various limiting situations transparently. Employing this model, we show that vibronic coupling effects play a crucial role even when a single E degenerate eigenstate of the system supports the current. The maximum current of a degenerate eigenstate depends on the strength of the nonadiabatic interactions. In the limit of large nuclear to electronic masses, in which the Born–Oppenheimer approximation becomes exact, constant ring currents and time-averaged oscillatory currents necessarily vanish.},

  abstract = {Conical intersections are ubiquitous in chemical systems but, nevertheless, extraordinary points on the molecular potential energy landscape. They provide ultra-fast radiationless relaxation channels, their topography influences the product branching, and they equalize the timescales of the electron and nuclear dynamics. These properties reveal optical control possibilities in the few femtosecond regime. In this theoretical study, we aim to explore control options that rely on the carrier envelope phase of a few-cycle IR pulse. The laser interaction creates an electronic superposition just before the wave packet reaches the conical intersection. The imprinted phase information is varied by the carrier envelope phase to influence the branching ratio after the conical intersection. We test and analyze this scenario in detail for a model system and show to what extent it is possible to transfer this type of control to a realistic system like uracil.},

Both molecules contain the amide bond, which is the linkage between two consecutive amino acid residues in proteins. Thus, their electron-induced dissociation can imitate the resonant behavior of the DEA process in more complex biostructures. Our experimental results indicate that in these two molecules, the dissociation of the amide bond results in a double resonant structure with peaks at ∼5 eV and 9 eV. We also determined the energy position of resonant states for several negative ions, i.e., the other dissociation products from NEF and NEA. Our predictions of dissociation channels were supported by density functional theory calculations of the corresponding threshold energies. Our results and those previously reported for small amides and peptides imply the fundamental nature for breakage of the amide bond through the DEA process.},

Our multi-component variational Monte Carlo calculation and the multi-component configuration interaction one resulted in the positronic covalent bonded structure being the global minimum, whereas a more sophisticated multi-component diffusion Monte Carlo calculation clearly showed that the [H 2 ; Ps − ]-like structure at the short bond distance is energetically more stable than the positronic covalent bonded one. The relaxation due to interparticle correlation effects pertinent to Ps − (or Ps) formation is crucial for the formation of the Ps − A 2 -like structure for binding a positron to the non-polar negatively charged dihydrogen.},

  abstract = {We prepared a series of compact Bodipy–anthryl electron donor/acceptor triads and dyads by attaching anthryl moieties at the 3-,5-positions of the Bodipy core, with a novel conformation restriction approach, to study the spin–orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC). The conformation restrictions are imposed by the BF 2 unit of Bodipy without invoking the previously reported method with 1,7-dimethyl or 1,3-dimethyl groups. Our new approach shows a few advantages, including the stronger electron accepting ability of the methyl-free Bodipy core (reduction potential anodically shifted by +0.3 V vs the methylated Bodipy), red-shifted absorption (by 21 nm), and longer triplet state lifetime (372 µ s vs 126 µ s). The effects of the different mutual orientations of the electron donor and acceptor on ultraviolet–visible absorption, fluorescence, triplet state quantum yields, and lifetimes were studied. Triads with orthogonal geometries show higher singlet oxygen quantum yields ( Φ Δ = 37\%) than those with more coplanar geometries. Since the non-radiative decay for the S 1 state is significant in the parent Bodipy chromophore ( Φ F = 6.0\%), we propose that in dyads/triads, the charge separation and recombination-induced ISC outcompete the non-radiative decay to the ground state, which is new in the study of SOCT-ISC. Density functional theory computation indicated a shallow torsion potential energy curve as compared to the meso -anthryl–Bodipy dyad analog, which may contribute a low triplet state quantum yield of the new dyads/triads. Triplet–triplet annihilation upconversion was performed with the electron donor/acceptor dyads as the triplet photosensitizer, with an upconversion quantum yield of 12.3\%.},

  abstract = {Hydrated calcium ion clusters have received considerable attention due to their essential role in biological processes such as bone development, hormone regulation, blood coagulation, and neuronal signaling. To better understand the biological role of the cation, the interactions between the Ca 2+ ions and water molecules have been frequently investigated. However, a quantitative measure for the intrinsic Ca—O (ion–solvent) and intermolecular hydrogen bond (solvent–solvent) interactions has been missing so far. Here, we report a topological electron density analysis and a natural population analysis to analyze the nature of these interactions for a set of 14 hydrated calcium clusters via local mode stretching force constants obtained at the ω B97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory. The results revealed that the strength of inner Ca—O interactions for Ca ( H 2 O ) n 2 + (n = 1–8) clusters correlates with the electron density. The application of a second hydration shell to Ca ( H 2 O ) n 2 + (n = 6–8) clusters resulted in stronger Ca—O interactions where a larger electron charge transfer between lp(O) of the first hydration shell and the lower valence of Ca prevailed. The strength of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, formed between the first and second hydration shells, became stronger when the charge transfers between hydrogen bond (HB) donors and HB acceptors were enhanced. From the local mode stretching force constants of implicitly and explicitly solvated Ca 2+ , we found the six-coordinated cluster to possess the strongest stabilizations, and these results prove that the intrinsic bond strength measures for Ca—O and hydrogen bond interactions form new effective tools to predict the coordination number for the hydrated calcium ion clusters.},

  abstract = {Two-photon excitation (TPE) is an attractive means for controlling chemistry in both space and time. Since isoenergetic one- and two-photon excitations (OPE and TPE) in non-centrosymmetric molecules are allowed to reach the same excited state, it is usually assumed that they produce similar excited-state reactivity. We compare the solvent-to-solute excited-state proton transfer of the super photobase FR0 -SB following isoenergetic OPE and TPE. We find up to 62\% increased reactivity following TPE compared to OPE. From steady-state spectroscopy, we rule out the involvement of different excited states and find that OPE and TPE spectra are identical in non-polar solvents but not in polar ones. We propose that differences in the matrix elements that contribute to the two-photon absorption cross sections lead to the observed enhanced isoenergetic reactivity, consistent with the predictions of our high-level coupled-cluster-based computational protocol. We find that polar solvent configurations favor greater dipole moment change between ground and excited states, which enters the probability for TPE as the absolute value squared. This, in turn, causes a difference in the Franck–Condon region reached via TPE compared to OPE. We conclude that a new method has been found for controlling chemical reactivity via the matrix elements that affect two-photon cross sections, which may be of great utility for spatial and temporal precision chemistry.},

Two kinds of quadrupole splittings were registered and connected with two different environments of the Sn ion occupying the center of SnO 6 octahedra. What is responsible for the existence of these two environments is the disorder in tilts of oxygen octahedra and antiparallel shifts of pairs of lead ions. Both disorders decide on structural transitions which the PbZr 0.72 Sn 0.28 O 3 single crystal undergoes. The two kinds of quadruple splittings that have been observed do not disappear at temperatures far above phase transitions.

  abstract = {A mass spectrometric study of secondary ions emitted from droplet surfaces by MeV-energy heavy ion impact was performed to investigate fast-ion-induced molecular reaction processes on liquid surfaces. Herein, a new coincidence technique was developed between secondary ions and scattered projectile ions at a small forward angle. The advantages of this technique were demonstrated by measurement of the collision between 4-MeV C 3+ and ethanol droplets. Secondary ion emission probabilities were obtained directly from the coincidence data. Notably, this technique enabled positive fragment ions that had not been identified in previous measurements to be observed by suppressing the strong background originating from gas-phase molecules more than 10 4 -fold. H + , H 3 O + , C 2 H 5 + , and C 2 H 5 O + were found to be produced as major positive fragment ions, in addition to minor fragments H 2 + , C 2 H 3 + , and CH 2 OH + . Production of these ions suggests that competition between rapid hydrogen ion emission from multiply ionized states and intermolecular proton transfer accompanied by fragmentation through protonated ethanol occurs after fast heavy-ion collisions. Clarification of the positive fragment ions also revealed the characteristic features of negative ions. Negative ions were realized to exhibit higher degrees of fragmentation and reactivity compared with positive ions. Furthermore, the energy loss by forward-scattered ions during droplet penetration was used to evaluate the target thickness at a submicron level. Variations in secondary ion yield, mass distribution, and kinetic energies depending on the penetration length were observed below 1 µ m. These results highlight the unknown mechanism of these “submicron effects” observed in secondary ion emission processes as a new phenomenon.},

Here, we propose a new ten-dimensional (10D) quantum dynamics model for the kind of X + YCAB 2 reaction. The new model is an extension of our previous eight-dimensional (8D) model for the X + YCZ 3 reaction. In this 10D model, AB 2 holds C 2v symmetry and the group CAB 2 is assumed to keep C s symmetry, which gives a better description of the rocking mode of methane than the previous 8D model. The reaction dynamics of H + CH 4 → H 2 + CH 3 is first investigated using this model. The calculations showed that the rocking mode has a similar reaction efficiency to the umbrella mode. For the degenerate asymmetric stretching mode, the averaged efficiency is comparable to that of the symmetric stretching mode.},

Two geometries are considered, one at which the anion is unbound and the other at which it is bound in the Hartree–Fock (HF) approximation. It is demonstrated that DMC calculations can recover from the use of a HF trial wave function that has collapsed onto a discretized continuum solution, although larger EBEs are obtained when using a trial wave function for the anion that provides a more realistic description of the charge distribution and, hence, of the nodal surface. For the geometry at which the cluster has a non-valence correlation-bound anion, both the inclusion of triples in the EOM-CC method and the inclusion of supplemental diffuse d functions in the basis set are important. DMC calculations with suitable trial wave functions give EBE values in good agreement with our best estimate EOM-CC result. AFQMC using a trial wave function for the anion with a realistic electron density gives a value of the EBE nearly identical to the EOM-CC result when using the same basis set. For the geometry at which the anion is bound in the HF approximation, the inclusion of triple excitations in the EOM-CC calculations is much less important. The best estimate EOM-CC EBE value is in good agreement with the results of DMC calculations with appropriate trial wave functions.},

  abstract = {Transferring particle charges to and from a grid plays a central role in the particle–mesh algorithms widely used to evaluate the electrostatic energy in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The computational cost of this transfer process represents a substantial part of the overall time required for simulation and is primarily determined by the size of the support (the set of grid nodes at which the transfer function is evaluated). The accuracy of the resulting approximation depends on the form of the transfer function, of which several have been proposed, as well as the size and shape of its support. Here, we show how to derive the transfer function that yields maximal asymptotic accuracy for a given support in the limit of fine grid resolution, finding that all such functions are splines, and we determine these functions (which we refer to as midtown splines ) for a variety of choices of support to find optimally efficient transfer functions at accuracy levels relevant to MD simulations. We describe midtown splines that achieve fourth- and sixth-order accuracy in the grid spacing while requiring a support size of 32 and 88 grid nodes, respectively, compared to the 64 and 216 nodes required by the most widely used transfer functions (B-splines). At accuracy levels typically used in MD simulations, the use of midtown splines thus cuts the time required for charge spreading by roughly a factor of two.},

Accurate bandgaps for these materials can be reproduced with local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation density functionals via a continuous series of empirically derived U d and U p combinations, which are relatively insensitive to the choice of functional. On the other hand, lattice parameters are much more sensitive to the choice of U d and U p , but in a systematic way that enables the U d and U p corrections to be used to qualitatively gauge the extent of self-interaction error in the electron density. Modest U d corrections (e.g., 4 eV–5 eV) yield the most reliable dielectric response functions for SrTiO 3 and are comparable to the range of U d values derived via linear response approaches. For r-TiO 2 and a-TiO 2 , however, the U d,p corrections that yield accurate bandgaps fail to accurately describe both the parallel and perpendicular components of the dielectric response function. Analysis of individual U d and U p corrections on the optical properties of SrTiO 3 suggests that the most consequential of the two individual corrections is U d , as it predominately determines the accuracy of the dominant excitation from O-2p to the Ti-3d t 2g /e g orbitals. U p , on the other hand, can be used to shift the entire optical response uniformly to higher frequencies. These results will assist high-throughput and machine learning approaches to screening photoactive materials based on d 0 photocatalysts.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper, we proposed the adaptive shift method for correcting undersampling bias of the initiator-full configuration interaction (FCI) quantum Monte Carlo. The method allows faster convergence with the number of walkers to the FCI limit than the normal initiator method, particularly for large systems. However, in its application to some systems, mostly strongly correlated molecules, the method is prone to overshooting the FCI energy at intermediate walker numbers, with convergence to the FCI limit from below. In this paper, we present a solution to the overshooting problem in such systems, as well as further accelerating convergence to the FCI energy. This is achieved by offsetting the reference energy to a value typically below the Hartree–Fock energy but above the exact energy. This offsetting procedure does not change the exactness property of the algorithm, namely, convergence to the exact FCI solution in the large-walker limit, but at its optimal value, it greatly accelerates convergence. There is no overhead cost associated with this offsetting procedure and is therefore a pure and substantial computational gain. We illustrate the behavior of this offset adaptive shift method by applying it to the N 2 molecule, the ozone molecule at three different geometries (an equilibrium open minimum, a hypothetical ring minimum, and a transition state) in three basis sets (cc-pV X Z, X = D, T, Q), and the chromium dimer in the cc-pVDZ basis set, correlating 28 electrons in 76 orbitals. We show that in most cases, the offset adaptive shift method converges much faster than both the normal initiator method and the original adaptive shift method.},

  abstract = {Vibrational-electronic (vibronic) resonance and its possible role in energy and charge transfer have been experimentally and theoretically investigated in several photosynthetic proteins. Using a dimer modeled on a typical photosynthetic protein, we contrast the description of such excitons provided by an exact basis set description, as opposed to a basis set with reduced vibrational dimensionality. Using a reduced analytical description of the full Hamiltonian, we show that in the presence of vibrational excitation both on electronically excited as well as unexcited sites, constructive interference between such basis states causes vibronic coupling between excitons to become progressively stronger with increasing quanta of vibrational excitation. This effect leads to three distinguishing features of excitons coupled through a vibronic resonance, which are not captured in basis sets that restrict ground state vibrations: (1) the vibronic resonance criterion itself, (2) vibronically assisted perfect delocalization between sites even though purely electronic mixing between the sites is imperfect due to energetic disorder, and (3) the nuclear distortion accompanying vibronic excitons becoming increasingly larger for resonant vibronic coupling involving higher vibrational quanta. In terms of spectroscopically observable limitations of reduced basis set descriptions of vibronic resonance, several differences are seen in absorption and emission spectra but may be obscured on account of overwhelming line broadening. However, we show that several features such as vibronic exciton delocalization and vibrational distortions associated with electronic excitations, which ultimately dictate the excited state wavepacket motions and relaxation processes, are fundamentally not described by basis sets that restrict ground state vibrations.},

  abstract = {Dissipative systems often exhibit novel and unexpected properties. This is, for instance, the case of simple liquids, which, when subjected to shear and after reaching a steady state, can exhibit a negative entropy production over finite length scales and timescales. This result, among others, is captured by nonequilibrium relations known as fluctuation theorems. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we examine how, by fine-tuning the properties of the components of a complex fluid, we can steer the nonequilibrium response of the fluid. More specifically, we show how we control the nonequilibrium probability distribution for the shear stress and, in turn, how often states with a negative entropy production can occur. To achieve this, we start by characterizing how the size for the liquid matrix impacts the probability of observing negative entropy states, as well as the timescale over which these can be observed. We then measure how the addition of larger particles to this liquid matrix, i.e., simulating a model colloidal suspension, results in an increase in the occurrence of such states. This suggests how modifications in the composition of the mixture and in the properties of its components lead to an increase in the probability of observing states of negative entropy production and, thus, for the system to run in reverse.},

However, the RT-NEO approach neglects the motion of the other nuclei, preventing a complete description of the coupled nuclear–electronic dynamics and spectroscopy. In this work, the dynamical interactions between the other nuclei and the electron–proton subsystem are described with the mixed quantum–classical Ehrenfest dynamics method. The NEO-Ehrenfest approach propagates the electrons and quantum protons in a time-dependent variational framework, while the remaining nuclei move classically on the corresponding average electron–proton vibronic surface. This approach includes the non-Born–Oppenheimer effects between the electrons and the quantum protons with RT-NEO and between the classical nuclei and the electron–proton subsystem with Ehrenfest dynamics. Spectral features for vibrational modes involving both quantum and classical nuclei are resolved from the time-dependent dipole moments. This work shows that the NEO-Ehrenfest method is a powerful tool to study dynamical processes with coupled electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom.},

  abstract = {It is well known that Brillouin’s theorem (BT) holds in the restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF) method for three kinds of single excitations, c → o , c → v , and o → v , where c , o , and v are the orbitals of the closed, open, and virtual shells, respectively. For these excitations, the conditions imposed by BT on the orbitals of a system under study are physically equivalent to the conditions imposed by the variational principle, and this provides a fundamental meaning of BT. Together with this, BT is not satisfied for some excitations of the kind o → o , in which both orbitals participating in excitation belong to the open shell. This limitation of BT is known, for example, for the helium atom, where BT is satisfied for excitation from the ground state S 0 1 (1 s 2 ) to the state S 1 1 of the configuration 1 s 1 2 s 1 and is not satisfied for excitations S 1 1 → S 0 1 and S 1 1 → S 2 1 (2 s 2 ). In this work, we prove that Brillouin’s conditions for two latter excitations cannot be related to the fundamental conditions imposed by the variational principle due to specific symmetry restrictions. Based on this finding, we give a rigorous proof of fulfillment of BT for the alternative o → o excitation, which takes in the helium atom the form S 1 1 → S 3 1 ⁠ , where both the initial and excited states are treated as arising from the same open-shell configuration 1 s 1 2 s 1 , and the state S 3 1 is described by the symmetry-adapted ROHF wave function Ψ ( S 3 1 ) = [ Ψ ( S 2 1 ) − Ψ ( S 0 1 ) ] / 2 ⁠ . The new formulation of BT obeys all the necessary variational and symmetrical conditions, and its validity is illustrated by the results of computations of atom He and molecule LiH in their singlet states arising from different closed-shell and open-shell configurations performed using both ROHF and limited configuration interaction methods.},

They are rapidly gaining traction, especially techniques that revolve around “extended reservoirs,” a collection of a finite number of degrees of freedom with relaxation that maintains a bias or temperature gradient, and have appeared under various guises (e.g., the extended or mesoscopic reservoir, auxiliary master equation, and driven Liouville–von Neumann approaches). Yet, there are still a number of open questions regarding the behavior and convergence of these techniques. Here, we derive general analytical solutions, and associated asymptotic analyses, for the steady-state current driven by finite reservoirs with proportional coupling to the system/junction. In doing so, we present a simplified and unified derivation of the non-interacting and many-body steady-state currents through arbitrary junctions, including outside of proportional coupling. We conjecture that the analytic solution for proportional coupling is the most general of its form for isomodal relaxation (i.e., relaxing proportional coupling will remove the ability to find compact, general analytical expressions for finite reservoirs). These results should be of broad utility in diagnosing the behavior and implementation of extended reservoir and related approaches, including the convergence to the Landauer limit (for non-interacting systems) and the Meir–Wingreen formula (for many-body systems).},

It is based upon explicitly correlated basis functions derived from the regularized Krylov sequences (which constitute the core of the free iterative CI/free complement method of Nakatsuji) involving a term that introduces split length scales. For the nuclear charge Z approaching Z c , the inclusion of this term greatly reduces the error in the variational estimate for the ground-state energy, restores the correct large- r asymptotics of the one-electron density ρ ( Z ; r ), and dramatically alters the manifold of the pertinent natural amplitudes and natural orbitals. The advantages of this scheme are illustrated with test calculations for Z = 1 and Z = Z c carried out with a moderate-size 12th-generation basis set of 2354 functions. For Z = Z c , the augmentation is found to produce a ca. 5000-fold improvement in the accuracy of the approximate ground-state energy, yielding values of various electronic properties with between seven and eleven significant digits. Some of these values, such as those of the norms of the partial-wave contributions to the wavefunction and the Hill constant, have not been reported in the literature thus far. The same is true for the natural amplitudes at Z = Z c , whereas the published data for those at Z = 1 are revealed by the present calculations to be grossly inaccurate.

Using semi-empirical methods like density functional tight binding (DFTB) instead of DFT can reduce the computational costs dramatically, albeit with noticeable reductions in accuracy. This work proposes approximating the phonon density of states via a relatively inexpensive DFTB supercell treatment of the phonon dispersion that is then corrected by shifting the individual phonon modes according to the difference between the DFT and DFTB phonon frequencies at the Γ-point. The acoustic modes are then computed at the DFT level from the elastic constants. In several small-molecule crystal test cases, this combined approach reproduces DFT thermochemistry with kJ/mol accuracy and 1–2 orders of magnitude less computational effort. Finally, this approach is applied to computing the free energy differences between the five crystal polymorphs of oxalyl dihydrazide.},

  abstract = {Photo-induced relaxation processes leading to excimer formations or other traps are in the focus of many investigations of optoelectronic materials because they severely affect the efficiencies of corresponding devices. Such relaxation effects comprise inter-monomer distortions in which the orientations of the monomer change with respect to each other, whereas intra-monomer distortions are variations in the geometry of single monomers. Such distortions are generally neglected in quantum chemical investigations of organic dye aggregates due to the accompanied high computational costs. In the present study, we investigate their relevance using perylene-bisimide dimers and diindenoperylene tetramers as model systems. Our calculations underline the importance of intra-monomer distortions on the shape of the potential energy surfaces as a function of the coupling between the monomers. The latter is shown to depend strongly on the electronic state under consideration. In particular, it differs between the first and second excited state of the aggregate. Additionally, the magnitude of the geometrical relaxation decreases if the exciton is delocalized over an increasing number of monomers. For the interpretation of the vibronic coupling model, pseudo-Jahn–Teller or Marcus theory can be employed. In the first part of this paper, we establish the accuracy of density functional theory-based approaches for the prediction of vibrationally resolved absorption spectra of organic semiconductors. These investigations underline the accuracy of those approaches although shortcomings become obvious as well. These calculations also indicate the strength of intra-monomer relaxation effects.},

Consequently, inhomogeneous systems present a severe challenge for bottom-up models. In this work, we examine bottom-up CG models for interfaces and inhomogeneous systems. We first analyze the effect of external fields upon the many-body potential of mean force. We also demonstrate that the multiscale CG (MS-CG) variational principle for modeling the external field corresponds to a generalization of the first Yvon–Born–Green equation. This provides an important connection with liquid state theory, as well as physical insight into the structure of interfaces and the resulting MS-CG models. We then develop and assess MS-CG models for a film of liquid methanol that is adsorbed on an attractive wall and in coexistence with its vapor phase. While pair-additive potentials provide unsatisfactory accuracy and transferability, the inclusion of local-density (LD) potentials dramatically improves the accuracy and transferability of the MS-CG model. The MS-CG model with LD potentials quite accurately describes the wall–liquid interface, the bulk liquid density, and the liquid–vapor interface while simultaneously providing a much improved description of the vapor phase. This model also provides an excellent description of the pair structure and pressure–density equation of state for the bulk liquid. Thus, LD potentials hold considerable promise for transferable bottom-up models that accurately describe the structure and thermodynamic properties of both bulk and interfacial systems.},

  abstract = {HN 3 is a unique liquid energetic material that exhibits ultrafast detonation chemistry and a transition to metallic states during detonation. We combine the Chebyshev interaction model for efficient simulation (ChIMES) many-body reactive force field and the extended-Lagrangian multiscale shock technique molecular dynamics method to calculate the detonation properties of HN 3 with the accuracy of Kohn–Sham density-functional theory. ChIMES is based on a Chebyshev polynomial expansion and can accurately reproduce density-functional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations for a wide range of unreactive and decomposition conditions of liquid HN 3 . We show that addition of random displacement configurations and the energies of gas-phase equilibrium products in the training set allows ChIMES to efficiently explore the complex potential energy surface. Schemes for selecting force field parameters and the inclusion of stress tensor and energy data in the training set are examined. Structural and dynamical properties and chemistry predictions for the resulting models are benchmarked against DFT-MD. We demonstrate that the inclusion of explicit four-body energy terms is necessary to capture the potential energy surface across a wide range of conditions. Our results generally retain the accuracy of DFT-MD while yielding a high degree of computational efficiency, allowing simulations to approach orders of magnitude larger time and spatial scales. The techniques and recipes for MD model creation we present allow for direct simulation of nanosecond shock compression experiments and calculation of the detonation properties of materials with the accuracy of Kohn–Sham density-functional theory.},

  abstract = {In modern physics, the entanglement between quantum states is a well-established phenomenon. Going one step forward, one can conjecture the likely existence of an entanglement between excitations of one-particle quantum states. Working with a density matrix that is well defined within the polarization propagator formalism, together with information theory, we found that the quantum origin of, at least, few molecular response properties can be described by the entanglement between two pairs of virtual excitations of molecular orbitals (MOs). With our model, we are able to bring new insights into the electronic mechanisms that are behind the transmission, and communication, of the effects of a given perturbation to the whole electronic system described by the Hamiltonian of an unperturbed quantum system. With our entanglement model, we analyzed the electronic origin of the Karplus rule of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a well-known empirical phenomenon, and found that this rule is straightforwardly related to the behavior of entangled MO excitations. The model compound used to show it is the H 2 O 2 molecule.},

  abstract = {The intermolecular contribution to the spectral density of the exciton-vibrational coupling of the homotrimeric Fenna–Matthews–Olson (FMO) light-harvesting protein of green sulfur bacteria P. aestuarii is analyzed by combining a normal mode analysis of the protein with the charge density coupling method for the calculation of local transition energies of the pigments. Correlations in site energy fluctuations across the whole FMO trimer are found at low vibrational frequencies. Including, additionally, the high-frequency intrapigment part of the spectral density, extracted from line-narrowing spectra, we study intra- and intermonomer exciton transfer. Whereas the intrapigment part of the spectral density is important for fast intramonomer exciton relaxation, the intermolecular contributions (due to pigment-environment coupling) determine the intermonomer exciton transfer. Neither the variations of the local Huang–Rhys factors nor the correlations in site energy fluctuations have a critical influence on energy transfer. At room temperature, the intermonomer transfer in the FMO protein occurs on a 10 ps time scale, whereas intramonomer exciton equilibration is roughly two orders of magnitude faster. At cryogenic temperatures, intermonomer transfer limits the lifetimes of the lowest exciton band. The lifetimes are found to increase between 20 ps in the center of this band up to 100 ps toward lower energies, which is in very good agreement with the estimates from hole burning data. Interestingly, exciton delocalization in the FMO monomers is found to slow down intermonomer energy transfer, at both physiological and cryogenic temperatures.},

  abstract = {The multiscale calculations involving excited states may suffer from the electron spill-out (ESO) problem. This seems to be especially the case when the environment of the core region, described with the electronic structure method, is approximated by a polarizable force field. The ESO effect often leads to incorrect physical character of electronic excitations, spreading outside the quantum region, which, in turn, results in erroneous absorption spectra. In this work, we investigate means to remove the artifacts in one-photon absorption (OPA) and two-photon absorption (TPA) spectra of green and yellow fluorescent protein representatives. This includes (i) using different basis sets, (ii) extending the core subsystem beyond the chromophore, (iii) modification of polarization interaction between the core region and its environment, and (iv) including the Pauli repulsion through effective core potentials (ECPs). Our results clearly show that ESO is observed when diffuse functions are used to assemble the multielectron wave function regardless of the exchange–correlation functional used. Furthermore, extending the core region, thus accounting for exchange interactions between the chromophore and its environment, leads to even more spurious excited states. Also, damping the interactions between the core subsystem and the polarizable force field is hardly helpful. In contrast, placing ECPs in the position of sites creating the embedding potential leads to the removal of artificious excited states that presumably should not be observed in the OPA and TPA spectra. We prove that it is a reliable and cost-effective approach for systems where the covalent bond(s) between the core region and its environment must be cut.},

  abstract = {The mechanism of water oxidation by the Photosystem II (PSII) protein–cofactor complex is of high interest, but specifically, the crucial coupling of protonation dynamics to electron transfer (ET) and dioxygen chemistry remains insufficiently understood. We drove spinach-PSII membranes by nanosecond-laser flashes synchronously through the water-oxidation cycle and traced the PSII processes by time-resolved single-frequency infrared (IR) spectroscopy in the spectral range of symmetric carboxylate vibrations of protein side chains. After the collection of IR-transients from 100 ns to 1 s, we analyzed the proton-removal step in the S 2 ⇒ S 3 transition, which precedes the ET that oxidizes the Mn 4 CaO x -cluster. Around 1400 cm −1 , pronounced changes in the IR-transients reflect this pre-ET process (∼40 µ s at 20 °C) and the ET step (∼300 µ s at 20 °C). For transients collected at various temperatures, unconstrained multi-exponential simulations did not provide a coherent set of time constants, but constraining the ET time constants to previously determined values solved the parameter correlation problem and resulted in an exceptionally high activation energy of 540 ± 30 meV for the pre-ET step. We assign the pre-ET step to deprotonation of a group that is re-protonated by accepting a proton from the substrate–water, which binds concurrently with the ET step. The analyzed IR-transients disfavor carboxylic-acid deprotonation in the pre-ET step. Temperature-dependent amplitudes suggest thermal equilibria that determine how strongly the proton-removal step is reflected in the IR-transients. Unexpectedly, the proton-removal step is only weakly reflected in the 1400 cm −1 transients of PSII core complexes of a thermophilic cyanobacterium ( T. elongatus ).},

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce a method for modeling the evolving absorbance spectrum of an organic molecule, pseudoisocyanine (PIC), measured during the process of molecular aggregation. Despite being historically considered a J-aggregate, we find that the absorbance spectrum of PIC cannot be adequately modeled using solely J-aggregates either during molecular aggregation or in the final dry film. The collection of absorbance spectra during solution-casting is particularly difficult since a distribution of aggregates with various sizes and structures can coexist. Here, spectra measured during film formation are fit to a weighted sum of simulated spectra of two aggregate species, revealing the combinations of Coulombic coupling values, Huang–Rhys parameters, and aggregate sizes that provide good fits to measured spectra. The peak intensity ratios and relative peak positions are highly sensitive to the aggregate structure, and fitting only these features enables the rapid comparison of aggregate combinations. We find that the spectra of PIC aggregates cannot be modeled using the Huang–Rhys factor of the PIC monomer, as is typically assumed, leading us to consider models that utilize independent Huang–Rhys factors for each aggregate species. This method of fitting only the key spectral features allows an experimental spectrum to be modeled within 1 h–2 h when using a single Huang–Rhys factor, making the simulation of a series of in situ measurements during aggregation computationally feasible.},

We first report a method using anisotropic beads for polymers, which solves the computing time issue by considering that beads keep their principal orientation alongside the mean local backbone vector of the polymer chain, avoiding the computation of torques during the dynamics. Applying this method to a polymer bulk, we study the effect of anisotropic interactions vs isotropic ones for various properties such as density, pressure, topology of the chain network, local structure, and orientational order. We show that for different classes of potentials traditionally used in molecular simulations, those backbone oriented anisotropic beads can solve numerous issues usually encountered with isotropic interactions. We conclude that the use of backbone oriented anisotropic beads is a promising approach for the development of realistic coarse-grained potentials for polymers.},

The adsorption energies close to zero coverage are determined from the temperature dependence of the initial trapping probability using a novel approach. For both groups of ILs, the binding energy is dominated by the interaction of n -butane with the alkyl chain of the cation, whereas the ionic headgroups contribute only weakly. Comparing ILs with different alkyl chains at the IL cation, we find that the adsorption strength of n -butane increases with increasing length of the alkyl chain.

Realizing this is, however, a significant challenge that must circumvent the need for molecular diffusion, poor exciton migration, and detrimental back energy transfer among other hurdles. Here, we show that the above-mentioned issues can be overcome using the versatile and easily synthesized oxotriphenylhexanoate (OTHO) gelator that allows covalent incorporation of chromophores (or other functional units) at well-defined positions. To study the self-assembly properties as well as its use as a TTA-UC platform, we combine the benchmark couple platinum octaethylporphyrin as a sensitizer and 9,10-diphenylanthracene (DPA) as an annihilator, where DPA is covalently linked to the OTHO gelator at different positions. We show that TTA-UC can be achieved in the chromophore-decorated gels and that the position of attachment affects the photophysical properties as well as triplet energy transfer and triplet–triplet annihilation. This study not only provides proof-of-principle for the covalent approach but also highlights the need for a detailed mechanistic insight into the photophysical processes underpinning solid state TTA-UC.},

  abstract = {Graphene-like materials (GLMs) have received much attention as a potential alternative to precious metal-based electrocatalysts. However, the description of their electrocatalytic characteristics may still need to be improved, especially under constant chemical potential. Unlike the case of conventional metal electrodes, the potential drop across the electrical double layer ( ϕ D ) at the electrode–electrolyte interface can deviate substantially from the applied voltage ( ϕ app ) due to a shift of the Dirac point ( eϕ G ) with charging. This may in turn significantly alter the interfacial capacitance ( C T ) and the relationship between ϕ app and free-energy change (Δ F ). Hence, accurate evaluation of the electrode contribution is necessary to better understand and optimize the electrocatalytic properties of GLMs. In this work, we revisit and compare first-principles methods available to describe the ϕ app –∆ F relation. Grand-canonical density functional theory is used to determine Δ F as a function of ϕ app or electrode potential ( ϕ q ), from which the relative contribution of eϕ G is estimated. In parallel, eϕ G is directly extracted from a density functional theory analysis of the electronic structure of uncharged GLMs. The results of both methods are found to be in close agreement for pristine graphene, but their predictions deviate noticeably in the presence of adsorbates; the origin of the discrepancy is analyzed and explained. We then evaluate the application of the first-principle methods to prediction of the electrocatalytic processes, taking the reduction (hydrogenation) and oxidation (hydroxylation) reactions on pristine graphene as examples. Our work highlights the vital role of the modification of the electrode electronic structure in determining the electrocatalytic performance of GLMs.},

  abstract = {Molecular scattering at solid surfaces has been a sensitive probe of the molecule–surface interaction. Existing theoretical studies have primarily focused on diatomic molecules scattering from metal surfaces. Here, we investigate the vibrational state-to-state scattering dynamics of H 2 O/HOD from Cu(111) by a fully coupled six-dimensional quantum dynamical model based on a first-principles determined potential energy surface. Specifically, state-to-state scattering probabilities of H 2 O(1ν 1 ) and HOD with its O–H or O–D excitation are obtained in a wide range of incidence energies. We find very efficient ν 1 -to-ν 3 vibrational energy redistribution of H 2 O, with a similar efficiency to what we found previously for ν 3 -to-ν 1 energy flow in H 2 O(1ν 3 ) scattering. In comparison, we find that the energy transfer from the more localized 1ν OH or 1ν OD state to the other bond is much more difficult, in line with the strong bond selectivity observed in the dissociation of HOD on Cu(111). These results suggest that vibrational energy transfer in H 2 O/HOD scattering from Cu(111) is mode- and bond-selective, which is better described in the sudden limit via a local mode picture. Implications of these results on the mode-specific vibrational energy transfer of other polyatomic molecules scattering from metal surfaces, such as methane and ammonia, have been discussed. We hope that our study will inspire more quantum state-resolved experiments on state-to-state scattering of polyatomic molecules at metal surfaces.},

  abstract = {The electronic properties of azobenzene (AB) in interaction with gold clusters and adsorbed on the Au(111) surface are investigated by adopting a near-Hartree–Fock–Kohn–Sham (HFKS) scheme. This scheme relies on a hybrid Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional, in which the exact non-local HF exchange contribution to the energy is taken as 3/4. Ionization energies and electron affinities for gas phase AB are in very good agreement with experimental data and outer valence Green’s function) calculations. The presence of C—H⋯Au interactions in AB–Au n complexes illustrates the role played by weak interactions between molecular systems and Au nanoparticles, which is in line with recent works on Au–H bonding. In AB–Au n complexes, the frontier orbitals are mainly localized on the gold platform when n ≥ 10, which indicates the transition from a molecular to a semiconducting regime. In the latter regime, the electronic density reorganization in AB–Au n clusters is characterized by significant polarization effects on the Au platform. The accuracy of the near-HFKS scheme for predicting adsorption energies of AB on Au(111) and the interest of combining exact non-local HF exchange with a non-local representation of the dispersion energy are discussed. Taking into account the significant computational cost of the exact non-local HF exchange contribution, calculations for the adsorption energies and density of states for AB adsorbed on Au(111) were carried out by using a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approach. The results strongly support near-HFKS as a promising methodology for predicting the electronic properties of hybrid organic–metal systems.},

  abstract = {The ability to combine intermolecular potentials without loss of information is investigated. Molecular simulation results for both vapor–liquid equilibria and supercritical isochoric heat capacities are reported for different combinations of n – m potentials. The role of both additional cohesion and repulsive terms is determined. The 12-8-6 potential obtained by adding an m = 6 contribution to the 12-8 potential significantly broadens the phase envelope, which remains inside of the 12-6 envelope. In contrast, the 12+9-6 potential that involves an additional n = 9 repulsive contribution lifts the phase envelope above the 12-6 values. The 12-8-6 potential significantly reduces the maximum and minimum observed for the isochoric heat capacity at supercritical conditions. In contrast, the additional repulsion of the 12+9-6 potential has a relatively small influence on the supercritical behavior of the isochoric heat capacity. Significantly, a comparison of vapor–liquid equilibria data for two-body only simulations for Ar, Kr, and Xe indicates that there is very good agreement with the 12-8-6 data. This means that the 12-8-6 potential may provide a useful description of two-body only interactions for the noble gases. The 12+9-8 potential at least partially reproduces vapor–liquid properties of noble gases interacting via two-body plus three-body interactions. In general, the combination of potentials provides a mechanism of simplifying the calculation of two-body and two-body plus three-body interactions.},

  abstract = {Mode-coupling theory (MCT) constitutes one of the few first-principles-based approaches to describe the physics of the glass transition, but the theory’s inherent approximations compromise its accuracy in the activated glassy regime. Here, we show that microscopic generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT), a recently proposed hierarchical framework to systematically improve upon MCT, provides a promising pathway toward a more accurate first-principles description of glassy dynamics. We present a comprehensive numerical analysis for Percus–Yevick hard spheres by performing explicitly wavenumber- and time-dependent GMCT calculations up to sixth order. Specifically, we calculate the location of the critical point, the associated non-ergodicity parameters, and the time-dependent dynamics of the density correlators at both absolute and reduced packing fractions, and we test several universal scaling relations in the α - and β -relaxation regimes. It is found that higher-order GMCT can successfully remedy some of MCT’s pathologies, including an underestimation of the critical glass transition density and an overestimation of the hard-sphere fragility. Furthermore, we numerically demonstrate that the celebrated scaling laws of MCT are preserved in GMCT and that the predicted critical exponents manifestly improve as more levels are incorporated in the GMCT hierarchy. Although formally the GMCT equations should be solved up to infinite order to reach full convergence, our finite-order GMCT calculations unambiguously reveal a uniform convergence pattern for the dynamics. We thus argue that GMCT can provide a feasible and controlled means to bypass MCT’s main uncontrolled approximation, offering hope for the future development of a quantitative first-principles theory of the glass transition.},

  abstract = {Generalized mode-coupling theory (GMCT) constitutes a systematically correctable, first-principles theory to study the dynamics of supercooled liquids and the glass transition. It is a hierarchical framework that, through the incorporation of increasingly many particle density correlations, can remedy some of the inherent limitations of the ideal mode-coupling theory (MCT). However, despite MCT’s limitations, the ideal theory also enjoys several remarkable successes, notably including the analytical scaling laws for the α - and β -relaxation dynamics. Here, we mathematically derive similar scaling laws for arbitrary-order multi-point density correlation functions obtained from GMCT under arbitrary mean-field closure levels. More specifically, we analytically derive the asymptotic and preasymptotic solutions for the long-time limits of multi-point density correlators, the critical dynamics with two power-law decays, the factorization scaling laws in the β -relaxation regime, and the time-density superposition principle in the α -relaxation regime. The two characteristic power-law-divergent relaxation times for the two-step decay and the non-trivial relation between their exponents are also obtained. The validity ranges of the leading-order scaling laws are also provided by considering the leading preasymptotic corrections. Furthermore, we test these solutions for the Percus–Yevick hard-sphere system. We demonstrate that GMCT preserves all the celebrated scaling laws of MCT while quantitatively improving the exponents, rendering the theory a promising candidate for an ultimately quantitative first-principles theory of glassy dynamics.},

  abstract = {Soda–lime–silica is a glassy system of strong industrial interest. In order to characterize its liquid state properties, we performed molecular dynamics simulations employing an aspherical ion model that includes atomic polarization and deformation effects. They allowed us to study the structure and diffusion properties of the system at temperatures ranging from 1400 K to 3000 K. We show that Na + and Ca 2+ ions adopt a different structural organization within the silica network, with Ca 2+ ions having a greater affinity for non-bridging oxygens than Na + . We further link this structural behavior to their different diffusivities, suggesting that escaping from the first oxygen coordination shell is the limiting step for the diffusion. Na + diffuses faster than Ca 2+ because it is bonded to a smaller number of non-bridging oxygens. The formed ionic bonds are also less strong in the case of Na + .},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations were performed to study the phase behavior of equimolar mixtures of spheres and cubes having selective inter-species affinity. Such a selectivity was designed to promote the formation of the substitutionally ordered NaCl compound, the “C * phase,” and to be driven not only by energetic bonds but also by entropic bonds generated by dimples on the cube facets. Nestling of the spheres in the cube indentations can promote negative nonadditive mixing and increase the C * phase packing entropy. The focus is on congruent phase behavior wherein the C * phase directly melts into, and can be conveniently accessed from, the disordered state. A specialized thermodynamic integration scheme was used to trace the coexisting curves for varying the values of the interspecies contact energy, ε * , the relative indentation size, λ , and the sphere-to-cube size ratio, ζ . By starting from a known coexistence point with ε * &gt; 0 and λ = 0 (no indentation), it is found that increasing λ (at fixed ε * and ζ ) reduces the free-energy and pressure of the C * phase at coexistence, indicative of stronger entropic bonding. Remarkably, it is demonstrated that a purely athermal C * phase (i.e., with ε * = 0) can be formed for λ ≥ 0.7 and suitable choices of ζ . A metric of nonadditive (excess) volume of mixing is also suggested as an approximate predictor of athermal C * phase stability. The principles used to engineer selective entropic bonds and compounds with congruent melting are expected to be applicable to other particle shapes and crystalline phases.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) with long alkyl substituents are amphiphilic, which leads to a bicontinuous liquid structure. The strongly interacting anionic and cationic head groups form a long range charge network, with the hydrocarbon tails forming a nonpolar domain. Such nonpolar domains have been shown to dissolve a variety of neutral organic solvents. In mixtures of ILs with solvents the neutral organic molecules residing in the nonpolar domains experience different environments and friction from the charged cations and anions. Thus, the neutral molecules diffuse much faster than predicted by hydrodynamic scaling using the average viscosity of the mixture. In this work, we report studies on the structure and transport properties of mixtures of 1-octanol with the IL trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ( ⁠ P 6,6,6,14 + / NTf 2 − ⁠ ). The majority of the atom fraction in the P 6,6,6,14 + cation comprises four hydrocarbon substituents. The unique amphiphilic nature of ILs with the P 6,6,6,14 + cation makes 1-octanol fully miscible with the IL at ambient temperatures. X-ray scattering experiments show that the IL structure persists in the mixtures for 1-octanol mole fractions as large as x oct = 0.90. The self-diffusion coefficients of the three molecular species in the mixtures were measured by NMR experiments. The self-diffusion of the P 6,6,6,14 + cation is well described by the Stokes–Einstein equation, while the diffusivity of the NTf 2 − anion is slightly lower than the hydrodynamic prediction. The measured diffusivities of octanol in these mixtures are 1.3–4 times higher than the hydrodynamic predictions.},

The DEA operator employed in this work contains two-particle and three-particle one-hole excitations, and SOC is included in post-Hartree–Fock treatment. Time-reversal symmetry and spatial symmetry are exploited to reduce computational cost. The EOM-DEA-CCSD method with SOC allows us to investigate SOC effects of systems with two-unpaired electrons. According to our results on atoms, double ionization potentials (DIPs), excitation energies (EEs), and SO splittings of low-lying states are calculated reliably using the EOM-DEA-CCSD method with SOC. Its accuracy is usually higher than that of EOM-CCSD for EEs or DIPs if the same target can be reached from single excitations by choosing a proper closed-shell reference. However, performance of the EOM-DEA-CCSD method with SOC on molecules is not as good as that for atoms. Bond lengths for the ground and the several lowest excited states of GaH, InH, and TlH are underestimated pronouncedly, although reasonable EEs are obtained, and splittings of the 3 Σ − state from the π 2 configuration are calculated to be too small with EOM-DEA-CCSD.},

Here, we first validate and discuss in detail the features of the method on a benchmark water molecule. Then, we apply it to calculate on-the-fly the ab initio anharmonic nuclear densities in the correspondence of the fundamental transitions of NH and CH stretches in protonated glycine. We show how we can gain both qualitative and quantitative physical insight by inspection of different one-nucleus densities and assign a character to spectroscopic absorption peaks using the expansion of vibrational states in terms of harmonic basis functions. The visualization of the nuclear vibrations in a purely quantum picture allows us to observe and quantify the effects of anharmonicity on the molecular structure, also to exploit the effect of IR excitations on specific bonds or functional groups, beyond the harmonic approximation. We also calculate the quantum probability distribution of bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals of the molecule. Notably, we observe how in the case of one type of fundamental NH stretching, the typical harmonic nodal pattern is absent in the anharmonic distribution.},

  abstract = {Accurate prediction of water properties in its gas and condensed phases, including the interaction of water with surfaces, is of prime importance for many scientific disciplines. However, accurate simulation of all water properties together within semilocal approximations of the density functional theory possesses great challenges. The Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed semilocal density functional, which satisfies 17 known exact constraints and includes the intermediate range van der Waals interaction, performs quite well for different properties of water including the correct energy ordering of isomers. Despite its impressive performance, the energy overestimation for water isomers, ice lattice energies, and volume underestimation for ice are noticeable. However, it is recently shown that [S. Jana et al. , J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 (2), 974–987 (2020)] meta-generalized gradient approximations based on the density matrix expansion [i.e., Tao-Mo (TM) and revised TM (revTM)] can achieve quite a good accuracy for the diverse properties of water. In this paper, we assess the performance of the dispersion corrected counterparts of the TM and revTM functionals. It is shown that the dispersion corrected counterparts of both methods are also quite accurate for diverse water properties, especially for the water–solid interactions. Moreover, the extent of accuracy of TM-based functionals is also analyzed from the viewpoint of the density and functional-driven error. Finally, a comparison in the performance of the dispersion corrected functionals is exhibited. It is shown that the “ O ptimized P ower” damping function together with Grimme’s D3 correction and revTM functional is in excellent agreement for the water adsorption on carbon nanostructure materials and ice-lattice mismatch problem without deviating accuracy of other water properties compared to its bare functional.},

  abstract = {Quantum chemistry calculations have been very useful in providing many key detailed properties and enhancing our understanding of molecular systems. However, such calculation, especially with ab initio models, can be time-consuming. For example, in the prediction of charge-transfer properties, it is often necessary to work with an ensemble of different thermally populated structures. A possible alternative to such calculations is to use a machine-learning based approach. In this work, we show that the general prediction of electronic coupling, a property that is very sensitive to intermolecular degrees of freedom, can be obtained with artificial neural networks, with improved performance as compared to the popular kernel ridge regression method. We propose strategies for optimizing the learning rate and batch size, improving model performance, and further evaluating models to ensure that the physical signatures of charge-transfer coupling are well reproduced. We also address the effect of feature representation as well as statistical insights obtained from the loss function and the data structure. Our results pave the way for designing a general strategy for training such neural-network models for accurate prediction.},

The irreversible methods we present here are based on Gibbs sampling and concern breaking DBC at the update scheme of the temperature swaps. We utilize three systems as a test bed for our methods: a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation on a simple system described by a one-dimensional double well potential, the Ising model, and molecular dynamics simulations on alanine pentapeptide (ALA5). The relaxation times of inverse temperature, magnetic susceptibility, and energy density for the Ising model indicate clear gains in sampling efficiency over conventional Gibbs sampling techniques with DBC and also over the conventionally used simulated tempering with the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) scheme. Simulations on ALA5 with a large number of temperatures indicate distinct gains in mixing times for inverse temperature and consequently the energy of the system compared to conventional MH. With no additional computational overhead, our methods were found to be more efficient alternatives to the conventionally used simulated tempering methods with DBC. Our algorithms should be particularly advantageous in simulations of large systems with many temperature ladders, as our algorithms showed a more favorable constant scaling in Ising spin systems as compared with both reversible and irreversible MH algorithms. In future applications, our irreversible methods can also be easily tailored to utilize a given dynamical variable other than temperature to flatten rugged free energy landscapes.},

The SH scheme couples distinct conformational basins (states), each described by its own force field (surface), resulting in a significant improvement of the approximation to the many-body potential of mean force [T. Bereau and J. F. Rudzinski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 , 256002 (2018)]. The present study first describes CG SH in more detail, through both a toy model and a three-bead model of hexane. We further extend the methodology to non-bonded interactions and report its impact on liquid properties. Finally, we investigate the transferability of the surfaces to distinct systems and thermodynamic state points, through a simple tuning of the state probabilities. In particular, applications to variations in temperature and chemical composition show good agreement with reference atomistic calculations, introducing a promising “weak-transferability regime,” where CG force fields can be shared across thermodynamic and chemical neighborhoods.},

Afterward, this relationship is applied to show that the equations proposed by Sambe to check the quality and conservation of computed electronic current densities can be obtained as particular cases of this general theorem, with a substantial gain in computational efficiency.

  abstract = {Unitary coupled cluster (UCC), originally developed as a variational alternative to the popular traditional coupled cluster method, has seen a resurgence as a functional form for use on quantum computers. However, the number of excitors present in the Ansatz often presents a barrier to implementation on quantum computers. Given the natural sparsity of wavefunctions obtained from quantum Monte Carlo methods, we consider here a stochastic solution to the UCC problem. Using the coupled cluster Monte Carlo framework, we develop cluster selection schemes that capture the structure of the UCC wavefunction, as well as its Trotterized approximation, and use these to solve the corresponding projected equations. Due to the fast convergence of the equations with order in the cluster expansion, this approach scales polynomially with the size of the system. Unlike traditional UCC implementations, our approach naturally produces a non-variational estimator for the energy in the form of the projected energy. For unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) in small systems, we find that this agrees well with the expectation value of the energy and, in the case of two electrons, with full configuration interaction results. For the larger N 2 system, the two estimators diverge, with the projected energy approaching the coupled cluster result, while the expectation value is close to results from traditional UCCSD.},

This highlights coherence effects whether these are due to ultrafast lasers whose energy width spans several states all the way to the output of quantum computing. Surprisal analysis has provided seminal insights into the probability distributions of quantum systems from elementary particle and also nuclear physics through molecular reaction dynamics to system biology. It is therefore necessary to extend surprisal analysis to the full quantum regime where it characterizes not only the probabilities of states but also their coherence. In principle, this can be done by the maximal entropy formalism, but in the full quantum regime, its application is far from trivial [S. Dagan and Y. Dothan, Phys. Rev. D 26 , 248 (1982)] because an exponential function of non-commuting operators is not easily accommodated. Starting from an exact dynamical approach, we develop a description of the dynamics where the quantum mechanical surprisal, a linear combination of operators, plays a central role. We provide an explicit route to the Lagrange multipliers of the system and identify those operators that act as the dominant constraints.},

We show that the corners of this simplex correspond to landmark environments that can be used in a fully automatic way to analyze structures. In this way, we can, for instance, detect atoms in grain boundaries or on edges of carbon flakes without any human input about the expected environment.

Recently, various MQC methods were devised such that two harmonic oscillators are employed to represent each electronic state, showing improvements over one-oscillator-based methods. Here, we introduce and analyze newly modified mapping approximations of the quantum–classical Liouville equation (QCLE) using two oscillators for each electronic state. We design two separate mapping relations that we can adopt toward simulating dynamics and computing expectation values. Through the process, two MQC methods can be constructed, one of which actually reproduces the population dynamics of the forward and backward trajectory solution of QCLE. By applying the methods to spin–boson systems with a range of parameters, we find out that the choice of mapping relations greatly affects the simulation results. We also show that further improvement is possible through using modified identity operator formulations. Our findings may be helpful in constructing improved MQC methods in the future.},

  abstract = {Driving molecular dynamics simulations with data-guided collective variables offer a promising strategy to recover thermodynamic information from structure-centric experiments. Here, the three-dimensional electron density of a protein, as it would be determined by cryo-EM or x-ray crystallography, is used to achieve simultaneously free-energy costs of conformational transitions and refined atomic structures. Unlike previous density-driven molecular dynamics methodologies that determine only the best map-model fits, our work employs the recently developed Multi-Map methodology to monitor concerted movements within equilibrium, non-equilibrium, and enhanced sampling simulations. Construction of all-atom ensembles along the chosen values of the Multi-Map variable enables simultaneous estimation of average properties, as well as real-space refinement of the structures contributing to such averages. Using three proteins of increasing size, we demonstrate that biased simulation along the reaction coordinates derived from electron densities can capture conformational transitions between known intermediates. The simulated pathways appear reversible with minimal hysteresis and require only low-resolution density information to guide the transition. The induced transitions also produce estimates for free energy differences that can be directly compared to experimental observables and population distributions. The refined model quality is superior compared to those found in the Protein Data Bank. We find that the best quantitative agreement with experimental free-energy differences is obtained using medium resolution density information coupled to comparatively large structural transitions. Practical considerations for probing the transitions between multiple intermediate density states are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A suite of quantum embedding methods have recently been developed where the Schmidt decomposition is applied to the full system wavefunction to derive basis states that preserve the entanglement between the fragment and the bath. The quality of these methods can depend heavily on the quality of the initial full system wavefunction. Most of these methods, including bootstrap embedding (BE) [M. Welborn et al ; J. Chem. Phys. 145 , 074102 (2016)], start from a spin-restricted mean-field wavefunction [call this restricted BE (RBE)]. Given that spin-unrestricted wavefunctions can capture a significant amount of strong correlation at the mean-field level, we suspect that starting from a spin-unrestricted mean-field wavefunction will improve these embedding methods for strongly correlated systems. In this work, BE is generalized to an unrestricted Hartree–Fock bath [call this unrestricted BE (UBE)], and UBE is applied to model hydrogen ring systems. UBE’s improved versatility over RBE is utilized to calculate high spin symmetry states that were previously unattainable with RBE. Ionization potentials, electron affinities, and spin-splittings are computed using UBE with accuracy on par with spin-unrestricted coupled cluster singles and doubles. Even for cases where RBE is viable, UBE converges more reliably. We discuss the limitations or weaknesses of each calculation and how improvements to RBE and density matrix embedding theory these past few years can also improve UBE.},

  abstract = {Choosing an appropriate representation of the molecular Hamiltonian is one of the challenges faced by simulations of the nonadiabatic quantum dynamics around a conical intersection. The adiabatic, exact quasidiabatic, and strictly diabatic representations are exact and unitary transforms of each other, whereas the approximate quasidiabatic Hamiltonian ignores the residual nonadiabatic couplings in the exact quasidiabatic Hamiltonian. A rigorous numerical comparison of the four different representations is difficult because of the exceptional nature of systems where the four representations can be defined exactly and the necessity of an exceedingly accurate numerical algorithm that avoids mixing numerical errors with errors due to the different forms of the Hamiltonian. Using the quadratic Jahn–Teller model and high-order geometric integrators, we are able to perform this comparison and find that only the rarely employed exact quasidiabatic Hamiltonian yields nearly identical results to the benchmark results of the strictly diabatic Hamiltonian, which is not available in general. In this Jahn–Teller model and with the same Fourier grid, the commonly employed approximate quasidiabatic Hamiltonian led to inaccurate wavepacket dynamics, while the Hamiltonian in the adiabatic basis was the least accurate, due to the singular nonadiabatic couplings at the conical intersection.},

Here, we extended a previously developed three-bead lipid model into a five-bead model and parameterized it for two phospholipids, POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine). The developed model, iSoLF, reproduced the area per lipid, hydrophobic thickness, and phase behaviors of the target phospholipid bilayer membranes at the physiological temperature. The model POPC and DPPC membranes were in liquid and gel phases, respectively, in accordance with experiments. We further examined the spontaneous formation of a membrane bilayer, the temperature dependence of physical properties, the vesicle dynamics, and the POPC/DPPC two-component membrane dynamics of the CG lipid model, showing some promise. Once combined with standard Cα protein models, the iSoLF model will be a powerful tool to simulate large biological membrane systems made of lipids and proteins.},

Here, we report a study of a neutral oxygen vacancy in TiO 2 using state-of-the-art quantum chemical electronic structure methods. We find that the ground state is a color center singlet state in both the rutile and the anatase phases of TiO 2 . Specifically, embedded coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples calculations find, for an oxygen vacancy in rutile, that the lowest triplet state energy is 0.6 eV above the singlet state, and in anatase, the triplet state energy is higher by 1.4 eV. Our study provides fresh insights into the electronic structure of the oxygen vacancy in TiO 2 , clarifying earlier controversies and potentially inspiring future studies of defects with correlated wave function theories.},

We utilized two metal models, one based on the embedded atom method (EAM) and the other including metallic polarizability via a density readjusting EAM. These were combined with three popular water models, SPC/E, TIP4P, and TIP4P-FQ, to understand the role of polarizability in the thermal transport process. A thermal flux was introduced using velocity shearing and scaling reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics, and transport coefficients were measured by calculating the resulting thermal gradients and temperature differences at the interface. Our primary finding is that the computed interfacial thermal conductance between a bare metal interface and water increases when polarizability is taken into account in the metal model. Additional work to understand the origin of the conductance difference points to changes in the local ordering of the water molecules in the first two layers of water above the metal surface. Vibrational densities of states on both sides of the interface exhibit interesting frequency modulation close to the surface but no obvious differences due to metal polarizability.},

  abstract = {Thermally activated triplet-to-singlet upconversion is attractive from both fundamental science and exciton engineering, but controlling the process from molecular configuration is still unrevealed. In particular, the flexibility of the freedom of molecular geometry is of major importance to understand the kinetics of the phonon-induced upconversion. Here, we focus on two linearly connected donor–acceptor molecules, 9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine-2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (DMAC-TRZ) and hexamethylazatriangulene-2,4,6-triphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (HMAT-TRZ), as the model system. While DMAC-TRZ possesses a rotational degree of freedom in the dihedral angle between the donor and acceptor moieties, i.e., C–N bond in tertiary amine, the rotation is structurally restricted in HMAT-TRZ. The rotationally flexible DMAC-TRZ showed significant triplet-to-singlet upconversion caused by thermal activation. On the other hand, the rotation-restricted HMAT-TRZ showed negligible thermal upconversion efficiency. We elaborate on the origin of the photophysical properties from the viewpoint of the geometries in the excited states using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. We uncovered that the structural restriction of the intramolecular flexibility significantly affects the optimized geometry and phonon modes coupled to the spin conversion. As a result of the rotation restriction, the spin flipping in HMAT-TRZ was coupled to bending motion instead of the rotation. In contrast, the free rotation fluctuation in the DMAC-TRZ mixes local-excitation and charge-transfer characters, leading to successful activation of the delayed fluorescence as well as the reverse intersystem crossing. Our discovery sheds light on the mechanism of the triplet-to-singlet upconversion, providing a microscopic strategy to control the optoelectronic properties from a molecular viewpoint.},

At supercritical conditions, ∼600 K and 0.249 g/cm 3 (the critical isochore), the electrostatic field is of the same order, despite the low dielectric constant of the fluid. In this case, the electrostatic field is determined by the enhanced rotational diffusion of the molecules and stronger cross-coupling between heat and polarization fluxes.

It is shown that when considering a gas phase that contains mixtures of carbon monoxide and nitrogen, the trapping of carbon monoxide is favored with respect to nitrogen at the surface of all solids, irrespective of the temperature. The results of the calculations also indicate that some amounts of molecules can be incorporated in the bulk of the water structures, and the molecular selectivity of the incorporation process is investigated. Again, it is shown that incorporation of carbon monoxide is favored with respect to nitrogen in most of the situations considered here. In addition, the conclusions of the present simulations emphasize the importance of the strength of the interactions between the guest molecules and the water network.

Yet, control of synthetic parameters, such as uniform temperature and mixing, can be challenging, particularly, when scaling-up production of a mixed-linker MOF or a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). Here, we examine the effect of heterogeneous linker distribution on the thermal properties and melting behavior of ZIF-62. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies revealed little discernable structural difference between samples of ZIF-62 synthesized in our lab and by a commercial supplier. Differential scanning calorimetry and variable temperature/isothermal XRD revealed the samples to have significantly different thermal behavior. Formation of ZIF-zni was identified, which contributed to a dramatic rise in the melting point by around 100 K and also led to the alteration of the macroscopic properties of the final glass. Parameters that might lead to the formation of unexpected phases such as an uneven distribution of linkers were identified, and characterization methods for the detection of unwanted phases are provided. Finally, the need for adequate consideration of linker distribution is stressed when characterizing mixed-linker ZIFs.},

Similarly, the AIE 1 for QC at 7.671 eV, assigned to the 2 B 2 state, discloses a vibrational progression of nine or more members with vibration frequency decreasing from 703 cm −1 to 660 cm −1 ; our calculated vibration frequency is 663 cm −1 . These AIEs, determined by coupled cluster and fourth order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, were very similar to the corresponding second order perturbation theory results. The calculated AIE symmetry sequences are 2 B 1 &lt; 2 A 1 &lt; 2 A 2 &lt; 2 B 2 for NBD and 2 B 2 &lt; 2 A 2 &lt; 2 B 1 &lt; 2 A 1 for QC. The overall PES vertical ionization energy profiles for both compounds were closely reproduced by Tamm–Dancoff approximation energies and intensities. The vibrational structure of the ionic states, determined using Franck–Condon methods, gave a good account of the observed spectra, but the observed envelopes for both IE 1 are complex sets of vibrations, rather than single progressions. The NMR spectra for QC showed residual second order properties at 300 MHz; both QC and NBD have been theoretically analyzed in greater detail using AA / BB / CC / XX / spectra, where all H are coupled; the magnetic shielding and spin–spin coupling constants obtained are similar to experimental values.},

  abstract = {G-quadruplex assemblies are a promising tool for self-assembling π -stacked chromophore arrays to better understand their photophysics. We have shown that coupling a single guanine moiety to terrylenediimide (TDI) produces a structure ( GTDI ) that self-assembles in tetrahydrofuran (THF) into a nearly monodisperse guanine-quadruplex structure having 16 π-stacked layers (GTDI 4 ) 16 . The TDI surfaces were determined to have a high degree of cofacial overlap and underwent quantitative symmetry-breaking charge separation (SB-CS) upon photoexcitation. Here, we more deeply examine the relationship between solvent and aggregate formation and develop insights into structure–function relationships over a variety of solvent polarities and hydrogen-bonding capabilities. At high concentrations, GTDI assembles into guanine-quadruplex structures (GTDI 4 ) 16 in THF and toluene, as well as (GTDI 4 ) 9 in pyridine and benzonitrile. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows that SB-CS occurs in all solvents, regardless of their static dielectric constants, but the SB-CS yield is determined by structure. Solvent polarity independent SB-CS generation is also observed in GTDI films, where there is a complete absence of solvent.},

The origin of the doubling has been investigated by means of ab initio calculations conducted at the CCSD(T)(F12 * )/cc-pVDZ-F12 level. Two paths were examined by calculating the corresponding energy as a function of two angles. One path involved inversion of the configuration at S through a planar transition state of C 2v symmetry via changes in the angle ϕ between the C 2 axis of H 2 S and the line joining the H and I nuclei [the potential energy function V ( ϕ )]. The other was a torsional oscillation θ about the local C 2 axis of H 2 S that also exchanges the equivalent H nuclei [the potential energy function V ( θ )]. The inversion path is slightly lower in energy and much shorter in arc length and is therefore the favored tunneling pathway. In addition, calculation of V ( ϕ ) for the series of hydrogen- and halogen-bonded complexes H 2 S⋯HX (X = F, Cl, or Br) and H 2 S⋯XY (XY = Cl 2 , Br 2 , ClF, BrCl, or ICl) at the same level of theory revealed that doubling is unlikely to be resolved in these, in agreement with experimental observations.

  abstract = {The infrared pulses used to generate nonlinear signals from a vibrational probe can cause heating via solvent absorption. Solvent absorption followed by rapid vibrational relaxation produces unwanted heat signals by creating spectral shifts of the solvent and probe absorptions. The signals are often isolated by “chopping,” i.e., alternately blocking one of the incident pulses. This method is standard in pump–probe transient absorption experiments. As less heat is deposited into the sample when an incident pulse is blocked, the heat-induced spectral shifts give rise to artificial signals. Here, we demonstrate a new method that eliminates heat induced signals using pulse shaping to control pulse spectra. This method is useful if the absorption spectrum of the vibrational probe is narrow compared to the laser bandwidth. By using a pulse shaper to selectively eliminate only frequencies of light resonant with the probe absorption during the “off” shot, part of the pulse energy, and the resulting heat, is delivered to the solvent without generating the nonlinear signal. This partial heating reduces the difference heat signal between the on and off shots. The remaining solvent heat signal can be eliminated by reducing the wings of the on shot spectrum while still resonantly exciting the probe; the heat deposition from the on shot can be matched with that from the off shot, eliminating the solvent heat contribution to the signal. Modification of the pulse sequence makes it possible to measure only the heat signal, permitting the kinetics of heating to be studied.},

  abstract = {The on-top pair density [ Π r ] is a local quantum-chemical property that reflects the probability of two electrons of any spin to occupy the same position in space. Being the simplest quantity related to the two-particle density matrix, the on-top pair density is a powerful indicator of electron correlation effects, and as such, it has been extensively used to combine density functional theory and multireference wavefunction theory. The widespread application of Π( r ) is currently hindered by the need for post-Hartree–Fock or multireference computations for its accurate evaluation. In this work, we propose the construction of a machine learning model capable of predicting the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF)-quality on-top pair density of a molecule only from its structure and composition. Our model, trained on the GDB11-AD-3165 database, is able to predict with minimal error the on-top pair density of organic molecules, bypassing completely the need for ab initio computations. The accuracy of the regression is demonstrated using the on-top ratio as a visual metric of electron correlation effects and bond-breaking in real-space. In addition, we report the construction of a specialized basis set, built to fit the on-top pair density in a single atom-centered expansion. This basis, cornerstone of the regression, could be potentially used also in the same spirit of the resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the electron density.},

We present a semi-analytic modified boundary layer approximation (mBLA) method for calculating the inhomogeneous concentration-polarization (CP) layer of particles near the membrane and the dispersion flow in a cross-flow filtration setup with a hollow fiber membrane. Conditions are established for which unwarranted axial flow and permeate flow reversal are excluded, and non-monotonic CP profiles are observed. The permeate flux is linked to the particle concentration on the membrane wall using the Darcy–Starling expression invoking axially varying osmotic and trans-membrane pressures. Results are discussed for dispersions of hard spheres serving as a reference system and for solvent-permeable particles mimicking non-ionic microgels. Accurate analytic expressions are employed for the concentration and solvent permeability dependent dispersion viscosity and gradient diffusion coefficient entering into the effective Stokes flow and advection–diffusion equations. We show that the mBLA concentration and flow profiles are in quantitative agreement with results by a finite element method. The mBLA results are compared with predictions by an earlier CP layer similarity solution, showing the higher precision of the former method.},

Yet, it has recently been found that the HEOM may become numerically unstable in simulations using discrete harmonic oscillator modes [I. S. Dunn, et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 184109 (2019)]. In this paper, a new set of equations of motion are obtained based on the equivalence between the HEOM for discrete harmonic oscillator modes and the mixed quantum-classical Liouville equation. The new set of equations can thus be regarded as the expansion of the same phase space partial differential equation using different basis sets. It is shown that they have similar structures as the original HEOM but are free from the problem of numerical instability. The new set of equations are also incorporated into the matrix product state method, where it is found that the trace of the reduced density operator is not well conserved during the propagation. A modified time-dependent variational principle is then proposed to achieve better trace conservation.},

  abstract = {Finite temperature auxiliary field-based quantum Monte Carlo methods, including determinant quantum Monte Carlo and Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), have historically assumed pivotal roles in the investigation of the finite temperature phase diagrams of a wide variety of multidimensional lattice models and materials. Despite their utility, however, these techniques are typically formulated in the grand canonical ensemble, which makes them difficult to apply to condensates such as superfluids and difficult to benchmark against alternative methods that are formulated in the canonical ensemble. Working in the grand canonical ensemble is furthermore accompanied by the increased overhead associated with having to determine the chemical potentials that produce desired fillings. Given this backdrop, in this work, we present a new recursive approach for performing AFQMC simulations in the canonical ensemble that does not require knowledge of chemical potentials. To derive this approach, we exploit the convenient fact that AFQMC solves the many-body problem by decoupling many-body propagators into integrals over one-body problems to which non-interacting theories can be applied. We benchmark the accuracy of our technique on illustrative Bose and Fermi–Hubbard models and demonstrate that it can converge more quickly to the ground state than grand canonical AFQMC simulations. We believe that our novel use of HS-transformed operators to implement algorithms originally derived for non-interacting systems will motivate the development of a variety of other methods and anticipate that our technique will enable direct performance comparisons against other many-body approaches formulated in the canonical ensemble.},

By calculating the exchange interaction of periodic systems with single-precision arithmetic, the computation time is cut nearly in half with a negligible loss in accuracy. This improvement makes exact exchange calculations quicker and more feasible, especially for high-throughput calculations.

In many cases, the same organic molecules form various stable and metastable polymorphous structures that can transform to each other at certain parameters. A high rigidity of SAMs extremely complicates the evaluation of the chemical potential using standard methods based on thermodynamic integration. This study presents results of molecular modeling of two-dimensional structures of tripod-shaped molecules associated with the trimesic acid (TMA) molecules. A technique used here is based on a recently developed method of external fields imposed on an elongated simulation cell in the framework of a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. These fields are the external potential and a damping field that reduces the intermolecular potential and affects the system similar to the increase in temperature. Equations of state (EOS) for several TMA polymorphs have been obtained with the conventional Monte Carlo simulation. It was shown that, in each case, only one constant links the chemical potential obtained with the external field method and the EOS at any temperature and pressure. The heat capacities of SAMs at constant volume and pressure were also determined as functions of temperature and compressibility of the structure at given degrees of freedom. The approach can be used as a general tool for modeling and evaluation of thermodynamic properties of various rigid structures, including SAMs of functional organic molecules.},

In order to compute quantum response functions from classical dynamics, we extend this mapping to a quantum Hamiltonian with time-dependence arising from a classical field. This generalization requires attention to time-ordering in quantum and classical propagators. Quantum response theory with the original quantum Hamiltonian is equivalent to classical response theory with the classical mapping Hamiltonian. We elucidate the structure of classical response theory with the mapping Hamiltonian, thereby generating classical versions of the two-sided quantum density operator diagrams conventionally used to describe spectroscopic processes. This formal development can provide a foundation for new semiclassical approximations to spectroscopic observables for models in which classical nuclear degrees of freedom are introduced into a mapping Hamiltonian describing electronic states. Calculations of the temperature-dependence of two-dimensional electronic spectra for an exciton dimer using two semiclassical approaches are compared with benchmark calculations using the hierarchical equations of motion method.},

Seeking the design that optimizes a rate is a particularly challenging problem since the rate calculation for any one design is itself a difficult computation. Toward this end, we demonstrate a strategy based on transition path sampling to generate an ensemble of designs and reactive trajectories with a preference for fast reaction rates. Each step of the Monte Carlo procedure requires a measure of how a design constrains molecular configurations, expressed via the reciprocal of the partition function for the design. Although the reciprocal of the partition function would be prohibitively expensive to compute, we apply Booth’s method for generating unbiased estimates of a reciprocal of an integral to sample designs without bias. A generalization with multiple trajectories introduces a stronger preference for fast rates, pushing the sampled designs closer to the optimal design. We illustrate the methodology on two toy models of increasing complexity: escape of a single particle from a Lennard-Jones potential well of tunable depth and escape from a metastable tetrahedral cluster with tunable pair potentials.},

  abstract = {We report on applications of the domain based local pair-natural orbital (PNO) coupled-cluster method within the singles and doubles approximation (DLPNO-CCSD) to the calculation of 57 Fe isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings in a small training set of iron complexes consisting of large molecular ligands and iron atoms in varying charge, spin, and oxidation states. The electron densities and electric field gradients needed for these calculations were obtained within the recently implemented analytic derivative scheme. A method for the direct treatment of scalar relativistic effects in the calculation of effective electron densities is described by using the first-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess Hamiltonian and a Gaussian charge distribution model for the nucleus. The performance of DLPNO-CCSD is compared with four modern-day density functionals, namely, RPBE, TPSS, B3LYP, and B2PLYP, as well as with the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. An excellent correlation between the calculated electron densities and the experimental isomer shifts is attained with the DLPNO-CCSD method. The correlation constant a obtained from the slope of the linear correlation plot is found to be ≈−0.31 a.u. 3 mm s −1 , which agrees very well with the experimental calibration constant α = −0.31 ± 0.04 a.u. 3 mm s −1 . This value of a is obtained consistently using both nonrelativistic and scalar relativistic DLPNO-CCSD electron densities. While the B3LYP and B2PLYP functionals achieve equally good correlation between theory and experiment, the correlation constant a is found to deviate from the experimental value. Similar trends are observed also for quadrupole splittings. The value of the nuclear quadrupole moment for 57 Fe is estimated to be 0.15 b at the DLPNO-CCSD level. This is consistent with previous results and is here supported by a higher level of theory. The DLPNO-CCSD results are found to be insensitive to the intrinsic approximations in the method, in particular the PNO occupation number truncation error, while the results obtained with density functional theory (DFT) are found to depend on the choice of the functional. In a statistical sense, i.e., on the basis of the linear regression analysis, however, the accuracies of the DFT and DLPNO-CCSD results can be considered comparable.},

  abstract = {Strong light–matter coupling leads to the formation of mixed exciton–polariton states, allowing for a rigorous manipulation of the absorption and emission of excitonic materials. Here, we demonstrate the realization of this promising concept in organic photodetectors. By hybridizing the E 11 exciton of semiconducting (6,5) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with near-infrared cavity photons, we create spectrally tunable polariton states within a photodiode. In turn, we are able to red-shift the detection peak that coincides with the lower polariton band. Our photodiodes comprise a metal cavity to mediate strong coupling between light and SWNTs and utilize P3HT and PC 70 BM as the electron donor and acceptor, respectively. The diodes are formed either via mixing of SWNTs, P3HT, and PC 70 BM to create a bulk heterojunction or by sequential processing of layers to form flat heterojunctions. The resulting near-infrared sensors show tunable, efficient exciton harvesting in an application-relevant wavelength range between 1000 nm and 1300 nm, with optical simulations showing a possible extension beyond 1500 nm.},

The isomers employed different stabilizing mechanisms compared to the ground state. Only the phenolate-keto isomer became attracted to the water molecules in its excited state and was stabilized by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds with nearby water molecules. The most stable isomer in the excited state was the phenolate-keto, and the phenolate-enol and phenol-enolate isomers were higher in energy by ∼0.38 eV and 0.57 eV, respectively, than the phenolate-keto. This was in contrast to the case of ground state in which the phenolate-enol was the most stable isomer.},

Dynamics of cells in the core is glass-like, whereas those in the periphery undergoes diffusive or super-diffusive behavior. Quantification of heterogeneity using the mean square displacement or the self-intermediate scattering function, which involves averaging over the cell population, hides the complexity of the collective movement. Using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), a popular unsupervised machine learning dimensionality reduction technique, we show that the phase space structure of an evolving colony of cells, driven by cell division and apoptosis, partitions into nearly disjoint sets composed principally of the core and periphery cells. The non-equilibrium phase separation is driven by the differences in the persistence of self-generated active forces induced by cell division. Extensive heterogeneity revealed by t-SNE paves the way toward understanding the origins of intratumor heterogeneity using experimental imaging data.},

Multiscale hybrid techniques, using a different level of description for the molecule and the plasmonic nanosystems, permit a reliable representation of the atomistic details and of collective features, such as plasmons, in such complex systems. Here, we focus on a selected set of topics of current interest in molecular plasmonics (control of electronic excitations in light-harvesting systems, polaritonic chemistry, hot-carrier generation, and plasmon-enhanced catalysis). We discuss how their description may benefit from a hybrid modeling approach and what are the main challenges for the application of such models. In doing so, we also provide an introduction to such models and to the selected topics, as well as general discussions on their theoretical descriptions.},

Various conformational properties, such as the atomic density profile, counterion density distribution, charge distribution, cavity volume, and the static structure factor are studied as a function of the charge and chain length of the LPE. The lower generation dendrimer complexes encapsulate the shorter linear PE chains, while the longer PE chains are adsorbed on the dendrimer surface that screen the surface charge and prevent the penetration of the counterions and water molecules. However, the overall charge of the higher generation dendrimers is not neutralized by the charge of the PE chains, which results in chloride counterion penetration within the dendrimers. The adsorption of the PE chains on the dendrimers is also verified from the charge distribution of the dendrimer–PE complexes. The charge on the lower generation dendrimer complexes is overcompensated by the longer PE chains resulting in an overall negative charge on the complexes, while the PE chains do not completely neutralize the charge of the higher generation dendrimers and produce positively charged complexes. The results of the structure factor indicate a conformational transition of the dendrimer–PE complexes from a dense compact structure to an open one with an increase in the PE chain length. This transition is characterized by an increase in the cavity volume in dendrimers with an increase in the PE chain length.},

  abstract = {Intracellular elastic filaments such as microtubules are subject to thermal Brownian noise and active noise generated by molecular motors that convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Similarly, polymers in living fluids such as bacterial suspensions and swarms suffer bending deformations as they interact with single bacteria or with cell clusters. Often, these filaments perform mechanical functions and interact with their networked environment through cross-links or have other similar constraints placed on them. Here, we examine the mechanical properties—under tension—of such constrained active filaments under canonical boundary conditions motivated by experiments. Fluctuations in the filament shape are a consequence of two types of random forces—thermal Brownian forces and activity derived forces with specified time and space correlation functions. We derive force-extension relationships and expressions for the mean square deflections for tethered filaments under various boundary conditions including hinged and clamped constraints. The expressions for hinged–hinged boundary conditions are reminiscent of the worm-like-chain model and feature effective bending moduli and mode-dependent non-thermodynamic effective temperatures controlled by the imposed force and by the activity. Our results provide methods to estimate the activity by measurements of the force-extension relation of the filaments or their mean square deflections, which can be routinely performed using optical traps, tethered particle experiments, or other single molecule techniques.},

Yb 3+ ions are fixed in the neighborhood of the CsPbCl 3 lattice by preparing a one-to-one layer arrangement consisting of quasi-2D CsPbCl 3 perovskite and Yb 3+ layers. The successful preparation of layer arrangements resulted in the highly sensitized luminescence of Yb 3+ by CsPbCl 3 with NIR PLQYs exceeding 130\%, which is attributed to quantum cutting. In addition, Er 3+ luminescence at 1540 nm is acquired by the co-existence of Er 3+ with Yb 3+ in a layer, which is a result of the intralayer metal-to-metal energy transfer from Yb 3+ activated by CsPbCl 3 via the interlayer quantum cutting process. The PLQY of Er 3+ luminescence reaches to 12.6\%, which is the highest value ever observed for Er 3+ compounds, resulting from the efficient interlayer quantum cutting process over 100\% and the following intralayer resonance metal to metal energy transfer with the efficiency over 80\%.},

Here, we report the theoretical study of adsorption-induced deformation of the model mesoporous material with ordered corrugated cylindrical pores. Using the classical density functional theory in the local density approximation, we compared the solvation pressure in corrugated and cylindrical pores for nitrogen at sub- and super-critical temperatures. Our results demonstrate qualitative differences between solvation pressures in the two geometries at sub-critical temperatures. The deviations are attributed to the formation of liquid bridges in corrugated pores. However, at super-critical temperatures, there is no abrupt bridge formation and corrugation does not qualitatively change solvation pressure isotherms. We believe that these results could help in the analysis of an adsorption-induced deformation of the materials with distorted pores.},

The covalency is assessed based on novel theoretical analyses of wave functions for the various cases. It is found that the covalency is considerably different for different oxidation states and for different ionized and non-ionized configurations. The changes in covalency for the ions are shown to be responsible for important changes in relaxation energies for X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and in the intensity lost from main XPS peaks to shake satellites. While these consequences are not observables themselves, they are important for the interpretation of the XPS spectra, in particular, for efforts to extract stoichiometries of these iron oxides from XPS data.

In this work, we show the use of Marcus–Hush–Chidsey (MHC) kinetics to accurately predict the Tafel curve data from the work of Boyle et al. [ACS Energy Lett. 5 (3), 701 (2020)]. We discuss the differences in predictions of reorganization energies from the Marcus–Hush and the MHC models for lithium metal electrodes in four solvents. The MHC kinetic model is implemented and open-sourced within Cantera . Using the reaction kinetic model in a pseudo-2D battery model with a lithium anode paired with a LiFePO 4 cathode, we show the importance of accounting for the MHC kinetics and compare it to the use of Butler–Volmer and Marcus–Hush kinetic models. We find significant deviation in the limiting currents associated with reaction kinetics for the three different rate laws for conditions of fast charge and discharge relevant for eVTOL and EV, respectively.},

For the H 2 O layer, we obtain oxygen–oxygen (O–O) and oxygen–hydrogen (O–H) peaks at 2.84 Å and 1.83 Å, respectively, in good agreement with values in the literature. This demonstrates the potential of our approach toward future studies of water-based physics and chemistry in TEMs or electron probes of structural dynamics.},

  abstract = {Temperature-dependent thermal conductivities are reported for one-dimensional (1D) hydrogen-bonding ferroelectric crystals of isostructural compounds NH 4 HSO 4 and RbHSO 4 . As the temperature was decreased from 300 K, at which point they were paraelectric in the P 2 1 / n space group, their thermal conductivities decreased, similar to those of glassy materials. At the ferroelectric transition points ( T 1A = 270 K for NH 4 HSO 4 and T 1R = 264 K for RbHSO 4 ), a change from P 2 1 / n to Pn space groups was observed, and the thermal conductivity of the NH 4 HSO 4 crystal decreased without any anomalies, whereas that of RbHSO 4 increased, similar to that of crystalline materials. At the second ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition point of NH 4 HSO 4 ( T 2A = 154 K), the thermal conductivity increased from 1.00 W m −1 K to 1.32 W m −1 K and increased with a subsequent decrease in temperature, similar to that of crystalline materials. Single-crystal x-ray structure analyses revealed that the thermal conductivity transition of RbHSO 4 at T 1R = 264 K corresponds to the rotational motion excitation of the HSO 4 − chains. The abrupt thermal conductivity jump of NH 4 HSO 4 was likely related to the order–disorder type transition in NH 4 + ions, accompanied by lattice vibration excitation, coupled with internal rotation. At the T 2A ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition of NH 4 HSO 4 , 2 1 crystal symmetry recovery was observed, similar to the Rochelle salt, and the space group at low temperatures was P 2 1 / n . For the RbHSO 4 crystals, the thermal conductivity parallel to the 1D chains was 1.5-times higher than the corresponding perpendicular orientation.},

  abstract = {We theoretically study the effect of external deformation on activated structural relaxation and aspects of the nonlinear mechanical response of glassy hard sphere fluids in the context of elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation theory. This microscopic force-based approach describes activated relaxation as a coupled local–nonlocal event involving caging and longer range collective elasticity, with the latter becoming more important and ultimately dominant with increasing packing fraction under equilibrium conditions. The central new question we address is how this physical picture of activated relaxation, and the relative importance of local caging vs collective elasticity physics, depends on external deformation. Theoretical predictions are presented for deformation-induced enhancement of mobility, the onset of relaxation speed up at remarkably low values of stress, strain, or shear rate, apparent power law thinning of the steady state structural relaxation time and viscosity, a non-vanishing activation barrier in the shear thinning regime, an apparent Herschel–Bulkley form of the rate dependence of the steady state shear stress, exponential growth of different measures of a dynamic yield or flow stress with the packing fraction, and reduced fragility and dynamic heterogeneity under deformation. The results are contrasted with experiments and simulations, and qualitative or better agreement is found. An overarching conclusion is that deformation strongly reduces the importance of longer range collective elastic effects relative to the local caging aspect for most, but not all, physical questions, with deformation-dependent fragility and dynamic heterogeneity phenomena being qualitatively sensitive to collective elasticity. Overall, nonlinear rheology is predicted to be a more local problem than quiescent structural relaxation, albeit with deformation-modified activated processes still important.},

  abstract = {Combining results from impedance spectroscopy and oscillatory shear rheology, the present work focuses on the relation between the mass and charge flows and on how these are affected by the H-bonding in viscous ionic liquids (ILs). In particular, we compare the relaxational behaviors of the paradigmatic IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMIM-TFSI) and its OH-functionalized counterpart 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (OHEMIM-TFSI). Our results and their analysis demonstrate that the presence of cationic OH-groups bears a strong impact on the overall dynamics of OHEMIM-TFSI, although no signatures of suprastructural relaxation modes could be identified in their dielectric and mechanical responses. To check whether at the origin of this strong variation is the H-bonding or merely the difference between the corresponding cation sizes (controlling both the hydrodynamic volume and the inter-charge distance), the present study includes 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PMIM-TFSI), mixtures of EMIM-TFSI and PMIM-TFSI with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), and mixtures of OHEMIM-TFSI with PMIM-TFSI. Their investigation clearly reveals that the dynamical changes induced by H-bonding are significantly larger than those that can be attributed to the change in the ion size. Moreover, in the mixtures of OHEMIM-TFSI with PMIM-TFSI, a dilution of the OH-groups leads to strong deviations from ideal mixing behavior, thus highlighting the common phenomenological ground of hydroxy-functionalized ILs and other H-bonded liquids.},

Ab initio anharmonic calculations were carried out in a step-wise manner to reveal the origin of various bands observed in the spectrum of the methylamine dimer. A seven-dimensional potential energy surface involving symmetric and asymmetric stretching and bending vibrations of both the hydrogen bond donor and the acceptor along intermolecular-translational modes was constructed using the discrete variable representation approach. The resulting spectrum of the dimer shows five bands that can be attributed to the symmetric stretching ( ⁠ ν sym D ⁠ ), asymmetric stretchin ( ⁠ ν asym D ⁠ ), and bending overtone ( ⁠ 2 ν bend D ⁠ ) of the donor moiety. These appear along with the combination band arising out of bending vibrations of the donor and acceptor ( ⁠ ν bend D + ν bend A ⁠ ) and with the combination of the intermolecular translational mode over the donor bending overtone ( ⁠ ν trans + 2 ν bend D ⁠ ). The spectrum of the trimer essentially consists of all the features seen in the dimer with marginal changes in band positions. The analysis of the experimental spectra based on the two-state deperturbation model and ab initio anharmonic calculations yield a matrix element of about 40 cm −1 for the N–H bend–stretch Fermi resonance coupling. In general, the IR spectra of the hydrogen-bonded amino group depict three sets of bands that arise due to bend–stretch Fermi resonance coupling.},

  abstract = {Frenkel exciton population dynamics of an excitonic dimer is studied by comparing the results from a quantum master equation involving rates from second-order perturbative treatment with respect to the excitonic coupling with the non-perturbative results from “Hierarchical Equations of Motion” (HEOM). By formulating generic Liouville-space expressions for the rates, we can choose to evaluate them either via HEOM propagations or by applying the cumulant expansion. The coupling of electronic transitions to bath modes is modeled either as overdamped oscillators for the description of thermal bath components or as underdamped oscillators to account for intramolecular vibrations. Cases of initial nonequilibrium and equilibrium vibrations are discussed. In the case of HEOM, initial equilibration enters via a polaron transformation. Pointing out the differences between the nonequilibrium and equilibrium approach in the context of the projection operator formalism, we identify a further description, where the transfer dynamics is driven only by fluctuations without involvement of dissipation. Despite this approximation, this approach can also yield meaningful results in certain parameter regimes. While for the chosen model, HEOM has no technical advantage for evaluation of the rate expressions compared to cumulant expansion, there are situations where only evaluation with HEOM is applicable. For instance, a separation of reference and interaction Hamiltonian via a polaron transformation to account for the interplay between Coulomb coupling and vibrational oscillations of the bath at the level of a second-order treatment can be adjusted for a treatment with HEOM.},

The exponents of the basis set are optimized through the minimization of the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) energy in a small unit cell of the solid. We compare against other alternative basis sets proposed in the literature, namely, calculations in the Kohn–Sham basis and in the natural orbitals of an MP2 calculation. We find that our optimized basis sets accelerate the convergence of the AFQMC correlation energy compared to a Kohn–Sham basis and offer similar convergence to MP2 natural orbitals at a fraction of the cost needed to generate them. We also suggest the use of an improved, method independent, MP2-based basis set correction that significantly reduces the required basis set sizes needed to converge the correlation energy. With these developments, we study the relative performance of these basis sets in LiH, Si, and MgO and determine that our optimized basis sets yield the most consistent results as a function of volume. Using these optimized basis sets, we systematically converge the AFQMC calculations to the complete basis set and thermodynamic limit and find excellent agreement with experiment for the systems studied. Although we focus on AFQMC, our basis set generation procedure is independent of the subsequent correlated wavefunction method used.},

  abstract = {In a previous paper [J. R. Mannouch and J. O. Richardson, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 194109 (2020)], we derived a new partially linearized mapping-based classical-trajectory technique called the spin partially linearized density matrix (spin-PLDM) approach. This method describes the dynamics associated with the forward and backward electronic path integrals using a Stratonovich–Weyl approach within the spin-mapping space. While this is the first example of a partially linearized spin-mapping method, fully linearized spin-mapping is already known to be capable of reproducing dynamical observables for a range of nonadiabatic model systems reasonably accurately. Here, we present a thorough comparison of the terms in the underlying expressions for the real-time quantum correlation functions for spin-PLDM and fully linearized spin mapping in order to ascertain the relative accuracy of the two methods. In particular, we show that spin-PLDM contains an additional term within the definition of its real-time correlation function, which diminishes many of the known errors that are ubiquitous for fully linearized approaches. One advantage of partially linearized methods over their fully linearized counterparts is that the results can be systematically improved by re-sampling the mapping variables at intermediate times. We derive such a scheme for spin-PLDM and show that for systems for which the approximation of classical nuclei is valid, numerically exact results can be obtained using only a few “jumps.” Additionally, we implement focused initial conditions for the spin-PLDM method, which reduces the number of classical trajectories that are needed in order to reach convergence of dynamical quantities, with seemingly little difference to the accuracy of the result.},

Within a classical trajectory picture, partially linearized methods treat the electronic dynamics along forward and backward paths separately by explicitly evolving two sets of mapping variables. Unlike previously derived partially linearized methods based on the Meyer–Miller–Stock–Thoss mapping, spin-PLDM uses the Stratonovich–Weyl transform to describe the electronic dynamics for each path within the spin-mapping space; this automatically restricts the Cartesian mapping variables to lie on a hypersphere and means that the classical equations of motion can no longer propagate the mapping variables out of the physical subspace. The presence of a rigorously derived zero-point energy parameter also distinguishes spin-PLDM from other partially linearized approaches. These new features appear to give the method superior accuracy for computing dynamical observables of interest when compared with other methods within the same class. The superior accuracy of spin-PLDM is demonstrated in this paper through application of the method to a wide range of spin-boson models as well as to the Fenna–Matthews–Olsen complex.},

This allows us to simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopic signals of two-mode and three-mode models of crystalline rubrene in the temperature range from 0 K to 300 K. It is demonstrated that an elevated temperature facilitates excitonic population transfer and accelerates the singlet fission process. In addition, increasing temperature leads to dramatic changes in two-dimensional spectra, thanks to temperature-dependent electronic dephasing and to an increased number of system eigenstates amenable to spectroscopic probing.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful (and the most viable) tool to compute the thermal conductivities of solid disordered materials. However, conventional classical MD fails to describe the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), so it may give inaccurate results for light materials at low temperatures. While the importance of NQE has been widely acknowledged, yet we do not have a fully reliable method to account for NQE in the MD thermal conductivity calculations. In this work, we will investigate and analyze the performances of a number of path-integral-based quantum MD methods, using ordered ice as a test case. To establish the validity of these methods, we will compare the MD results with the lattice dynamics results, in both classical and quantum limits. Through such a comparison, we will show that methods such as ring polymer MD stand as a good approach for a complex solid with short phonon lifetimes but could be problematic when describing long-living acoustic phonons. In addition, we will show that the rigid water model, which is the state-of-the-art model in the studies of ice/water systems, fails to capture most of the NQEs in ice thermal conductivity. Neglecting librational and translational NQEs leads to essential errors, which clearly demonstrates the importance of a true quantum simulation method that treats all modes at a consistent quantum level.},

  abstract = {We investigate memory effects in barrier-crossing in the overdamped setting. We focus on the scenario where the hidden degrees of freedom relax on exactly the same time scale as the observable. As a prototypical model, we analyze tagged-particle diffusion in a single file confined to a bi-stable potential. We identify the signatures of memory and explain their origin. The emerging memory is a result of the projection of collective many-body eigenmodes onto the motion of a tagged-particle. We are interested in the “confining” (all background particles in front of the tagged-particle) and “pushing” (all background particles behind the tagged-particle) scenarios for which we find non-trivial and qualitatively different relaxation behaviors. Notably and somewhat unexpectedly, at a fixed particle number, we find that the higher the barrier, the stronger the memory effects are. The fact that the external potential alters the memory is important more generally and should be taken into account in applications of generalized Langevin equations. Our results can readily be tested experimentally and may be relevant for understanding transport in biological ion-channels.},

  abstract = {Localized basis sets in the projector augmented wave formalism allow for computationally efficient calculations within density functional theory (DFT). However, achieving high numerical accuracy requires an extensive basis set, which also poses a fundamental problem for the interpretation of the results. We present a way to obtain a reduced basis set of atomic orbitals through the subdiagonalization of each atomic block of the Hamiltonian. The resulting local orbitals (LOs) inherit the information of the local crystal field. In the LO basis, it becomes apparent that the Hamiltonian is nearly block-diagonal, and we demonstrate that it is possible to keep only a subset of relevant LOs that provide an accurate description of the physics around the Fermi level. This reduces to some extent the redundancy of the original basis set, and at the same time, it allows one to perform post-processing of DFT calculations, ranging from the interpretation of electron transport to extracting effective tight-binding Hamiltonians, very efficiently and without sacrificing the accuracy of the results.},

  abstract = {Single-molecule experimental techniques track the real-time dynamics of molecules by recording a small number of experimental observables. Following these observables provides a coarse-grained, low-dimensional representation of the conformational dynamics but does not furnish an atomistic representation of the instantaneous molecular structure. Takens’s delay embedding theorem asserts that, under quite general conditions, these low-dimensional time series can contain sufficient information to reconstruct the full molecular configuration of the system up to an a priori unknown transformation. By combining Takens’s theorem with tools from statistical thermodynamics, manifold learning, artificial neural networks, and rigid graph theory, we establish an approach, Single-molecule TAkens Reconstruction, to learn this transformation and reconstruct molecular configurations from time series in experimentally measurable observables such as intramolecular distances accessible to single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We demonstrate the approach in applications to molecular dynamics simulations of a C 24 H 50 polymer chain and the artificial mini-protein chignolin. The trained models reconstruct molecular configurations from synthetic time series data in the head-to-tail molecular distances with atomistic root mean squared deviation accuracies better than 0.2 nm. This work demonstrates that it is possible to accurately reconstruct protein structures from time series in experimentally measurable observables and establishes the theoretical and algorithmic foundations to do so in applications to real experimental data.},

  abstract = {Coarse graining enables the investigation of molecular dynamics for larger systems and at longer timescales than is possible at an atomic resolution. However, a coarse graining model must be formulated such that the conclusions we draw from it are consistent with the conclusions we would draw from a model at a finer level of detail. It has been proved that a force matching scheme defines a thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained model for an atomistic system in the variational limit. Wang et al. [ACS Cent. Sci. 5 , 755 (2019)] demonstrated that the existence of such a variational limit enables the use of a supervised machine learning framework to generate a coarse-grained force field, which can then be used for simulation in the coarse-grained space. Their framework, however, requires the manual input of molecular features to machine learn the force field. In the present contribution, we build upon the advance of Wang et al. and introduce a hybrid architecture for the machine learning of coarse-grained force fields that learn their own features via a subnetwork that leverages continuous filter convolutions on a graph neural network architecture. We demonstrate that this framework succeeds at reproducing the thermodynamics for small biomolecular systems. Since the learned molecular representations are inherently transferable, the architecture presented here sets the stage for the development of machine-learned, coarse-grained force fields that are transferable across molecular systems.},

We show that in a Gibbsian description of the thermodynamics of a curved solid–liquid interface in equilibrium, the choice of the thermodynamic (rather than mechanical) pressure is required, as suggested by Tolman for the liquid–gas scenario. With this definition, the interfacial free energy is positive, and the values obtained are in excellent agreement with previous results from nucleation studies. Although, for a curved fluid–fluid interface, there is no distinction between mechanical and thermal pressures (for a sufficiently large inner phase), in the solid–liquid interface, they do not coincide, as hypothesized by Gibbs.},

  abstract = {Reported data of measured slip lengths in nanostructures span several orders of magnitude, from a few nanometers to tens of micrometers. Small roughness on surfaces caused by structural defects or thermal fluctuations dramatically reduces slippage. Tiny bubbles entrapped on rough surfaces can also affect slippage. We used an asymptotic solution and a high density-ratio pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model to systematically study the drag resistance of a rough surface with attached bubbles. As bubbles nucleate and grow, drag resistance is slightly reduced until the tri-phase contact line reaches the edges of roughness, where bubbles with small angles substantially reduce drag resistance. As bubbles grow to become a continuous gas layer on the surface, the drag resistance greatly decreases. However, the interface deformation from flat to curved shape greatly hinders liquid flow, and the vortex structures cause a wave-like fluctuation in the effective slip length. This finding sheds light on the controversies of reported large variations in the slip length of super-hydrophobic surfaces in nanostructures, e.g., carbon nanotubes.},

This is especially true in topics such as corrosion, catalysis, wetting, and many others in nature and industry. Sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy was developed for interface studies due to its high molecular selectivity and surface sensitivity, which is quite useful to study the effects of structural inhomogeneity in microscopy. Compressive sensing (CS) combined with SFG spectroscopy minimizes the imaging time while still producing quality images. Selected systems are presented here to demonstrate the capability of CS-SFG microscopy. CS-SFG microscopy successfully distinguished the static monolayer molecular mixtures, the orientations and adsorption of adsorbed molecules by the dip-coating technique, and the localized CO behaviors on polycrystalline Pt electrodes. Further discussion includes dynamic imaging as a future direction in CS-SFG microscopy. As materials and surfaces become more complex, imaging with chemical contrast becomes indispensable to understanding their performance and CS-SFG microscopy seems highly beneficial in this respect.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are an invaluable tool to characterize the dynamic motions of proteins in atomistic detail. However, the accuracy of models derived from simulations inevitably relies on the quality of the underlying force field. Here, we present an evaluation of current non-polarizable and polarizable force fields (AMBER ff14SB, CHARMM 36m, GROMOS 54A7, and Drude 2013) based on the long-standing biophysical challenge of protein folding. We quantify the thermodynamics and kinetics of the β -hairpin formation using Markov state models of the fast-folding mini-protein CLN025. Furthermore, we study the (partial) folding dynamics of two more complex systems, a villin headpiece variant and a WW domain. Surprisingly, the polarizable force field in our set, Drude 2013, consistently leads to destabilization of the native state, regardless of the secondary structure element present. All non-polarizable force fields, on the other hand, stably characterize the native state ensembles in most cases even when starting from a partially unfolded conformation. Focusing on CLN025, we find that the conformational space captured with AMBER ff14SB and CHARMM 36m is comparable, but the ensembles from CHARMM 36m simulations are clearly shifted toward disordered conformations. While the AMBER ff14SB ensemble overstabilizes the native fold, CHARMM 36m and GROMOS 54A7 ensembles both agree remarkably well with experimental state populations. In addition, GROMOS 54A7 also reproduces experimental folding times most accurately. Our results further indicate an over-stabilization of helical structures with AMBER ff14SB. Nevertheless, the presented investigations strongly imply that reliable (un)folding dynamics of small proteins can be captured in feasible computational time with current additive force fields.},

  abstract = {Bridge-mediated electron transfer (ET) between a donor and an acceptor is prototypical for the description of numerous most important ET scenarios. While multi-step ET and the interplay of sequential and direct superexchange transfer pathways in the donor–bridge–acceptor (D–B–A) model are increasingly understood, the influence of off-diagonal system–bath interactions on the transfer dynamics is less explored. Off-diagonal interactions account for the dependence of the ET coupling elements on nuclear coordinates (non-Condon effects) and are typically neglected. Here, we numerically investigate with quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral simulations the impact of off-diagonal system–environment interactions on the transfer dynamics for a wide range of scenarios in the D–B–A model. We demonstrate that off-diagonal system–environment interactions can have profound impact on the bridge-mediated ET dynamics. In the considered scenarios, the dynamics itself does not allow for a rigorous assignment of the underlying transfer mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate how off-diagonal system–environment interaction mediates anomalous localization by preventing long-time depopulation of the bridge B and how coherent transfer dynamics between donor D and acceptor A can be facilitated. The arising non-exponential short-time dynamics and coherent oscillations are interpreted within an equivalent Hamiltonian representation of a primary reaction coordinate model that reveals how the complex vibronic interplay of vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom underlying the non-Condon effects can impose donor-to-acceptor coherence transfer on short timescales.},

The properties of non-concatenated ring polymers can also be important in biological fields because ring polymers have been proven to be a good model to study DNA organization in the cell nucleus. From our previous study, linear polymers in a cylindrically confined polymer melt were found to segregate from each other as a result of the strong correlation hole effect that is enhanced by the confining surfaces. By comparison, our subsequent study of linear polymers in confined thin films at similar levels of confinements found only the onset of segregation. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the chain conformations and dynamics of ring polymers under planar (1D) confinement as a function of film thickness. Our results show that conformations of ring polymers are similar to the linear polymers under planar confinement, except that ring polymers are less compressed in the direction normal to the walls. While we find that the correlation hole effect is enhanced under confinement, it is not as pronounced as the linear polymers under 2D confinement. Finally, we show that chain dynamics far above Tg are primarily affected by the friction from walls based on the monomeric friction coefficient we get from the Rouse mode analysis.},

This transport property leads to new expressions for its long-time diffusion coefficients, which satisfy an Einstein relation with the frictions of its translational and rotational Brownian motion. Further use of the nano-rheology theory allowed us to derive also the viscoelastic modulus of the colloid from such a property. The temporal relaxation of the viscoelasticity and transport coefficient turns out to be governed by the intermediate scattering function of the colloid. We derived an explicit formula for this evolution function within a hydrodynamic theory to include rotational degrees of freedom of the particles. In the limit of short frequencies, the viscous moduli render a new expression for the static viscosity. We found that its comparison with known experiments, at low and high concentration of ferroparticles in magnetite ferrofluids, is fair. However, comparing the predicted viscoelastic moduli with computer simulations as a function of frequency yields poor agreement.},

  abstract = {Self-assembly of amphiphilic polymers in water is of fundamental and practical importance. Significant amounts of free unimers and associated micellar aggregates often coexist over a wide range of phase regions. The thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the microphase separation are closely related to the relative population density of unimers and micelles. Although the scattering technique has been employed to identify the structure of micellar aggregates as well as their time-evolution, the determination of the population ratio of micelles to unimers remains a challenging problem due to their difference in scattering power. Here, using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), we present a comprehensive structural study of amphiphilic n -dodecyl-PNIPAm polymers, which shows a bimodal size distribution in water. By adjusting the deuterium/hydrogen ratio of water, the intra-micellar polymer and water distributions are obtained from the SANS spectra. The micellar size and number density are further determined, and the population densities of micelles and unimers are calculated to quantitatively address the degree of micellization at different temperatures. Our method can be used to provide an in-depth insight into the solution properties of microphase separation, which are present in many amphiphilic systems.},

TERS results are in excellent agreement with those of confocal Raman spectroscopy and chemical analysis, determined using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, of the functionalized materials.

  abstract = {Raman spectral vibrational frequencies are used to probe the local chemical environment surrounding molecules in solution and adsorbed to gold nanostars. Herein, the impacts of functional group protonation on monosubstituted benzene derivatives with amine, carboxylic acid, or hydroxide are evaluated. Changes in binding affinity and orientation are apparent by evaluating systematic variations in vibrational frequencies. Notably, the electron donating abilities of these functional groups influence the vibrational frequency of the ring breathing mode, thus leading to improved spectral interpretation. Furthermore, gold nanostars are used to investigate the impact of molecular protonation on the adsorption of benzoic acid/benzoate to gold. The changes in molecular protonation are measured using zeta potential and the surface-sensitive technique, surface-enhanced Raman scattering. These methods reveal that pH variations induce carboxylate protonation and electron redistribution that weaken molecular affinity, thereby causing the molecule to adopt a perpendicular to parallel orientation with respect to the nanostar surface. Functional group identity influences the ring breathing mode frequency as a function of changes in electron donation from the functional group to the ring in solution as well as molecular affinity to and orientation on gold. This exploitation of vibrational frequencies facilitates the elucidation of molecule behavior in complex systems.},

We provide here an ultimate benchmark of Δ f for FG by many-body GW and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) methods. Both approaches independently arrive at Δ f ≈ 7.1 ± 0.1 eV. In addition, the Bethe–Salpeter equation enabled us to determine the first exciton binding energy, E b = 1.92 eV. We also point to the possible misinterpretation problem of the results obtained for gaps of solids by FNDMC with single-reference trial wave functions of Bloch orbitals. We argue why instead of Δ opt , in the thermodynamic limit, such an approach results in energy differences that rather correspond to Δ f , and we also outline conditions when this case actually applies.},

  abstract = {Surface nanobubbles have potential applications in the manipulation of nanoscale and biological materials, waste-water treatment, and surface cleaning. These spherically capped bubbles of gas can exist in stable diffusive equilibrium on chemically patterned or rough hydrophobic surfaces, under supersaturated conditions. Previous studies have investigated their long-term response to pressure variations, which is governed by the surrounding liquid’s local supersaturation; however, not much is known about their short-term response to rapid pressure changes, i.e., their cavitation dynamics. Here, we present molecular dynamics simulations of a surface nanobubble subjected to an external oscillating pressure field. The surface nanobubble is found to oscillate with a pinned contact line, while still retaining a mostly spherical cap shape. The amplitude–frequency response is typical of an underdamped system, with a peak amplitude near the estimated natural frequency, despite the strong viscous effects at the nanoscale. This peak is enhanced by the surface nanobubble’s high internal gas pressure, a result of the Laplace pressure. We find that accurately capturing the gas pressure, bubble volume, and pinned growth mode is important for estimating the natural frequency, and we propose a simple model for the surface nanobubble frequency response, with comparisons made to other common models for a spherical bubble, a constant contact angle surface bubble, and a bubble entrapped within a cylindrical micropore. This work reveals the initial stages of growth of cavitation nanobubbles on surfaces, common in heterogeneous nucleation, where classical models based on spherical bubble growth break down.},

This paper describes an investigation into the behavior at the interfaces in p -DSSCs, using a series of BODIPY dyes, BOD1-3 . The three dyes have different structural and electronic properties, which lead to different performances in p -DSSCs. We have applied photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy to rationalize these differences. The results show that the electronic orbitals of the dyes are appropriately aligned with the valence band of the NiO semiconductor to promote light-induced charge transfer, but charge-recombination is too fast for efficient dye regeneration by the electrolyte. We attribute this fast recombination, which limits the efficiency of the solar cells, to the electronic structure of the dye and the presence of Ni 3+ recombination sites at the NiO surface.},

Recently, we observed the intense dark exciton PL in strongly confined CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals at cryogenic temperatures, in contrast to weakly confined nanocrystals lacking dark exciton PL, which was explained by the confinement enhanced bright–dark exciton splitting. In this work, we investigated the size-dependence of the dark exciton photoluminescence properties in CsPbBr 3 and CsPbI 3 quantum dots in the strongly confined regime, showing the clear role of confinement in determining the bright–dark energy splitting (ΔE BD ) and the dark exciton lifetime (τ D ). We observe the increase in both ΔE BD and τ D with increasing quantum confinement in CsPbBr 3 and CsPbI 3 QDs, consistent with the earlier predictions on the size-dependence of ΔE BD and τ D .

In this work, we report direct dynamics simulations of atomic-nitrogen [N( 4 S)] collisions with pristine, defected, and oxidized graphene. Apart from non-reactive scattering of nitrogen atoms, various forms of nitridation of graphene were observed in our simulations. Furthermore, a number of gaseous molecules, including the experimentally observed CN molecule, have been found to desorb as a result of N-atom bombardment. These results provide a foundation for understanding the molecular beam experiment and for modeling the ablation of carbon-based TPSs and for future improvement of their properties.},

  abstract = {Although an intimate relation between entropy and diffusion has been advocated for many years and even seems to have been verified in theory and experiments, a quantitatively reliable study and any derivation of an algebraic relation between the two do not seem to exist. Here, we explore the nature of this entropy–diffusion relation in three deterministic systems where an accurate estimate of both can be carried out. We study three deterministic model systems: (a) the motion of a single point particle with constant energy in a two-dimensional periodic potential energy landscape, (b) the same in the regular Lorentz gas where a point particle with constant energy moves between collisions with hard disk scatterers, and (c) the motion of a point particle among the boxes with small apertures. These models exhibit diffusive motion in the limit where ergodicity is shown to exist. We estimate the self-diffusion coefficient of the particle by employing computer simulations and entropy by quadrature methods using Boltzmann’s formula. We observe an interesting crossover in the diffusion–entropy relation in some specific regions, which is attributed to the emergence of correlated returns. The crossover could herald a breakdown of the Rosenfeld-like exponential scaling between the two, as observed at low temperatures. Later, we modify the exponential relation to account for the correlated motions and present a detailed analysis of the dynamical entropy obtained via the Lyapunov exponent, which is rather an important quantity in the study of deterministic systems.},

The temperature T * at which stable ρ &gt; ρ S liquids emerge is ∼0.84 ϵ / k B for Lennard-Jones liquids; T * decreases (increases) rapidly with increasing (decreasing) pair-interaction range. In particular, for short-ranged potentials, T * is above the critical temperature. All liquids’ inherent structures are isostructural (isomorphic) for densities below (above) the Sastry density ρ S . Overall, our results suggest that the barriers to cavitation in most simple liquids under ambient conditions for which significant cavitation is likely to occur are primarily vibrational-energetic and entropic rather than configurational-energetic. The most likely exceptions to this rule are liquids with long-ranged pair interactions, such as alkali metals.},

This work devotes to revealing the temperature effect on the coupling transport of water and ions through a carbon nanotube by molecular dynamics simulations. A fascinating finding is that the ion flux order changes from cation &gt; anion to anion &gt; cation with the increase in field strength, leading to the same direction change of water flux. The competition between ion hydration strength and mobility should be a partial reason for this ion flux order transition. High temperatures significantly promote the transport of water and ions, stabilize the water flux direction, and enhance the critical field strength. The ion translocation time exhibits an excellent Arrhenius relation with the temperature and a power law relation with the field strength, yielding to the Langevin dynamics. However, because of self-diffusion, the water translocation time displays different behaviors without following the ions. The high temperature also leads to an abnormal maximum behavior of the ion flux, deciphered by the massive increase in water flow that inversely hinders the ion flux, suggesting the coexistence of water–ion coupling transport and competition. Our results shed deep light on the temperature dependence of coupling transport of water and ions, answering a fundamental question on the water flux direction during the ionic transport, and thus should have great implications in the design of high flux nanofluidic devices.},

The use of both 6 Li and 7 Li isotopes is helpful to identify the quadrupolar contribution to the relaxation rate. In particular, it is found that the quadrupolar interaction constitutes the strongest contribution above a concentration of ∼10 molal. The next-strongest contribution arises from interactions that scale with the square of the gyromagnetic ratio (mostly the dipolar interaction), and the experimental relaxation rates appear to be fully accounted for when these mechanisms are combined over the concentration range up to the saturation concentration. The study of solvation dynamics, particularly at high concentrations, could be of relevance for electrolyte dynamics in aqueous Li-ion rechargeable batteries.},

The geometry of Pery–PXZ (80.0°) is different from the previously reported perylene–phenothiazine dyad ( Pery–PTZ , 91.5°), although there is only one atom variation for the two dyads. Pery–PXZ shows a high singlet oxygen quantum yield (84\%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate that the charge separation (CS, faster than 120 fs) is faster than the Pery–PTZ analog (CS, 250 fs) and charge recombination (CR, i.e., SOCT-ISC, 5.98 ns) of Pery–PXZ is slower than the Pery–PTZ analog (CR, 0.9 ns). The intrinsic triplet state lifetime of Pery–PXZ is 242 µ s vs the lifetime of 181 µ s for the Pery–PTZ analog. Moreover, the triplet state lifetime of Pery–PXZ in the solid polymer matrix is extended to 4.45 ms, which indicates that the triplet state of Pery–PXZ in fluid solution is deactivated not only by the triplet–triplet annihilation effect but also by other factors such as vibration coupled relaxation. Interestingly, with pulsed laser excited time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the electron spin polarization (ESP) pattern of the triplet state of the current dyad is opposite to that of Pery–PTZ . These results demonstrated the rich electron spin chemistry of the ISC of compact electron donor/acceptor dyads, e.g., the ESP is dependent on not only the molecular geometry but also the structure of the electron donor (or acceptor).},

  abstract = {The model-potential approach previously developed by the authors to study positron interactions with molecules is used to calculate the positron binding energy for n -alkanes (C n H 2 n +2 ) and the corresponding cycloalkanes (C n H 2 n ). For n -alkanes, the dependence of the binding energy on the conformation of the molecule is investigated, with more compact structures showing greater binding energies. As a result, thermally averaged binding energies for larger alkanes ( n ≳ 9) show a strong temperature dependence in the range of 100 K–600 K. This suggests that positron resonant annihilation can be used as a probe of rotational ( trans-gauche ) isomerization of n -alkanes. In particular, the presence of different conformers leads to shifts and broadening of vibrational Feshbach resonances in the annihilation rate, as observed with a trap-based low-energy positron beam.},

The spectra show a typical energy dependence of the detachment cross section yielding a determination of the electron affinity of CN to greater precision than has previously been known at 31 163(16) cm −1 [3.864(2) eV]. Allowed s -wave detachment is observed for CN − , but the dependence of the photodetachment cross section near the threshold is perturbed by the long-range interaction between the permanent dipole moment of CN and the outgoing electron. Furthermore, we observe a temperature dependence of the cross section near the threshold, which we attribute to a reduction of the effective permanent dipole due to higher rotational excitation at higher temperatures.},

The experimentally deduced rotational constants are A = 25 934.717(21) MHz, B = 3919.8212(23) MHz, and C = 3669.530(21) MHz.

  abstract = {Recent experiments on rotational quenching of HD in the v = 1, j = 2 rovibrational state in collisions with H 2 , D 2 , and He near 1 K have revealed strong stereodynamic preference stemming from isolated shape resonances. So far, the experiments and subsequent theoretical analyses have considered the initial HD rotational state in an orientation specified by the projection quantum number m or a coherent superposition of different m states. However, it is known that such stereodynamic control is generally not effective in the ultracold energy regime due to the dominance of the incoming s -wave ( l = 0, partial wave). Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the stereodynamics of rotational quenching of HD by He with both m and m ′ resolution, where m ′ refers to the inelastically scattered HD. We show the existence of a significant m dependence in the m ′-resolved differential and integral cross sections even in the ultracold s -wave regime with a factor greater than 60 for j = 2 → j ′ = 1 and a factor greater than 1300 for j = 3 → j ′ = 2 transitions. In the helicity frame, however, the integral cross section has no initial orientation ( k ) dependence in the ultracold energy regime, even resolving with respect to the final orientation ( k ′). The distribution of final rotational state orientations ( k ′) is found to be statistical (uniform), regardless of the initial orientation.},

  abstract = {(Semi)-local density functional approximations (DFAs) suffer from self-interaction error (SIE). When the first ionization energy (IE) is computed as the negative of the highest-occupied orbital (HO) eigenvalue, DFAs notoriously underestimate them compared to quasi-particle calculations. The inaccuracy for the HO is attributed to SIE inherent in DFAs. We assessed the IE based on Perdew–Zunger self-interaction correction on 14 small to moderate-sized organic molecules relevant in organic electronics and polymer donor materials. Although self-interaction corrected DFAs were found to significantly improve the IE relative to the uncorrected DFAs, they overestimate. However, when the self-interaction correction is interiorly scaled using a function of the iso-orbital indicator z σ , only the regions where SIE is significant get a correction. We discuss these approaches and show how these methods significantly improve the description of the HO eigenvalue for the organic molecules.},

We simulate trajectories adiabatically on all nine surfaces and perform analysis on data from each surface separately and the combined set of nine. It is shown that aggregated adiabatic calculations from nine surfaces agree better with the experiment for both inelastic and exchange collisions than a previous study that used a single surface and lie within the reported experimental uncertainty at almost all points. Distributions for exchange reactions using all nine PESs are interpreted using each surface’s opacity function and activation energy for exchange. Rovibrationally resolved product distributions are then studied for a better understanding of energy relaxation in exchange collisions and may prove useful for further quasiclassical trajectory study and new experiments that use rovibrational spectroscopy to resolve the internal energy of the scattered products.},

Symmetric and asymmetric C–O stretching vibrations along with C–H/C–D stretching vibrations were characterized. Fermi interactions between the C–H stretch and likely a C–O combination band and/or the overtone of a C–H in-plane bending motion have been confirmed by deuteration. The spectra reveal a strong dependence on the monodentate or bidentate binding motif of the formate ligands. Many minima are energetically accessible on the potential energy surface through rotation of the monodentate formate ligands into several almost isoenergetic local minima. While the C–H/C–D stretching vibration is heavily influenced by the charge distribution in the cluster, the C–O vibrations are largely unaffected. The C–H stretch region is not very diagnostic due to a variety of possible Fermi resonances, which also depend on the charge distribution at the formate ligand. Deuteration yields unperturbed spectra in the C–D stretch region and reveals characteristic shifts of the C–D stretching mode for the different binding motifs, with a strong dependence of the band position on the oxidation state of the copper center. The observed bands are compared with formate adsorbed on copper surfaces from the literature.},

  abstract = {Coulomb explosion velocity-map imaging is a new and potentially universal probe for gas-phase chemical dynamics studies, capable of yielding direct information on (time-evolving) molecular structure. The approach relies on a detailed understanding of the mapping between the initial atomic positions within the molecular structure of interest and the final velocities of the fragments formed via Coulomb explosion. Comprehensive on-the-fly ab initio trajectory studies of the Coulomb explosion dynamics are presented for two prototypical small molecules, formyl chloride and cis -1,2-dichloroethene, in order to explore conditions under which reliable structural information can be extracted from fragment velocity-map images. It is shown that for low parent ion charge states, the mapping from initial atomic positions to final fragment velocities is complex and very sensitive to the parent ion charge state as well as many other experimental and simulation parameters. For high-charge states, however, the mapping is much more straightforward and dominated by Coulombic interactions (moderated, if appropriate, by the requirements of overall spin conservation). This study proposes minimum requirements for the high-charge regime, highlights the need to work in this regime in order to obtain robust structural information from fragment velocity-map images, and suggests how quantitative structural information may be extracted from experimental data.},

A comparison with multiconfigurational methods confirms that our exciton model predicts consistent energies and couplings for the pentacene dimer and captures the correct physics. Calculations of larger pentacene clusters demonstrate the computational scalability of the exciton model and suggest that the mixing between local and charge-transfer excitations narrows the gap between singlet and multiexcitonic states. Local vibrations of pentacene molecules are found to facilitate singlet–multiexcitonic state-crossing and hence are important for understanding singlet fission. The exciton model developed in this work also sets the stage for further implementation of the nuclear gradients and nonadiabatic couplings needed for first principles nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics simulations of singlet fission.},

The algorithm uses seminumerical integral techniques for evaluating Coulomb and exchange parts for a set of density matrices as occurring in standard TD-DFT or similar methods for the evaluation of vibrational frequencies. A suitable optimized de-aliasing procedure is introduced. The latter does not depend on further auxiliary quantities and retains the symmetry of a given density matrix. The algorithm is self-contained and applicable to any orbital basis set available without the need for further auxiliary basis sets or optimized de-aliasing grids. Relativistic two-component excited-state TD-DFT calculations are reported for the first time using the developed seminumerical algorithm for standard and local hybrid density functional approximations. Errors are compared with the widely used “resolution of the identity” (RI) approximations for Coulomb (RI-J) and exchange integrals (RI-K). The fully seminumerical algorithm does not exhibit an enlarged error for standard DFT functionals compared to the RI approximation. For the more involved local hybrid functionals and within strong external fields, accuracy is even considerably improved.},

  abstract = {Investigating nanoplasmonics in an explicit time-dependent perspective is a natural choice when light pulses are used and may also reveal aspects that are hidden in a frequency-based picture. In the past, we proposed a method time domain-boundary element method (TD-BEM) to simulate the time dependent polarization of nanoparticles based on a boundary element method that is particularly suitable to interface with a quantum atomistic description of nearby molecules. So far, however, metal dielectric functions in TD-BEM have been modeled through analytic expressions, such as those of Debye and Drude–Lorentz, which cannot account for multiple electronic resonances. Our approach allows us to include in the TD-BEM framework also the description of metals with complicate dielectric function profiles in the frequency domain. Particularly, among all metals, gold is a challenging case due to the presence of many transition frequencies. We applied our methods to different metals (gold, silver, and the less commonly investigated rhodium) and different shaped nanoparticles (spheres, ellipsoids, and cubes), the approach has been tested comparing TD-BEM and frequency domain BEM absorption spectra, and it has been used to investigate the time-dependent field acting locally close to nanoparticle vertices.},

  abstract = {Subsystem time-dependent density-functional theory (sTDDFT) making use of approximate non-additive kinetic energy (NAKE) functionals is known to be capable of describing excitation energy transfer processes in a variety of applications. Here, we show that sTDDFT, especially when combined with projection-based embedding (PbE), can be employed for the entire range of photo-induced electronic couplings essential for modeling photophysical properties of complex chemical and biological systems and therefore represents a complete toolbox for this class of problems. This means that it is capable of capturing the interaction/coupling associated with local- and charge-transfer (CT) excitons. However, this requires the choice of a reasonable diabatic basis. We therefore propose different diabatization strategies of the virtual orbital space in PbE-sTDDFT and show how CT excitations can be included in sTDDFT using NAKE functionals via a phenomenological approach. Finally, these electronic couplings are compared to couplings from a multistate fragment excitation difference (FED)–fragment charge difference (FCD) diabatization procedure. We show that both procedures, multistate FED–FCD and sTDDFT (with the right diabatization procedure chosen), lead to an overall good agreement for the electronic couplings, despite differences in their general diabatization strategy. We conclude that the entire range of photo-induced electronic couplings can be obtained using sTDDFT (with the right diabatization procedure chosen) in a black-box manner.},

Chem. Phys. 152 , 244112 (2020)]. The root of the order-of-limit problem of the TM functional is inherent within the interpolation function, which acts as a switch between the compact density and the slowly varying density. This paper proposes a different switch function that avoids the order-of-limit problem and correctly interpolates the compact density and the slowly varying fourth-order density correction. By circumventing the order-of-limit problem, the proposed form enhances the applicability of the original TM functional on the diverse nature of solid-state properties. Our conclusion is ensured by examining the functional in predicting properties related to general-purpose solids, quantum chemistry, and phase transition pressure. Besides, we discuss the connection between the order-of-limit problem, phase transition pressure, and bandgap of solids.},

  abstract = {While Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is in principle an exact stochastic method for ab initio electronic structure calculations, in practice, the fermionic sign problem necessitates the use of the fixed-node approximation and trial wavefunctions with approximate nodes (or zeros). This approximation introduces a variational error in the energy that potentially can be tested and systematically improved. Here, we present a computational method that produces trial wavefunctions with systematically improvable nodes for DMC calculations of periodic solids. These trial wavefunctions are efficiently generated with the configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively (CIPSI) method. A simple protocol in which both exact and approximate results for finite supercells are used to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit is introduced. This approach is illustrated in the case of the carbon diamond using Slater–Jastrow trial wavefunctions including up to one million Slater determinants. Fixed-node DMC energies obtained with such large expansions are much improved, and the fixed-node error is found to decrease monotonically and smoothly as a function of the number of determinants in the trial wavefunction, a property opening the way to a better control of this error. The cohesive energy extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit is in close agreement with the estimated experimental value. Interestingly, this is also the case at the single-determinant level, thus, indicating a very good error cancellation in carbon diamond between the bulk and atomic total fixed-node energies when using single-determinant nodes.},

Here, we propose an accurate and computationally affordable approach, based on the single-trajectory semiclassical thawed Gaussian approximation, to evaluate two-dimensional electronic spectra. Importantly, the method is exact for arbitrary harmonic potentials with mode displacement, changes in the mode frequencies, and inter-mode coupling (Duschinsky effect), but can also account partially for the anharmonicity of the involved potential energy surfaces. We test its accuracy on a set of model Morse potentials and use it to study anharmonicity and Duschinsky effects on the linear and two-dimensional electronic spectra of phenol. We find that in this molecule, the anharmonicity effects are weak, whereas the Duschinsky rotation and the changes in the mode frequencies must be included in accurate simulations. In contrast, the widely used displaced harmonic oscillator model captures only the basic physics of the problem but fails to reproduce the correct vibronic lineshape.},

In a previous study [T. Nudejima et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 024104 (2019)], the ML-EC model was constructed using the correlation energy density from all-electron calculations with basis sets including core polarization functions. In this study, we applied the frozen core approximation (FCA) to the correlation energy density to reduce the computational cost of the response variable used in machine learning. The coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] correlation energy density obtained from a grid-based energy density analysis was analyzed within FCA and correlation-consistent basis sets without core polarization functions. The complete basis set (CBS) limit of the correlation energy density was obtained using the extrapolation and composite schemes. The CCSD(T)/CBS correlation energy densities based on these schemes showed reasonable behavior, indicating its appropriateness as a response variable. As expected, the computational time was significantly reduced, especially for systems containing elements with a large number of inner-shell electrons. Based on the density-to-density relationship, a large number of data (5 662 500 points), which were accumulated from 30 molecules, were sufficient to construct the ML-EC model. The valence-electron correlation energies and reaction energies calculated using the constructed model were in good agreement with the reference values, the latter of which were superior in accuracy to density functional calculations using 71 exchange–correlation functionals. The numerical results indicate that the FCA is useful for constructing a versatile model.},

Binder and I. Burghardt, J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 204120 (2020)]. Accurate quantum dynamical simulations are performed using the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method as applied to a site-based Hamiltonian comprising 20 electronic states of Frenkel type and 460 vibrational modes, including site-local quinoid-distortion modes along with site-correlated bond-length alternation (BLA) modes, ring torsional modes, and an explicit harmonic-oscillator bath. A first-principles parameterized Frenkel–Holstein type Hamiltonian is employed, which accounts for correlations between the ring torsional modes and the anharmonically coupled BLA coordinates located at the same junction. Thermally induced fluctuations of the torsional modes are described by a stochastic mean-field approach, and their impact on the excitonic motion is characterized in terms of the exciton mean-squared displacement. A normal diffusion regime is observed under periodic boundary conditions, apart from transient localization features. Even though the polaronic exciton species are comparatively weakly bound, exciton diffusion is found to be a coherent—rather than hopping type—process, driven by the fluctuations of the soft torsional modes. Similar to the previous observations for oligothiophenes, the evolution for the most part exhibits a near-adiabatic dynamics of local exciton ground states (LEGSs) that adjust to the local conformational dynamics. However, a second mechanism, involving resonant transitions between neighboring LEGSs, gains importance at higher temperatures.},

The modified algorithm allows for the sampling of the four-component spinors of the Dirac–Coulomb(–Breit) Hamiltonian within the relativistic no-pair approximation. The loss of spin symmetry and the general requirement for complex-valued Hamiltonian matrix elements are the most immediate considerations in expanding the scope of FCIQMC into the relativistic domain, and the alternatives for their efficient implementation are motivated and demonstrated. For the canonical correlated four-component chemical benchmark application of thallium hydride, we show that the necessary modifications do not particularly adversely affect the convergence of the systematic (initiator) error to the exact correlation energy for FCIQMC calculations, which is primarily dictated by the sparsity of the wavefunction, allowing the computational effort to somewhat bypass the formal increases in Hilbert space dimension for these problems. We apply the method to the larger problem of the spectroscopic constants of tin oxide, correlating 28 electrons in 122 Kramers-paired spinors, finding good agreement with experimental and prior theoretical relativistic studies.},

Moreover, the theory shows that the molecular emission power spectra can be decomposed into the electromagnetic environment factor and lineshape function . In order to demonstrate the validity of the theory, we investigate the lineshape function in two limits. In the incoherent limit (single molecules in a vacuum), the lineshape function exactly corresponds to the Franck–Condon principle. In the coherent limit (single molecules strongly coupled with single polaritons or photons) together with the condition of high vibrational frequency, the lineshape function exhibits a Rabi splitting, the spacing of which is exactly the same as the magnitude of exciton–photon coupling estimated by our previous theory [S. Wang et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 014105 (2019)]. Finally, we explore the influence of exciton–photon and electron–phonon interactions on the lineshape function of a single molecule in a cavity. The theory shows that the vibronic structure of the lineshape function does not always disappear as the exciton–photon coupling increases, and it is related to the loss of a dielectric environment.},

First, we derive these curves from the equations of state (EOS) of the fully interacting systems, which were obtained using a combination of path integral Monte Carlo calculations at high temperature and density functional molecular dynamics simulations at lower temperatures. We then use the ideal mixing approximation at constant pressure and temperature to rederive these Hugoniot curves from the EOS tables of the individual elements. We find that the linear mixing approximation works remarkably well at temperatures above ∼2 × 10 5 K, where the shock compression ratio exceeds ∼3.2. The shape of the Hugoniot curve of each compound is well reproduced. Regions of increased shock compression, which emerge because of the ionization of L and K shell electrons, are well represented, and the maximum compression ratio of the Hugoniot curves is reproduced with high precision. Some deviations are seen near the onset of the L shell ionization regime, where ionization equilibrium in the fully interacting system cannot be well reproduced by the ideal mixing approximation. This approximation also breaks down at lower temperatures, where chemical bonds play an increasingly important role. However, the results imply that the equilibrium properties of binary and ternary mixtures in the regime of WDM can be derived from the EOS tables of the individual elements. This significantly simplifies the characterization of binary and ternary mixtures in the WDM and plasma phases, which otherwise requires large numbers of more computationally expensive first-principles computer simulations.},

This not only makes characterization of liquid dynamics difficult but also renders it highly questionable to describe liquids in these terms. In particular, the current definition of the structure of liquids by the instantaneous structure may need to be expanded because the liquid structure is inherently dynamic. Here, we advocate describing the liquid structure through the distinct-part of the Van Hove function, which can be determined by inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering measurements as well as by simulation. It depicts the dynamic correlation between atoms in space and time, starting with the instantaneous correlation function at t = 0. The observed Van Hove functions show that the atomic dynamics is strongly correlated in some liquids, such as water. The effect of atomic correlation on various transport properties of fluid, including viscosity and diffusivity, is discussed.},

  abstract = {The basic theory of sum-frequency generation (SFG) is revisited. A rigorous derivation showing that linear optical transmission and reflection at an interface result from the interference of the incident wave and induced radiation wave in a medium is presented. The derivation is extended to SFG in a medium with a finite interface layer to see how SFG evolves. Detailed description on interface vs bulk and electric dipole (ED) vs electric quadrupole (EQ) contribution to SFG are provided with essentially no model dependence, putting the theory of SFG on a solid ground and removing possible existing confusions. Electric-quadrupole contributions to SFG from the interface and bulk are discussed. It is seen that there is a relevant bulk EQ contribution intrinsically inseparable in measurement from the interface ED contribution but plays a major role among all EQ contributions; its importance relative to the ED part can only be judged by referring to the established reference cases.},

  abstract = {A method to optimize a conformational pathway through a space of well-chosen reduced variables is employed to advance our understanding of protein conformational equilibrium. The adaptively biased path optimization strategy utilizes unrestricted, enhanced sampling in the region of a path in the reduced-variable space to identify a broad path between two stable end-states. Application to the inactivation transition of the Src tyrosine kinase catalytic domain reveals new insight into this well studied conformational equilibrium. The mechanistic description gained from identifying the motions and structural features along the path includes details of the switched electrostatic network found to underpin the transition. The free energy barrier along the path results from rotation of a helix, αC, that is tightly correlated with motions in the activation loop (A-loop) as well as distal regions in the C-lobe. Path profiles of the reduced variables clearly demonstrate the strongly correlated motions. The exchange of electrostatic interactions among residues in the network is key to these interdependent motions. In addition, the increased resolution from an all-atom model in defining the path shows multiple components for the A-loop motion and that different parts of the A-loop contribute throughout the length of the path.},

  abstract = {A flexible polymer chain in the presence of inert macromolecular crowders will experience a loss of configurational entropy due to the crowder excluded volume. This entropy reduction will be most pronounced in good solvent conditions where the chain assumes an expanded coil conformation. For polymers that undergo a folding transition from a coil to a compact ordered state, as is the case for many globular proteins, macromolecular crowding is expected to stabilize the folded state and thereby shift the transition location. Here, we study such entropic stabilization effects for a tangent square-well sphere chain (monomer diameter σ ) in the presence of hard-sphere (HS) crowders (diameter D ≥ σ ). We use the Wang–Landau simulation algorithm to construct the density of states for this chain in a crowded environment and are thus able to directly compute the reduction in configurational entropy due to crowding. We study both a chain that undergoes all-or-none folding directly from the coil state and a chain that folds via a collapsed-globule intermediate state. In each case, we find an increase in entropic stabilization for the compact states with an increase in crowder density and, for fixed crowder density, with a decrease in crowder size (concentrated, small crowders have the largest effect). The crowder significantly reduces the average size for the unfolded states while having a minimal effect on the size of the folded states. In the athermal limit, our results directly provide the confinement free energy due to crowding for a HS chain in a HS solvent.},

In this work, we developed a computational tool, namely, Qsac (quadrupole susceptibility automatic calculator), to evaluate the comprehensive contributions of the dipole/quadrupole and interface/bulk in the arbitrary vibrational bands of SFG spectra. The calculations of relevant susceptibility terms are performed on the basis of the theory of energy representation using quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics simulation, which allows for semi-quantitative comparison among these terms on the same footing. We applied the Qsac to the methyl C—H stretching bands of organic molecules and found a general trend that the weak asymmetric bands are more sensitive to the bulk contribution than the symmetric ones. The phases of interface and bulk terms tend to cancel in the asymmetric band, which results in the reduced band intensity in the SFG spectra.},

Molecular dynamics simulations play a prominent role in this field since they provide a microscopic picture of the mechanisms involved. The current state-of-the-art consists of treating the electrode as a perfect conductor, precluding the possibility to analyze the effect of its metallicity on the interfacial properties. Here, we show that the Thomas–Fermi model provides a very convenient framework to account for the screening of the electric field at the interface and differentiating good metals such as gold from imperfect conductors such as graphite. All the interfacial properties are modified by screening within the metal: the capacitance decreases significantly and both the structure and dynamics of the adsorbed electrolyte are affected. The proposed model opens the door for quantitative predictions of the capacitive properties of materials for energy storage.},

This mechanistic picture is justified using a simple mean-field analysis. We find that the position of this third peak can be tuned to various surface potential values by adjusting the ambient pH of the electrolyte solution. We investigate the effect of changing the residue type and the concentration of the adsorbed peptide and of the supporting electrolyte. Varying the residue species and pH allows one to modify the capacitance profile as a function of surface potential, facilitating the design of varying discharging patterns for the capacitor.},

  abstract = {The influence of vibration mode distortion and mode mixing in the vibronic structure of molecules on the doubly resonant sum (SFG) and difference frequency generation spectroscopies is systematically studied in several examples. These phenomena modify the spectral overlap function at the heart of the modeling of the doubly resonant processes. When the visible beam is tuned, under the Franck–Condon approximation, each vibration mode generates two main peaks corresponding to the resonance of the molecular electronic transition with the visible and SFG energies, together with higher order ones driven by the amplitudes of the vibronic displacements. For a single mode system, mode distortion modifies the positions of the main peaks and the excitations of the higher order ones. For a two-mode system, mode mixing induces in addition a deep change in the balance between the intensities of the mixed modes. It also changes the phases of the vibrations, which makes curve fitting difficult. For multimode systems, mode mixing may greatly enhance intensity of a poorly active mode. For all these reasons, it seems mandatory to take mode distortion and mode mixing into account for an accurate analysis of second-order nonlinear spectroscopic experimental data.},

The excitation spectra of vibrations in SFG and DFG experiments are calculated in integral form for arbitrary mode distortions and small amplitude mode mixing between pairs of modes. Mode distortion modifies all orders of vibronic coupling including the fundamental process, whereas mode mixing appears as a perturbation added to the distorted mode case.

Phys. 2 , 70 (2019)], we find that the phase behavior of polydisperse hard-disk systems with lognormal and triangle distributions is significantly different. In polydisperse hard-disk systems of lognormal distributions, although the phase diagram appears similar to that of Gaussian-like polydisperse hard disks, the re-entrant melting of the hexatic or solid phase cannot be observed in sedimentation experiments. For polydisperse hard-disk systems of triangle distributions, the phase behavior is qualitatively different from the Gaussian-like and lognormal distributions, and we cannot reach any system of true polydispersity larger than 0.06, which is due to the special shape of the triangle distribution. Our results suggest that the exact particle size distribution is of primary importance in determining the phase behavior of polydisperse hard disks, and we do not have a universal phase diagram for different polydisperse hard-disk systems.},

The remarkable role of co-operative pentavalent phosphorus bonding in the stabilization of the structure dictated by hydrogen bonding is deciphered. The complete potential energy surface of the heterodimer was scanned by ab initio and density functional theory computational methodologies. The hydrogen bond between the phosphoryl oxygen of POCl 3 and C—H group of CHCl 3 in heterodimers induces a blue-shift in the C—H stretching frequency within the Ne matrix. However, in Ar and Kr matrixes, the C—H stretching frequency is exceptionally red-shifted in stark contrast with Ne. The plausibility of the Fermi resonance by the C—H stretching vibrational mode with higher order modes in the heterodimers has been eliminated as a possible cause within Ar and Kr matrixes by isotopic substitution (CDCl 3 ) experiments. To evaluate the influence of matrixes as a possible cause of red-shift, self-consistent Iso-density polarized continuum reaction field model was applied. This conveyed the important role of the dielectric matrixes in inducing the fascinating vibrational shift from blue (Ne) to red (Ar and Kr) due to the matrix specific transmutation of the POCl 3 —CHCl 3 structure. The heterodimer produced in the Ne matrix possesses a cyclic structure stabilized by hydrogen bonding with co-operative phosphorus bonding, while in Ar and Kr the generation of an acyclic open structure stabilized solely by hydrogen bonding is promoted. Compelling justification regarding the dispersion force based influence of matrix environments in addition to the well-known dielectric influence is presented.},

Coupled cluster theory at the coupled cluster singles doubles triples level with very large correlation-consistent basis sets with extended diffuse functions has been used to predict the polarizabilities of the atomic neutrals, mono-cations and mono-anions with a noble gas configuration. Additional corrections for scalar relativistic and spin–orbit effects were also included for the electron configurations of Kr, Xe, and Rn. The results are in excellent agreement with experiment or with other high level calculations where available. The current results for most of these species represent the best available values for the polarizabilities. The results show that the polarizability of H − is very difficult to calculate without extremely diffuse functions. The polarizability of H − is the largest value, 34.05 Å 3 , calculated for all species in the current study. The polarizabilities of the remaining halogen anions are also the best available values. The polarizabilities of the halogen anions (excluding F − ) and H − have a linear correlation with the electron affinity of the neutral atom. Spin–orbit effects, even for closed shell species, cannot be ignored for quantitative accuracy, and the inclusion of spin–orbit effects for Fr + , Rn, and At − increases the polarizability by 4\%, 6\%, and 15\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Electron–phonon interaction strongly affects and often limits charge transport in organic semiconductors (OSs). However, approaches to its experimental probing are still in their infancy. In this study, we probe the local electron–phonon interaction (quantified by the charge-transfer reorganization energy) in small-molecule OSs by means of Raman spectroscopy. Applying density functional theory calculations to four series of oligomeric OSs—polyenes, oligofurans, oligoacenes, and heteroacenes—we extend the previous evidence that the intense Raman vibrational modes considerably contribute to the reorganization energy in several molecules and molecular charge-transfer complexes, to a broader scope of OSs. The correlation between the contribution of the vibrational mode to the reorganization energy and its Raman intensity is especially prominent for the resonance conditions. The experimental Raman spectra obtained with various excitation wavelengths are in good agreement with the theoretical ones, indicating the reliability of our calculations. We also establish for the first time relations between the spectrally integrated Raman intensity, the reorganization energy, and the molecular polarizability for the resonance and off-resonance conditions. The results obtained are expected to facilitate the experimental studies of the electron–phonon interaction in OSs for an improved understanding of charge transport in these materials.},

  abstract = {The form of the electron density change (or difference) is usable as a kind of fingerprint of the electronic structural origin or mechanism that gives rise to intermolecular interactions. Here, this method is applied to halogen-bonding brominated systems to dissect the electric quadrupolar effect (arising from the anisotropic distribution of the valence electrons and intrinsic to the s 2 p x 2 p y 2 p z electronic configuration) and the polarization effect (induced by a partial negative charge of the halogen-bond accepting atom). It is shown that a suitable location of the “extra point” for placing a partial positive charge to represent the former is crucial and is clearly found from the electron density difference from the spherically isotropic Br − ion, while the latter consists of the dipolar polarization of the Br atom and the delocalized polarization of the whole molecule. A practical way for application to molecular dynamics simulations, etc., to represent these two factors is discussed.},

The spin–orbit (SO) coupling effect on the collision process of the F + H 2 reaction has been included as a perturbation to the non-relativistic electronic Hamiltonian. Adiabatic PESs and NACTs for the lowest three electronic states (1 2 A ′, 2 2 A ′, and 1 2 A ″) are determined in hyperspherical coordinates as functions of hyperangles for a grid of fixed values of the hyperradius. Jahn–Teller (JT) type conical intersections between the two A ′ states translate along C 2 v and linear geometries in F + H 2 . In addition, A ′ and A ″ states undergo Renner–Teller (RT) interaction at collinear configurations of this system. Both JT and RT couplings are validated by integrating NACTs along properly chosen contours. Subsequently, we have solved adiabatic-to-diabatic transformation (ADT) equations to evaluate the ADT angles for constructing the diabatic potential matrix of F + H 2 , including the SO coupling terms. The newly calculated diabatic PESs are found to be smooth, single-valued, continuous, and symmetric and can be invoked for performing accurate scattering calculations on the F + H 2 system.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulations are widely applied in the study of chemical and bio-physical problems. However, the accessible timescales of atomistic simulations are limited, and extracting equilibrium properties of systems containing rare events remains challenging. Two distinct strategies are usually adopted in this regard: either sticking to the atomistic level and performing enhanced sampling or trading details for speed by leveraging coarse-grained models. Although both strategies are promising, either of them, if adopted individually, exhibits severe limitations. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning approach to ally both strategies so that simulations on different scales can benefit mutually from their crosstalks: Accurate coarse-grained (CG) models can be inferred from the fine-grained (FG) simulations through deep generative learning; in turn, FG simulations can be boosted by the guidance of CG models via deep reinforcement learning. Our method defines a variational and adaptive training objective, which allows end-to-end training of parametric molecular models using deep neural networks. Through multiple experiments, we show that our method is efficient and flexible and performs well on challenging chemical and bio-molecular systems.},

We simulated the signals of three widely used techniques: time- and frequency-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, transient absorption pump–probe spectroscopy, and electronic two-dimensional spectroscopy. The signals were calculated through third-order response functions, which, in turn, were evaluated with the numerically accurate multiple Davydov ansatz. We establish spectroscopic signatures of the optically dark A u state and demonstrate that the key features of the photoinduced dynamics, such as electronic/nuclear populations, electronic/nuclear coherences, and electronic/nuclear energy transfer processes, are imprinted in the spectroscopic signals. We show that a fairly complete picture of the nonadiabatic dynamics at conical intersections can be obtained when several spectroscopic techniques are combined. Provided that the time resolution is sufficient, time- and frequency-resolved fluorescence may provide the best visualization of the nonadiabatic dynamics near conical intersections.},

  abstract = {Trajectory surface hopping simulations of photochemical reactions are a powerful and increasingly important tool to unravel complex photochemical reactivity. Within surface hopping, electronic transitions are mimicked by stochastic hops between electronic potential surfaces. Thus, statistical sampling is an inescapable component of trajectory-surface-hopping-based nonadiabatic molecular dynamics methods. However, the standard sampling strategy inhibits computational reproducibility, limits predictability, and results in trajectories that are overly sensitive to numerical parameters like the time step. We describe an equivalent approach to sampling electronic transitions within fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) in which hops are decided in terms of the cumulative probability (FSSH-c) as opposed to the usual prescription, which is in terms of the instantaneous conditional probability (FSSH-i). FSSH-c is statistically equivalent to FSSH-i and can be implemented from trivial modifications to an existing surface hopping algorithm but has several key advantages: (i) a single trajectory is fully specified by just a handful of random numbers, (ii) all hopping decisions are independent of the time step such that the convergence behavior of individual trajectories can be explored, and (iii) alternative integral-based sampling schemes are enabled. In addition, we show that the conventional hopping probability overestimates the hopping rate and propose a simple scaling correction as a fix. Finally, we demonstrate these advantages numerically on model scattering problems.},

A biorthogonal second quantization formulation of many-mode dynamics is introduced, allowing separate biorthogonal bases for the bra and ket states, thus ensuring complex analyticity. We employ the time-dependent bivariational principle to derive equations of motion for both the one-mode basis functions and the parameters describing the cluster ( T ) and linear de-excitation ( L ) operators. The choice of constraint (or gauge) operators for the modal time evolution is discussed. In the case of untruncated cluster expansion, the result is independent of this choice, but restricting the excitation space removes this invariance; equations for the variational determination of the constraint operators are derived for the latter case. We show that all single-excitation parts of T and L are redundant and can be left out in the case of variationally determined constraint-operator evolution. Based on a pilot implementation, test computations on Henon–Heiles model systems, the water molecule, and a reduced-dimensionality bi-thiophene model are presented, showing highly encouraging results for TDMVCC. It is demonstrated how TDMVCC in the limit of a complete cluster expansion becomes equivalent to multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree for the same active-space size. Similarly, it is discussed how TDMVCC generally gives better and more stable results than its time-independent-modals counterpart, while equivalent results are obtained for complete expansions and full one-mode basis sets.},

In particular, we combine here short-range exchange-correlation functionals with a flavor of selected configuration interaction known as configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively (CIPSI), a scheme that we label RS-DFT-CIPSI. One of the take-home messages of the present study is that RS-DFT-CIPSI trial wave functions yield lower fixed-node energies with more compact multi-determinant expansions than CIPSI, especially for small basis sets. Indeed, as the CIPSI component of RS-DFT-CIPSI is relieved from describing the short-range part of the correlation hole around the electron–electron coalescence points, the number of determinants in the trial wave function required to reach a given accuracy is significantly reduced as compared to a conventional CIPSI calculation. Importantly, by performing various numerical experiments, we evidence that the RS-DFT scheme essentially plays the role of a simple Jastrow factor by mimicking short-range correlation effects, hence avoiding the burden of performing a stochastic optimization. Considering the 55 atomization energies of the Gaussian-1 benchmark set of molecules, we show that using a fixed value of μ = 0.5 bohr −1 provides effective error cancellations as well as compact trial wave functions, making the present method a good candidate for the accurate description of large chemical systems.},

Docking is the state-of-the-art computational method to identify ice-binding surfaces (IBS). However, docking methods require a priori knowledge of the ice plane to which the molecules bind and either neglect the competition of ice and water for the IBS or are computationally expensive. Here we present and validate a robust methodology for the identification of the IBS of molecules and crystals that is easy to implement and a hundred times computationally more efficient than the most advanced ice-docking approaches. The methodology is based on biased sampling with an order parameter that drives the formation of ice. We validate the method using all-atom and coarse-grained models of organic crystals and proteins. To our knowledge, this approach is the first to simultaneously identify the ice-binding surface as well as the plane of ice to which it binds, without the use of structure search algorithms. We show that biased simulations even identify surfaces that are too small or too weak to heterogeneously nucleate ice. The biasing simulations can be used to identify of IBS of antifreeze and ice nucleating proteins and to equilibrate ice seeds bound to an IBS for the calculation of heterogeneous ice nucleation rates using classical nucleation theory.},

By comparing the absorption spectra between a conical intersection model and the multimode Brownian oscillator model, the optimal system–bath coupling parameter of η = 0.2 is determined, and ensuing population dynamics of the S1 state is found to concur with a previously proposed coherent singlet fission mechanism. We further simulate the two-dimensional spectra to reveal the wavepacket dynamics on both excited state and ground state potential energy surfaces. It is demonstrated that the wavepacket motion of tuning modes plays a significant role in the evolution of two-dimensional spectra.},

  abstract = {One means for describing electron transport across single molecule tunnel junctions (MTJs) is to use density functional theory (DFT) in conjunction with a nonequilibrium Green’s function formalism. This description relies on interpreting solutions to the Kohn–Sham (KS) equations used to solve the DFT problem as quasiparticle (QP) states. Many practical DFT implementations suffer from electron self-interaction errors and an inability to treat charge image potentials for molecules near metal surfaces. For MTJs, the overall effect of these errors is typically manifested as an overestimation of electronic currents. Correcting KS energies for self-interaction and image potential errors results in MTJ current–voltage characteristics in close agreement with measured currents. An alternative transport approach foregoes a QP picture and solves for a many-electron wavefunction on the MTJ subject to open system boundary conditions. It is demonstrated that this many-electron method provides similar results to the corrected QP picture for electronic current. The analysis of these two distinct approaches is related through corrections to a junction’s electronic structure beyond the KS energies for the case of a benzene diamine molecule bonded between two gold electrodes.},

  abstract = {Full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) is a stochastic approach for finding the ground state of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian. It is based on the dynamical evolution of a walker population in Hilbert space, which samples the ground state configuration vector over many iterations. Here, we present a modification of the original protocol for walker population control of Booth et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 131 , 054106 (2009)] in order to achieve equilibration at a pre-defined average walker number and to avoid walker number overshoots. The dynamics of the walker population is described by a noisy damped harmonic oscillator and controlled by two parameters responsible for damping and forcing, respectively, for which reasonable values are suggested. We further introduce a population growth witness that can be used to detect annihilation plateaus related to overcoming the FCIQMC sign problem. Features of the new population control procedure such as precise walker number control and fast equilibration are demonstrated. The standard error of the shift estimator for the ground state energy as well as the population control bias is found to be unaffected by the population control procedure or its parameters. The improved control of the walker number, and thereby memory consumption, is a desirable feature required for automating FCIQMC calculations and requires minimal modifications to the existing code.},

Møller operators, which play a fundamental role in quantum scattering theory, do not appear in his formulation based on action-angle coordinates. These operators were introduced much later by Garashchuk and Light [J. Chem. Phys. 114 , 1060 (2001)] in SC-IVR calculations performed in Cartesian coordinates within the Tannor and Weeks [J. Chem.

The purpose of this work is to show within a simple model of light-induced rotational transitions that, in fact, Møller operators were already underlying Miller’s pioneering formulation. In line with the results of Garashchuk and Light [J. Chem. Phys. 114 , 1060 (2001)], removing the action of these operators in Miller’s theory strongly decreases its numerical efficiency.},

Here, we focus on thermal junctions with a molecule bridging two solids that are maintained at different temperatures. The classical steady state heat current in this system can be simulated in different ways, either at the interfaces with the solids, which are represented by thermostats, or between atoms within the conducting molecule. We show that while the latter, intramolecular definition feasibly converges to the correct limit, the molecule–thermostat interface definition is more challenging to converge to the correct result. The problem with the interface definition is demonstrated by simulating heat transport in harmonic and anharmonic one-dimensional chains illustrating unphysical effects such as thermal rectification in harmonic junctions.},

Furthermore, the excellent spatial and temporal resolution as well as the capacity of molecular recognition of these methods help in obtaining rich information of charged macromolecules. This paper summarizes the applications of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy, especially fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and photon counting histogram, in the studies on charged macromolecules in aqueous solutions and plenty of new information has been revealed on the molecular conformation, counterion distribution, and a few important governing factors. The powerfulness and effectiveness of single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy make it promising in the investigations of charged macromolecules.},

All dynamic processes are influenced by the local environment, so it is of fundamental and practical value to understand the structure of the environment and the dynamics with nanoscale resolution. Most techniques for measuring dynamic processes have microscopic spatial resolution and can only measure the average behavior of a large ensemble of sites within their sampling volumes. Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a powerful tool for overcoming this limitation due to its combination of high chemical specificity and spatial resolution that is on the nanometer scale. Adapting it for the study of dynamic systems remains a work in progress, but the increasing sophistication of TERS is making such studies more routine, and there are now growing efforts to use TERS to examine more complex processes. This Perspective aims to promote development in this area of research by highlighting recent progress in using TERS to understand reacting and dynamic systems, ranging from simple model reactions to complex processes with practical applications. We discuss the unique challenges and opportunities that TERS presents for future studies.},

We are specifically concerned with the effect of e–ph interaction on the coherence of the ET process and how to model the interaction of DNA with phonon reservoirs of biological relevance. We assume that the electron bearing orbitals are half filled and derive the physics of e–ph coupling in the vicinity in reciprocal space. We find that at half filling, the acoustical modes are decoupled to ET at first order, while optical modes are predominant. The latter are associated with inter-strand vibrational modes in consistency with previous studies involving polaron models of ET. Coupling to acoustic modes depends on electron doping of DNA, while optical modes are always coupled within our model. Our results yield e–ph coupling consistent with estimates in the literature, and we conclude that large polarons are the main result of such e–ph interactions. This scenario will have strong consequences on decoherence of ET under physiological conditions due to relative isolation from thermal equilibration of the ET mechanism.},

It is found that the ultra-long tail of the ULCFA flips between two leaflets and fluctuates among an elongation into the opposite leaflet, lies between two leaflets, and turns back. As the number ratio of lipids in the opposite leaflet increases, the ratio of the elongated shape linearly decreases in all three cases. Thus, ULCFAs can sense the density differences between the two leaflets and respond to these changes.},

  abstract = {The low thermal conductance of polymers is one of the major drawbacks for many polymer-based products. However, a single polymer chain when stretched can have high thermal conductivities. We use non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to study the steady-state thermal conductance along finite macromolecules under mechanical control of the end-to-end distance. We find that the nature of heat transport along such chains strongly depends on mechanical tuning, leading to significantly different heat conductions and temperature profiles along the chain in the compressed-chain and stretched-chain limits. This transition between modes of behaviors appears to be a threshold phenomenon: at relatively small end-to-end distances, the thermal conductance remains almost constant as one stretches the polymer chain. At given critical end-to-end distances, thermal conductances start to increase, reaching the fully extended chain values. Correlated with this behavior are two observations: first, the temperature bias falls mostly at contacts in the fully stretched chain, while part of it falls along the molecule in the compressed limit. Second, the heat conduction does not change significantly with the chain length in the stretched-chain limit but decreases dramatically when this length increases in the compressed molecule. This suggests that heat transfer along stretched chains is mostly ballistic, while in the compressed chain, heat is transferred by diffusive mechanisms. Significantly, these trends persist also for a large range of molecular structures and force fields, and the changing behavior correlates well with mode localization properties. Similar studies conducted with disordered chains and bundles of several chains show remnants of the same behavior.},

  abstract = {Understanding the impact of inter-molecular orientation on the optical properties of organic semiconductors is important for designing next-generation organic (opto)electronic and photonic devices. However, fundamental aspects of how various features of molecular packing in crystalline systems determine the nature and dynamics of excitons have been a subject of debate. Toward this end, we present a systematic study of how various molecular crystal packing motifs affect the optical properties of a class of high-performance organic semiconductors: functionalized derivatives of fluorinated anthradithiophene. The absorptive and emissive species present in three such derivatives (exhibiting “brickwork,” “twisted-columnar,” and “sandwich-herringbone” motifs, controlled by the side group R) were analyzed both in solution and in single crystals, using various modalities of optical and photoluminescence spectroscopy, revealing the nature of these excited states. In solution, in the emission band, two states were identified: a Franck–Condon state present at all concentrations and an excimer that emerged at higher concentrations. In single crystal systems, together with ab initio calculations, it was found in the absorptive band that Frenkel and Charge Transfer (CT) excitons mixed due to nonvanishing CT integrals in all derivatives, but the amount of admixture and exciton delocalization depended on the packing, with the “sandwich-herringbone” packing motif least conducive to delocalization. Three emissive species in the crystal phase were also identified: Frenkel excitons, entangled triplet pairs 1 (TT) (which are precursors to forming free triplet states via singlet fission), and self-trapped excitons (STEs, similar in origin to excimers present in concentrated solution). The “twisted-columnar” packing motif was most conducive to the formation of Frenkel excitons delocalized over 4–7 molecules depending on the temperature. These delocalized Frenkel states were dominant across the full temperature range (78 K–293 K), though at lower temperatures, the entangled triplet states and STEs were present. In the derivative with the “brickwork” packing, all three emissive species were observed across the full temperature range and, most notably, the 1 (TT) state was present at room temperature. Finally, the derivative with the “sandwich-herringbone” packing exhibited localized Frenkel excitons and had a strong propensity for self-trapped exciton formation even at higher temperatures. In this derivative, no formation of the 1 (TT) state was observed. The temperature-dependent dynamics of these emissive states are reported, as well as their origin in fundamental inter-molecular interactions.},

  abstract = {The polarized interface between two immiscible liquids plays a central role in many technological processes. In particular, for electroanalytical and ion extraction applications, an external electric field is typically used to selectively induce the transfer of ionic species across the interfaces. Given that it is experimentally challenging to obtain an atomistic insight into the ion transfer process and the structure of liquid–liquid interfaces, atomistic simulations have often been used to fill this knowledge gap. However, due to the long-range nature of the electrostatic interactions and the use of 3D periodic boundary conditions, the use of external electric fields in molecular dynamics simulations requires special care. Here, we show how the simulation setup affects the dielectric response of the materials and demonstrate how by a careful design of the system it is possible to obtain the correct electric field on both sides of a liquid–liquid interface when using standard 3D Ewald summation methods. In order to prove the robustness of our approach, we ran extensive molecular dynamics simulations with a rigid-ion and polarizable force field of the water/1,2-dichloroethane interface in the presence of weak external electric fields.},

  abstract = {The quantitative role of entropy in the surface diffusion of molecules with many degrees of freedom is still not well understood. Here, we quantify entropic diffusion barriers as well as attempt frequencies by performing a systematic decomposition of the Arrhenius equation for single oligophenyl molecules of various lengths (two to six phenyl rings and benzene as the reference) on an amorphous silica surface using extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Attempt frequencies evaluated from velocity auto-correlation functions are found close to k B T / h , the frequency factor of transition state theory. Importantly, we find large positive entropy contributions to the free energy barrier of diffusion up to 55\%, increasing with molecular length with 4.1 kJ/mol/phenyl ring. The entropic barrier is about 40\%–60\% of the entropy of the molecule surface adsorption free energy, revealing that at the transition states, the molecules can liberate a major part of their conformational states, increasing with length. The substantial role of the internal degrees of freedom for the diffusive dynamics is explicitly demonstrated by studying internally constrained, “rigid” version of the molecules. Finally, we discuss also rotational diffusion and the role of surface vibrations. Our results affirm that it is essential for quantitative studies and interpretation of surface diffusion of complex molecules to consider internal entropic effects.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to understand the fracture mechanisms in the lithium manganese oxide (LiMn 2 O 4 ) electrode at the molecular level by studying mechanical properties of the material at different values of the State of Charge (SOC) using the principles of molecular dynamics (MD). A 2 × 2 × 2 cubic structure of the LiMn 2 O 4 unit cell containing eight lithium ions, eight trivalent manganese ions, eight tetravalent manganese ions, and 32 oxygen ions is studied using a large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator. As part of the model validation, the lattice parameter and volume changes of Li x Mn 2 O 4 as a function of SOC (0 &lt; x &lt; 1) have been studied and validated with respect to the experimental data. This validated model has been used for a parametric study involving the SOC value, strain rate (charge and discharge rate), and temperature. The MD simulations suggest that the lattice constant varies from 8.042 Å to 8.235 Å during a full discharging cycle, in agreement with the experimental data. The material at higher SOC shows more ductile behavior compared to low SOC values. Furthermore, yield and ultimate stresses are less at lower SOC values except when SOC values are within 0.125 and 0.375, verifying the phase transformation theory in this range. The strain rate does not affect the fully intercalated material significantly but seems to influence the material properties of the partially charged electrode. Finally, a study of the effect of temperature suggests that diffusion coefficient values for both high and low-temperature zones follow an Arrhenius profile, and the results are successfully explained using the vacancy diffusion mechanism.},

  abstract = {We prepared triplet–triplet annihilation photon upconverters combining thin-film methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite with a rubrene annihilator in a bilayer structure. Excitation of the perovskite film leads to delayed, upconverted photoluminescence emitted from the annihilator layer, with triplet excitation of the rubrene being driven by carriers excited in the perovskite layer. To better understand the connections between the semiconductor properties of the perovskite film and the upconversion efficiency, we deliberately varied the perovskite film properties by modifying two spin-coating conditions, namely, the choice of antisolvent and the antisolvent dripping time, and then studied the resulting photon upconversion performance with a standard annihilator layer. A stronger upconversion effect was exhibited when the perovskite films displayed brighter and more uniform photoluminescence. Both properties were sensitive to the antisolvent dripping time and were maximized for a dripping time of 20 s (measured relative to the end of the spin-coating program). Surprisingly, the choice of antisolvent had a significant effect on the upconversion performance, with anisole-treated films yielding on average a tenfold increase in upconversion intensity compared to the chlorobenzene-treated equivalent. This performance difference was correlated with the carrier lifetime in the perovskite film, which was 52 ns and 306 ns in the brightest chlorobenzene and anisole-treated films, respectively. Since the bulk properties of the anisole- and chlorobenzene-treated films were virtually identical, we concluded that differences in the defect density at the MAPI/rubrene interface, linked to the choice of antisolvent, must be responsible for the differing upconversion performance.},

  abstract = {Rare earth oxides are attracting increasing interest as a relatively unexplored group of materials with potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis; therefore, a credible and universal computational approach is needed for modeling their reactivity. In this work, we systematically assessed the performance of the PBE+U method against the results of the hybrid HSE06 method with respect to the description of structural parameters and energetic properties of the selected hexagonal lanthanide sesquioxides and the cubic fluorite-type cerium dioxide. In addition, we evaluated the performance of PBE+U in describing the electronic structure and adsorption properties of the CeO 2 (111) and Nd 2 O 3 (0001) surfaces. The HSE06 method reproduces rather well the lattice parameters and selected energetic properties with respect to the experimental values. The PBE+U method is able to reproduce the results of HSE06 or the experimental values only if the U parameter is selected from an appropriate range of values. The U value around 3 eV gives the best description of the lattice parameters of most bulk oxides. 2 eV–3 eV is also found to be the optimal range of U for the reaction energies of bulk La 2 O 3 , Ce 2 O 3 , Nd 2 O 3 , Er 2 O 3 , and Ho 2 O 3 . U = 1 eV gives the best results for Pr 2 O 3 , Pm 2 O 3 , Eu 2 O 3 , Tm 2 O 3 , and Lu 2 O 3 , whereas Gd 2 O 3 could not be accurately described by the PBE+U method. The U values (∼3 eV) found optimal for most bulk oxides also work well in the calculations of adsorption of small molecules on Nd 2 O 3 (0001) and CeO 2 (111), although larger U values are required to obtain sufficient localization of 4 f electrons.},

For charged surfaces in contact with an electrolyte solution, an obvious example is the density profile of ions along the direction normal to the surface. Here, we demonstrate that, in the slab geometry typically used in simulations, imposing an electric displacement field D determines the integrated surface charge density of adsorbed ions at charged interfaces. This allows us to obtain macroscopic surface charge densities irrespective of the slab thickness used in our simulations. We also show that the commonly used Yeh–Berkowitz method and the “mirrored slab” geometry both impose vanishing integrated surface charge densities. We present results both for relatively simple rocksalt (1 1 1) interfaces and the more complex case of kaolinite’s basal faces in contact with an aqueous electrolyte solution.},

Understanding and tuning the optical and electronic properties of NPLs in a plasmonic environment is a new paradigm in the field of optoelectronics. Here, we report on the resonant plasmon enhancement of light emission including Raman scattering and photoluminescence from colloidal CdSe/CdS nanoplatelets deposited on arrays of Au nanodisks fabricated by electron beam lithography. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Au nanodisk arrays can be tuned by varying the diameter of the disks. In the case of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the Raman intensity profile follows a symmetric Gaussian shape matching the LSPR of the Au nanodisk arrays. The surface-enhanced photoluminescence (SEPL) profile of NPLs, however, follows an asymmetric Gaussian distribution highlighting a compromise between the excitation and emission enhancement mechanisms originating from energy transfer and Purcell effects. The SERS and SEPL enhancement factors depend on the nanodisk size and reach maximal values at 75 and 7, respectively, for the sizes, for which the LSPR energy of Au nanodisks coincides with interband transition energies in the semiconductor platelets. Finally, to explain the origin of the resonant enhancement behavior of SERS and SEPL, we apply a numerical simulation to calculate plasmon energies in Au nanodisk arrays and emission spectra from NPLs in such a plasmonic environment.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer in electrocatalysis involves strong short-range electronic interactions and occurs in an electrochemical double layer. Describing the two elements on an equal footing is an essential but challenging task for theoretical electrocatalysis. This work addresses this challenge using a mixed quantum–classical treatment. This treatment features the combination of chemisorption theory, electron transfer theory, and double layer theory in a unifying framework. Electrostatic free energy terms and solvent reorganization energy, key parameters modulating the electron transfer process, are calculated from a three-dimensional continuum double layer model that considers the reactant structure, steric effect, and solvent orientational polarization. The presented model is reduced back to the Marcus theory by neglecting electronic interactions and to the Schmickler theory of electrocatalysis by neglecting double layer effects. Emphasis is placed on understanding the multifaceted double layer effects in electrocatalysis. Apart from modifying the driving force and reactant concentration that are considered in the Frumkin corrections, double layer effects also modulate the interfacial solvent reorganization energy, thus adding a new term to the transfer coefficient. An additional level of intricacy comes into play if the reactant zone needs to replace solvent molecules originally adsorbed on the metal surface when it approaches the metal surface. The resulting free energy penalty shifts the transition state away from the metal surface and thus increases the activation barrier. Understanding how the metal surface charging condition modulates the interfacial stiffness opens an additional channel of deciphering electrolyte effects in electrocatalysis.},

  abstract = {We develop a stochastic theory that treats time-dependent exciton–exciton s -wave scattering and that accounts for dynamic Coulomb screening, which we describe within a mean-field limit. With this theory, we model excitation-induced dephasing effects on time-resolved two-dimensional coherent optical lineshapes and we identify a number of features that can be attributed to the many-body dynamics occurring in the background of the exciton, including dynamic line narrowing, mixing of real and imaginary spectral components, and multi-quantum states. We test the model by means of multidimensional coherent spectroscopy on a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor that hosts tightly bound excitons and biexcitons that feature strong polaronic character. We find that the exciton nonlinear coherent lineshape reflects many-body correlations that give rise to excitation-induced dephasing. Furthermore, we observe that the exciton lineshape evolves with the population time over time windows in which the population itself is static in a manner that reveals the evolution of the multi-exciton many-body couplings. Specifically, the dephasing dynamics slow down with time, at a rate that is governed by the strength of exciton many-body interactions and on the dynamic Coulomb screening potential. The real part of the coherent optical lineshape displays strong dispersive character at zero time, which transforms to an absorptive lineshape on the dissipation timescale of excitation-induced dephasing effects, while the imaginary part displays converse behavior. Our microscopic theoretical approach is sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide exploration of how system-bath dynamics contribute to linear and non-linear time-resolved spectral behavior.},

  abstract = {Methylglyoxal (MG)—an atmospherically important α-dicarbonyl implicated in aqueous-phase secondary organic aerosol formation—is known to be surface-active. Due to the presence of carbonyl moieties, MG can hydrate to form geminal diols in solution. Recently, it has been shown that MG exists predominantly as a monohydrate at the neat air–water interface. However, inorganic aerosol constituents have the potential to “salt-out” MG to the interface, shift its hydration equilibria, and catalyze self- and cross-oligomerization reactions. Here, we study the influence of the non-reactive salt, sodium chloride (NaCl), on the MG’s surface adsorption and hydration state using vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy. The presence of NaCl is found to enhance MG’s surface activity but not to the extent that water is fully excluded from the interface. Perturbations in the interfacial water structure are attributed to shifts in MG’s hydration equilibrium at higher ionic strengths. Evidence of surface-active MG oligomer species is presented, but such oligomers are not thought to contribute significantly to the interfacial population. This work builds on the published studies on MG in pure water and gives insight into the interface’s perturbation by NaCl, which has important implications for understanding MG’s atmospheric fate.},

The wetting–dewetting nature of reline has been investigated by analyzing simulated contact angles formed by its nanodroplets on the carbon sheets. Through this investigation, we find that at the lowest DES–sheet interaction strength, the contact angle formed by the reline nanodroplet on the carbon surface exceeds 150°, indicating that the surface is supersolvophobic. On the other hand, at the higher interaction potentials, reline DES wets the surface of the sheets, forming an adlayer primarily consisting of urea molecules. The choline cation and urea molecules are observed to exhibit stronger interactions with the carbon surface as compared to that of chloride anions. At the supersolvophobic carbon surface, the urea molecules have relatively higher density in the bulk of the nanodroplet, whereas the choline cation and chloride have major contributions to the outer layers of the droplets. Moreover, at the solvophilic surfaces, urea molecules are present in the adlayer, as well as in the bulk of the droplets, whereas the reline–vapor interface majorly consists of choline and chloride ions.},

Our observations reveal that both electronically adiabatic and non-adiabatic mechanisms are at play in this inelastic process. A comparison to other systems shows similarities and trends that are consistent with an electron transfer mechanism forming a transient HCl − . For example, the electronically nonadiabatic coupling is stronger than for HCl scattering from Au, where the solid’s work function is higher. HCl differs from other systems in that dissociation is possible over a low barrier. Vibrationally inelastic v = 1 → 2 transitions could not be seen when HCl ( v = 1) collides with an Ag(111) surface. We suggest that scattering events, where HCl ( v = 1) is subject to dynamical influences that increase its vibrational energy, lead efficiently to dissociation before the HCl ( v = 2) molecule can escape the surface. This system appears to be an excellent candidate to study electronically nonadiabatic effects in dissociative adsorption.},

  abstract = {The recent advent of cutting-edge experimental techniques allows for a precise synthesis of subnanometer metal clusters composed of just a few atoms, opening new possibilities for subnanometer science. In this work, via first-principles modeling, we show how the decoration of perfect and reduced TiO 2 surfaces with Ag 5 atomic clusters enables the stabilization of multiple surface polarons. Moreover, we predict that Ag 5 clusters are capable of promoting defect-induced polarons transfer from the subsurface to the surface sites of reduced TiO 2 samples. For both planar and pyramidal Ag 5 clusters, and considering four different positions of bridging oxygen vacancies, we model up to 14 polaronic structures, leading to 134 polaronic states. About 71\% of these configurations encompass coexisting surface polarons. The most stable states are associated with large inter-polaron distances (&gt;7.5 Å on average), not only due to the repulsive interaction between trapped Ti 3+ 3 d 1 electrons, but also due to the interference between their corresponding electronic polarization clouds [P. López-Caballero et al. , J. Mater. Chem. A 8 , 6842–6853 (2020)]. As a result, the most stable ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic arrangements are energetically quasi-degenerate. However, as the average inter-polarons distance decreases, most (≥70\%) of the polaronic configurations become ferromagnetic. The optical excitation of the midgap polaronic states with photon energy at the end of the visible region causes the enlargement of the polaronic wave function over the surface layer. The ability of Ag 5 atomic clusters to stabilize multiple surface polarons and extend the optical response of TiO 2 surfaces toward the visible region bears importance in improving their (photo-)catalytic properties and illustrates the potential of this new generation of subnanometer-sized materials.},

  abstract = {Here, we perform a Surface-Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF) intensity and lifetime imaging study on linear arrays of silver half-shells (LASHSs), a class of polarization-sensitive hybrid colloidal photonic–plasmonic crystal unexplored previously in SEF. By combining fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, scanning confocal fluorescence imaging, Rayleigh scattering imaging, optical microscopy, and finite difference time domain simulations, we identify with high accuracy the spatial locations where SEF effects (intensity increase and lifetime decrease) take place. These locations are the junctions/crevices between adjacent half-shells in the LASHS and locations of high electromagnetic field enhancement and strong emitter–plasmon interactions, as confirmed also by simulated field maps. Such detailed knowledge of the distributed SEF enhancements and lifetime modification distribution, with respect to topography, should prove useful for improved future evaluations of SEF enhancement factors and a more rational design of efficiency-optimized SEF substrates. These linear arrays of metal-coated microspheres expand the family of hybrid colloidal photonic–plasmonic crystals, platforms with potential for applications in optoelectronic devices, fluorescence-based (bio)chemical sensing, or medical assays. In particular, due to the polarized optical response of these LASHSs, specific applications such as hidden tags for anti-counterfeiting or plasmon-enhanced photodetection can be foreseen.},

  abstract = {Lithium ion solutions in organic solvents have become ubiquitous because of their use in energy storage technologies. The widespread use of lithium salts has prompted a large scientific interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms, giving rise to their macroscopic properties. Due to the complexity of these molecular systems, only few studies have been able to unravel the molecular motions and underlying mechanisms of the lithium ion (Li + ) solvation shell. Lately, the atomistic motions of these systems have become somewhat available via experiments using ultrafast laser spectroscopies, such as two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy. However, the molecular mechanism behind the experimentally observed dynamics is still unknown. To close this knowledge gap, this work investigated solutions of a highly dissociated salt [LiTFSI: lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] and a highly associated salt (LiSCN: lithium thiocyanate) in acetonitrile (ACN) using both experimental and theoretical methods. Linear and non-linear infrared spectroscopies showed that Li + is found as free ions and contact ion pairs in ACN/LiTFSI and ACN/LiSCN systems, respectively. In addition, it was also observed from the non-linear spectroscopy experiments that the dynamics of the ACN molecules in the Li + first solvation shell has a characteristic time of ∼1.6 ps irrespective of the ionic speciation of the cation. A similar characteristic time was deducted from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory computations. Moreover, the theoretical calculations showed that molecular mechanism is directly related to fluctuations in the angle between Li + and the coordinated ACN molecule (Li + ⋯N≡C), while other structural changes such as the change in the distance between the cation and the solvent molecule (Li + ⋯N) play a minor role. Overall, this work uncovers the time scale of the solvent motions in the Li + solvation shell and the underlying molecular mechanisms via a combination of experimental and theoretical tools.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations can provide mechanistic insight into ionic liquids (ILs) and predict the properties of experimentally unrealized ion combinations. However, ILs suffer from a particularly large disparity in the time scales of atomistic and ensemble motion. Coarse-grained models are therefore used in place of costly all-atom simulations, accessing longer time scales and larger systems. Nevertheless, constructing the many-body potential of mean force that defines the structure and dynamics of a coarse-grained system can be complicated and computationally intensive. Machine learning shows great promise for the linked challenges of dimensionality reduction and learning the potential of mean force. To improve the coarse-graining of ILs, we present a neural network model trained on all-atom classical molecular dynamics simulations. The potential of mean force is expressed as two jointly trained neural network interatomic potentials that learn the coupled short-range and many-body long range molecular interactions. These interatomic potentials treat temperature as an explicit input variable to capture its influence on the potential of mean force. The model reproduces structural quantities with high fidelity, outperforms the temperature-independent baseline at capturing dynamics, generalizes to unseen temperatures, and incurs low simulation cost.},

In the first one, a two-photon process populates configurations M * M * M and MM * M * so that two excitons reside on neighboring monomers M. Then, EEA can immediately proceed. In contrast, if the trimer initially is in the local configuration M * MM * , exciton diffusion must occur before the annihilation process can take place. For the trimer, this excitonic motion takes place on a very short time scale. In both cases, wave packets are prepared which show a different quantum dynamics where the latter depends on the couplings and decay rates.

  abstract = {The infrared (IR) probe often suffers from an unexpected complex absorption profile due to the Fermi resonance and short vibrational lifetime, which restricts the application of time-resolved IR spectroscopy to investigate the site-specific structural dynamics of the protein. Researchers have found that isotope substitution to the IR probe not only removes the Fermi resonance but also extends the dynamic observation window with a prolonged vibrational lifetime. This method has been successfully applied to modify the vibrational properties of many IR probes for time-resolved spectroscopy and imaging. In this study, the effect of isotope substitution ( 15 N) on the vibrational properties of the azide stretching band in 4-azido-L-phenylalanine has been investigated using ultrafast pump-probe and 2D-IR spectroscopy. In contrast to the earlier reports, it has been observed that the Fermi resonance remains unchanged even after isotope substitution, and there is very little change in the vibrational relaxation dynamics as well. Anharmonic frequency analysis reveals that the α -N atom of N 3 is being shared between the two transitions participating in the Fermi resonance and gets affected similarly due to isotope labeling. Hence, this study unveils the specific circumstance at which the isotope labeling strategy may not be successful in eliminating the Fermi resonance band and explains the molecular origin behind it. This study also suggests definitive approaches on how to overcome the limitations related to the Fermi resonance to extend the development and application of this IR probe for biological research.},

While the formation of the first coordination shell is incomplete for clusters with less than 15 tin atoms, the second coordination sphere starts to form for cluster sizes of more than 20 tin atoms. The magnetic properties of the clusters reveal that the tin atoms not only provide a hollow cage for Gd but also are chemically bound to the central atom. The calculated spin densities imply that an electron transfer from Gd to the tin cage takes place, which is similar to what is observed for endohedral metallofullerenes. However, the measured electric dipole moments indicate that in contrast to metallofullerenes, the Gd atom is located close to the center of the tin cage.},

  abstract = {Vibronic interactions in the pyridine radical cation ground state, 2 A 1 , and its lowest excited states, 2 A 2 and 2 B 1 , are studied theoretically. These states originate from the ionization out of the highest occupied orbitals of pyridine, 7a 1 (nσ), 1a 2 (π), and 2b 1 (π), respectively, and give rise to the lowest two photoelectron maxima. According to our previous high-level ab initio calculations [Trofimov et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 146 , 244307 (2017)], the 2 A 2 (π −1 ) excited state is very close in energy to the 2 A 1 (nσ −1 ) ground state, which suggests that these states could be vibronically coupled. Our present calculations confirm that this is indeed the case. Moreover, the next higher excited state, 2 B 1 (π −1 ), is also involved in the vibronic interaction with the 2 A 1 (nσ −1 ) and 2 A 2 (π −1 ) states. The three-state vibronic coupling problem was treated within the framework of a linear vibronic coupling model employing parameters derived from the ionization energies of pyridine computed using the linear response coupled-cluster method accounting for single, double, and triple excitations (CC3). The potential energy surfaces of the 2 A 1 and 2 A 2 states intersect in the vicinity of the adiabatic minimum of the 2 A 2 state, while the surfaces of the 2 A 2 and 2 B 1 states intersect near the 2 B 1 state minimum. The spectrum computed using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method accounting for 24 normal modes is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental spectrum of pyridine obtained using high-resolution He I photoelectron spectroscopy and allows for some assignment of the observed features.},

  abstract = {Photocatalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to produce value-added chemicals and fuel products is a critical routine to solve environmental issues. However, developing photocatalysts composed of earth-abundant, economic, and environmental-friendly elements is desired and challenging. Metal oxide clusters of subnanometer size have prominent advantages for photocatalysis due to their natural resistance to oxidation as well as tunable electronic and optical properties. Here, we exploit 3 d transition metal substitutionally doped Zn 12 O 12 clusters for CO 2 hydrogenation under ultraviolet light. By comprehensive ab initio calculations, the effect of the dopant element on the catalytic behavior of Zn 12 O 12 clusters is clearly revealed. The high activity for CO 2 hydrogenation originates from the distinct electronic states and charge transfer from transition metal dopants. The key parameters governing the activity and selectivity, including the d orbital center of TM dopants and the energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital for the doped Zn 12 O 12 clusters, are thoroughly analyzed to establish an explicit electronic structure–activity relationship. These results provide valuable guidelines not only for tailoring the catalytic performance of subnanometer metal oxide clusters at atomic precision but also for rationally designing non-precious metal photocatalysts for CO 2 hydrogenation.},

For small sizes, the enrichment is much larger than previously reported for bare neon clusters grown in nozzle expansions and subsequently ionized. The enrichment is traced to the massive evaporation of neon atoms in a collision cell that is used to strip helium from the HNDs. We derive a relation between the enrichment of 22 Ne in the cluster ion and its corresponding depletion factor F in the vapor phase. The value thus found for F is in excellent agreement with a theoretical expression that relates isotopic fractionation in two-phase equilibria of atomic gases to the Debye temperature. Furthermore, the difference in zero-point energies between the two isotopes computed from F agrees reasonably well with theoretical studies of neon cluster ions that include nuclear quantum effects in the harmonic approximation. Another fitting parameter provides an estimate for the size s i of the precursor of the observed Ne s + . The value is in satisfactory agreement with the size estimated by modeling the growth of Ne s + and with lower and upper limits deduced from other experimental data. On the other hand, neon clusters grown in neutral HNDs that are subsequently ionized by electron bombardment exhibit no statistically significant isotope enrichment at all. The finding suggests that the extent of ionization-induced dissociation of clusters embedded in HNDs is considerably smaller than that for bare clusters.},

Our results show that while all three DFAs overestimate the cluster polarizabilities, the description systematically improves from LDA to PBE to SCAN. The self-correlation free SCAN predicts polarizabilities quite accurately with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.53 bohr 3 with respect to coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) values. Removing SIE using PZ-SIC correctly reduces the DFA polarizabilities, but overcorrects, resulting in underestimated polarizabilities in SIC-LDA, SIC-PBE, and SIC-SCAN. Finally, we applied a recently proposed locally scaled SIC (LSIC) method using a quasi self-consistent scheme and using the kinetic energy density ratio as an iso-orbital indicator. The results show that the LSIC polarizabilities are in excellent agreement with mean absolute errors of 0.08 bohr 3 for LSIC-LDA and 0.06 bohr 3 for LSIC-PBE with most recent CCSD polarizabilities. Likewise, the ionization energy estimates as absolute of highest occupied energy eigenvalue predicted by LSIC are also in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) ionization energies with MAEs of 0.4 eV for LSIC-LDA and 0.06 eV for LSIC-PBE. The LSIC-LDA predictions of ionization energies are comparable to the reported GW ionization energies, while the LSIC-PBE ionization energies are more accurate than the reported GW results.},

  abstract = {Homogeneous nucleation of water is investigated in argon and in nitrogen at about 240 K and 0.1 MPa, 1 MPa, and 2 MPa by means of a pulse expansion wave tube. The surface tension reduction at high pressure qualitatively explains the observed enhancement of the nucleation rate of water in argon as well as in nitrogen. The differences in nucleation rates for the two mixtures at high pressure are consistent with the differences in adsorption behavior of the different carrier gas molecules. At low pressure, there is not enough carrier gas available to ensure the growing clusters are adequately thermalized by collisions with carrier gas molecules so that the nucleation rate is lower than under isothermal conditions. This reduction depends on the carrier gas, pressure, and temperature. A qualitative agreement between experiments and theory is found for argon and nitrogen as carrier gases. As expected, the reduction in the nucleation rates is more pronounced at higher temperatures. For helium as the carrier gas, non-isothermal effects appear to be substantially stronger than predicted by theory. The critical cluster sizes are determined experimentally and theoretically according to the Gibbs–Thomson equation, showing a reasonable agreement as documented in the literature. Finally, we propose an empirical correction of the classical nucleation theory for the nucleation rate calculation. The empirical expression is in agreement with the experimental data for the analyzed mixtures (water–helium, water–argon, and water–nitrogen) and thermodynamic conditions (0.06 MPa–2 MPa and 220 K–260 K).},

  abstract = {The reaction of hydrogen atoms (H) with pyrrole (C 4 H 4 NH) in solid para -hydrogen ( p -H 2 ) matrices at 3.2 K has been studied by infrared spectroscopy. Upon reaction of the H atoms with pyrrole in p -H 2 , a new series of lines appeared in the infrared spectrum, and based on secondary photolysis, it was determined that the majority of the new lines belong to two distinct chemical species; these lines are designated as set A and set B. According to quantum–chemical calculations performed at the B3PW91/6–311++G(2d,2p) level, the most likely reactions to occur under low temperature conditions in solid p -H 2 are the addition of an H atom to carbon 2 or 3 of C 4 H 4 NH to produce the corresponding hydrogen-atom addition radicals (HC 4 H 4 NH•). When the lines in sets A and B are compared to the scaled harmonic and anharmonic vibrational infrared stick spectra of these two radicals, the best agreement for set A is with the radical produced by the addition to carbon 3 (2,3-dihydropyrrol-2-yl radical, 3-HC 4 H 4 NH•), and the best agreement for set B is with the radical produced by addition to carbon 2 (2,3-dihydropyrrol-3-yl radical, 2-HC 4 H 4 NH•). The ratio of the 2-HC 4 H 4 NH• to 3-HC 4 H 4 NH• radicals is estimated to be 4–5:1, consistent with the smaller predicted barrier height for the H-atom addition to C2. In addition to the assignments of the 2,3-dihydropyrrol-2-yl and 2,3-dihydropyrrol-3-yl radicals, a series of lines that appear upon 455-nm photolysis have been assigned to 1,3-pyrrolenine (2-HC 4 H 4 N).},

  abstract = {The molecular dissociation energy has often been explained and discussed in terms of singlet bonds, formed by bounded pairs of valence electrons. In this work, we use a highly correlated resonating valence bond ansatz, providing a consistent paradigm for the chemical bond, where spin fluctuations are shown to play a crucial role. Spin fluctuations are known to be important in magnetic systems and correspond to the zero point motion of the spin waves emerging from a magnetic broken symmetry state. Within our ansatz, a satisfactory description of the carbon dimer is determined by the magnetic interaction of two carbon atoms with antiferromagnetically ordered S = 1 magnetic moments. This is a first step that, thanks to the highly scalable and efficient quantum Monte Carlo techniques, may open the door for understanding challenging complex systems containing atoms with large spins (e.g., transition metals).},

The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated for small test systems, and the scaling is investigated with the number of virtual orbitals and the molecule size. We also find the SC-NEVPT2 energy to be relatively insensitive to the quality of the reference wave function.

However, their influences on the properties of a -AlO x have rarely been investigated from a theoretical perspective. In this study, high-dimensional neural network potentials were constructed to generate a series of atomic structures of a -AlO x with different densities (2.6 g/cm 3 –3.3 g/cm 3 ) and O/Al ratios (1.0–1.75). The structural, vibrational, mechanical, and thermal properties of the a -AlO x models were investigated, as well as the Li and Cu diffusion behavior in the models. The results showed that density and composition had different degrees of effects on the different properties. The structural and vibrational properties were strongly affected by composition, whereas the mechanical properties were mainly determined by density. The thermal conductivity was affected by both the density and composition of a -AlO x . However, the effects on the Li and Cu diffusion behavior were relatively unclear.},

We propose an Energy Minimized AT (DOF) Insertion (EMATI) method that uses an informed rather than random AT DOF insertion to tackle the root cause of the issue, i.e., overlapping AT potentials. EMATI enables us to directly couple AT and coarse-grained resolutions without any modifications of the interaction potentials. We exemplify AdResS-EMATI in a system of liquid butane and show that it yields improved structural and thermodynamic properties at the interface compared to competing AdResS approaches. Furthermore, our approach extends the applicability of the AdResS without a hybrid region to systems for which force capping is inadequate.},

Our rung-3.5 correlation functionals also include a local complement to the nonlocal ingredient, analogous to the local exchange component of a hybrid functional. Here, we use the density matrix expansion (DME) to build rung-3.5 complements. We demonstrate how these provide a measure of local fractional occupancy and use them to approximate the flat-plane condition. We also use these complements in a three-parameter nonlocal correlation functional compatible with full nonlocal exchange. This functional approaches the accuracy of widely used hybrids for molecular thermochemistry and kinetics. The DME provides a foundation for practical, minimally empirical, nonlocal correlation functionals compatible with full nonlocal local exchange.},

The generated operators lead to linearly independent but non-orthogonal configuration state functions (CSFs) when applied to the reference and span the complete spin space. To incorporate spin completeness, spectating substitutions (e.g., Ê i v v a ⁠ ) are introduced. The presented procedure utilizes Löwdin’s projection operator method of spin eigenfunction generation to ensure spin completeness. The generated operators are explicitly checked for (i) their linear independence and (ii) their spin completeness for up to tenfold substitutions and up to a multiplicity of 2 S + 1 = 11. A proof of concept implementation utilizing the generated operators in a coupled cluster (CC) calculation was successfully applied to the high spin states of the boron atom. The results show pure spin states and small effects on the correlation energy compared to spin orbital CC. A comparison to spin-adapted but spin-incomplete CC shows a significant spin-incompleteness error.},

In particular, assuming that the probability of a complex dissociating into an enzyme and substrate is significantly larger than the probability of a product formation event, we obtain expressions for the time-dependent marginal probability distributions of the number of substrate and enzyme molecules. For delta function initial conditions, we show that the substrate distribution is either unimodal at all times or else becomes bimodal at intermediate times. This transient bimodality, which has no deterministic counterpart, manifests when the initial number of substrate molecules is much larger than the total number of enzyme molecules and if the frequency of enzyme–substrate binding events is large enough. Furthermore, we show that our closed-form solution is different from the solution of the chemical master equation reduced by means of the widely used discrete stochastic Michaelis–Menten approximation, where the propensity for substrate decay has a hyperbolic dependence on the number of substrate molecules. The differences arise because the latter does not take into account enzyme number fluctuations, while our approach includes them. We confirm by means of a stochastic simulation of all the elementary reaction steps in the Michaelis–Menten mechanism that our closed-form solution is accurate over a larger region of parameter space than that obtained using the discrete stochastic Michaelis–Menten approximation.},

Our approach formulates the inverse problem as a target vector estimation problem and uses Bayesian surrogate models of the Schrödinger equation solutions to direct the optimization of feedback loops. For the surrogate models, we use Gaussian processes with vector outputs and composite kernels built by an iterative algorithm with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as a kernel selection metric. The outputs of the Gaussian processes are designed to model an observable simultaneously at different time instances. We show that the use of Gaussian processes with vector outputs and the BIC-directed kernel construction reduces the number of iterations in the feedback loops by, at least, a factor of 3. We also demonstrate an application of Bayesian optimization for inverse problems with noisy data. To demonstrate the algorithm, we consider the orientation and alignment of polyatomic molecules SO 2 and propylene oxide (PPO) induced by strong laser pulses. We use simulated time evolutions of the orientation or alignment signals to determine the relevant components of the molecular polarizability tensors. We show that, for the five independent components of the polarizability tensor of PPO, this can be achieved with as few as 30 quantum dynamics calculations.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations universally rely on thermostats to control temperature. The thermostat-induced alteration in the system dynamics that enables temperature control can, however, adversely impact molecular transport across the temperature-controlled and temperature-uncontrolled regions. Here, we analyze the influence of a thermostat on thermal transport across a solid–liquid interface in a canonical setup that, owing to its generality, has been widely employed in NEMD simulations. In scenarios wherein temperature is controlled via stochastic/frictional forcing based thermostats, we find occurrence of a spurious temperature jump across the solid–liquid interface. The corresponding Kapitza length diminishes with a gradual weakening of the coupling between the thermostat and the system. Hence, we identify an optimal thermostat control parameter range over which contrasting requirements of an effective temperature control and a sufficiently low interfacial thermal resistance are simultaneously satisfied. We show that a similar disruption in thermal transport occurs in a single phase system of pure solid atoms as well. We trace the microscopic origin of the anomalous interfacial thermal resistance to a stochastic/frictional forcing-induced alteration in the force autocorrelation function. We propose a simple model consisting of an individual atom impinging in vacuo on a thermostatted solid as a computationally inexpensive alternative for determination of the control parameter range over which thermostat-induced spurious thermal resistance across a solid–liquid interface becomes significant. Our results suggest that the undesirable possibility of MD-deduced temperature jumps being misleading indicators of the interfacial Kapitza resistance could simply be eliminated through a judicious choice of the thermostat control parameter.},

In particular, this has been achieved without computational overhead over the unrestricted TD-DFT (U-TD-DFT) that usually produces heavily spin-contaminated excited states. It is shown here that the analytic energy gradients of X-TD-DFT can be obtained by just slight modifications of those of U-TD-DFT running with restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham orbitals. As such, X-TD-DFT also has no overhead over U-TD-DFT in the calculation of energy gradients of excited states of open-shell systems. Although only a few prototypical open-shell molecules are considered as showcases, it can definitely be said that X-TD-DFT can replace U-TD-DFT for geometry optimization and dynamics simulation of excited states of open-shell systems.},

Previously, we have shown that a high-dimensional neural network potential can extend molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Li x Mn 2 O 4 to nanosecond time scales, but these simulations did not provide information about the electronic structure. Here, we extend the use of neural networks to the prediction of atomic oxidation and spin states. The resulting high-dimensional neural network is able to predict the spins of the Mn ions with an error of only 0.03 ℏ . We find that the Mn e g electrons are correctly conserved and that the number of Jahn–Teller distorted Mn III O 6 octahedra is predicted precisely for different Li loadings. A charge ordering transition is observed between 280 K and 300 K, which matches resistivity measurements. Moreover, the activation energy of the electron hopping conduction above the phase transition is predicted to be 0.18 eV, deviating only 0.02 eV from experiment. This work demonstrates that machine learning is able to provide an accurate representation of both the geometric and the electronic structure dynamics of Li x Mn 2 O 4 on time and length scales that are not accessible by ab initio MD.},

  abstract = {SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) has become a widely used method for hyper-polarizing nuclear spins, thereby enhancing their Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals by orders of magnitude. In SABRE experiments, the non-equilibrium spin order is transferred from parahydrogen to a substrate in a transient organometallic complex. The applicability of SABRE is expanded by the methodology of SABRE-relay in which polarization can be relayed to a second substrate either by direct chemical exchange of hyperpolarized nuclei or by polarization transfer between two substrates in a second organometallic complex. To understand the mechanism of the polarization transfer and study the transfer efficiency, we propose a theoretical approach to SABRE-relay, which can treat both spin dynamics and chemical kinetics as well as the interplay between them. The approach is based on a set of equations for the spin density matrices of the spin systems involved (i.e., SABRE substrates and complexes), which can be solved numerically. Using this method, we perform a detailed study of polarization formation and analyze in detail the dependence of the attainable polarization level on various chemical kinetic and spin dynamic parameters. We foresee the applications of the present approach for optimizing SABRE-relay experiments with the ultimate goal of achieving maximal NMR signal enhancements for substrates of interest.},

  abstract = {Halogen atoms are widely used in drug molecules to improve their binding affinity for the receptor proteins. Many of the examples involve “halogen bonding” between the molecule and the binding site, which is a directional interaction between a halogen atom and a nucleophilic atom. Such an interaction is induced by an electron cloud shift of the halogen atom toward its covalently bonded neighbor to form the σ -bond, leaving a small electrostatic positive region opposite to the bond called the “ σ -hole.” To mimic the effect of the σ -hole in the CHARMM non-polarizable force field, recently CGenFF added a positively charged massless particle to halogen atoms, positioned at the opposite side of the carbon–halogen bond. This particle is referred to as a lone pair (LP) particle because it uses the lone pair implementation in the CHARMM force field. Here, we have added support for LP particles to ffTK, an automated force field parameterization toolkit widely distributed as a plugin to the molecular visualization software VMD. We demonstrate the updated optimization process using an example halogenated drug molecule, AT130, which is a capsid assembly modulator targeting the hepatitis B virus. Our results indicate that parameterization with the LP particle significantly improves the accuracy of the electrostatic response of the molecule, especially around the halogen atom. Although the inclusion of the LP particle does not produce a prominent effect on the interactions between the molecule and its target protein, the protein–ligand binding performance is greatly improved by optimization of the parameters.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new strategy for improving the efficiency of upconversion emissions based on triplet–triplet exciton annihilation (TTA-UC) in the solid state. We designed a ternary blend system consisting of a triplet sensitizer (TS), an exciton-transporting host polymer, and a small amount of an annihilator in which the triplet-state energies of the TS, host, and annihilator decrease in this order. The key idea underpinning this concept involves first transferring the triplet excitons generated by the TS to the host and then to the annihilator, driven by the cascaded triplet energy landscape. Because of the small annihilator blend ratio, the local density of triplet excitons in the annihilator domain is higher than those in conventional binary TS/annihilator systems, which is advantageous for TTA-UC because TTA is a density-dependent bimolecular reaction. We tracked the triplet exciton dynamics in the ternary blend film by transient absorption spectroscopy. Host triplet excitons are generated through triplet energy transfer from the TS following intersystem crossing in the TS. These triplet excitons then diffuse in the host domain and accumulate in the annihilator domain. The accumulated triplet excitons undergo TTA to generate singlet excitons that are higher in energy than the excitation source, resulting in UC emission. Based on the excitation-intensity and blend-ratio dependences of TTA-UC, we found that our concept has a positive impact on accelerating TTA.},

In the regime, when the model system approaches the Coulomb system, they allow the calculation of ground states, excited states, and properties, without making use of the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem. Asymptotically, the technique is improvable and allows for error estimates that can validate the results. Some considerations for correcting the errors of finite basis sets in this spirit are also presented.

The Ebola nucleocapsid consists of a helical assembly of nucleoproteins (NPs) encapsidating single-stranded viral RNA (ssRNA). Knowledge of the molecular determinants of Ebola nucleocapsid stability is essential for the development of therapeutics against EBOV. However, large degrees of freedom associated with the Ebola nucleocapsid helical assembly pose a computational challenge, thereby limiting the previous simulation studies to the level of monomers. In the present work, we have performed all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the helical assembly of EBOV nucleoproteins in the absence and presence of ssRNA. We found that ssRNA is essential for maintaining structural integrity of the nucleocapsid. Other molecular determinants observed to stabilize the nucleocapsid include NP–RNA and NP–NP interactions and ion distributions. Additionally, the structural and dynamical behavior of the nucleocapsid monomer depends on its position in the helical assembly. NP monomers present on the longitudinal edges of the helical tube are more exposed, flexible, and have weaker NP–NP interactions than those residing in the center. This work provides key structural features stabilizing the nucleocapsid that may serve as therapeutic targets.},

The phase separation is manifested through the appearance of needle-like dense particle aggregates synchronously rotating with the field. Their size progressively increases with time due to the absorption of individual nanoparticles (aggregate growth) and coalescence with neighboring aggregates. The aggregate growth is enhanced by the convection of nanoparticles toward rotating aggregates. The maximal aggregate length, L max ∝ ν −2 , is limited by fragmentation arising as a result of their collisions. Experimentally, the aggregate growth and coalescence occur at a similar timescale, ∼1 min, weakly dependent on the field frequency. The proposed theoretical model provides a semi-quantitative agreement with the experiments on the average aggregate size, aggregation timescale, and size distribution function without any adjustable parameter.},

The theoretical framework developed provides a concise physical and chemical picture. Delicate evaluations and analyses have been made on the optimal lattices, energy bands, and orbital-projected van Hove singularities. They provide decisive mechanisms, such as buckled/planar honeycomb lattices, multi-/single-orbital hybridizations, and significant/negligible spin–orbital couplings. We investigate the stacking-configuration-induced dramatic transformations of essential properties by relative shift in bilayer graphenes and silicenes. The lattice constant, interlayer distance, buckling height, and total energy essentially depend on the magnitude and direction of the relative shift: AA → AB → AA′ → AA. Apparently, sliding bilayer systems are quite different between silicene and graphene in terms of geometric structures, electronic properties, orbital hybridizations, interlayer hopping integrals, and spin interactions.},

This model reveals the typical 1/ r 6 -distance dependence for a dimer of a donor and acceptor, similar to the nuclear Overhauser effect in NMR spectroscopy or Förster resonant energy transfer in electronic spectroscopy. However, VET becomes a collective phenomenon on the surface, with the existence of a network of coupled molecules and its disappearance below a percolation threshold, dominating the concentration dependence of the VET rate.},

  abstract = {Even though the study of interfacial phenomena can be traced back to Laplace and was given a solid thermodynamic foundation by Gibbs, it appears that some concepts and relations among them are still causing some confusion and debates in the literature, particularly for interfaces involving solids. In particular, the definitions of the concepts of interfacial tension, free energy, and stress and the relationships between them sometimes lack clarity, and some authors even question their validity. So far, the debates about these relationships, in particular the Shuttleworth equation, have taken place within the framework of classical thermodynamics. In this work, we are offering to look at these concepts within the framework of statistical mechanics, which can be readily tested in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. For a simple one component system of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential, we calculate by the cleaving method the excess free energy of a solid–vacuum interface (solid surface) for systems in different states of tangential strain and compare the results to the calculation of surface stress via the difference of normal and tangential forces at the surface. As a result, we demonstrate consistency, within the statistical uncertainty, of the thermodynamic and statistical mechanical definitions of surface free energy and surface stress and how they are expressed via interaction-dependent quantities in MD simulations.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) post-transition metal chalcogenides (PTMCs) have attracted attention due to their suitable bandgaps and lower exciton binding energies, making them more appropriate for electronic, optical, and water-splitting devices than graphene and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Of the predicted 2D PTMCs, GaSe has been reliably synthesized and experimentally characterized. Despite this fact, quantities such as lattice parameters and band character vary significantly depending on which density functional theory (DFT) functional is used. Although many-body perturbation theory (GW approximation) has been used to correct the electronic structure and obtain the excited state properties of 2D GaSe, and solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE) has been used to find the optical gap, we find that the results depend strongly on the starting wavefunction. In an attempt to correct these discrepancies, we employed the many-body Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method to calculate the ground and excited state properties of GaSe because DMC has a weaker dependence on the trial wavefunction. We benchmark these results with available experimental data, DFT [local-density approximation, Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA, and hybrid (HSE06) functionals] and GW-BSE (using PBE and SCAN wavefunctions) results. Our findings confirm that monolayer GaSe is an indirect gap semiconductor (Γ-M) with a quasiparticle electronic gap in close agreement with experiment and low exciton binding energy. We also benchmark the optimal lattice parameter, cohesive energy, and ground state charge density with DMC and various DFT methods. We aim to present a terminal theoretical benchmark for pristine monolayer GaSe, which will aid in the further study of 2D PTMCs using DMC methods.},

  abstract = {CO adsorbed to NaCl(100) exhibits perhaps the weakest possible coupling between the adsorbate and solid. It is, therefore, an ideal system to observe the influence of adsorbate–adsorbate interactions on infrared absorption. In this work, we report polarized FTIR absorption spectra of CO/NaCl(100) as a function of coverage (0.02 ≤ θ ≤ 1 ML), where the coverage has been quantitatively determined by temperature-programmed desorption and molecular beam dosing. We extend a previous semi-empirical model designed to describe the screening of the local electric field due to dipole–dipole interactions in a CO monolayer. The extended model applies to sub-monolayer coverages and describes properly the electric field of the absorbed radiation at the vacuum–substrate interface. Fitting this model to coverage-dependent IR absorption data allows us to derive the vibrational and electronic polarizabilities [ χ v = 0.0435(14) Å 3 , χ e = 3.30(36) Å 3 ] and the integrated absorption cross section of 2.51(8) × 10 −17 cm/molecule for an isolated CO molecule adsorbed at the NaCl (100) surface. The determined integrated absorption cross section is substantially smaller than that of gas phase CO.},

Owing to resonant excitation, chiral near fields can be significantly enhanced for these resonators, holding great promise for developing enantioselective photonic components such as biochemical sensors based on circular dichroism (CD) and spin-dependent nonlinear imaging. In the present work, strong linear and nonlinear chiroptical responses (scattering CD &gt; 0.15 and nonlinear differential CDs &gt; 0.4) at visible and near infrared frequencies are reported for the first time for individual micrometer-scale plasmonic and dielectric helical structures. By leveraging dark-field spectroscopy and nonlinear optical microscopy, the circular-polarization-selective scattering behavior and nonlinear optical responses (e.g., second harmonic generation and two-photon photoluminescence) of 3D printed micro-helices with feature sizes comparable to the wavelength (total length is ∼5λ) are demonstrated. These micro-helices provide potential for readily accessible photonic platforms, facilitating an enantiomeric analysis of chiral materials. One such example is the opportunity to explore ultracompact photonic devices based on single, complex meta-atoms enabled by state-of-the-art 3D fabrication techniques.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are receiving significant attention due to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties. The material quality is greatly affected by defects that are inevitably generated during material synthesis. Focusing on chalcogenide vacancies, which constitute the most common defect, we use the state-of-the-art simulation methodology developed in our group to demonstrate that W doping of MoSe 2 with Se vacancies reduces charge carrier losses by two mechanisms. First, W doping makes the formation of double Se vacancies unfavorable, while it is favorable in undoped MoSe 2 . Second, if a Se vacancy is present, the charge carrier lifetimes are extended in the W-doped MoSe 2 . Combining ab initio real-time time-dependent density functional theory with nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, the simulations show that the nonradiative carrier losses in the presence of Se vacancies proceed by sub-10 ps electron trapping and relaxation down the manifold of trap states, followed by a 100 ps recombination of trapped electrons with free holes. The electron–vibrational energy exchange is driven by both in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational motions of the MoSe 2 layer. The atomistic studies advance our understanding of the influence of defects on charge carrier properties in TMDs and guide improvements of material quality and development of TMD applications.},

It was found that the density of IBP molecules in an average pore size has a direct influence on both the glass transition and the mechanism of crystallization. Detailed analyzes of the crystallite distribution and melting by Raman mapping, x-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry have shown that the crystals are localized in the core of the channel and surrounded by a liquid monolayer.

  abstract = {Small rigid ions perturb the water structure around them significantly. At constant viscosity, alkali cations (Li + , Na + , and so on) exhibit an anomalous non-monotonic dependence of diffusivity on ion-size, in stark violation of the Stokes–Einstein expression. Although this is a well-known problem, we find that an entropic view of the problem can be developed, which provides valuable insight. The local entropy experienced by the solute ion is relevant here, which leads to the connection with local viscosity, discussed earlier by many. Due to the strong interactions with ions, the translational and rotational entropy of solvation water decreases sharply; however, an opposite effect comes from the disruption of the tetrahedral network structure of water near the charges. We compute the tetrahedral order of water molecules (q tet ) around the ion and suitably defined tetrahedral entropy [S(q tet )] that is a contribution to the excess entropy of the system. Our results reveal that although the structural properties of the second shell become nearly identical to the bulk, S(q tet ) of the second shell is found to play an important role in giving rise to the non-monotonic ion-size dependence. The detailed study of the static and dynamic fluctuations in q tet and the number of hydration water molecules provides interesting insights into correlation between the structure and dynamics; the smallest static fluctuation of q tet for the first hydration shell water molecules of Li + is indicative of the iceberg picture. The study of fluctuation properties of q tet and the coordination number also reveals the role of the second hydration layer and could explain the anomalous behavior of the Rb + ion.},

The congruent melting is associated with the stability of a previously unobserved solid phase of AMH, which we named AMH-VII. Another, presumably water-rich, hydrate has also been detected in the range 4 GPa–7 GPa at 295 K on decompression of the high pressure disordered ionico-molecular alloy (DIMA) phase. Comparing our melting data to the literature suggests that non-congruent melting extends from 220 K to 324 K and that the solid phase that borders the fluid between 220 K and 270 K, called AMH-III, is not a proper phase of AMH but a solid solution of ammonia hemihydrate and ice.

The simulation results are in excellent agreement with previous experiments available up to 100 MPa for both pure compounds (200 MPa for 1-methylnaphthalene) and the binary mixtures. For 1-methylnaphthalene, the viscosity initially increases slower-than-exponential with pressure before it reaches an inflection point and then increases faster-than-exponential. The inflection point (300 MPa) occurs at a pressure slightly below the one at which 1-methylnaphthalene is expected to enter the supercooled phase (400 MPa). For methylcyclohexane, the increase in viscosity with pressure is slower-than-exponential over the entire pressure range studied. The binary mixtures show intermediate pressure–viscosity responses between the two pure cases. The applicability of equations commonly used to describe the pressure dependence of viscosity, as well as the viscosity of binary mixtures, is evaluated against the computational predictions.},

  abstract = {Glasses exhibit vibrational and thermal properties that are markedly different from those of crystals. While recent works have advanced our understanding of vibrational excitations in glasses in the harmonic approximation limit, efforts in understanding finite-temperature anharmonic processes have been limited. In crystals, phonon–phonon coupling provides an extremely efficient mechanism for anharmonic decay that is also important in glasses. By using extensive molecular dynamics simulation of model atomic systems, here we first describe, both numerically and analytically, the anharmonic couplings in the crystal and the glass by focusing on the temperature dependence of the associated decay rates. Next, we show that an additional anharmonic channel of different origin emerges in the amorphous case, which induces unconventional intermittent rearrangements of particles. We have found that thermal vibrations in glasses trigger transitions among numerous different local minima of the energy landscape, which, however, are located within the same wide (meta)basin. These processes generate motions that are different from both diffusive and out-of-equilibrium aging dynamics. We suggest that (i) the observed intermittent rearrangements accompanying thermal fluctuations are crucial features distinguishing glasses from crystals and (ii) they can be considered as relics of the liquid state that survive the complete dynamic arrest taking place at the glass transition temperature.},

We elaborate a quantitative model, which includes fragmentation in competition with radiative cooling via both vibrational and electronic (recurrent fluorescence) de-excitation. Excellent agreement with experimental results is found when sequential fragmentation of daughter ions co-stored with the parent perylene ions is included in the model. Based on the comparison of the model to experiment, we constrain the oscillator strength of the D 1 → D 0 emissive electronic transition in perylene ( f RF = 0.055 ± 0.011), as well as the absolute absorption cross section of the D 5 ← D 0 excitation transition ( σ abs &gt; 670 Mb). The former transition is responsible for the laser-induced and recurrent fluorescence of perylene, and the latter is the most prominent in the absorption spectrum. The vibrational cooling rate is found to be consistent with the simple harmonic cascade approximation. Quantitative experimental benchmarks of unimolecular processes in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ions like perylene are important for refining astrochemical models.},

  abstract = {Improvement in the photochemical formation efficiency of one-electron-reduced species (OERS) of a photoredox photosensitizer (a redox catalyst) is directly linked to the improvement in efficiencies of the various photocatalytic reactions themselves. We investigated the primary processes of a photochemical reduction of two series [Ru(diimine) 3 ] 2+ and [Os(diimine) 3 ] 2+ as frequently used redox photosensitizers ( PS 2+ ), by 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1 H -benzo[ d ]imidazole (BIH) as a typical reductant in detail using steady-irradiation and time-resolved spectroscopies. The rate constants of all elementary processes of the photochemical reduction of PS 2+ by BIH to give the free PS• + were obtained or estimated. The most important process for determining the formation efficiency of the free PS• + was the escape yield from the solvated ion pair [ PS• + –BIH• + ], which was strongly dependent on both the central metal ion and the ligands. In cases with the same central metal ion, the system with larger −Δ G bet , which is the free energy change in the back-electron transfer from the OERS of PS• + to BIH• + , tended to lower the escape yield of the free OERS of PS 2+ . On the other hand, different central metal ions drastically affected the escape yield even in cases with similar −Δ G bet ; the escape yield in the case of RuH 2+ (−Δ G bet = 1.68 eV) was 5–11 times higher compared to those of OsH 2+ (−Δ G bet = 1.60 eV) and OsMe 2+ (−Δ G bet = 1.71 eV). The back-electron transfer process from the free PS• + to the free BIH• + could not compete against the further reaction of the free BIH• + , which is the deprotonation process giving BI•, in DMA for all examples. The produced BI• gave one electron to PS 2+ in the ground state to give another PS• + , quantitatively. Based on these findings and investigations, it is clarified that the photochemical formation efficiency of the free PS• + should be affected not only by −Δ G bet but also by the heavy-atom effect of the central metal ion, and/or the oxidation power of the excited PS 2+ , which should determine the distance between the excited PS and BIH at the moment of the electron transfer.},

To calibrate the MP2 calculated interaction energies for these dimeric complexes, we perform single-point calculations with the coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations method at the complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS] using the well-tested extrapolation methods. In order to gain more physical insights, we also perform a parallel series of energy decomposition calculations based on the symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). The collection of these CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energy values can serve as a minimum quantum chemistry dataset for testing or training less accurate but more efficient calculation methods. As an application, we further propose a segmental SAPT model based on chemically recognizable segments in a specific functional group. These model interactions can be used to construct coarse-grained force fields for larger molecular systems.},

  abstract = {Radical enhanced intersystem crossing (EISC) of organic chromophores is an important approach to generate a long-lived triplet state for various electronic and optoelectronic applications. However, structural factors and design rules to promote EISC are not entirely clear. In this work, we report a series of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives covalently linked with a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) radical with varying distances and topologies. We show that the incorporation of the TEMPO radical to BODIPY results in strong fluorescence quenching by up to 85\% as a result of EISC and enhanced internal conversion. In BDP-2AR [2-(4-methyleneamino-TEMPO) BODIPY], a dyad with the shortest BODIPY–TEMPO through-bond distance, we observe the fastest EISC rate ( τ isc = 1.4 ns) and the longest triplet excited state lifetime ( τ T = 32 µ s) compared to other distance and geometry variations. Contrary to previous reports and a general presumption, the BODIPY–TEMPO through-bond distance in this system does not play a significant role on the triplet formation rate and yield. Density functional theory suggests a folding of the TEMPO radical to form a sandwich-like structure with a BODIPY ring that leads to a decrease in the through-space distance, providing a new and an interesting insight for the radical enhanced intersystem.},

We performed WEM simulations on the following host–guest systems: Na + /Cl − ion pair and 4-hydroxy-2-butanone ligand with FK506 binding protein. As a proof of principle, we show that the WEM formalism reproduces the Na + /Cl − ion pair dissociation timescale and the free energy profile obtained from long conventional MD simulation. To increase the accuracy of WEM calculations applied to kinetics and thermodynamics in protein–ligand binding, we introduced a modified WEM scheme called weighted ensemble milestoning with restraint release (WEM-RR), which can increase the number of starting points per milestone without adding additional computational cost. WEM-RR calculations obtained a ligand residence time and binding free energy in agreement with experimental and previous computational results. Moreover, using the milestoning framework, the binding time and rate constants, dissociation constants, and committor probabilities could also be calculated at a low computational cost. We also present an analytical approach for estimating the association rate constant ( k on ) when binding is primarily diffusion driven. We show that the WEM method can efficiently calculate multiple experimental observables describing ligand–receptor binding/unbinding and is a promising candidate for computer-aided inhibitor design.},

  abstract = {Achieving thermodynamic faithfulness and transferability across state points is an outstanding challenge in the bottom-up coarse graining of molecular models, with many efforts focusing on augmenting the form of coarse-grained interaction potentials to improve transferability. Here, we revisit the critical role of the simulation ensemble and the possibility that even simple models can be made more predictive through a smarter choice of ensemble. We highlight the efficacy of coarse graining from ensembles where variables conjugate to the thermodynamic quantities of interest are forced to respond to applied perturbations. For example, to learn activity coefficients, it is natural to coarse grain from ensembles with spatially varying external potentials applied to one species to force local composition variations and fluctuations. We apply this strategy to coarse grain both an atomistic model of water and methanol and a binary mixture of spheres interacting via Gaussian repulsions and demonstrate near-quantitative capture of activity coefficients across the whole composition range. Furthermore, the approach is able to do so without explicitly measuring and targeting activity coefficients during the coarse graining process; activity coefficients are only computed after-the-fact to assess accuracy. We hypothesize that ensembles with applied thermodynamic potentials are more “thermodynamically informative.” We quantify this notion of informativeness using the Fisher information metric, which enables the systematic design of optimal bias potentials that promote the learning of thermodynamically faithful models. The Fisher information is related to variances of structural variables, highlighting the physical basis underlying the Fisher information’s utility in improving coarse-grained models.},

Starting from a field theory description for interacting bosonic excitons, we derive a reduced model whereby optical excitons are coupled to an incoherent background via scattering as mediated by their screened Coulomb coupling. The Heisenberg equations of motion for the optical excitons are then driven by an auxiliary stochastic population variable, which we take to be the solution of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Itô’s lemma then allows us to easily construct and evaluate correlation functions and response functions. Focusing on the linear response, we compare our model to the classic Anderson–Kubo model. While similar in motivation, there are differences in the predicted lineshapes, notably in terms of asymmetry, and variation with the increasing background population.},

  abstract = {We revisit the well-known aqueous ferrous–ferric electron transfer reaction in order to address recent suggestions that nuclear tunneling can lead to significant deviation from the linear response assumption inherent in the Marcus picture of electron transfer. A recent study of this reaction by Richardson and co-workers [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 22, 10687 (2020)] has found a large difference between their new path-integral method, golden-rule quantum transition state theory (GR-QTST), and the saddle point approximation of Wolynes (Wolynes theory). They suggested that this difference could be attributed to the existence of multiple tunneling pathways, leading Wolynes theory to significantly overestimate the rate. This was used to argue that the linear response assumptions of Marcus theory may break down for liquid systems when tunneling is important. If true, this would imply that the commonly used method for studying such systems, where the problem is mapped onto a spin-boson model, is invalid. However, we have recently shown that size inconsistency in GR-QTST can lead to poor predictions of the rate in systems with many degrees of freedom. We have also suggested an improved method, the path-integral linear golden-rule (LGR) approximation, which fixes this problem. Here, we demonstrate that the GR-QTST results for ferrous–ferric electron transfer are indeed dominated by its size consistency error. Furthermore, by comparing the LGR and Wolynes theory results, we confirm the established picture of nuclear tunneling in this system. Finally, by comparing our path-integral results to those obtained by mapping onto the spin-boson model, we reassess the importance of anharmonic effects and the accuracy of this commonly used mapping approach.},

The method is based on a modification of the recently proposed golden-rule quantum transition state theory (GR-QTST) of Thapa, Fang, and Richardson [J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 104107 (2019)]. While GR-QTST is not size consistent, leading to the possibility of unbounded errors in the rate, our modified method has no such issue and so can be reliably applied to condensed phase systems. Both methods involve path-integral sampling in a constrained ensemble; the two methods differ, however, in the choice of constraint functional. We demonstrate numerically that our modified method is as accurate as GR-QTST for the one-dimensional model considered by Thapa and co-workers. We then study a multidimensional spin-boson model, for which our method accurately predicts the true quantum rate, while GR-QTST breaks down with an increasing number of boson modes in the discretization of the spectral density. Our method is able to accurately predict reaction rates in the Marcus inverted regime without the need for the analytic continuation required by Wolynes theory.},

[Chem. Sci. 8 , 6924–6935 (2017)], which was originally proposed for the permanent dipole moment vector of the electronic ground state. (ii) We investigate the transferability of our excited-state ML models in chemical space, i.e., whether an ML model can predict the properties of molecules that it has never been trained on and whether it can learn the different excited states of two molecules simultaneously. To this aim, we employ and extend our previously reported SchNarc approach for excited-state ML. We calculate UV absorption spectra from excited-state energies and transition dipole moments as well as electrostatic potentials from latent charges inferred by the ML model of the permanent dipole moment vectors. We train our ML models on C H 2 N H 2 + and C 2 H 4 , while predictions are carried out for these molecules and additionally for CHNH 2 , CH 2 NH, and C 2 H 5 + ⁠ .

On the other hand, the real-time DEOM deals with both equilibrium structural and nonequilibrium dynamic properties. Its combination with the thermodynamic integral formalism would be a viable and accurate means to both equilibrium and transient thermodynamics. As illustrations, we report the numerical results on a spin-boson system, with elaborations on the underlying anharmonic features, the thermodynamic entropy vs the von Neumann entropy, and an indication of “solvent-cage” formation.

  abstract = {A first principles quantum formalism to describe the non-adiabatic dynamics of electrons and nuclei based on a second quantization representation (SQR) of the electronic motion combined with the usual representation of the nuclear coordinates is introduced. This procedure circumvents the introduction of potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings, providing an alternative to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. An important feature of the molecular Hamiltonian in the mixed first quantized representation for the nuclei and the SQR representation for the electrons is that all degrees of freedom, nuclear positions and electronic occupations, are distinguishable. This makes the approach compatible with various tensor decomposition Ansätze for the propagation of the nuclear–electronic wavefunction. Here, we describe the application of this formalism within the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree framework and its multilayer generalization, corresponding to Tucker and hierarchical Tucker tensor decompositions of the wavefunction, respectively. The approach is applied to the calculation of the photodissociation cross section of the HeH + molecule under extreme ultraviolet irradiation, which features non-adiabatic effects and quantum interferences between the two possible fragmentation channels, He + H + and He + + H. These calculations are compared with the usual description based on ab initio potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements, which fully agree. The proof-of-principle calculations serve to illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of this formalism, which are discussed in detail, as well as possible ways to overcome them. We close with an outlook of possible application domains where the formalism might outperform the usual approach, for example, in situations that combine a strong static correlation of the electrons with non-adiabatic electronic–nuclear effects.},

  abstract = {Peptides mediate up to 40\% of known protein–protein interactions in higher eukaryotes and play an important role in cellular signaling. However, it is challenging to simulate both binding and unbinding of peptides and calculate peptide binding free energies through conventional molecular dynamics, due to long biological timescales and extremely high flexibility of the peptides. Based on the Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD) enhanced sampling technique, we have developed a new computational method “Pep-GaMD,” which selectively boosts essential potential energy of the peptide in order to effectively model its high flexibility. In addition, another boost potential is applied to the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm. Pep-GaMD has been demonstrated on binding of three model peptides to the SH3 domains. Independent 1 µ s dual-boost Pep-GaMD simulations have captured repetitive peptide dissociation and binding events, which enable us to calculate peptide binding thermodynamics and kinetics. The calculated binding free energies and kinetic rate constants agreed very well with available experimental data. Furthermore, the all-atom Pep-GaMD simulations have provided important insights into the mechanism of peptide binding to proteins that involves long-range electrostatic interactions and mainly conformational selection. In summary, Pep-GaMD provides a highly efficient, easy-to-use approach for unconstrained enhanced sampling and calculations of peptide binding free energies and kinetics.},

  abstract = {The recently proposed many-body expanded full configuration interaction (MBE-FCI) method is extended to excited states and static first-order properties different from total, ground state correlation energies. Results are presented for excitation energies and (transition) dipole moments of two prototypical, heteronuclear diatomics—LiH and MgO—in augmented correlation consistent basis sets of up to quadruple- ζ quality. Given that MBE-FCI properties are evaluated without recourse to a sampled wave function and the storage of corresponding reduced density matrices, the memory overhead associated with the calculation of general first-order properties only scales with the dimension of the desired property. In combination with the demonstrated performance, the present developments are bound to admit a wide range of future applications by means of many-body expanded treatments of electron correlation.},

  abstract = {In this article, a numerical implementation of the exact kinetic energy operator (KEO) for triatomic molecules (symmetric of XY 2 -type and asymmetric of YXZ-type) is presented. The implementation is based on the valence coordinates with the bisecting (XY 2 -type molecules) and bond-vector (YXZ) embeddings and includes the treatment of the singularity at linear geometry. The KEO is represented in a sum-of-product form. The singularity caused by the undetermined angle at the linear configuration is resolved with the help of the associated Legendre and Laguerre polynomials used as parameterized bending basis functions in the finite basis set representation. The exact KEO implementation is combined with the variational solver theoretical rovibrational energies, equipped with a general automatic symmetry-adaptation procedure and efficient basis step contraction schemes, providing a powerful computational solver of triatomic molecules for accurate computations of highly excited ro-vibrational spectra. The advantages of different basis set choices are discussed. Examples of specific applications for computing hot spectra of linear molecules are given.},

  abstract = {The ability to understand and engineer molecular structures relies on having accurate descriptions of the energy as a function of atomic coordinates. Here, we outline a new paradigm for deriving energy functions of hyperdimensional molecular systems, which involves generating data for low-dimensional systems in virtual reality (VR) to then efficiently train atomic neural networks (ANNs). This generates high-quality data for specific areas of interest within the hyperdimensional space that characterizes a molecule’s potential energy surface (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this approach by gathering data within VR to train ANNs on chemical reactions involving fewer than eight heavy atoms. This strategy enables us to predict the energies of much higher-dimensional systems, e.g., containing nearly 100 atoms. Training on datasets containing only 15k geometries, this approach generates mean absolute errors around 2 kcal mol −1 . This represents one of the first times that an ANN-PES for a large reactive radical has been generated using such a small dataset. Our results suggest that VR enables the intelligent curation of high-quality data, which accelerates the learning process.},

  abstract = {Biophysical processes often encounter high energy transition states that lie in regions of the free energy landscape (FEL) inaccesible to conventional molecular dynamics simulations. Various enhanced sampling methods have been developed to handle the inherent quasi-nonergodicity, either by adding a biasing potential to the underlying Hamiltonian or by forcing the transitions with parallel tempering. However, when attempting to probe systems of increasing complexity with limited computational resources, there arises an imminent need for fast and efficient FEL exploration with sufficient accuracy. Herein, we present a computationally efficient algorithm based on statistical inference for fast estimation of key features in the two-dimensional FEL. Unlike conventional enhanced sampling methods, this newly developed method avoids direct sampling of high free energy states. Rather, the transition states connecting metastable regions of comparable free energies are estimated using Bayesian likelihood maximization. Furthermore, the method incorporates a tunable self-feedback mechanism with classical molecular dynamics for preventing unnecessary sampling that no more effectively contributes to the underlying distributions of metastable states. We have applied this novel protocol in three independent case studies and compared the results against a conventional method. We conclude with the scope of further developments for improved accuracy of the new method and its generalization toward estimation of features in more complex FELs.},

The phase-space fidelity between excited states is proportional to the position-space fidelity, with a factor of proportionality depending on total energies.

In the perturbation theory, we test multiple core–valence separation schemes and find that, with the mean field theory already so accurate, electron-counting biases in one popular separation scheme become a dominant error when predicting K-edges. Happily, these appear to be relatively easy to correct for, leading to a perturbation theory for K-edge positions that is lower scaling and more accurate than coupled cluster theory and competitive in accuracy with recent high-accuracy results from restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham theory. For peak separations, our preliminary data show excited state mean field theory to be exceptionally accurate, but more extensive testing will be needed to see how it and its perturbation theory compare to coupled cluster peak separations more broadly.},

  abstract = {The molecular junction geometry is modeled in terms of nuclear degrees of freedom that are embedded in a stochastic quantum environment of non-equilibrium electrons. The time-evolution of the molecular geometry is governed via a mean force, a frictional force, and a stochastic force, forces arising from many electrons tunneling across the junction for a given nuclear vibration. Conversely, the current-driven nuclear dynamics feed back to the electronic current, which can be captured according to the extended expressions for the current that have explicit dependences on classical nuclear velocities and accelerations. Current-induced nuclear forces and the non-adiabatic electric current are computed using non-equilibrium Green’s functions via a timescale separation solution of Keldysh–Kadanoff–Baym equations in the Wigner space. Applying the theory to molecular junctions demonstrated that non-adiabatic corrections play an important role when nuclear motion is considered non-equilibrium and, in particular, showed that non-equilibrium and equilibrium descriptions of nuclear motion produce significantly different current characteristics. It is observed that non-equilibrium descriptions generally produce heightened conductance profiles relative to the equilibrium descriptions and provide evidence that the effective temperature is an effective measure of the steady-state characteristics. Finally, we observe that the non-equilibrium descriptions of nuclear motion can give rise to the Landauer blowtorch effect via the emergence of multi-minima potential energy surfaces in conjunction with non-uniform temperature profiles. The Landauer blowtorch effect and its impact on the current characteristics, waiting times, and the Fano factor are explored for an effective adiabatic potential that morphs between a single, double, and triple potential as a function of voltage.},

  abstract = {Boosting nonlinear frequency-conversion efficiencies in hybrid metal–dielectric nanostructures generally requires the enhancement of optical fields that interact constructively with nonlinear dielectrics. Inevitably for localized surface plasmons, spectra subject to this enhancement tend to span narrowly. As a result, because of the spectral mismatch of resonant modes at frequencies participating in nonlinear optical processes, strong nonlinear signal generations endure the disadvantage of rapid degradations. Here, we experimentally design a multiband enhanced second-harmonic generation platform of three-dimensional metal–dielectric-metal nanocavities that consist of thin ZnO films integrated with silver mushroom arrays. Varying geometric parameters, we demonstrate that the introduction of ZnO materials in intracavity regions enables us to modulate fundamental-frequency-related resonant modes, resulting in strong coupling induced plasmon hybridization between localized and propagating surface plasmons. Meanwhile, ZnO materials can also serve as an efficient nonlinear dielectric, which provides a potential to obtain a well-defined coherent interplay between hybridized resonant modes and nonlinear susceptibilities of dielectric materials at multi-frequency. Finally, not only is the conversion efficiency of ZnO materials increased by almost two orders of magnitude with respect to hybrid un-pattered systems at several wavelengths over a 100-nm spectral range but also a hybrid plasmon-light coupling scheme in three-dimensional nanostructures can be developed.},

Here, we highlight recent developments of alternative approaches leading, from different perspectives, to estimators with a reduced variance compared to conventional binning. They all make use of the force acting on the particles, in addition to their position, and allow us to focus on the non-trivial part of the problem in order to alleviate (or even remove in some cases) the catastrophic behavior of histograms as the bin size decreases. The corresponding computational cost is negligible for molecular dynamics simulations, since the forces are already computed to generate the configurations, and the benefit of reduced-variance estimators is even larger when the cost of generating the latter is high, in particular, with ab initio simulations. The force sampling approach may result in spurious residual non-zero values of the density in regions where no particles are present, but strategies are available to mitigate this artifact. We illustrate this approach on number, charge, and polarization densities, radial distribution functions, and local transport coefficients, discuss the connections between the various perspectives, and suggest future challenges for this promising approach.},

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to parameterize a Frenkel–Kontorova model that provides analytic expressions for the limiting stress and activation energy for dislocation nucleation as a function of stress. Results from four commonly used hydrocarbon potentials are compared to show that the qualitative behavior is robust and estimate quantitative uncertainties. In all cases, the results can be described by an Eyring model with values of the zero-stress activation energy E a 0 ≈ 1.5 eV and activation volume V * ≈ 45 Å 3 that are consistent with the experimental results for increasingly crystalline materials.

In order to overcome the well-known limitations of mean-field electrostatics to capture polyelectrolyte complexation, the formation of ion pairs between anionic and cationic groups in the polyelectrolytes is explicitly modeled in our theory as an association reaction. This feature is essential to capture the microphase separation of the mixed brush and the formation of lateral aggregates triggered by polyelectrolyte complexation. The effects of solution pH and ionic strength, surface coverage, and chain length on the morphology of the mixed brush are systematically explored. It is shown that increasing salt concentration leads to the rupture of polyelectrolyte complexes and the stabilization of the homogeneous, non-aggregated brush, providing that the formation of ion pairs between the polyelectrolytes and the salt ions in solution is explicitly accounted for by the theory. The inclusion of ion-pairing association reactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes within a mean-field description of electrostatics emerges from this work as a useful and simple theoretical approach to capture the formation of polyelectrolyte complexes and their responsiveness to solution ionic strength and pH.},

Then, we insert the microscopic details of the underlying bead-spring model. Tuning the strength of the wall potential, the monomer density of confined polymer melts in equilibrium is kept at the bulk density even near the walls. In a weak confining regime, we observe the same conformational properties of chains as in the bulk melt showing that our confined polymer melts have reached their equilibrated state. Our methodology provides an efficient way of equilibrating large polymer films with different thicknesses and is not confined to a specific underlying microscopic model.

  abstract = {We investigate the behavior of two-dimensional systems that exhibit a transition between homogeneous and spatially inhomogeneous phases, which have spherical topology, and whose mechanical properties depend on the local value of the order parameter. One example of such a system is multicomponent lipid bilayer vesicles, which serve as a model to study cellular membranes. Under certain conditions, such bilayers separate into coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered regions. When arranged into the shape of small vesicles, this phase coexistence can result in spatial patterns that are more complex than the basic two-domain configuration encountered in typical bulk systems. The difference in bending rigidity between the liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered regions couples the shape of the vesicle to the local composition. We show that this interplay gives rise to a rich phase diagram that includes homogeneous, separated, and axisymmetric modulated phases that are divided by regions of spiral patterns in the surface morphology.},

  abstract = {The absorption spectra for face-centered cubic nanoparticle dimers at various interparticle distances are investigated using time-dependent density functional tight binding. Both homodimers and heterodimers are investigated in this work. By studying nanoparticles at various interparticle distances and analyzing their vertical excitations, we found that as the interparticle distance decreases, a red shift arises from contributions of the transition dipole moment that are aligned along the z -axis with nondegenerate features; blue shifts occur for peaks that originate from transition dipole moment components in the x and y directions with double degeneracy. When the nanoparticles are similar in size, the features in the absorption spectra become more sensitive to the interparticle distances. The best-fit curves from vertical excitation energy in the form of AR − b for ΔE redshift /ΔE blueshift vs R are determined. In this way, we determined trends for absorption peak shifts and how these depend on the interparticle distance.},

In situ x-ray excited photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates that the O 2 plasma oxidation of VO x N y films generates non-lattice N1s surface features with binding energies near 396.5 eV, which are associated with the nitrogen reduction reaction activity but not observed upon thermal oxidation. The NH 3 plasma generates N1s surface features near 400.5 eV binding energy. The O 2 +NH 3 plasma generates both types of N1s features. Annealing in UHV to &lt;1000 K reverses plasma-induced changes to N1s spectra. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations integrated with the experiments indicate that the plasma-induced N1s features at ∼396.5 eV and 400.5 eV are V≡N: and V—NH 2 sites, respectively, with significantly lower thermal stabilities than lattice N sites. These results provide practical insight regarding the plasma modification of MO x N y surfaces for important applications.},

  abstract = {The performance of organic light-emitting diodes based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters depends on the efficiency of reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) processes, which are promoted by a small energy gap between the lowest singlet (S 1 ) and triplet (T 1 ) excited states and large spin–orbit couplings. Recently, it was proposed that the introduction of secondary donor units into 2,3,4,5,6-penta(9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzonitrile (5CzBN) can significantly increase the mixing between triplet states with charge-transfer (CT) and local-excitation characteristics and consequently increase the spin–orbit couplings. Here, the results of long-range corrected density functional theory calculations show that the main impact on the RISC rates of substituting 5CzBN with secondary donors is due to a decrease in adiabatic singlet–triplet energy gaps and intramolecular reorganization energies rather than to a change in spin–orbit couplings. Our calculations underline that at least two singlet and three triplet excited states contribute to the ISC/RISC processes in 5CzBN and its derivatives. In addition, we find that in all emitters, the lowest singlet excited-state potential energy surface has a double-minimum shape.},

Here, we use surface photovoltage spectroscopy to study charge transfer in i -, n -, and p -GaN nanowire arrays on n + -Si wafers in the presence and absence of Rh/Cr 2 O 3 co-catalysts. The effect of the space charge layer and sub-bandgap defects on majority and minority carrier transport can be clearly observed, and estimates of the built-in potential of the junctions can be made. Transient illumination of the p -GaN/n + -Si junction generates up to −1.4 V surface photovoltage by carrier separation along the GaN nanowire axis. This process is central to the overall water-splitting function of the n + -Si/ p -GaN/Rh/Cr 2 O 3 nanowire array.

  abstract = {Understanding the temperature profile across a liquid–vapor interface in the presence of phase change is essential for the accurate prediction of evaporation, boiling, and condensation. It has been shown experimentally, from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and using molecular dynamics simulations, the existence of an inverted temperature profile across an evaporating liquid–vapor interface, where the vapor-side interface temperature observes the lowest value and the vapor temperature increases away from the interface, opposite to the direction of heat flow. It is worth noting, however, that an inverted temperature profile is not always the case from other experiments and simulations. In this study, we apply non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to systematically study the temperature profile across a liquid–vapor interface during phase change under various heat fluxes in a two-interface setting consisting of both an evaporating and a condensing interface. The calculated vapor temperature shows different characteristics inside the Knudsen layer and in the bulk vapor. In addition, both the direction and magnitude of the vapor temperature gradient, as well as the temperature jump at the liquid–vapor interface, are functions of the applied heat flux. The interfacial entropy generation rate calculated from the vibrational density of state of the interfacial liquid and vapor molecules shows a positive production during evaporation, and the results qualitatively agree with the predictions from non-equilibrium thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {High-performance photocathodes for many prominent particle accelerator applications, such as x-ray free-electron lasers, cannot be grown in situ . These highly reactive materials must be grown and then transported to the electron gun in an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) suitcase, during which time monolayer-level oxidation is unavoidable. Thin film Cs 3 Sb photocathodes were grown on a variety of substrates. Their performance and chemical state were measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after transport in a UHV suitcase as well as after O 2 -induced oxidation. The unusual chemistry of cesium oxides enabled trace amounts of oxygen to drive structural reorganization at the photocathode surface. This reorganization pulled cesium from the bulk photocathode, leading to the development of a structurally complex and O 2 -exposure-dependent cesium oxide layer. This oxidation-induced phase segregation led to downward band bending of at least 0.36 eV as measured from shifts in the Cs 3 d 5/2 binding energy. At low O 2 exposures, the surface developed a low work function cesium suboxide overlayer that had little effect on quantum efficiency (QE). At somewhat higher O 2 exposures, the overlayer transformed to Cs 2 O; no antimony or antimony oxides were observed in the near-surface region. The development of this overlayer was accompanied by a 1000-fold decrease in QE, which effectively destroyed the photocathode via the formation of a tunnel barrier. The O 2 exposures necessary for degradation were quantified. As little as 100 L of O 2 irreversibly damaged the photocathode. These observations are discussed in the context of the rich chemistry of alkali oxides, along with potential material strategies for photocathode improvement.},

It was found that the α-phase is completely converted to the β-phase by thermal annealing at 220 °C under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. When the α- to β-phase transition takes place, the surface roughness of the ZnPc film became flat uniformly with a nanometer order of unevenness by anisotropic growth of crystalline grains along a lateral direction to substrates. Correspondingly, the optical absorbance of the β-phase film became greater by 1.5–2 times than that of the α-phase one in an ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV–vis–NIR) wavelength range, which plays a role in increasing the number of photogenerated excitons. On the contrary, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements showed that the average lifetime of excitons for the β-phase film became shorter by 1/6–1/7 than that for the α-phase one, which plays a role in decreasing the number of excitons achieving the donor/acceptor interface where excitons are separated to carriers (holes and electrons). Both the increase in the number and the shortening in the average lifetime have a trade-off relationship with each other for contribution to the photoelectric conversion efficiency of OPVs. Then, we examined an external quantum efficiency ( EQE ) of OPVs using the α- and β-phase films as a donor and obtained that the former OPV (α-phase) exhibits a higher EQE by ∼2 times than the latter one (β-phase) in the wavelength range of 400 nm–800 nm.},

The effects of growth temperature and films’ thickness on the spontaneous polarization that develops within ASW films grown at 33 K–120 K on top of a Ru(0001) substrate are reported. Electric fields of ∼10 6 V/m are developed within the ASW films despite low average levels of molecular dipole alignment (&lt;0.01\%) normal to the substrate plane. Upon annealing, an irreversible morphology-dependent depolarization has been recorded, indicating that the ASW films keep a “memory” of their thermal history. We demonstrate that TP-∆CPD measurements can track the collapse of the porous structure at temperatures above the growth and the ASW-ice I c and ASW-ice I h transitions at 131 K and 157 K, respectively. These observations have interesting implications for physical and chemical processes that take place at the interstellar medium such as planetary formation and photon- and electron-induced synthesis of new molecules.},

Studying bulk reduced LTO, we could show recently that the formation of polaronic states can play a major role in explaining this improved conductivity. In this work, we extend our study toward the lithium-terminated LTO (111) surface. We investigate the formation of polarons by applying Hubbard-corrected density functional theory.

Iodine ions are unintentionally incorporated when the crystals are grown by the chemical-vapor-transport method with SnI 4 as the transport agent. The Sn 2 P 2 S 6 crystals consist of Sn 2+ ions and (P 2 S 6 ) 4− anionic groups. During growth, an iodine ion replaces a phosphorus in a few of the anionic groups, thus forming (IPS 6 ) 4− molecular ions. Following an exposure at low temperature to 633 nm laser light, these (IPS 6 ) 4− ions trap an electron and convert to EPR-active (IPS 6 ) 5− groups with S = 1/2. A concentration near 1.1 × 10 17 cm −3 is produced. The EPR spectrum from the (IPS 6 ) 5− ions has well-resolved structure resulting from large hyperfine interactions with the 127 I and 31 P nuclei. Analysis of the angular dependence of the spectrum gives principal values of 1.9795, 2.0123, and 2.0581 for the g matrix, 232 MHz, 263 MHz, and 663 MHz for the 127 I hyperfine matrix, and 1507 MHz, 1803 MHz, and 1997 MHz for the 31 P hyperfine matrix. Results from quantum-chemistry modeling (unrestricted Hartree–Fock/second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory) support the (IPS 6 ) 5− assignment for the EPR spectrum. The transient two-beam coupling gain can be improved in these photorefractive Sn 2 P 2 S 6 crystals by better controlling the point defects that trap charge.},

  abstract = {We investigate acoustic propagation in amorphous solids by constructing a projection formalism based on separating atomic vibrations into two, “phonon” (P) and “non-phonon” (NP), subspaces corresponding to large and small wavelengths. For a pairwise interaction model, we show the existence of a “natural” separation lengthscale, determined by structural disorder, for which the isolated P subspace presents the acoustic properties of a nearly homogenous (Debye-like) elastic continuum, while the NP one encapsulates all small scale non-affinity effects. The NP eigenstates then play the role of dynamical scatterers for the phonons. However, at variance with a conjecture of defect theories, their spectra present a finite low frequency gap, which turns out to lie around the Boson peak frequency, and only a small fraction of them are highly localized. We then show that small scale disorder effects can be rigorously reduced to the existence, in the Navier-like wave equation of the continuum, of a generalized elasticity tensor, which is not only retarded, since scatterers are dynamical, but also non-local. The full neglect of both retardation and non-locality suffices to account for most of the corrections to Born macroscopic moduli. However, these two features are responsible for sound speed dispersion and have quite a significant effect on the magnitude of sound attenuation. Although it remains open how they impact the asymptotic, large wavelength scaling of sound damping, our findings rule out the possibility of representing an amorphous solid by an inhomogeneous elastic continuum with the standard (i.e., local and static) elastic moduli.},

  abstract = {The thermal properties of β -Ga 2 O 3 can significantly affect the performance and reliability of high-power electronic devices. To date, due to the absence of a reliable interatomic potential, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been routinely used to probe the thermal properties of β -Ga 2 O 3 . DFT calculations can only tackle small-scale systems due to the huge computational cost, while the thermal transport processes are usually associated with large time and length scales. In this work, we develop a machine learning based Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for accurately describing the lattice dynamics of perfect crystalline β -Ga 2 O 3 and accelerating atomic-scale simulations. The GAP model shows excellent convergence, which can faithfully reproduce the DFT potential energy surface at a training data size of 32 000 local atomic environments. The GAP model is then used to predict ground-state lattice parameters, coefficients of thermal expansion, heat capacity, phonon dispersions at 0 K, and anisotropic thermal conductivity of β -Ga 2 O 3 , which are all in excellent agreement with either the DFT results or experiments. The accurate predictions of phonon dispersions and thermal conductivities demonstrate that the GAP model can well describe the harmonic and anharmonic interactions of phonons. Additionally, the successful application of our GAP model to the phonon density of states of a 2500-atom β -Ga 2 O 3 structure at elevated temperature indicates the strength of machine learning potentials to tackle large-scale atomic systems in long molecular simulations, which would be almost impossible to generate with DFT-based molecular simulations at present.},

The inclusion of the diatomic vibrational degree of freedom allows the investigation of transitions between different vibrational manifolds, in addition to those between different rotational, spin–orbit, and Λ-doublet states. This method is applied to the scattering of vibrationally excited NO( 2 Π) with Ar and H (with its spin ignored). The former has negligible vibrational inelasticity, thanks to the weak interaction between the two collisional partners. This conclusion justifies the commonly used two-dimensional approximation in treating NO scattering with rare gas atoms. The latter, on the other hand, is shown to undergo significant vibrational relaxation, even in the ultra-cold regime, owing to a chemically bonded (HNO) complex on the lowest-lying singlet potential energy surfaces.},

  abstract = {The rates of exciton transfer within dyads of perylene diimide and terrylene diimide connected by oligophenylene bridge units have been shown to deviate significantly from those of Förster’s resonance energy transfer theory, according to single molecule spectroscopy experiments. The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such a discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density functional theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between the exciton donor and the acceptor are estimated based on both the transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of the exciton to the bridge parts contributes to significant enhancement of donor–acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster’s spectral overlap expression.},

Modeling the kinetic-energy-dependent endothermic reactions to form PrH + (PrD + ) yields a 0 K bond dissociation energy (BDE) of 2.10 ± 0.05 eV for PrH + . Quantum chemical calculations were performed for PrH + at the B3LYP, BHLYP, PBE0, and coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple levels of theory, and they overestimate the PrH + experimental BDE by 0.06 –0.28 eV. The branching ratio of the PrH + and PrD + products in the HD reaction suggests that the reaction occurs via a direct reaction mechanism with short-lived intermediates. This is consistent with the theoretical calculations for the relaxed potential energy surfaces of PrH 2 + , where no strongly bound dihydride intermediates were found. The reactivity and PrH + BDE are compared with previous results for lanthanide metal cations (La + , Ce + , Sm + , Gd + , and Lu + ). Periodic trends across the lanthanide series and insights into the role of the electronic configuration on metal-hydride bond strength are discussed.},

The calculations are carried out in a valence-only framework using recently derived correlation consistent effective core potentials. Our primary goal is to understand the fixed-node diffusion QMC errors in both the ground and excited states with single-reference trial wave functions. Using a combination of methods, we demonstrate the very high accuracy of the QMC atomization energies being within ≈0.07 eV or better when compared with essentially exact results. By employing proper choices for trial wave functions, we have found that the fixed-node QMC biases for total energies are remarkably uniform ranging between 1\% and 3.5\% with absolute values at most ≈0.2 eV across the systems and several types of excitations such as singlets and triplets as well as low-lying and Rydberg-like states. Our results further corroborate that Si systems, and presumably also related main group IV and V elements of the periodic table (Ge, Sn, etc), exhibit some of the lowest fixed-node biases found in valence-only electronic structure QMC calculations.},

The non-symmetric structure of PMIDE renders a polarized distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals along the long axis of this acceptor moiety, which differentiates the electron coupling between the donor, attached at either the 1- or the 7-position, and the acceptor. We demonstrate that directional control of the photo-driven charge transfer process has been obtained by engineering the molecular structure of the light-harvesting antenna molecules.},

  abstract = {Superatoms have exciting properties, including diverse functionalization, redox activity, and magnetic ordering, so the resulting cluster-assembled solids hold the promise of high tunability, atomic precision, and robust architectures. By utilizing adamantane-like clusters as building blocks, a new class of superatoms N 4 Mg 6 M (M = Li, Na, K) is proposed here. The studied superalkalis feature low adiabatic ionization energies, an antibonding character in the interactions between magnesium and nitrogen atoms, and highly delocalized highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, the N 4 Mg 6 M superalkalis might easily lose their HOMO electrons when interacting with superhalogen electrophiles to form stable superatom [superalkali] + [superhalogen] − compounds. Moreover, the studied superalkalis interact strongly with carbon dioxide, and the resulting N 4 Mg 6 M/CO 2 systems represent two strongly interacting ionic fragments (i.e., N 4 Mg 6 M + and CO 2 − ). In turn, the electron affinity of the N 2 molecule (of −1.8 eV) is substantially lower than that observed for carbon dioxide (EA = −0.6 eV) and consequently, the N 2 was found to form the weakly bound [N 4 Mg 6 M][N 2 ] complex rather than the desired ionic [N 4 Mg 6 M] + [N 2 ] − product. Thus, the N 4 Mg 6 M superalkalis have high selectivity over N 2 when it comes to CO 2 reduction and also are themselves stable. We believe that the results described within this paper will be useful for understanding CO 2 activation, which is the first step for producing fuels from CO 2 . Moreover, we demonstrate that designing novel superatomic systems and exploring their physicochemical features might be used to create desirable functional materials.},

Furthermore, signals can be detected both coherently (C-2DES) and by fluorescence (F-2DES), with fundamental and practical differences. We directly compare the simultaneous measurements of four- and six-wave mixing C-2DES and F-2DES on an excitonic heterodimer of squaraine molecules. Spectral features are described in increasing orders of nonlinearity by an explicit excitonic model. We demonstrate that the four-wave-mixing spectra are sensitive to one-exciton energies, their delocalization and dynamics, while the six-wave-mixing spectra include information on bi-exciton and higher excited states including the state energies, electronic coupling, and exciton–exciton annihilation. We focus on the possibility to extract the dynamics arising from exciton–exciton interaction directly from the six-wave-mixing spectra. To this end, in analogy to previously demonstrated fifth-order coherently detected exciton–exciton-interaction 2DES (EEI2D spectroscopy), we introduce a sixth-order fluorescence-detected EEI2D spectroscopy variant.},

CT states often have small transition dipole moments, making them insensitive to other spectroscopic methods, but are particularly sensitive to Stark spectroscopy due to their large permanent dipole moment. In a previous study, we demonstrated a new experimental method, two-dimensional electronic Stark spectroscopy (2DESS), which combines two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and Stark spectroscopy. In order to understand how the presence of CT states manifest in 2DESS, here, we perform computational modeling and calculations of 2DESS as well as 2DES and Stark spectra, studying a photosynthetic dimer inspired by the photosystem II reaction center. We identify specific cases where qualitatively different sets of system parameters produce similar Stark and 2DES spectra but significantly different 2DESS spectra, showing the potential for 2DESS to aid in identifying CT states and their coupling to excitonic states.},

Exciton dynamics can be modified by annihilation processes, and different light propagation mechanisms can take place, such as active waveguiding and photon recycling. Since these various processes and mechanisms can lead to similar spectroscopic and microscopic signatures on comparable time scales, their discrimination is highly demanding. Here, we study individual organic single crystals grown from thiophene-based oligomers. We use time-resolved detection-beam scanning microscopy to excite a local singlet exciton population and monitor the subsequent broadening of the photoluminescence (PL) signal in space and on pico- to nanosecond time scales. Combined with Monte Carlo simulations, we were able to exclude photon recycling for our system, whereas leakage radiation upon active waveguiding leads to an apparent PL broadening of about 20\% compared to the initial excitation profile. Exciton–exciton annihilation becomes important at high excitation fluence and apparently accelerates the exciton dynamics leading to apparently increased diffusion lengths. At low excitation fluences, the spatiotemporal PL broadening results from singlet exciton diffusion with diffusion lengths of up to 210 nm. Surprisingly, even in structurally highly ordered single crystals, the transport dynamics is subdiffusive and shows variations between different crystals, which we relate to varying degrees of static and dynamic electronic disorders.},

Imaginary-time updates are computed by the stochastic sampling of the coupled cluster vector function: each term is evaluated as a randomly realized diagram in the connected expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. We highlight similarities and differences between deterministic and stochastic linked coupled cluster theory when the latter is re-expressed as a sampling of the diagrammatic expansion and discuss details of our implementation that allow for a walker-less realization of the stochastic sampling. Finally, we demonstrate that in the presence of locality, our algorithm can obtain a fixed errorbar per electron while only requiring an asymptotic computational effort that scales quartically with system size, independent of the truncation level in coupled cluster theory. The algorithm only requires an asymptotic memory cost scaling linearly, as demonstrated previously. These scaling reductions require no ad hoc modifications to the approach.},

Two mixed bath models are considered. In one, the bath consists of 190 N 2 and 10 Bz, whereas in the other bath, 396 N 2 and 4 Bz are utilized. The results are compared to results from 300 K simulations and experiments, revealing that Bz * –Bz vibration–vibration IET efficiency increased at low temperatures consistent with longer lived “chattering” collisions at lower temperatures. In the simulations, at the Bz * excitation energy of 150 kcal/mol, the averaged energy transferred per collision, ⟨Δ E c ⟩, for Bz * –Bz collisions is found to be ∼2.4 times larger in 140 K than in 300 K bath, whereas this value is ∼1.3 times lower for Bz * –N 2 collisions. The overall ⟨Δ E c ⟩, for all collisions, is found to be almost two times larger at 140 K compared to the one obtained from the 300 K bath. Such an enhancement of IET efficiency at 140 K is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observation. However, the possible reasons for not attaining a quantitative agreement are discussed. These results imply that the bath temperature and molecular composition as well as the magnitude of vibrational energy of a highly vibrationally excited molecule can shift the overall timescale of rethermalization.},

  abstract = {A new treatment is presented to account for the extreme anomalous centrifugal distortion displayed by the open-shell methylene radical. This new treatment is based on a four-dimensional approach in which both the overall rotation and the large amplitude bending mode are treated simultaneously. It accounts for the spin–rotation and spin–spin fine couplings, assumed to depend on the large amplitude bending coordinate, as well as for the hyperfine coupling. The new treatment is tested analyzing the available high-resolution data. 336 transitions, involving the ground and first excited vibrational states of the bending mode, are reproduced with a unitless standard deviation of 1.3, using 42 molecular constants. Compared to a previous analysis [S. Brünken et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 123 , 164315 (2005)], the present analysis is more satisfactory as it accounts for a larger dataset and the ratio of the number of data to the number of varied constants is larger. The present theoretical treatment also allows us to retrieve the bending potential and the main kinetic energy term.},

Time-dependent density functional theory can have the computational efficiency to allow for such calculations. However, the (semi-)local exchange-correlation approximations that are computationally most efficient fail to describe charge-transfer excitations reliably. We here investigate whether the inexpensive average density self-interaction correction (ADSIC) remedies the problem. For the systems that we study, ADSIC is even more prone to the charge-transfer problem than the local density approximation. We further explore the recently reported finding that the electrostatic potential associated with the chromophores’ protein environment in the light-harvesting complex 2 beneficially shifts spurious excitations. We find a great sensitivity on the chromophores’ atomistic structure in this problem. Geometries obtained from classical molecular dynamics are more strongly affected by the spurious charge-transfer problem than the ones obtained from crystallography or density functional theory. For crystal structure geometries and density-functional theory optimized ones, our calculations confirm that the electrostatic potential shifts the spurious excitations out of the energetic range that is most relevant for electronic coupling.},

  abstract = {Understanding phononic heat transport processes in molecular junctions is a central issue in the developing field of nanoscale heat conduction. Here, we present a Langevin dynamics simulation framework to investigate heat transport processes in molecular junctions at and beyond the linear response regime and apply it to saturated and unsaturated linear hydrocarbon chains connecting two gold substrates. Thermal boundary conditions represented by Markovian noise and damping are filtered through several (up to four) gold layers to provide a realistic and controllable bath spectral density. Classical simulations using the full universal force field are compared with quantum calculations that use only the harmonic part of this field. The close agreement found at about room temperature between these very different calculations suggests that heat transport at such temperatures is dominated by lower frequency vibrations whose dynamics is described well by classical mechanics. The results obtained for alkanedithiol molecules connecting gold substrates agree with previous quantum calculations based on the Landauer formula and match recent experimental measurements [e.g., thermal conductance around 20 pW/K for alkanedithiols in single-molecule junctions (SMJs)]. Heat conductance simulations on polyynes of different lengths illuminate the effects of molecular conjugation on thermal transport. The difference between alkanes and polyynes is not large but correlates with the larger rigidity and stronger mode localization that characterize the polyyne structure. This computational approach has been recently used [R. Chen, I. Sharony, and A. Nitzan, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 4261–4268 (2020)] to unveil local atomic heat currents and phononic interference effect in aromatic-ring based SMJs.},

Being an importance sampling based estimator, however, FEP suffers from a severe limitation: the requirement of sufficient overlap between distributions. One strategy to mitigate this problem, called Targeted FEP, uses a high-dimensional mapping in configuration space to increase the overlap of the underlying distributions. Despite its potential, this method has attracted only limited attention due to the formidable challenge of formulating a tractable mapping. Here, we cast Targeted FEP as a machine learning problem in which the mapping is parameterized as a neural network that is optimized so as to increase the overlap. We develop a new model architecture that respects permutational and periodic symmetries often encountered in atomistic simulations and test our method on a fully periodic solvation system. We demonstrate that our method leads to a substantial variance reduction in free energy estimates when compared against baselines, without requiring any additional data.},

Going forward, exascale computing poses new challenges to the efficient execution and management of MD simulations. The diversity and rapid developments of hardware architectures, software environments, and MD engines make it necessary that users can easily run benchmarks to optimally set up simulations, both with respect to time-to-solution and overall efficiency. To this end, we have developed the software MDBenchmark to streamline the setup, submission, and analysis of simulation benchmarks and scaling studies. The software design is open and as such not restricted to any specific MD engine or job queuing system. To illustrate the necessity and benefits of running benchmarks and the capabilities of MDBenchmark, we measure the performance of a diverse set of 23 MD simulation systems using GROMACS 2018. We compare the scaling of simulations with the number of nodes for central processing unit (CPU)-only and mixed CPU–graphics processing unit (GPU) nodes and study the performance that can be achieved when running multiple simulations on a single node. In all these cases, we optimize the numbers of message passing interface (MPI) ranks and open multi-processing (OpenMP) threads, which is crucial to maximizing performance. Our results demonstrate the importance of benchmarking for finding the optimal system and hardware specific simulation parameters. Running MD simulations with optimized settings leads to a significant performance increase that reduces the monetary, energetic, and environmental costs of MD simulations.},

A suite of schemes for computing and updating the auxiliary fields in FAMC simulations are developed in tandem to further enhance the computational efficiency of the method. The capacity of the FAMC method is demonstrated and tested against CMC simulations in simulating polymer solutions with explicit solvent under the canonical ( nVT ) ensemble and stress-free mircophase formation under the isothermal–isobaric ( nPT ) ensemble.

The scheme has been demonstrated in insulating, semiconducting, and magnetic nanoribbons of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, where the SEC tends to strengthen the individual π bonds, leading to transfer of charges from the edge to bulk. Additionally, in magnetic bipartite systems, the SEC tends to enhance inter-sublattice spin separation. The proposed scheme thus promises to enable the estimation of SEC of bandgaps of large systems without the need to explicitly calculate the SEC of KS single particle levels, which can be computationally prohibitively expensive.},

  abstract = {Explicit description of atomic polarizability is critical for the accurate treatment of inter-molecular interactions by force fields (FFs) in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aiming to investigate complex electrostatic environments such as metal-binding sites of metalloproteins. Several models exist to describe key monovalent and divalent cations interacting with proteins. Many of these models have been developed from ion–amino-acid interactions and/or aqueous-phase data on cation solvation. The transferability of these models to cation–protein interactions remains uncertain. Herein, we assess the accuracy of existing FFs by their abilities to reproduce hierarchies of thousands of Ca 2+ –dipeptide interaction energies based on density-functional theory calculations. We find that the Drude polarizable FF, prior to any parameterization, better approximates the QM interaction energies than any of the non-polarizable FFs. Nevertheless, it required improvement in order to address polarization catastrophes where, at short Ca 2+ –carboxylate distances, the Drude particle of oxygen overlaps with the divalent cation. To ameliorate this, we identified those conformational properties that produced the poorest prediction of interaction energies to reduce the parameter space for optimization. We then optimized the selected cation–peptide parameters using Boltzmann-weighted fitting and evaluated the resulting parameters in MD simulations of the N-lobe of calmodulin. We also parameterized and evaluated the CTPOL FF, which incorporates charge-transfer and polarization effects in additive FFs. This work shows how QM-driven parameter development, followed by testing in condensed-phase simulations, may yield FFs that can accurately capture the structure and dynamics of ion–protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic extrapolation has previously been used to predict arbitrary structural observables in molecular simulations at temperatures (or relative chemical potentials in open-system mixtures) different from those at which the simulation was performed. This greatly reduces the computational cost in mapping out phase and structural transitions. In this work, we explore the limitations and accuracy of thermodynamic extrapolation applied to water, where qualitative shifts from anomalous to simple-fluid-like behavior are manifested through shifts in the liquid structure that occur as a function of both temperature and density. We present formulas for extrapolating in volume for canonical ensembles and demonstrate that linear extrapolations of water’s structural properties are only accurate over a limited density range. On the other hand, linear extrapolation in temperature can be accurate across the entire liquid state. We contrast these extrapolations with classical perturbation theory techniques, which are more conservative and slowly converging. Indeed, we show that such behavior is expected by demonstrating exact relationships between extrapolation of free energies and well-known techniques to predict free energy differences. An ideal gas in an external field is also studied to more clearly explain these results for a toy system with fully analytical solutions. We also present a recursive interpolation strategy for predicting arbitrary structural properties of molecular fluids over a predefined range of state conditions, demonstrating its success in mapping qualitative shifts in water structure with density.},

  abstract = {Damped linear response calculations within the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) framework usually diverge in the x-ray regime. This divergent behavior stems from the valence ionization continuum in which the x-ray response states are embedded. Here, we introduce a general strategy for removing the continuum from the response manifold while preserving important spectral properties of the model Hamiltonian. The strategy is based on decoupling the core and valence Fock spaces using the core–valence separation (CVS) scheme combined with separate (approximate) treatment of the core and valence resolvents. We illustrate this approach with the calculations of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of benzene and para -nitroaniline using EOM-CCSD wave functions and several choices of resolvents, which differ in their treatment of the valence manifold. The method shows robust convergence and extends the previously introduced CVS-EOM-CCSD RIXS scheme to systems for which valence contributions to the total cross section are important, such as the push–pull chromophores with charge-transfer states.},

  abstract = {Many membrane proteins are modulated by external stimuli, such as small molecule binding or change in pH, transmembrane voltage, or temperature. This modulation typically occurs at sites that are structurally distant from the functional site. Revealing the communication, known as allostery, between these two sites is key to understanding the mechanistic details of these proteins. Residue interaction networks of isolated proteins are commonly used to this end. Membrane proteins, however, are embedded in a lipid bilayer, which may contribute to allosteric communication. The fast diffusion of lipids hinders direct use of standard residue interaction networks. Here, we present an extension that includes cofactors such as lipids and small molecules in the network. The novel framework is applied to three membrane proteins: a voltage-gated ion channel (KCNQ1), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR— β 2 adrenergic receptor), and a pH-gated ion channel (KcsA). Through systematic analysis of the obtained networks and their components, we demonstrate the importance of lipids for membrane protein allostery. Finally, we reveal how small molecules may stabilize different protein states by allosterically coupling and decoupling the protein from the membrane.},

  abstract = {Lead-halide perovskites have attracted much attention over the past decade, while two main issues, i.e., the lead-induced toxicity and materials’ instability, limit their further practice in widespread applications. To overcome these limitations, an effective alternative is to design lead-free perovskite materials with the substitution of two divalent lead ions with a pair of monovalent and trivalent metal ions. However, fundamental physics and chemistry about how tuning material’s composition affects the crystal phase, electronic band structures, and optoelectronic properties of the material have yet to be fully understood. In this work, we conducted a series of density functional theory calculations to explore the mechanism that how various monovalent metal ions influence the crystal and electronic structures of lead-free Cs 2 MBiCl 6 perovskites. We found that the Cs 2 MBiCl 6 (M = Ag, Cu, and Na) perovskites preferred a cubic double perovskite phase with low carrier effective masses, while the Cs 2 MBiCl 6 (M = K, Rb, and Cs) perovskites favored a monoclinic phase with relatively high carrier effective masses. The different crystal phase preferences were attributed to the different radii of monovalent metal cations and the orbital hybridization between the metal and Cl ions. The calculation showed that all Cs 2 MBiCl 6 perovskites studied here exhibited indirect bandgaps. Smaller bandgap energies for the perovskites with a cubic phase were calculated than those of the monoclinic phase counterparts. Charge density difference calculation and electron localization functional analysis were also conducted and revealed that the carrier mobility can be improved via changing the characteristics of metal-halide bonds through compositional and, thus, crystal structure tuning. Our study shown here sheds light on the future design and fabrication of various lead-free perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on assessing the possible impact of changes in hemoglobin (Hb) oxygenation on the state of water in its hydration shell as it contributes to red blood cell deformability. Microwave Dielectric Spectroscopy (MDS) was used to monitor the changes in interactions between water molecules and Hb, the number of water molecules in the protein hydration shell, and the dynamics of pre-protein water in response to the transition of Hb from the tense (T) to the relaxed (R) state, and vice versa. Measurements were performed for Hb solutions of different concentrations (5 g/dl–30 g/dl) in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Cole–Cole parameters of the main water relaxation peak in terms of interactions of water molecules (dipole–dipole/ionic dipole) during the oxygenation–deoxygenation cycle were used to analyze the obtained data. The water mobility—represented by α as a function of ln τ —differed dramatically between the R (oxygenated) state and the T (deoxygenated) state of Hb at physiologically relevant concentrations (30 g/dl–35 g/dl or 4.5 mM–5.5 mM). At these concentrations, oxygenated hemoglobin was characterized by substantially lower mobility of water in the hydration shell, measured as an increase in relaxation time, compared to deoxyhemoglobin. This change indicated an increase in red blood cell cytosolic viscosity when cells were oxygenated and a decrease in viscosity upon deoxygenation. Information provided by MDS on the intraerythrocytic water state of intact red blood cells reflects its interaction with all of the cytosolic components, making these measurements powerful predictors of the changes in the rheological properties of red blood cells, regardless of the cause.},

While the importance of moving beyond Butler–Volmer kinetics and incorporating the effect of electronic density of states of the electrode has been recognized, a unified framework that incorporates these aspects directly into electrochemical performance models is still lacking. In this work, we explicitly account for the density functional theory-calculated density of states numerically in calculating electrochemical reaction rates for a variety of electrode–electrolyte interfaces. We first show the utility of this for two cases related to Li metal electrodeposition and stripping on a Li surface and a Cu surface (anode-free configuration). The deviation in reaction rates is minor for cases with flat densities of states such as Li, but is significant for Cu due to nondispersive d -bands creating large variation. Finally, we consider a semiconducting case of a solid-electrolyte interphase consisting of LiF and Li 2 CO 3 and note the importance of the Fermi level at the interface pinned by the redox reaction occurring there. We identify the asymmetry in reaction rates as a function of discharge/charge naturally within this approach.},

Using molecular dynamics, we can pick apart the interface structure and understand surface tension. In this work, we derive an exact mechanical formulation of hydrodynamics for a liquid–vapor interface using a control volume, which moves with the surface. This mathematical framework provides the local definition of hydrodynamic fluxes at any point on the surface. These are represented not only by the flux of molecules and intermolecular interactions acting across the surface but also as a result of the instantaneous local curvature and movement of the surface itself. By explicitly including the surface dynamics in the equations of motion, we demonstrate an exact balance between kinetic and configurational pressure normal to the surface. The hydrodynamic analysis makes no assumptions regarding the probability distribution function, so it is valid for any system arbitrarily far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The presented equations provide a theoretical basis for the study of time-evolving interface phenomena, such as bubble nucleation, droplet dynamics, and liquid–vapor instabilities.},

By first-principles calculations, we show that temperature-driven SCO is preserved on both hexagonal boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), while low-spin ground states are locked on metal surfaces, including Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111). On the contrary, the molecule in contact with graphene exhibits a high-spin ground state. We demonstrate that the spin transition temperature T c depends critically on surface environments, and we correlate this effect with the modification of electronic structures and molecular vibrations upon adsorption. In particular, a sulfur vacancy in MoS 2 considerably increases T c . These findings open a way to nanoscale applications related to spin state bistability.},

  abstract = {Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation techniques at a constant electrode–electrolyte potential drop are employed to study the differential capacitance of a planar electric double layer in slit nanopores. According to the technique, a single randomly selected ion is exchanged between a simulation box and a reservoir. The probability of this step is given by the GCMC algorithm. To preserve the electroneutrality of the system after the ion exchange, the electrode charge is adequately modified, which produces electrode charge fluctuations. The charge fluctuations are used to calculate the differential capacitance of the double layer. Results for the ion distributions, electrode surface charge density, and differential capacitance in slit nanopores are reported for a symmetric system of +1:−1 ionic valences with a common ionic diameter of 0.4 nm at electrolyte concentrations of 0.2M, 1.0M, and 2.5M, pore widths of 0.6 nm, 0.8 nm, and 1.2 nm, a potential drop of 0.05 V, a relative permittivity of 78.5, and a temperature of 298.15 K. These results are compared with the corresponding data for a +1:−2 valence asymmetric system and a size asymmetric system with ionic diameters of 0.4 nm and 0.3 nm. The results show that with increasing electrolyte concentration, the range of confinement effects decreases. For divalent anions, the width dependence of electrode charge and differential capacitance reveals a maximum. The differential capacitance curves show a camel shape to bell shape transition as the electrolyte concentration increases. Asymmetry in both ionic valences and diameters leads to asymmetric capacitance curves.},

Specifically, by introducing “barriers” to the energy landscape at regular intervals along the transport path, we find that undesirable radiative recombination processes are suppressed due to a clear separation of sub-radiant and super-radiant eigenstates in the system. This, in turn, can lead to an improvement in transmitted power by many orders of magnitude, even for very long chains. From there, we analyze the robustness of this phenomenon to changes in both system and environment properties to show that this effect can be beneficial over a range of different thermal and optical environment regimes. Finally, we show that the novel energy landscape presented here may provide a useful foundation for overcoming the short length scales over which exciton diffusion typically occurs in organic photo-voltaics and other nanoscale transport scenarios, thus leading to considerable potential improvements in the efficiency of such devices.},

The storage shear modulus G′ shows a scaling behavior of G′(ω) ∼ ω n in the terminal (low-frequency) regime, where n varies between 1 and 2 and shows an increasingly anomalous departure from the expected value of 2 (Maxwell scaling) with increasing molecule content. A concomitant departure from the Maxwell scaling is also observed for the loss modulus G″ at frequencies above the G′–G″ crossover. On the other hand, the variation in the phase angle δ with the complex modulus indicates that the molecular liquid does not display a purely viscous response even at the lowest frequencies. These results, combined with an analysis of the relaxation spectra of these liquids, suggest that the anomalous behavior of molecular liquids may be linked to their rather broad relaxation spectrum and the presence of slow relaxation processes associated with molecular clusters. Additionally, these liquids are also characterized by a wide high-frequency plateau in the relaxation spectral density that can be linked to the rotational dynamics of the constituent molecules. Such fundamental differences between the rheological behavior of molecular and network liquids may explain the significantly higher fragility of the former.},

  abstract = {A novel mechanochemical method for the simulation of molecules and molecular crystals under hydrostatic pressure, the eXtended Hydrostatic Compression Force Field (X-HCFF) approach, is introduced. In contrast to comparable methods, the desired pressure can be adjusted non-iteratively and molecules of general shape retain chemically reasonable geometries even at high pressure. The implementation of the X-HCFF approach is straightforward, and the computational cost is practically the same as for regular geometry optimization. Pressure can be applied by using any desired electronic structure method for which a nuclear gradient is available. The results of the X-HCFF for pressure-dependent intramolecular structural changes in the investigated molecules and molecular crystals as well as a simple pressure-induced dimerization reaction are chemically intuitive and fall within the range of other established computational methods. Experimental spectroscopic data of a molecular crystal under pressure are reproduced accurately.},

  abstract = {This paper generalizes isomorph theory to systems that are not in thermal equilibrium. The systems are assumed to be R-simple, i.e., to have a potential energy that as a function of all particle coordinates R obeys the hidden-scale-invariance condition U ( R a ) &lt; U ( R b ) ⇒ U ( λ R a ) &lt; U ( λ R b ). “Systemic isomorphs” are introduced as lines of constant excess entropy in the phase diagram defined by density and systemic temperature, which is the temperature of the equilibrium state point with the average potential energy equal to U ( R ). The dynamics is invariant along a systemic isomorph if there is a constant ratio between the systemic and the bath temperature. In thermal equilibrium, the systemic temperature is equal to the bath temperature and the original isomorph formalism is recovered. The new approach rationalizes within a consistent framework previously published observations of isomorph invariance in simulations involving nonlinear steady-state shear flows, zero-temperature plastic flows, and glass-state isomorphs. This paper relates briefly to granular media, physical aging, and active matter. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the energy unit defining the reduced quantities should be based on the systemic rather than the bath temperature.},

  abstract = {The concept of the formation of a solute-sized cavity in a solvent is widely used in the theories of solvation processes; however, most of the studies of cavity formation using atomistic simulations were limited to water and hydrocarbon models. We calculated the Gibbs free energy of cavity formation Δ cav G for a structurally diverse set of 23 common organic solvents. For the calculation, molecular dynamics simulations of solvent boxes were conducted, and the Widom particle insertion method was applied. The results obtained with two different force fields for the same solvent were in good agreement with each other in most cases. The obtained cavity size dependences of Δ cav G allowed ranking the solvents by the free energy cost of creation of a cavity with a certain size. Surprisingly, this cost was somewhat higher in glycerol, formamide, and ethylene glycol than in water. In general, higher values of Δ cav G are observed for the solvents with a branched network of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and strongly polar aprotic solvents. The numerical results can be used to improve the accuracy of the calculation of the cavity term in non-aqueous continuum solvation models.},

Results were obtained by deep inelastic neutron scattering at the VESUVIO spectrometer at ISIS. We find that the effect of pressure is to increase the hydrogen nuclear mean kinetic energy with respect to ambient conditions, while ions in the solution have the opposite effect. These results confirm the recent state-of-the-art simulations of the nuclear hydrogen dynamics in water. The changes in the nuclear mean kinetic energy likely correspond to different isotopic fractionation values in the Challenger Deep compared to standard sea water.},

Such disorder, however, is hard to explore using standard ensemble measurements. In this paper, we report on the characterization of intra-aggregate structural disorder through a linewidth analysis of fluorescence excitation experiments on individual zinc-chlorin (ZnChl) nanotubular molecular aggregates. Recent experiments suggest an anomaly in the linewidths of the two absorption bands that dominate the spectra: the higher-energy bands on average show a smaller linewidth than the lower-energy bands. This anomaly is explored in this paper by analyzing and modeling the correlation of the two linewidths for each aggregate. We exploit a Frenkel exciton model to show that the experimentally observed correlation of linewidths and other statistical properties of the single-aggregate spectra can be explained from small variations of the molecular orientations within individual aggregates.},

Oscillator strengths and vertical excitation energies of the lowest 18 states have been computed using the average of the second- and third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction polarization propagator method and the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method at the level of singles and doubles model. These show that the bright valence transitions of ππ * -character are embedded into Rydberg transitions, whose oscillator strengths are at least one order of magnitude lower. To account for intensity borrowing, the first broad valence transition between 5.5 eV and 6.8 eV was simulated using a nuclear ensemble, and the agreement between experiment and theory is excellent. Whereas 23DHF only exhibits one broad valence transition followed by d/f Rydberg series converging to the ionization energy, the absorption spectrum of 25DHF has four bands, attributed to a valence n πσ → π * -transition, n πσ → 3p x,z /3d xz transitions, a second valence n π → π * -transition followed by d/f Rydberg series converging to the ionization energy, respectively. All Rydberg series converging to the ionization energy have been characterized in terms of their quantum defects.},

The features of VCs related to diabatic exciton states and interstate electronic couplings (Holstein and Peierls couplings, respectively) are interpreted by the VC density (VCD) analysis, which allows one to clarify the relationship between the chemical structure and VC as spatial contribution. It is found for the pentacene dimer face-to-edge configuration in a herringbone crystal that characteristic intermolecular vibrations with low frequencies exhibit strong Holstein couplings for the intermediate charge-transfer (CT) exciton states as well as Peierls couplings. From VCD analysis, the comprising density of the intermolecular CT and that of the intermolecular vibration are found to be constructively mixed in the intermolecular space, leading to the enhancement of VC. Moreover, in order to assess the chemical modification manner for controlling VC, we design several halogenated pentacene derivatives with slip-stack configurations. Our strategy to enhance VCD by halogenation is found to be rational, whereas the peaks of VC spectra for the CT states in the slip-stack packings are observed in high frequency regions. We compare their SF dynamics based on the quantum master equation explicitly including the exciton state-dependent VCs. From the analysis on relative relaxation factors between the adiabatic exciton states, their difference in the SF rate is highlighted by exciton configurations in addition to VCs. The present study is expected to be a first step toward efficient SF based on the design of VC in terms of both the chemical structure and intermolecular packing.},

The structures of neutral BaCl 2 (H 2 O) n clusters up to n = 8 were also investigated by theoretical calculations. It is found that in BaCl 2 (H 2 O) n −/0 , the Ba–Cl distances increase very slowly with the cluster size. The hydration process is not able to induce the breaking of a Ba–Cl bond in the cluster size range (n = 0–8) studied in this work. In small BaCl 2 (H 2 O) n clusters with n ≤ 5, the Ba atom has a coordination number of n + 2; however, in BaCl 2 (H 2 O) 6–8 clusters, the Ba atom coordinates with two Cl atoms and (n − 1) water molecules, and it has a coordination number of n + 1. Unlike the previously studied MgCl 2 (H 2 O) n − and CaCl 2 (H 2 O) n − , negative charge-transfer-to-solvent behavior has not been observed for BaCl 2 (H 2 O) n − , and the excess electron of BaCl 2 (H 2 O) n − is mainly localized on the Ba atom rather on the water molecules. No observation of Ba 2+ –Cl − separation in current work is consistent with the lower solubility of BaCl 2 compared to MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 . Considering the BaCl 2 /H 2 O mole ratio in the saturated solution, one would expect that about 20–30 H 2 O molecules are needed to break the first Ba–Cl bond in BaCl 2 .},

  abstract = {Interest in layered organohalide perovskites is motivated by their potential for use in optoelectronic devices. In these systems, the smallest and largest quantum wells are primarily concentrated near the glass and air interfaces of a film, thereby establishing a gradient in the average values of the bandgaps. It has been suggested that this layered architecture promotes the funneling of electronic excitations through space in a manner similar to light-harvesting processes in photosynthetic antennae. Whereas energy and charge transfer are difficult to distinguish by conventional transient absorption techniques, it has recently been shown that these competing relaxation mechanisms may be separately targeted with nonlinear fluorescence (NLFL) and photocurrent “action spectroscopies.” Here, we present perturbative rate functions to describe NLFL experiments conducted on layered perovskite systems. The formulas reproduce the patterns of resonances observed in experimental measurements and show how signatures of energy transfer manifest in two-dimensional spectra. Overall, this work suggests that NLFL spectroscopy may be used to fully reveal the trajectories of electronic excitations by correlating ultrafast energy transfer pathways to fluorescence emission from the thickest quantum wells.},

One important application is the direct inversion of a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum containing multiple overlapping anisotropic subspectra to obtain a distribution of the tensor parameters. Because of the ill-conditioned nature of this inverse problem, we investigate the use of the truncated singular value decomposition and the smooth least absolute shrinkage and selection operator based regularization methods, which (a) stabilize the solution and (b) promote sparsity and smoothness in the solution. We also propose an unambiguous representation for the anisotropy parameters using a piecewise polar coordinate system to minimize rank deficiency in the inversion kernel. To obtain the optimum tensor parameter distribution, we implement the k -fold cross-validation, a statistical learning method, to determine the hyperparameters of the regularized inverse problem. In this article, we provide the details of the linear-inversion method along with numerous illustrative applications on purely anisotropic NMR spectra, both synthetic and experimental two-dimensional spectra correlating the isotropic and anisotropic frequencies.},

Here, we present an active learning approach based on cluster analysis and inspired by Shannon information theory to enable semi-automated generation of informative training sets and robust machine learned force fields. The use of this tool is demonstrated for development of a model based on linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials explicitly describing up to four-body interactions, for a chemically and structurally diverse system of C/O under extreme conditions.

  abstract = {The free energy of transitions between stable states is the key thermodynamic quantity that governs the relative probabilities of the forward and reverse reactions and the ratio of state probabilities at equilibrium. The binding free energy of a drug and its receptor is of particular interest, as it serves as an optimization function for drug design. Over the years, many computational methods have been developed to calculate binding free energies, and while many of these methods have a long history, issues such as convergence of free energy estimates and the projection of a binding process onto order parameters remain. Over 20 years ago, the Jarzynski equality was derived with the promise to calculate equilibrium free energies by measuring the work applied to short nonequilibrium trajectories. However, these calculations were found to be dominated by trajectories with low applied work that occur with extremely low probability. Here, we examine the combination of weighted ensemble algorithms with the Jarzynski equality. In this combined method, an ensemble of nonequilibrium trajectories are run in parallel, and cloning and merging operations are used to preferentially sample low-work trajectories that dominate the free energy calculations. Two additional methods are also examined: (i) a novel weighted ensemble resampler that samples trajectories directly according to their importance to the work of work and (ii) the diffusion Monte Carlo method using the applied work as the selection potential. We thoroughly examine both the accuracy and efficiency of unbinding free energy calculations for a series of model Lennard-Jones atom pairs with interaction strengths ranging from 2 kcal/mol to 20 kcal/mol. We find that weighted ensemble calculations can more efficiently determine accurate binding free energies, especially for deeper Lennard-Jones well depths.},

  abstract = {We analyze the probability distribution of rare first passage times corresponding to transitions between product and reactant states in a kinetic transition network. The mean first passage times and the corresponding rate constants are analyzed in detail for two model landscapes and the double funnel landscape corresponding to an atomic cluster. Evaluation schemes based on eigendecomposition and kinetic path sampling, which both allow access to the first passage time distribution, are benchmarked against mean first passage times calculated using graph transformation. Numerical precision issues severely limit the useful temperature range for eigendecomposition, but kinetic path sampling is capable of extending the first passage time analysis to lower temperatures, where the kinetics of interest constitute rare events. We then investigate the influence of free energy based state regrouping schemes for the underlying network. Alternative formulations of the effective transition rates for a given regrouping are compared in detail to determine their numerical stability and capability to reproduce the true kinetics, including recent coarse-graining approaches that preserve occupancy cross correlation functions. We find that appropriate regrouping of states under the simplest local equilibrium approximation can provide reduced transition networks with useful accuracy at somewhat lower temperatures. Finally, a method is provided to systematically interpolate between the local equilibrium approximation and exact intergroup dynamics. Spectral analysis is applied to each grouping of states, employing a moment-based mode selection criterion to produce a reduced state space, which does not require any spectral gap to exist, but reduces to gap-based coarse graining as a special case. Implementations of the developed methods are freely available online.},

  abstract = {There are diverse reactions including spin-state crossing, especially the reactions catalyzed by transition metal compounds. To figure out the mechanisms of such reactions, the discussion of minimum energy intersystem crossing (MEISC) points cannot be avoided. These points may be the bottleneck of the reaction or inversely accelerate the reactions by providing a better pathway. It is of great importance to reveal their role in the reactions by computationally locating the position of the MEISC points together with the reaction pathway. However, providing a proper initial guess for the structure of the MEISC point is not as easy as that of the transition state. In this work, we extended the nudged elastic band (NEB) method for multiple spin systems, which is named the multiple spin-state NEB method, and it is successfully applied to find the MEISC points while optimizing the reaction pathway. For more precisely locating the MEISC point, a revised approach was adopted. Meanwhile, our examples also suggest that special attention should be paid to the criterion to define an image optimized as the MEISC point.},

  abstract = {Analytic energy gradients with respect to nuclear coordinates are derived and implemented for the self-consistent direct random phase approximation (sc-dRPA) method. In contrast to the more common non-self-consistent dRPA methods, the sc-dRPA method does not require a choice for the approach to generate the Kohn–Sham orbitals and eigenvalues serving as input for the dRPA correlation functional. The fact that the sc-dRPA total energy is variational facilitates the calculation of analytic gradients. The analytic gradients are tested against numerical ones and then used to calculate equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies for various molecules including weakly bonded dimers and transition metal compounds. The sc-dRPA method can compete in accuracy with Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of second order and with conventional density-functional methods within the generalized gradient approximation or of hybrid type. Indeed, sc-dRPA geometries and vibrational frequencies are most accurate in many cases. Moreover, the sc-dRPA method is robust in the sense that it is applicable to all considered molecules, whereas conventional density-functional methods are not applicable to dispersion bonded dimers, and Møller–Plesset perturbation theory of second order erroneously predicts a number of molecules to be unbound and yields completely wrong vibrational frequencies in some cases. The coupled cluster singles doubles methods yield geometries and vibrational frequencies of a quality that is inferior to that of the other considered methods.},

  abstract = {The variational fitting of the Fock potential employing localized molecular orbitals requires either the inversion of the local two-center Coulomb matrices or alternatively the solution of corresponding linear equation systems with these matrices. In both cases, the method of choice is the Cholesky decomposition of the formally positive definite local two-center Coulomb matrices. However, due to finite-precision round-off errors, the local Coulomb matrices may be indefinite, and thus, the Cholesky decomposition is not applicable. To overcome this problem, we propose to make use of a modified Cholesky decomposition based on the indefinite factorization of local two-center Coulomb matrices. To this end, the working equations for the use of the modified Cholesky decomposition within the variational fitting of the Fock potential are presented. Benchmark calculations with global and range-separated hybrid functionals show that the proposed method can improve considerably the workload balance in parallel calculations.},

BChl derivatives, which are excellent near-IR absorbing chromophores, are found to play a central role in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers but are rarely used in artificial solar energy harvesting systems. The optical properties of chemically linked BChl complexes can be tuned by varying the linking group and involving different ligated metal ions. We investigate charge transfer in BChl dyads that are either directly linked or through a phenylene ring (1,4-phenylene) and which are ligating Zn or Au ions. The directly linked dyads with a nearly perpendicular arrangement of the BChl units bear markedly different properties than phenylene linked dyads. In addition, we find that the dielectric dependence of the intramolecular CT rate is very strong in neutral Zn-ligated dyads, whereas cationic Au-ligated dyads show negligible dielectric dependence of the CT rate. Rate constants of the photo induced CT process are calculated at the semiclassical Marcus level and are compared to fully quantum mechanical Fermi’s golden rule based values. The rates are calculated using a screened range separated hybrid functional that offers a consistent framework for addressing environment polarization. We study solvated systems in two solvents of a low and a high scalar dielectric constant.},

To fully reap these benefits, it has been necessary to reformulate some of the most fundamental algorithms, including the Verlet list, pair searching, and cutoffs. Here, we present the heterogeneous parallelization and acceleration design of molecular dynamics implemented in the GROMACS codebase over the last decade. The setup involves a general cluster-based approach to pair lists and non-bonded pair interactions that utilizes both GPU and central processing unit (CPU) single instruction, multiple data acceleration efficiently, including the ability to load-balance tasks between CPUs and GPUs. The algorithm work efficiency is tuned for each type of hardware, and to use accelerators more efficiently, we introduce dual pair lists with rolling pruning updates. Combined with new direct GPU–GPU communication and GPU integration, this enables excellent performance from single GPU simulations through strong scaling across multiple GPUs and efficient multi-node parallelization.},

In practice, finite-basis-set representations of the ALIE exhibit seemingly irregular and sometimes dramatic deviations from the expected asymptotic behavior. We analyze the long-range behavior of the ALIE in finite basis sets and explain the puzzling observations.

  abstract = {State-specific orbital optimized approaches are more accurate at predicting core-level spectra than traditional linear-response protocols, but their utility had been restricted due to the risk of “variational collapse” down to the ground state. We employ the recently developed square gradient minimization [D. Hait and M. Head-Gordon, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16 , 1699 (2020)] algorithm to reliably avoid variational collapse and study the effectiveness of orbital optimized density functional theory (DFT) at predicting second period element 1s core-level spectra of open-shell systems. Several density functionals (including SCAN, B3LYP, and ω B97X-D3) are found to predict excitation energies from the core to singly occupied levels with high accuracy (≤0.3 eV RMS error) against available experimental data. Higher excited states are, however, more challenging by virtue of being intrinsically multiconfigurational. We thus present a configuration interaction inspired route to self-consistently recouple single determinant mixed configurations obtained from DFT, in order to obtain approximate doublet states. This recoupling scheme is used to predict the C K-edge spectra of the allyl radical, the O K-edge spectra of CO + , and the N K-edge of NO 2 with high accuracy relative to experiment, indicating substantial promise in using this approach for the computation of core-level spectra for doublet species [vs more traditional time dependent DFT, equation of motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD), or using unrecoupled mixed configurations]. We also present general guidelines for computing core-excited states from orbital optimized DFT.},

Additionally, new terms are introduced in the description of the semiclassical wavefunction that drastically improves the splitting estimates for certain systems. The method is based on the instanton theory and builds the semiclassical wavefunction of the vibrationally excited states from the ground-state instanton wavefunction along the minimum action path and its harmonic neighborhood. The splittings of excited states are thus obtained at a negligible added numerical effort. The cost is concentrated, as for the ground-state splittings, in the instanton path optimization and the hessian evaluation along the path. The method can thus be applied without modification to many mid-sized molecules in full dimensionality and in combination with on-the-fly evaluation of electronic potentials. The tests were performed on several model potentials and on the water dimer.},

The model has three atomic sites and a virtual site located on the ∠ HOH bisector (i.e., a TIP4P-type model). Pauli-repulsive interactions are represented using a Buckingham-type exponential decay potential. Dispersion interactions are represented by both C 6 / r 6 and C 8 / r 8 terms. This higher order C 8 dispersion term has been neglected by most force fields. The ForceBalance code was used to define parameters that optimally reproduce the experimental physical properties of liquid water. The resulting model is in good agreement with the experimental density, dielectric constant, enthalpy of vaporization, isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and radial distribution function. A graphical processing unit-accelerated implementation of this improved non-bonded potential can be employed in OpenMM without modification by using the CustomNonBondedForce feature. The efficient and automated parameterization of these non-bonded potentials provides a rational strategy to define a new molecular mechanical force field that treats repulsion and dispersion interactions more rigorously without major modifications to the existing simulation codes or a substantially larger computational cost.},

Identifying the essential residues and molecular features that regulate such interactions is paramount for understanding the biochemical process in question, allowing for suppression of a reaction through drug interventions or optimization of a chemical process using bioengineered molecules. In order to identify important residues and information pathways within molecular complexes, the dynamical network analysis method was developed and has since been broadly applied in the literature. However, in the dawn of exascale computing, this method is frequently limited to relatively small biomolecular systems. In this work, we provide an evolution of the method, application, and interface. All data processing and analysis are conducted through Jupyter notebooks, providing automatic detection of important solvent and ion residues, an optimized and parallel generalized correlation implementation that is linear with respect to the number of nodes in the system, and subsequent community clustering, calculation of betweenness of contacts, and determination of optimal paths. Using the popular visualization program visual molecular dynamics (VMD), high-quality renderings of the networks over the biomolecular structures can be produced. Our new implementation was employed to investigate three different systems, with up to 2.5M atoms, namely, the OMP-decarboxylase, the leucyl-tRNA synthetase complexed with its cognate tRNA and adenylate, and respiratory complex I in a membrane environment. Our enhanced and updated protocol provides the community with an intuitive and interactive interface, which can be easily applied to large macromolecular complexes.},

First, calculations of the Green’s function and the screened Coulomb interaction are decomposed into two parts: one is deterministic, while the other relies on stochastic sampling. Second, this separation allows constructing a subspace self-energy, which contains dynamic correlation from only a particular (spatial or energetic) region of interest. The methodology is exemplified on large-scale simulations of nitrogen-vacancy states in a periodic hBN monolayer and hBN-graphene heterostructure. We demonstrate that the deterministic embedding of strongly localized states significantly reduces statistical errors, and the computational cost decreases by more than an order of magnitude. The computed subspace self-energy unveils how interfacial couplings affect electronic correlations and identifies contributions to excited-state lifetimes. While the embedding is necessary for the proper treatment of impurity states, the decomposition yields new physical insight into quantum phenomena in heterogeneous systems.},

  abstract = {In light of the recently developed complete GJ set of single random variable stochastic, discrete-time Størmer–Verlet algorithms for statistically accurate simulations of Langevin equations [N. Grønbech-Jensen, Mol. Phys. 118 , e1662506 (2020)], we investigate two outstanding questions: (1) Are there any algorithmic or statistical benefits from including multiple random variables per time step and (2) are there objective reasons for using one or more methods from the available set of statistically correct algorithms? To address the first question, we assume a general form for the discrete-time equations with two random variables and then follow the systematic, brute-force GJ methodology by enforcing correct thermodynamics in linear systems. It is concluded that correct configurational Boltzmann sampling of a particle in a harmonic potential implies correct configurational free-particle diffusion and that these requirements only can be accomplished if the two random variables per time step are identical. We consequently submit that the GJ set represents all possible stochastic Størmer–Verlet methods that can reproduce time step-independent statistics of linear systems. The second question is thus addressed within the GJ set. Based on numerical simulations of complex molecular systems, as well as on analytic considerations, we analyze apparent friction-induced differences in the stability of the methods. We attribute these differences to an inherent, friction-dependent discrete-time scaling, which depends on the specific method. We suggest that the method with the simplest interpretation of temporal scaling, the GJ-I/GJF-2GJ method, be preferred for statistical applications.},

Large-scale motions of protein tertiary-structure elements, i.e., domains, are particularly intriguing as they are essential for the catalytic activity of many enzymes and for the functional cycles of protein machines and motors. Theoretical estimates suggest that domain motions should be very fast, occurring on the nanosecond or microsecond time scales. Indeed, free-energy barriers for domain motions are likely to involve salt bridges, which can break in microseconds. Experimental methods that can directly probe domain motions on fast time scales have appeared only in recent years. This Perspective discusses briefly some of these techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopies. We introduce a few recent studies that demonstrate ultrafast domain motions and discuss their potential roles. Particularly surprising is the observation of tertiary-structure element dynamics that are much faster than the functional cycles in some protein machines. These swift motions can be rationalized on a case-by-case basis. For example, fast domain closure in multi-substrate enzymes may be utilized to optimize relative substrate orientation. Whether a large mismatch in time scales of conformational dynamics vs functional cycles is a general design principle in proteins remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {Two or more liquid states may exist even for single-component substances, which is known as liquid polymorphism, and the transition between them is called liquid–liquid transition (LLT). On the other hand, the existence of two or more amorphous states is called polyamorphism, and the transition between them is called amorphous–amorphous transition (AAT). Recently, we have accumulated a lot of experimental and numerical evidence for LLT and AAT. These intriguing phenomena provide crucial information on the fundamental nature of liquid and amorphous states. Here, we review the recent progress in this field and discuss how we can physically rationalize the existence of two or more liquids (glasses) for a single-component substance. We also discuss the relationship between liquid-, amorphous-, and crystal-polymorphisms, putting a particular focus on the roles of thermodynamics, mechanics, and kinetics.},

  abstract = {The dissociation of ligands from proteins and other biomacromolecules occurs over a wide range of timescales. For most pharmaceutically relevant inhibitors, these timescales are far beyond those that are accessible by conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Consequently, to explore ligand egress mechanisms and compute dissociation rates, it is necessary to enhance the sampling of ligand unbinding. Random Acceleration MD (RAMD) is a simple method to enhance ligand egress from a macromolecular binding site, which enables the exploration of ligand egress routes without prior knowledge of the reaction coordinates. Furthermore, the τRAMD procedure can be used to compute the relative residence times of ligands. When combined with a machine-learning analysis of protein–ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs), molecular features that affect ligand unbinding kinetics can be identified. Here, we describe the implementation of RAMD in GROMACS 2020, which provides significantly improved computational performance, with scaling to large molecular systems. For the automated analysis of RAMD results, we developed MD-IFP, a set of tools for the generation of IFPs along unbinding trajectories and for their use in the exploration of ligand dynamics. We demonstrate that the analysis of ligand dissociation trajectories by mapping them onto the IFP space enables the characterization of ligand dissociation routes and metastable states. The combined implementation of RAMD and MD-IFP provides a computationally efficient and freely available workflow that can be applied to hundreds of compounds in a reasonable computational time and will facilitate the use of τRAMD in drug design.},

  abstract = {Permeation of small molecules through membranes is a fundamental biological process, and molecular dynamics simulations have proven to be a promising tool for studying the permeability of membranes by providing a precise characterization of the free energy and diffusivity. In this study, permeation of ethanol through three different membranes of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (POPS), PO-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), and PO-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) is studied. Permeabilities are calculated and compared with two different approaches based on Fick’s first law and the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model. Microsecond simulation of double bilayers of these membranes provided a direct measurement of permeability by a flux-based counting method. These simulations show that a membrane of POPC has the highest permeability, followed by POPE and POPS. Due to the membrane-modulating properties of ethanol, the permeability increases as functions of concentration and saturation of the inner leaflet in a double bilayer setting, as opposed to the customary definition as a proportionality constant. This concentration dependence is confirmed by single bilayer simulations at different ethanol concentrations ranging from 1\% to 18\%, where permeability estimates are available from transition-based counting and the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model. We show that the free energy and diffusion profiles for ethanol lack accuracy at higher permeant concentrations due to non-Markovian kinetics caused by collective behavior. In contrast, the counting method provides unbiased estimates. Finally, the permeabilities obtained from single bilayer simulations are combined to represent natural gradients felt by a cellular membrane, which accurately models the non-equilibrium effects on ethanol permeability from single bilayer simulations in equilibrium.},

  abstract = {We report a study of chromophore-catalyst assemblies composed of light harvesting hexabenzocoronene (HBC) chromophores axially coordinated to two cobaloxime complexes. The chromophore-catalyst assemblies were prepared using bottom-up synthetic methodology and characterized using solid-state NMR, IR, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Detailed steady-state and time-resolved laser spectroscopy was utilized to identify the photophysical properties of the assemblies, coupled with time-dependent DFT calculations to characterize the relevant excited states. The HBC chromophores tend to assemble into aggregates that exhibit high exciton diffusion length ( D = 18.5 molecule 2 /ps), indicating that over 50 chromophores can be sampled within their excited state lifetime. We find that the axial coordination of cobaloximes leads to a significant reduction in the excited state lifetime of the HBC moiety, and this finding was discussed in terms of possible electron and energy transfer pathways. By comparing the experimental quenching rate constant (1.0 × 10 9 s −1 ) with the rate constant estimates for Marcus electron transfer (5.7 × 10 8 s −1 ) and Förster/Dexter energy transfers (8.1 × 10 6 s −1 and 1.0 × 10 10 s −1 ), we conclude that both Dexter energy and Marcus electron transfer process are possible deactivation pathways in CoQD-A. No charge transfer or energy transfer intermediate was detected in transient absorption spectroscopy, indicating fast, subpicosecond return to the ground state. These results provide important insights into the factors that control the photophysical properties of photocatalytic chromophore-catalyst assemblies.},

Theoretically, the structure factor of Gaussian chains has been solved analytically, but for wormlike chains, numerical approaches are often used, such as Monte Carlo simulations, solving the modified diffusion equation. In these works, the structure factor needs to be calculated differently for different regions of the wave vector and chain rigidity, and some calculation processes are resource consuming. In this work, by training a deep neural network, we obtained an efficient model to calculate the structure factor of polymer chains, without considering different regions of wavenumber and chain rigidity. Furthermore, based on the trained neural network model, we predicted the contour and Kuhn lengths of some polymer chains by using scattering experimental data, and we found that our model can get pretty reasonable predictions. This work provides a method to obtain the structure factor for polymer chains, which is as good as previous and more computationally efficient. It also provides a potential way for the experimental researchers to measure the contour and Kuhn lengths of polymer chains.},

  abstract = {Programmable self-assembly is one of the most promising strategies for making ensembles of nanostructures from synthetic components. Yet, predicting the phase behavior that emerges from a complex mixture of many interacting species is difficult, and designing such a system to exhibit a prescribed behavior is even more challenging. In this article, I develop a mean-field model for predicting linker-mediated interactions between DNA-coated colloids, in which the interactions are encoded in DNA molecules dispersed in solution instead of in molecules grafted to particles’ surfaces. As I show, encoding interactions in the sequences of free DNA oligomers leads to new behavior, such as a re-entrant melting transition and a temperature-independent binding free energy per k B T . This unique phase behavior results from a per-bridge binding free energy that is a nonlinear function of the temperature and a nonmonotonic function of the linker concentration, owing to subtle entropic contributions. To facilitate the design of experiments, I also develop two scaling limits of the full model that can be used to select the DNA sequences and linker concentrations needed to program a specific behavior or favor the formation of a prescribed target structure. These results could ultimately enable the programming and tuning of hundreds of mutual interactions by designing cocktails of linker sequences, thus pushing the field toward the original goal of programmable self-assembly: these user-prescribed structures can be assembled from complex mixtures of building blocks through the rational design of their interactions.},

  abstract = {Improving the efficiency of photo-electrocatalytic cells depends on controlling the rates of interfacial electron transfer to promote the formation of long-lived charge separated states. Ultimately, for efficient catalytic assemblies to see widespread implementation, repeated electron transfer in the absence of charge recombination needs to be realized. In this study, a series of manganese-based transition metal complexes known to undergo charge transfer-induced spin crossover are employed to study how significant increases in inner-sphere reorganization energy affect the rates of interfacial electron transfer. Each complex is characterized by transient spectroscopic and electrochemical methods to calculate the rate of electron transfer to a model chromophore anchored to the surface of a TiO 2 film. Likewise, open-circuit voltage decay measurements were used to determine the voltage-dependent lifetime of injected electrons in TiO 2 in the presence of each complex. To further characterize the rates of electronic recombination, density functional theory was used to calculate the inner-sphere and outer-sphere reorganization energy for each complex. These calculations were then combined with classical Marcus theory to determine the theoretical rate of back-electron transfer from the TiO 2 conduction band. These results show that, in model complexes, a significant reduction in the recombination rate constant is achieved for complexes possessing a significant inner-sphere reorganization energy.},

Previous experiments have described defect–surface reactions for TiO 2 (110), but an atomistic picture of the mechanism remains unknown. The present work employs computations by density functional theory of the thermodynamic stabilities of metastable states to elucidate possible reaction pathways for oxygen interstitial atoms at TiO 2 (110). The simulations uncover unexpected metastable states including dumbbell and split configurations in the surface plane that resemble analogous interstitial species in the deep bulk. Comparison of the energy landscapes involving neutral (unionized) and charged intermediates shows that the Fermi energy E F exerts a strong influence on the identity of the most likely pathway. The largest elementary-step thermodynamic barrier for interstitial injection trends mostly downward by 2.1 eV as E F increases between the valence and conduction band edges, while that for annihilation trends upward by 2.1 eV. Several charged intermediates become stabilized for most values of E F upon receiving conduction band electrons from TiO 2 , and the behavior of these species governs much of the overall energy landscape.},

Further studies on the effects of loading amount, deposit types, titania crystalline type, and titania-particle size on the reaction order were also performed by LID analysis based on the proposed kinetic model.

  abstract = {We compare the surface structure of linear nanopores in amorphous silica (a-SiO 2 ) for different versions of “pore drilling” algorithms (where the pores are generated by the removal of atoms from the preformed bulk a-SiO 2 ) and for “cylindrical resist” algorithms (where a-SiO 2 is formed around a cylindrical exclusion region). After adding H to non-bridging O, the former often results in a moderate to high density of surface silanol groups, whereas the latter produces a low density. The silanol surface density for pore drilling can be lowered by a final dehydroxylation step, and that for the cylindrical resist approach can be increased by a final hydroxylation step. In this respect, the two classes of algorithms are complementary. We focus on the characterization of the chemical structure of the pore surface, decomposing the total silanol density into components corresponding to isolated and vicinal mono silanols and geminal silanols. The final dehyroxylation and hydroxylation steps can also be tuned to better align some of these populations with the target experimental values.},

  abstract = {Ammonia molecules have an important role in the radiation-induced chemistry that occurs on grains in the cold interstellar medium and leads to the formation of nitrogen containing molecules. Such grains and surfaces are primarily covered by water ices; however, these conditions allow the growth of solid ammonia films as well. Yet, solid ammonia know-how lags the vast volume of research that has been invested in the case of films of its “sibling” molecule water, which, in the porous amorphous phase, spontaneously form polar films and can cage coadsorbed molecules within their hydrogen-bonded matrix. Here, we report on the effect of growth temperature on the spontaneous polarization of solid ammonia films (leading to internal electric fields of ∼10 5 V/m) within the range of 30 K–85 K on top of a Ru(0001) substrate under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The effect of growth temperature on the films’ depolarization upon annealing was recorded as well. By demonstrating the ability of ammonia to cage coadsorbed molecules, as water does, we show that temperature-programmed contact potential difference measurements performed by a Kelvin probe and especially their temperature derivative can track film reorganization/reconstruction and crystallization at temperatures significantly lower than the film desorption.},

  abstract = {The enhancement mechanism due to the molecule–surface chemical interaction in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been characterized using a theoretical approach based on time dependent density functional theory. This includes a systematic study of the chemical mechanism (CM) to the SERS enhancement for halogen substituted benzenethiols interacting with a silver cluster. Changing the halogen on benzenethiol enables us to systematically modulate interactions between the benzenethiol ring and the metal cluster. We observe a decrease in the CM enhancement factor with an increase in the atomic number of the halogen for para- substitutions. For meta- substitutions, there is no such trend. However, the results scale linearly with the Hammett parameters for both meta and para halogens, which provides an important predictive tool for interpreting chemical enhancements. We also study the effect of solvation on the CM, showing that there is a systematic increase in enhancement with the increasing solvent dielectric constant. The correlation of CM with other properties, such as the amount of charge transfer between adsorbate and metal and the excitation energies of charge transfer states, is much less predictive than the Hammett parameter correlation.},

More specifically, the diffusion coefficient and hydrogen bond lifetime of interfacial water on the self-assembly monolayer composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups and their dependence on the mixing ratio are studied. The diffusion dramatically slows down, and the hydrogen bond lifetime considerably increases when a few hydrophilic groups are added to the hydrophobic surface. When the percentage of hydrophilic groups increases to 25\%, the behavior of interfacial water is similar to the case of the pure hydrophilic surface. The sensitivity to the hydrophilic group can be attributed to the fact that the grafted hydrophilic groups can not only retard the directly bound water molecules but also affect indirectly bound water by stabilizing hydrogen bonds among interfacial water molecules.},

The state-of-the-art technique of open space analysis using Ps revealed the detailed structure of the interfaces between MgO nanograins: ∼10 Å and ∼30 Å open spaces, participating in the chemisorption of B(OH) 4 − and BO 3 3− simultaneously with the physisorption of neutral B(OH) 3 molecules. Furthermore, in addition to the fraction of open spaces, a proton quasi-layer formed on the interior surfaces of the above-mentioned angstrom-scale open spaces was identified to be attributable for enhancing both the chemisorption and physisorption.},

Through conductance–voltage and temperature-dependent current–voltage characterization under a dark condition, we find that the Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 solar cell demonstrates good rectification and high temperature tolerance. The DLTS results indicates that there are two types of deep level hole traps H1 and H2 with active energy of 0.52 eV and 0.76 eV in the Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 film, and this defect property is further verified by ODLTS.

  abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures have found increasing utility due to the increased popularity that surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has achieved in recent years. SERS has been incorporated into an ever-growing list of applications, with bioanalytical and physiological analyses having emerged as two of the most popular. Thus far, the transition from SERS studies of cultured cells to SERS studies involving tissue has been gradual and limited. In most cases, SERS measurements in more intact tissue have involved nanoparticles distributed throughout the tissue or localized to specific regions via external functionalization. Performing highly localized measurements without the need for global nanoparticle uptake or specialized surface modifications would be advantageous to the expansion of SERS measurements in tissue. To this end, this work provides critical insight with supporting experimental evidence into performing SERS measurements with nanosensors inserted in tissues. We address two critical steps that are otherwise underappreciated when other approaches to performing SERS measurements in tissue are used. Specifically, we demonstrate two mechanical routes for controlled positioning and inserting the nanosensors into the tissue, and we discuss two means of focusing on the nanosensors both before and after they are inserted into the tissue. By examining the various combinations of these steps, we provide a blueprint for performing SERS measurements with nanosensors inserted in tissue. This blueprint could prove useful for the general development of SERS as a tool for bioanalytical and physiological studies and for more specialized techniques such as SERS-optophysiology.},

Here, we investigate the electronic and vibrational properties of 2D layered MoSe 2 intercalated with atomic manganese at ambient and high pressure up to 7 GPa by Raman scattering and electronic structure calculations. The behavior of optical phonons is studied experimentally with a diamond anvil cell and computationally through density functional theory calculations. Experiment and theory show excellent agreement in optical phonon behavior. The previously Raman inactive A 2 u mode is activated and enhanced with intercalation and pressure, and a new Raman mode appears upon decompression, indicating a possible onset of a localized structural transition, involving the bonding or trapping of the intercalant in 2D layered materials. Density functional theory calculations reveal a shift of the Fermi level into the conduction band and spin polarization in Mn x MoSe 2 that increases at low Mn concentrations and low pressure. Our results suggest that intercalation and pressurization of van der Waals materials may allow one to obtain dilute magnetic semiconductors with controllable properties, providing a viable route for the development of new materials for spintronic applications.},

The goal of this work was to investigate the properties of vapor-deposited glasses of this known polyamorphic system and to determine which liquid is formed when the glass is heated. We find that triphenyl phosphite forms a kinetically stable glass when prepared at substrate temperatures of 0.75–0.95T g , where T g is the glass transition temperature. Regardless of the substrate temperature utilized during deposition of triphenyl phosphite, heating a vapor-deposited glass always forms the ordinary supercooled liquid (liquid 1). The identity of liquid 1 was confirmed by both the calorimetric signal and the shape and position of the dielectric spectra. For the purposes of comparison, the glacial phase of triphenyl phosphite (liquid 2) was prepared by the conventional method of annealing liquid 1. We speculate that these new results and previous work on vapor deposition of other polyamorphic systems can be explained by the free surface structure being similar to one polyamorph even in a temperature regime where the other polyamorph is more thermodynamically stable in the bulk.},

For a reliable estimate of β K , the excess wing contribution has to be included in the spectral analysis. The relaxation stretching probed by PCS and NMR varies only weakly among the liquids ( β K = 0.58 ± 0.06). It is similar to that found in DS, provided that the liquid is sufficiently nonpolar (relaxation strength Δ ε ≲ 6 ⁠ ). For larger strengths, larger β K D S (narrowed relaxation spectra) are found when compared to those reported from NMR and PCS. Frequency–temperature superposition (FTS) holds for PCS and NMR. This is demonstrated by data scaling and, for the few glass formers for which results are available, by the equivalence of the susceptibilities χ P C S ″ ω τ ∝ χ N M R ″ τ ∝ χ N M R ″ ω ⁠ , i.e., measuring at a constant frequency is equivalent to measuring at a constant temperature or constant correlation time. In this context, a plot of the spin–lattice relaxation rate R 1 ( T ) as a function of the spin–spin relaxation rate R 2 ( T ) is suggested to reveal the stretching parameter without the need to perform frequency-dependent investigations. Dielectrically, we identify a trend of increasing deviations from FTS with increasing Δ ε . Depending on the technique and glass former, the relative relaxation strength of the excess wing varies, whereas its exponent appears to be method independent for a given substance. For polar liquids, we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between the results from PCS and NMR as compared to those from DS.},

Analysis of available data for bubble and droplet nucleation in Lennard-Jones fluid shows that the theory describes well the data by means of a single free parameter, the Gibbs–Tolman length of the planar liquid/vapor interface. It is found that this length is about one-tenth of the Lennard-Jones molecular-diameter parameter and that it is positive for the bubble nucleus and negative for the droplet nucleus. In a sufficiently narrow temperature range, the nucleation work, nucleus radius, scaled surface tension, and Gibbs–Tolman length are apparently universal functions of scaled overpressure.},

In the present work, we test whether this remarkable relation between the “fast” picosecond dynamics and the rate of structural relaxation τ α in these model amorphous and crystalline materials can be extended to the prediction of the local interfacial dynamics of model amorphous and crystalline films. Specifically, we simulate the free-standing amorphous Cu 64 Zr 36 and crystalline Cu films and find that the LM provides an excellent parameter-free prediction for τ α of the interfacial region. We also show that the Tammann temperature, defining the initial formation of a mobile interfacial layer, can be estimated precisely for both crystalline and glass-forming solid materials from the condition that the DWFs of the interfacial region and the material interior coincide.},

It allows fitting the typical super-Arrhenius temperature variation of the viscosity or dielectric relaxation time for various classes of glass-forming matter, over many decades.

  abstract = {The aqueous proton is a common and long-studied species in chemistry, yet there is currently intense interest devoted to understanding its hydration structure and transport dynamics. Typically described in terms of two limiting structures observed in gas-phase clusters, the Zundel H 5 O 2 + and Eigen H 9 O 4 + ions, the aqueous structure is less clear due to the heterogeneity of hydrogen bonding environments and room-temperature structural fluctuations in water. The linear infrared (IR) spectrum, which reports on structural configurations, is challenging to interpret because it appears as a continuum of absorption, and the underlying vibrational modes are strongly anharmonically coupled to each other. Recent two-dimensional IR (2D IR) experiments presented strong evidence for asymmetric Zundel-like motifs in solution, but true structure–spectrum correlations are missing and complicated by the anharmonicity of the system. In this study, we employ high-level vibrational self-consistent field/virtual state configuration interaction calculations to demonstrate that the 2D IR spectrum reports on a broad distribution of geometric configurations of the aqueous proton. We find that the diagonal 2D IR spectrum around 1200 cm −1 is dominated by the proton stretch vibrations of Zundel-like and intermediate geometries, broadened by the heterogeneity of aqueous configurations. There is a wide distribution of multidimensional potential shapes for the proton stretching vibration with varying degrees of potential asymmetry and confinement. Finally, we find specific cross peak patterns due to aqueous Zundel-like species. These studies provide clarity on highly debated spectral assignments and stringent spectroscopic benchmarks for future simulations.},

  abstract = {Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were utilized to show that Schrage theory predicts evaporation/condensation mass fluxes with good accuracy in the case of monoatomic and non-polar molecular fluids. Here, we examine if they are equally accurate for molecular polar fluids, such as water. In particular, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we study the steady state evaporation/condensation processes of water in a one-dimensional heat-pipe geometry to ascertain the validity of Schrage relationships. Non-equilibrium mass flow is driven by controlling the temperatures of the source/sink. Equilibrium simulations are utilized to evaluate the saturation properties and the mass accommodation coefficients as a function of temperature. Our results indicate that Schrage equations predict the evaporation/condensation rates of water with good accuracy. Moreover, we show that molecular velocity distributions in the vapor phase are indeed Maxwellian distributions shifted by the velocity of the macroscopic vapor flow, as assumed in Schrage’s theoretical analysis.},

  abstract = {A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to study the propagation of soundwaves in a fluid. Soundwaves are generated by a sinusoidally oscillating wall and annihilated by a locally applied Langevin thermostat near the opposite wall. The waveform changes from sinusoidal to sawtooth with increasing wave amplitude. For low-frequency sounds, the simulation results show a very good agreement with Burgers’s equation without any fitting parameters. In contrast, for high-frequency sounds, significant deviations are obtained because of acoustic streaming. The speed of sound can be directly determined from the Fourier transform of a waveform with high accuracy. Although obtaining the attenuation rate directly from the simulation results is difficult because of the nonlinear effects of the wave amplitude, it can be estimated via Burgers’s equation. The results demonstrate that MD simulations are a useful tool for the quantitative analysis of soundwaves.},

  abstract = {Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the structural and vibrational properties of the surfaces of sodo-silicate glasses depend on the sodium content as well as the nature of the surface. Two types of glass surfaces are considered: A melt-formed surface (MS) in which a liquid with a free surface has been cooled down into the glass phase and a fracture surface (FS) obtained by tensile loading of a glass sample. We find that the MS is more abundant in Na and non-bridging oxygen atoms than the FS and the bulk glass, whereas the FS has higher concentration of structural defects such as two-membered rings and under-coordinated Si than the MS. We associate these structural differences to the production histories of the glasses and the mobility of the Na ions. It is also found that for Na-poor systems, the fluctuations in composition and local atomic charge density decay with a power-law as a function of distance from the surface, while Na-rich systems show an exponential decay with a typical decay length of ≈2.3 Å. The vibrational density of states shows that the presence of the surfaces leads to a decrease in the characteristic frequencies in the system. The two-membered rings give rise to a pronounce band at ≈880 cm −1 , which is in good agreement with experimental observations.},

  abstract = {We perform classical molecular dynamics simulations of polycrystalline ice at 250 K using the TIP4P/Ice model. The structures of polycrystalline ice are prepared by growing ice particles in supercooled water. An order parameter developed recently is used to characterize local structures in terms of the liquid–liquid phase transition scenario. It is shown that the grain boundaries and triple junctions in ice are structurally similar to low-density liquid water in which most water molecules form four hydrogen bonds and the O–O–O angles deviate from the tetrahedral angle of 109.47°. The thickness of the grain boundaries is ∼1 nm. The diffusion coefficient of water molecules along the grain boundaries calculated in this study, 5.0 × 10 −13 m 2 s −1 , is in good agreement with experimental data. The diffusion along the triple junctions is 3.4 times faster than that along the grain boundaries. We model the grain size dependence of diffusivity of water molecules in polycrystalline ice using the simulation results and find that the impact of the grain boundaries and the triple junctions on the diffusivity is negligible for typical polycrystalline ice samples having grain sizes of the order of millimeters. We also demonstrate that the properties of the grain boundaries are quite different from those of the ice/vapor interface at the same temperature: the quasi-liquid layer at the ice/vapor interface is similar to high-density liquid water and the diffusion coefficient along the ice/vapor interface is two orders of magnitude larger than that along the grain boundaries.},

When considering short time nonergodic trajectory segments of a longer ergodic trajectory, we observe that, independent of the potentials and densities, the apparent diffusivity follows Arrhenius behavior until low temperatures. Comparing the two potentials, where the ergodic diffusivities are known to be rather different, we find that the short-time nonergodic part is similar throughout the temperature range. By including a correlation factor in the nonergodic diffusivity, a rescaled value is calculated, which provides a reasonable estimate of the true ergodic diffusivity. The true diffusion coefficient and the correction factor collapse to a master plot for all densities at any given time interval. Hence, our results confirm a strong connection between fragility and dynamical correlation.},

The high-resolution threshold photoelectron spectrum of HO 2 in the 11 eV–12 eV energy range is acquired without interferences from other species and assigned with the aid of theoretically calculated adiabatic ionization energies (AIEs) and Franck–Condon factors. The three vibrational modes of the radical cation HO 2 + , the H–O stretch, the H–O–O bend, and the O–O stretch, have been identified, and their individual frequencies are measured. In addition, the AIEs of the X 3 A″ ground state and the a 1 A′ first excited electronic state of HO 2 + are experimentally determined at 11.359 ± 0.003 eV and 11.639 ± 0.005 eV, respectively, in agreement with high-level theoretically computed results. Furthermore, the former AIE value provides validation of thermochemical networks used to extract the enthalpy of formation of the HO 2 radical.},

A cold Ne + ensemble was embedded in Ca + Coulomb crystals by a sympathetic laser cooling technique, while cold acetonitrile (CH 3 CN) molecules were produced by two types of Stark velocity filters to widely change the translational temperatures. The measured reaction rate constant gradually increases with the decrease in the translational temperature of the velocity-selected CH 3 CN molecules from 60 K down to 2 K, and thereby, a steep increase was observed at temperatures lower than 5 K. A comparison between experimental rate constants and the ion–dipole capture rate constants by the Perturbed Rotational State (PRS) theory was performed. The PRS capture rate constant reproduces well the reaction rate constant at a few kelvin but not for temperatures higher than 5 K. The result indicates that the reaction probability is small compared to typical ion–polar molecule reactions at temperatures above 5 K.},

Herein, we present a comprehensive analysis of these helical states at the tight-binding level. We demonstrate that, in general, the molecular orbital coefficients of the helical states trace out an ellipse, in analogy to elliptically polarized light. Helical states can be realized in a model, inspired by the structure of cumulene, which considers a chain terminated by sp 2 -hybridized atoms oriented at a nontrivial dihedral angle. We provide a complete analytic solution for this model. Additionally, we present a variation of the model that yields perfect helical states that trace out a circle as opposed to an ellipse.

New higher resolution wavelength-resolved emission (WRE) spectra covering a wider spectral range have been recorded for many of these C 3 Ar bands, which show that most of the features observed in fluorescence must be reassigned as emission from the C 3 fragment. Two types of VP processes have been recognized. The first type gives rise to vibrationally hot C 3 fragments, mostly following |Δv| = 1, |ΔP| = 1 propensity rules, where P is the vibronic angular momentum of C 3 . The second type gives vibrationally cooled fragments. The VP processes can change abruptly from one type to the other with comparatively small differences in vibrational energy. Although the initial states are associated with both orbital components of the C 3 , A ̃ 1 Π u state, most of the VP fragments belong to the lower orbital component. A dipole-induced dipole model has been used to interpret the observed ΔP- propensities. Ab initio calculations of the binding energies of the ground and excited electronic states of C 3 Ar have been carried out; the calculated values are consistent with estimates of ≤144 cm −1 and 164 cm −1 , respectively, given by the WRE spectra.},

Basis sets from cc-pVDZ to cc-pV5Z are used, totaling up to 500 orbitals and a Hilbert space of 10 32 Slater determinants for the largest molecules. For each basis, an extrapolated energy well within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol or 1.6 mHa/mol) of the exact energy for that basis is computed using only a tiny fraction of the entire Hilbert space. We also use our almost exact energies to benchmark energies from the coupled cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. The energies are extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and compared to the experimental atomization energies. The extrapolations are done both without and with a basis-set correction based on density-functional theory. The mean absolute deviations from experiment for these extrapolations are 0.46 kcal/mol and 0.51 kcal/mol, respectively. Orbital optimization methods used to obtain improved convergence of the SHCI energies are also discussed.},

A significant reduction in the computational cost of exact exchange is demonstrated relative to the conventional approach due to avoiding the need to evaluate four-center two-electron integrals, with sub-millihartree/atom errors in absolute HF energies and good cancellation of fitting errors in relative energies. The novel aspects of the evaluation of the Coulomb contribution to the Fock operator, such as the use of real two-center multipole expansions and spheropole-compensated unit cell densities, are also described.},

  abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) belongs to the most accurate simulation techniques for quantum many-particle systems. However, for fermions, these simulations are hampered by the sign problem that prohibits simulations in the regime of strong degeneracy. The situation changed with the development of configuration path integral Monte Carlo (CPIMC) by Schoof et al. [Contrib. Plasma Phys. 51 , 687 (2011)] that allowed for the first ab initio simulations for dense quantum plasmas [Schoof et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 , 130402 (2015)]. CPIMC also has a sign problem that occurs when the density is lowered, i.e., in a parameter range that is complementary to traditional QMC formulated in coordinate space. Thus, CPIMC simulations for the warm dense electron gas are limited to small values of the Brueckner parameter—the ratio of the interparticle distance to the Bohr radius— r s = r ¯ / a B ≲ 1 ⁠ . In order to reach the regime of stronger coupling (lower density) with CPIMC, here we investigate additional restrictions on the Monte Carlo procedure. In particular, we introduce two different versions of “restricted CPIMC”—called RCPIMC and RCPIMC+—where certain sign changing Monte Carlo updates are being omitted. Interestingly, one of the methods (RCPIMC) has no sign problem at all, but it introduces a systematic error and is less accurate than RCPIMC+, which neglects only a smaller class of the Monte Carlo steps. Here, we report extensive simulations for the ferromagnetic uniform electron gas with which we investigate the properties and accuracy of RCPIMC and RCPIMC+. Furthermore, we establish the parameter range in the density–temperature plane where these simulations are both feasible and accurate. The conclusion is that RCPIMC and RCPIMC+ work best at temperatures in the range of Θ = k B T / E F ∼ 0.1…0.5, where E F is the Fermi energy, allowing to reach density parameters up to r s ∼ 3…5, thereby partially filling a gap left open by existing ab initio QMC methods.},

  abstract = {Electron–phonon coupling plays a central role in the transport properties and photophysics of organic crystals. Successful models describing charge- and energy-transport in these systems routinely include these effects. Most models for describing photophysics, on the other hand, only incorporate local electron–phonon coupling to intramolecular vibrational modes, while nonlocal electron–phonon coupling is neglected. One might expect nonlocal coupling to have an important effect on the photophysics of organic crystals because it gives rise to large fluctuation in the charge-transfer couplings, and charge-transfer couplings play an important role in the spectroscopy of many organic crystals. Here, we study the effects of nonlocal coupling on the absorption spectrum of crystalline pentacene and 7,8,15,16-tetraazaterrylene. To this end, we develop a new mixed quantum–classical approach for including nonlocal coupling into spectroscopic and transport models for organic crystals. Importantly, our approach does not assume that the nonlocal coupling is linear, in contrast to most modern charge-transport models. We find that the nonlocal coupling broadens the absorption spectrum non-uniformly across the absorption line shape. In pentacene, for example, our model predicts that the lower Davydov component broadens considerably more than the upper Davydov component, explaining the origin of this experimental observation for the first time. By studying a simple dimer model, we are able to attribute this selective broadening to correlations between the fluctuations of the charge-transfer couplings. Overall, our method incorporates nonlocal electron–phonon coupling into spectroscopic and transport models with computational efficiency, generalizability to a wide range of organic crystals, and without any assumption of linearity.},

However, in recent years, the targets of spectroscopic studies are shifting toward flexible molecules, characterized by a large number of closely spaced energy minima, all contributing to the overall spectrum. Here, artificial intelligence comes into play since it is at the basis of powerful unsupervised techniques for the exploration of soft degrees of freedom. Integration of such algorithms with a two-stage QM/QM′ (Quantum Mechanical) exploration/refinement strategy driven by a user-friendly graphical interface is the topic of the present paper. We will address in particular: (i) the performances of different semi-empirical methods for the exploration step and (ii) the comparison between stochastic and meta-heuristic algorithms in achieving a cheap yet complete exploration of the conformational space for medium sized chromophores. As test cases, we choose three amino acids of increasing complexity, whose full conformer enumeration has been reached only very recently. Next, we show that systems in condensed phases can be treated at the same level and with the same efficiency when employing a polarizable continuum description of the solvent. Finally, the challenging issue represented by the vibrational circular dichroism spectra of some rhodium complexes with flexible ligands has been addressed, showing that our fully unsupervised approach leads to remarkable agreement with the experiment.},

We contrast the ability of ML-FF for reconstructing dynamic and thermodynamic observables to MM-FFs in order to gain a qualitative understanding of the differences between the two approaches.

In this work, we give a comprehensive description of how such a state can be learned from given samples of a potentially unknown target state and show how regression approaches based on Bayesian inference can be used to compress a target state into a highly compact and accurate GPS representation. By application of a type II maximum likelihood method based on relevance vector machines, we are able to extract many-body configurations from the underlying Hilbert space, which are particularly relevant for the description of the target state, as support points to define the GPS. Together with an introduced optimization scheme for the hyperparameters of the model characterizing the weighting of modeled correlation features, this makes it possible to easily extract physical characteristics of the state such as the relative importance of particular correlation properties. We apply the Bayesian learning scheme to the problem of modeling ground states of small Fermi–Hubbard chains and show that the found solutions represent a systematically improvable trade-off between sparsity and accuracy of the model. Moreover, we show how the learned hyperparameters and the extracted relevant configurations, characterizing the correlation of the wave function, depend on the interaction strength of the Hubbard model and the target accuracy of the representation.},

  abstract = {Permeation of many small molecules through lipid bilayers can be directly observed in molecular dynamics simulations on the nano- and microsecond timescale. While unbiased simulations provide an unobstructed view of the permeation process, their feasibility for computing permeability coefficients depends on various factors that differ for each permeant. The present work studies three small molecules for which unbiased simulations of permeation are feasible within less than a microsecond, one hydrophobic (oxygen), one hydrophilic (water), and one amphiphilic (ethanol). Permeabilities are computed using two approaches: counting methods and a maximum-likelihood estimation for the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion (ISD) model. Counting methods yield nearly model-free estimates of the permeability for all three permeants. While the ISD-based approach is reasonable for oxygen, it lacks precision for water due to insufficient sampling and results in misleading estimates for ethanol due to invalid model assumptions. It is also demonstrated that simulations using a Langevin thermostat with collision frequencies of 1/ps and 5/ps yield oxygen permeabilities and diffusion constants that are lower than those using Nosé–Hoover by statistically significant margins. In contrast, permeabilities from trajectories generated with Nosé–Hoover and the microcanonical ensemble do not show statistically significant differences. As molecular simulations become more affordable and accurate, calculation of permeability for an expanding range of molecules will be feasible using unbiased simulations. The present work summarizes theoretical underpinnings, identifies pitfalls, and develops best practices for such simulations.},

While widely invoked in inverse-problem studies, the utility of the theorem has not been quantitatively scrutinized to any large degree. We show that Henderson’s theorem has practical shortcomings for disordered and ordered phases for certain densities and temperatures. Using proposed sensitivity metrics, we identify illustrative cases in which distinctly different potential functions give very similar pair correlation functions and/or structure factors up to their corresponding correlation lengths. Our results reveal that due to a limited range and precision of pair information in either direct or reciprocal space, there is effective ambiguity of solutions to inverse problems that utilize pair information only, and more caution must be exercised when one claims the uniqueness of any resulting effective pair potential found in practice. We have also identified systems that possess virtually identical pair statistics but have distinctly different higher-order correlations. Such differences should be reflected in their individually distinct dynamics (e.g., glassy behaviors). Finally, we prove a more general version of Henderson’s theorem that extends the uniqueness statement to include potentials that involve two- and higher-body interactions.},

This is particularly palpable for complex systems like G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) whose ligand unbinding typically requires very long timescales oftentimes inaccessible by standard molecular dynamics simulations. Enhanced sampling methods offer a useful alternative, and their efficiency can be further improved by using machine learning tools to identify optimal reaction coordinates. Here, we test the combination of two machine learning techniques, automatic mutual information noise omission and reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling, with infrequent metadynamics to efficiently study the unbinding kinetics of two classical drugs with different RTs in a prototypic GPCR, the μ-opioid receptor. Dissociation rates derived from these computations are within one order of magnitude from experimental values. We also use the simulation data to uncover the dissociation mechanisms of these drugs, shedding light on the structures of rate-limiting transition states, which, alongside metastable poses, are difficult to obtain experimentally but important to visualize when designing drugs with a desired kinetic profile.},

A fully microscopic derivation of Langevin equations for self-diffusiophoretic particles powered by chemical reactions catalyzed asymmetrically by the colloid is given in this paper. The derivation provides microscopic expressions for the translational and rotational friction tensors, as well as reaction rate coefficients appearing in the Langevin equations. The diffusiophoretic force and torque are expressed in terms of nonequilibrium averages of fluid fields that satisfy generalized transport equations. The results provide a description of active motion on small scales where descriptions in terms of coarse grained continuum fluid equations combined with boundary conditions that account for the presence of the colloid may not be appropriate.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is often used for simulating extended materials such as infinite crystals or surfaces, under periodic boundary conditions (PBCs). In such calculations, when the simulation cell has non-zero charge, electrical neutrality has to be imposed, and this is often done via a uniform background charge of opposite sign (“jellium”). This artificial neutralization does not occur in reality, where a different mechanism is followed as in the example of a charged electrode in electrolyte solution, where the surrounding electrolyte screens the local charge at the interface. The neutralizing effect of the surrounding electrolyte can be incorporated within a hybrid quantum–continuum model based on a modified Poisson–Boltzmann equation, where the concentrations of electrolyte ions are modified to achieve electroneutrality. Among the infinite possible ways of modifying the electrolyte charge, we propose here a physically optimal solution, which minimizes the deviation of concentrations of electrolyte ions from those in open boundary conditions (OBCs). This principle of correspondence of PBCs with OBCs leads to the correct concentration profiles of electrolyte ions, and electroneutrality within the simulation cell and in the bulk electrolyte is maintained simultaneously, as observed in experiments. This approach, which we call the Neutralization by Electrolyte Concentration Shift (NECS), is implemented in our electrolyte model in the Order- N Electronic Total Energy Package (ONETEP) linear-scaling DFT code, which makes use of a bespoke highly parallel Poisson–Boltzmann solver, DL _ MG . We further propose another neutralization scheme (“accessible jellium”), which is a simplification of NECS. We demonstrate and compare the different neutralization schemes on several examples.},

  abstract = {Up-conversion of infrared (IR) to visible light is demonstrated via an unconventional two-step process combining second harmonic generation with photoluminescence. This is achieved in a composite material formed by single crystals of KH 2 PO 4 (KDP), in which CdTe/CdS quantum dots (QDs) are embedded during a crystal growth. The second harmonic generation from the IR laser frequency in KDP takes place, and then, generated light is absorbed by QDs and luminescence is emitted. Compared to the most common up-converting materials based on lanthanide ions, our novel composites use only abundant elements and have several other properties with application potential: the excitation and emission can cover a broader spectral range, and the response is much faster (ns compared to ms) and is strongly dependent on the direction of the incident beam.},

  abstract = {The quantum many-body problem in condensed phases is often simplified using a quasiparticle description, such as effective mass theory for electron motion in a periodic solid. These approaches are often the basis for understanding many fundamental condensed phase processes, including the molecular mechanisms underlying solar energy harvesting and photocatalysis. Despite the importance of these effective particles, there is still a need for computational methods that can explore their behavior on chemically relevant length and time scales. This is especially true when the interactions between the particles and their environment are important. We introduce an approach for studying quasiparticles in condensed phases by combining effective mass theory with the path integral treatment of quantum particles. This framework incorporates the generally anisotropic electronic band structure of materials into path integral simulation schemes to enable modeling of quasiparticles in quantum confinement, for example. We demonstrate the utility of effective mass path integral simulations by modeling an exciton in solid potassium chloride and electron trapping by a sulfur vacancy in monolayer molybdenum disulfide.},

Restrained locally enhanced sampling (RLES) is found to explore the space of configurations with an efficiency comparable to that of temperature replica exchange. To demonstrate the potential of RLES for realistic applications, the method is used to fold the 12-residue tryptophan zipper miniprotein in explicit solvent.

The infamous mechanical instability of molecular electronic junctions critically limits performance and lifespan and raises questions as to the technological viability of single-molecule electronics. Here, we propose a practical scheme for cooling the molecular vibrational temperature via application of an AC voltage over a large, static operational DC voltage bias. Using nonequilibrium Green’s functions, we computed the viscosity and diffusion coefficient experienced by nuclei surrounded by a nonequilibrium ”sea” of periodically driven, current-carrying electrons. The effective molecular junction temperature is deduced by balancing the viscosity and diffusion coefficients. Our calculations show the opportunity of achieving in excess of 40\% cooling of the molecular junction temperature while maintaining the same average current.},

While it has become clear that low-order density correlations do not provide a complete representation of an atomic environment, the exponential increase in the number of possible N -body invariants makes it difficult to design a concise and effective representation. We discuss how to exploit recursion relations between equivariant features of different order (generalizations of N -body invariants that provide a complete representation of the symmetries of improper rotations) to compute high-order terms efficiently. In combination with the automatic selection of the most expressive combination of features at each order, this approach provides a conceptual and practical framework to generate systematically improvable, symmetry adapted representations for atomistic machine learning.},

Ultrafast photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is a novel approach that has been widely applied to probe plasmonic nanostructures from multiple domains. Furthermore, PEEM is the only technique that provides nanometer spatial resolution, sub-femtosecond temporal resolution, and tens to hundreds of millielectron volt energy resolution. This allows for extremely sensitive observations of plasmonic field oscillations, field dephasing, and hot electrons. This Perspective provides a brief overview of the basic principles and main applications of ultrafast PEEM. The research progress of ultrafast PEEM in plasmonics is highlighted from three points of view: near-field imaging, near-field spectroscopy, and ultrafast dynamics. Future applications of PEEM in plasmonics for the probing of plasmonic hot electron dynamics in the energy and time domains are proposed and discussed.},

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is related to the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have caused the previous outbreaks. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive drug target due to its essential roles in the viral life cycle. As a cysteine protease, PLpro is rich in cysteines and histidines, and their protonation/deprotonation modulates catalysis and conformational plasticity. Here, we report the pK a calculations and assessment of the proton-coupled conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpros using the recently developed graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated implicit-solvent continuous constant pH molecular dynamics method with a new asynchronous replica-exchange scheme, which allows computation on a single GPU card. The calculated pK a ’s support the catalytic roles of the Cys–His–Asp triad. We also found that several residues can switch protonation states at physiological pH among which is C270/271 located on the flexible blocking loop 2 (BL2) of SARS-CoV-2/CoV PLpro. Simulations revealed that the BL2 can open and close depending on the protonation state of C271/270, consistent with the most recent crystal structure evidence. Interestingly, despite the lack of an analogous cysteine, BL2 in MERS-CoV PLpro is also very flexible, challenging a current hypothesis. These findings are supported by the all-atom fixed-charge simulations and provide a starting point for more detailed studies to assist the structure-based design of broad-spectrum inhibitors against CoV PLpros.},

The evolution of equilibrium and dynamic properties with NP loading, total packing fraction, and strength of interfacial attraction is systematically studied based on a minimalist model. Structural predictions of polymer reference interaction site model integral equation theory are employed to establish the rich behavior of the interfacial cohesive force density, surface excess, and a measure of free volume as a function of PNC variables. The glassy dynamic shear modulus is predicted to be softened, reinforced, or hardly changed relative to the pure polymer melt depending on system parameters, as a result of the competing and qualitatively different influences of interfacial cohesion (physical bonding), free volume, and entropic depletion on dynamic localization and shear elasticity. The localization of polymer segments is the dominant factor in determining bulk PNC softening and reinforcement effects for moderate to strong interfacial attractions, respectively. While in the athermal entropy-dominated regime, the primary origin of mechanical reinforcement is the stress stored in the aggregated NP subsystem. The PNC shear modulus is often qualitatively correlated with the segment localization length but with notable exceptions. The present work provides the foundation for developing a theory of segmental relaxation, T g changes, and collective NP dynamics in PNCs based on a self-consistent treatment of the cooperative activated motions of segments and NPs.},

Here, we report an interesting, counter-intuitive observation that interfacial triplet energy transfer from QDs is not retarded but rather enabled by an insulating shell. Specifically, photoluminescence of red-emitting CdSe QDs could not be quenched by surface-anchored Rhodamine B molecules; in contrast, after ZnS shell coating, their emission was effectively quenched. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the shell eliminates ultrafast hole trapping in the QDs and hence opens up the triplet exciton transfer pathway. The triplet energy of Rhodamine B can be reversely transferred back to QDs by thermal activation, or it can be passed to triplet acceptors in the solution. Capitalizing on the latter, we demonstrate red-to-blue photon upconversion based on QD-sensitized triplet–triplet annihilation with an efficiency of 2.8\% and an anti-Stokes shift of 1.13 eV.},

The atomic partial charges in GAFF and the second generation of GAFF (GAFF2) were originally developed with the quantum mechanics derived restrained electrostatic potential charge, but in practice, users usually adopt an efficient charge method, Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections (AM1-BCC), based on which, without expensive ab initio calculations, the atomic charges could be efficiently and conveniently obtained with the ANTECHAMBER module implemented in the AMBER software package. In this work, we developed a new set of BCC parameters specifically for GAFF2 using 442 neutral organic solutes covering diverse functional groups in aqueous solution. Compared to the original BCC parameter set, the new parameter set significantly reduced the mean unsigned error (MUE) of hydration free energies from 1.03 kcal/mol to 0.37 kcal/mol. More excitingly, this new AM1-BCC model also showed excellent performance in the solvation free energy (SFE) calculation on diverse solutes in various organic solvents across a range of different dielectric constants. In this large-scale test with totally 895 neutral organic solvent–solute systems, the new parameter set led to accurate SFE predictions with the MUE and the root-mean-square-error of 0.51 kcal/mol and 0.65 kcal/mol, respectively.

A scattering program has been implemented to carry out calculations of RA cross sections, accounting for coupled dynamics on the lowest ionic and the lowest neutral diabatic 1 Σ + states. The study shows that the non-adiabatic treatment gives a cross section that exceeds that of conventional adiabatic dynamics by one to four orders of magnitude. The contribution to the RA rate constant from Na and Cl approaching each other in the A 1 Π state has also been computed using an established quantum mechanical method. Ab initio data from the literature have been used for the potential energy curves, the diabatic coupling, and the electric dipole moments of NaCl.},

The nanocrystal electronic structure and rates of these processes are calculated using time-dependent density functional theory. Comparison with the H-passivated Si nanocrystal shows that the bromine coating, despite having less electronegativity, affects the electronic structure and transition rates more than the chlorine one due to the stronger structural perturbations caused by the greater surface atoms. Certain electron–hole asymmetry in both of the considered multi-carrier processes is revealed for the Br-coated silicon nanocrystal: the processes become faster if initiated by holes and slower (or invariable on the whole) if initiated by electrons. On the contrary, the chlorine coating weakly influences the multi-carrier processes.},

The potential provides an equally good fit of the laser induced fluorescence Fourier transform spectroscopic data of Pashov et al. [Phys. Rev.

The new potential is supported by the good agreement of the well parameters D e , R e and the harmonic vibrational constant ω e with combining-rule estimates. The scattering lengths for all six isotopologues are also in excellent agreement with experiment with a 0.2\% adjustment within theoretical uncertainty of the leading dispersion coefficient C 6 . An analysis of the harmonic vibrational constant ω e and the constant ω e x e of the potential of Pashov et al. reveals a significant difference to the present potential which turned out to be due to an oscillatory deviation in their potential in the vicinity of the potential minimum. The new potential is, thus, the best available because its simplicity is ideal for further applications.},

This is aimed at sensitizing the population of annihilating optically dark triplets that generates the high energy photoluminescence. A large resonance between the involved triplets is usually recommended because it increases the energy gain between absorbed and emitted upconverted photons. However, it also enables efficient back-ET from acceptor to donor triplets, with potential detrimental consequences on the system performance. Here, we analyze a model system, where the energy difference between donor and acceptor triplets is lower than k B T at room temperature by means of time resolved and steady state photoluminescence spectroscopy, and develop a kinetic model, which describes the iterative loop that transfers the triplet exciton between the donor and acceptor molecules. In such a way, we obtained the guidelines for the optimization of the system composition required to overcome the back-ET effect and maximize the upconversion quantum yield.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive description of the spin dynamics underlying the formation of Ortho -Deuterium Induced Polarization (ODIP) is presented. ODIP can serve as a tool for enhancing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) signals of 2 H nuclei, being important probes of molecular structure and dynamics. To produce ODIP, in the first step, the D 2 gas is brought to thermal equilibrium at low temperature, here 30 K, so that the ortho -component, corresponding to the total spin of the 2 H nuclei equal to 0 and 2, is enriched, here to 92\%. In the second step, the orthodeuterium molecule is attached to a substrate molecule using a suitable hydrogenation catalyst such that the symmetry of the two 2 H nuclei is broken. As a result, the non-thermal spin order of orthodeuterium is converted into enhancement of observable NMR signals. In this work, we perform a theoretical study of ODIP and calculate the shape of ODIP spectra and their dependence on the magnetization flip angle. These results are compared with experiments performed for a number of substrates; good agreement between experimental and calculated ODIP spectra is found. We also discuss the performance of NMR techniques for converting anti-phase ODIP spectral patterns into in-phase patterns, which are more suitable for signal detection and for transferring ODIP to heteronuclei, here to 13 C spins. Experimental procedures reported here allowed us to reach signal enhancement factors of more than 1000 for 2 H nuclei in the liquid phase. These results are useful for extending the scope of spin hyperpolarization to the widely used 2 H nuclei.},

Here, we describe in detail the PTTP fabrication method and report a statistical analysis based on 530 PTTPs’ and 185 ordinary gold micropyramids’ templates. Our results indicate that the PTTP method generates probes with an apex diameter smaller than 30 nm on 92.4\% of the batch, which is a parameter directly related to the achievable TERS spatial resolution. Moreover, the PTTPs’ nanopyramid edge size L , a critical parameter for LSPR spectral tuning, shows variability typically smaller than 12.5\%. The PTTP’s performance was tested in TERS experiments performed on graphene, and the results show a spectral enhancement of up to 72-fold, which is at least one order of magnitude higher than that typically achieved with gold micropyramids. Imaging resolution is in the order of 20 nm.},

Here, going beyond the static approximation, we compute the dynamical correction of the electron–hole screening for molecular excitation energies, thanks to a renormalized first-order perturbative correction to the static BSE excitation energies. The present dynamical correction goes beyond the plasmon-pole approximation as the dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction is computed exactly within the random-phase approximation. Our calculations are benchmarked against high-level (coupled-cluster) calculations, allowing one to assess the clear improvement brought by the dynamical correction for both singlet and triplet optical transitions.},

Here, we pursue a generalized mathematical model and cellular automata simulations to study the dynamics of infectious diseases and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 spread. Our model is inspired by the theory of coupled chemical reactions to treat multiple parallel reaction pathways. We essentially ask the question: how hard could the time evolution toward the desired herd immunity (HI) be on the lives of people? We demonstrate that the answer to this question requires the study of two implicit functions, which are determined by several rate constants, which are time-dependent themselves. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. We attempt to study and quantify possible adverse effects of the progression rate of the epidemic on the recovery rates of vulnerables, in the course of attaining HI. We find the important result that slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, slower progress toward HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.},

These methods operate by sampling the probability density of a system along a small set of suitable collective variables (CVs), which is, in turn, expressed in the form of a free energy surface (FES). This definition of the FES can capture the relative stability of metastable states but not that of the transition state because the barrier height is not invariant to the choice of CVs. Free energy barriers therefore cannot be consistently computed from the FES. Here, we present a simple approach to calculate the gauge correction necessary to eliminate this inconsistency. Using our procedure, the standard FES as well as its gauge-corrected counterpart can be obtained by reweighing the same simulated trajectory at little additional cost. We apply the method to a number of systems—a particle solvated in a Lennard-Jones fluid, a Diels–Alder reaction, and crystallization of liquid sodium—to demonstrate its ability to produce consistent free energy barriers that correctly capture the kinetics of chemical or physical transformations, and discuss the additional demands it puts on the chosen CVs. Because the FES can be converged at relatively short (sub-ns) time scales, a free energy-based description of reaction kinetics is a particularly attractive option to study chemical processes at more expensive quantum mechanical levels of theory.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules have been widely adopted in biomedical studies. As classical point-charge models continue to be used in routine biomolecular applications, there have been growing demands on developing polarizable force fields for handling more complicated biomolecular processes. Here, we focus on a recently proposed polarizable Gaussian Multipole (pGM) model for biomolecular simulations. A key benefit of pGM is its screening of all short-range electrostatic interactions in a physically consistent manner, which is critical for stable charge-fitting and is needed to reproduce molecular anisotropy. Another advantage of pGM is that each atom’s multipoles are represented by a single Gaussian function or its derivatives, allowing for more efficient electrostatics than other Gaussian-based models. In this study, we present an efficient formulation for the pGM model defined with respect to a local frame formed with a set of covalent basis vectors. The covalent basis vectors are chosen to be along each atom’s covalent bonding directions. The new local frame can better accommodate the fact that permanent dipoles are primarily aligned along covalent bonds due to the differences in electronegativity of bonded atoms. It also allows molecular flexibility during molecular simulations and facilitates an efficient formulation of analytical electrostatic forces without explicit torque computation. Subsequent numerical tests show that analytical atomic forces agree excellently with numerical finite-difference forces for the tested system. Finally, the new pGM electrostatics algorithm is interfaced with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) implementation in Amber for molecular simulations under the periodic boundary conditions. To validate the overall pGM/PME electrostatics, we conducted an NVE simulation for a small water box of 512 water molecules. Our results show that to achieve energy conservation in the polarizable model, it is important to ensure enough accuracy on both PME and induction iteration. It is hoped that the reformulated pGM model will facilitate the development of future force fields based on the pGM electrostatics for applications in biomolecular systems and processes where polarization plays crucial roles.},

The multi-reference coupled-cluster approaches are based on the effective Hamiltonian formulation providing a two-step procedure, in which dynamic correlation effects can be efficiently evaluated by the wave operator, while nondynamic correlation contributions are given by diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian in the final step. There are two classical multi-reference coupled-cluster formulations. In this paper, the focus is on the so-called Fock-space coupled-cluster method in its basic version with one- and two-particle operators in the exponent. Computational schemes using this truncation of the cluster operator have been successfully applied in calculations in one- and two-valence sectors of the Fock space. In this paper, we show that the approach can be easily extended and effectively employed in the three-valence sector calculations.},

  abstract = {Recently, the first laser spectroscopy measurement of the radioactive RaF molecule has been reported by Ruiz et al. [Nature 581 , 396 (2020)]. This and similar molecules are considered to search for the new physics effects. The radium nucleus is of interest as it is octupole-deformed and has close levels of opposite parity. The preparation of such experiments can be simplified if there are reliable theoretical predictions. It is shown that the accurate prediction of the hyperfine structure of the RaF molecule requires to take into account the finite magnetization distribution inside the radium nucleus. For atoms, this effect is known as the Bohr–Weisskopf (BW) effect. Its magnitude depends on the model of the nuclear magnetization distribution which is usually not well known. We show that it is possible to express the nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure constant in terms of one magnetization distribution dependent parameter: BW matrix element for 1 s -state of the corresponding hydrogen-like ion. This parameter can be extracted from the accurate experimental and theoretical electronic structure data for an ion, atom, or molecule without the explicit treatment of any nuclear magnetization distribution model. This approach can be applied to predict the hyperfine structure of atoms and molecules and allows one to separate the nuclear and electronic correlation problems. It is employed to calculate the finite nuclear magnetization distribution contribution to the hyperfine structure of the 225 Ra + cation and 225 RaF molecule. For the ground state of the 225 RaF molecule, this contribution achieves 4\%.},

  abstract = {In the full optimized reaction space and valence-complete active space self-consistent field (vCAS) methods, a set of active orbitals is defined as the union of the valence orbitals on the atoms, all possible configurations involving the active orbitals are generated, and the orbitals and configuration coefficients are self-consistently optimized. Such wave functions have tremendous flexibility, which makes these methods incredibly powerful but can also lead to inconsistencies in the description of the electronic structure of molecules. In this paper, the problems that can arise in vCAS calculations are illustrated by calculations on the BH and BF molecules. BH is well described by the full vCAS wave function, which accounts for molecular dissociation and 2 s –2 p near-degeneracy in the boron atom. The same is not true for the full vCAS wave function for BF. There is mixing of core and active orbitals at short internuclear distances and swapping of core and active orbitals at large internuclear distances. In addition, the virtual 2π orbitals, which were included in the active space to account for the 2 s –2 p near degeneracy effect, are used instead to describe radial correlation of the electrons in the F2 p π-like pairs. Although the above changes lead to lower vCAS energies, they lead to higher vCAS+1+2 energies as well as irregularities and/or discontinuities in the potential energy curves. All of the above problems can be addressed by using the spin-coupled generalized valence bond-inspired vCAS wave function for BF, which includes only a subset of the atomic valence orbitals in the active space.},

By borrowing the skeletal structure of each of the host materials, a hypothetical crystal structure is created by substituting all lanthanide sites with Nd, all transition metal sites with Fe, and all light element sites with B. High-throughput first-principle calculations are applied to evaluate the phase stability of these structures. Twenty of them are found to be potentially formable. As the first investigative result, the descriptor-relevance analysis on the orbital field matrix (OFM) materials’ descriptor reveals the average atomic coordination number as the essential factor in determining the structure stability of these substituted Nd–Fe–B crystal structures. 19 among 20 hypothetical structures that are found potentially formable have an average coordination number larger than 6.5. By applying the t-SNE dimensionality reduction method, all the local structures represented by the OFM descriptors are integrated into a visible space to study the detailed correlation between their characteristics and the stability of the crystal structure to which they belong. We discover that unstable substituted structures frequently carry Nd and Fe local structures with two prominent points: low average coordination numbers and fully occupied B neighboring atoms. Moreover, there are only three popular forms of B local structures appearing on all potentially formable substituted structures: cage networks, planar networks, and interstitial sites. The discovered relationships are promising to speed up the screening process for the new formable crystal structures.},

  abstract = {We present a relativistic correction scheme to improve the accuracy of 1s core-level binding energies calculated from Green’s function theory in the GW approximation, which does not add computational overhead. An element-specific corrective term is derived as the difference between the 1s eigenvalues obtained from the self-consistent solutions to the non- or scalar-relativistic Kohn–Sham equations and the four-component Dirac–Kohn–Sham equations for a free neutral atom. We examine the dependence of this corrective term on the molecular environment and the amount of exact exchange in hybrid exchange–correlation functionals. This corrective term is then added as a perturbation to the quasiparticle energies from partially self-consistent and single-shot GW calculations. We show that this element-specific relativistic correction, when applied to a previously reported benchmark set of 65 core-state excitations [D. Golze et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 1840–1847 (2020)], reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) with respect to the experiment from 0.55 eV to 0.30 eV and eliminates the species dependence of the MAE, which otherwise increases with the atomic number. The relativistic corrections also reduce the species dependence for the optimal amount of exact exchange in the hybrid functional used as a starting point for the single-shot G 0 W 0 calculations. Our correction scheme can be transferred to other methods, which we demonstrate for the delta self-consistent field (ΔSCF) approach based on density functional theory.},

  abstract = {Polarizable force fields based on classical Drude oscillators offer a practical and computationally efficient avenue to carry out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large biomolecular systems. To treat the polarizable electronic degrees of freedom, the Drude model introduces a virtual charged particle that is attached to its parent nucleus via a harmonic spring. Traditionally, the need to relax the electronic degrees of freedom for each fixed set of nuclear coordinates is achieved by performing an iterative self-consistent field (SCF) calculation to satisfy a selected tolerance. This is a computationally demanding procedure that can increase the computational cost of MD simulations by nearly one order of magnitude. To avoid the costly SCF procedure, a small mass is assigned to the Drude particles, which are then propagated as dynamic variables during the simulations via a dual-thermostat extended Lagrangian algorithm. To help clarify the significance of the dual-thermostat extended Lagrangian propagation in the context of the polarizable force field based on classical Drude oscillators, the statistical mechanics of a dual-temperature canonical ensemble is formulated. The conditions for dynamically maintaining the dual-temperature properties in the case of the classical Drude oscillator are analyzed using the generalized Langevin equation.},

In this paper, we introduce stochastic cell rescaling, a first-order barostat that samples the correct volume fluctuations by including a suitable noise term. The algorithm is shown to report volume fluctuations compatible with the isobaric ensemble and its anisotropic variant is tested on a membrane simulation. Stochastic cell rescaling can be straightforwardly implemented in the existing codes and can be used effectively in both equilibration and production phases.},

To this end, we extended the frequency-dependent Sternheimer formalism to the meta-GGA case. Using the Krieger–Li–Iafrate (KLI) approximation, we calculate the optical response for the selected paradigm molecular systems and compare the meta-GGA Kohn–Sham response to the one found with exact exchange and conventional (semi-)local functionals.

The authors recently introduced the collapse to a block (TAB) decoherence correction [M. P. Esch and B. G. Levine, J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 234105 (2020)], which incorporates a state-pairwise definition of decoherence time to accurately describe dynamics on more than two electronic states. In this work, TAB is extended by introduction of a scheme for efficiently computing a small number of approximate eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of a large number of potential energy surfaces. This adaptation of TAB for dense manifolds of states (TAB-DMS) is systematically improvable by increasing the number of computed approximate eigenstates. Application to a series of one-dimensional model problems demonstrates that TAB-DMS can be accurate when even a very modest number of approximate eigenstates are computed (four in all models tested here). Comparison of TAB simulations to exact quantum dynamical simulations indicates that TAB is quite accurate so long as the decoherence correction is carefully parameterized.},

Four types of systems are examined, arising from combinations of localized trapping, delocalized (Forster) trapping, eigenstate dephasing, and site basis dephasing. In the cases of site basis dephasing, the interplay between the energy gap of the excited dimer states and the environment is shown to give rise to a turnover effect in the efficiency under weak dimer coupling conditions. Furthermore, the nature of the coherences and associated flux is interpreted in terms of pathway interference effects. In addition, regardless of the cases considered, the ratio of the real part and the imaginary part of the coherences in the energy-eigenbasis tends to a constant value in the steady state limit.},

A huge increase in the electron detachment time as compared with the reference para -benzoquinone (40 µ s) is ascribed to the presence of the isoprene side chains. Elimination of a neutral CH 3 radical is found to be the most intense decay detected on the microsecond time scale. The results give some insight into the timescale of electron-driven processes stimulated in living tissues by high-energy radiation and are of importance in prospective fields of radiobiology and medicine.},

  abstract = {Single-atom alloys can be effective catalysts and have been compared to supported single-atom catalysts. To rationally design single-atom alloys and other surfaces with localized ensembles, it is crucial to understand variations in reactivity when varying the dopant and the ensemble size. Here, we examined hydrogen adsorption on surfaces embedded with localized clusters and discovered general trends. Counterintuitively, increasing the amount of a more reactive metal sometimes makes a surface site less reactive. This behavior is due to the hybridization and splitting of narrow peaks in the electronic density of states of many of these surfaces, making them analogous to free-standing nanoclusters. When a single-atom alloy has a peak just below the Fermi energy, the corresponding two-dopant cluster often has weaker adsorption than the single-atom alloy due to splitting of this peak across the Fermi energy. Furthermore, single-atom alloys have qualitatively different behaviors than larger ensembles. Specifically, the adsorption energy is a U-shaped function of the dopant’s group for single-atom alloys. Additionally, adsorption energies on single-atom alloys correlate more strongly with the dopant’s p-band center than with the d-band center.},

  abstract = {We propose a “backtracking” mechanism within Tully’s fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) algorithm, whereby whenever one detects consecutive (double) hops during a short period of time, one simply rewinds the dynamics backward in time. In doing so, one reduces the number of hopping events and comes closer to a truly fewest switches surface hopping approach with independent trajectories. With this algorithmic change, we demonstrate that surface hopping can be reasonably accurate for nuclear dynamics in a multidimensional configuration space with a complex-valued (i.e., not real-valued) electronic Hamiltonian; without this adjustment, surface hopping often fails. The added computational cost is marginal. Future research will be needed to assess whether or not this backtracking correction can improve the accuracy of a typical FSSH calculation with a real-valued electronic Hamiltonian (that ignores spin).},

Due to its molecular nature, the fundamental asymmetry of the hydrogen bond, and proton disorder, crystal defects in this condensed form of water reveal a complexity not usually seen in atomic crystalline solids. The discussion is organized in terms of the spatial extent of the defects. We start with zero-dimensional imperfections such as the molecular vacancy and interstitial, Bjerrum, and ionic defects, as well as possible defect complexes that can be formed from them. Subsequently, we turn to the properties of dislocations, which are the one-dimensional disturbances that carry plastic deformation in crystalline solids. Finally, we discuss two-dimensional defects such as stacking faults and grain boundaries and discuss to what extent the latter are similar to other interfaces in ice I h such as the free surface. We conclude with an outlook at the road ahead, discussing future challenges toward understanding the role of crystal defects in the macroscopic behavior of ice I h .},

  abstract = {Water is at the heart of almost all biological phenomena, without which no life that we know of would have been possible. It is a misleadingly complex liquid that exists in near coexistence with the vapor phase under ambient conditions. Confinement within a hydrophobic cavity can tip this balance enough to drive a cooperative dewetting transition. For a nanometer-scale pore, the dewetting transition leads to a stable dry state that is physically open but impermeable to ions. This phenomenon is often referred to as hydrophobic gating. Numerous transmembrane protein ion channels have now been observed to utilize hydrophobic gating in their activation and regulation. Here, we review recent theoretical, simulation, and experimental studies that together have started to establish the principles of hydrophobic gating and discuss how channels of various sizes, topologies, and biological functions can utilize these principles to control the thermodynamic properties of water within their interior pores for gating and regulation. Exciting opportunities remain in multiple areas, particularly on direct experimental detection of hydrophobic dewetting in biological channels and on understanding how the cell may control the hydrophobic gating in regulation of ion channels.},

Silver(I) ions mediate Cytosine–Cytosine (CC) base pairs by coordinating to the N3 atoms of two cytosines. Although these silver(I) mediated CC base pairs resemble the proton-mediated CC base pairs found in i-motif DNA at first glance, a comparison of experimental and calculated CD spectra reveals that silver ion-mediated i-motif structures do not form. Instead, the parallel-stranded duplex formed between dC 20 and silver ions is proposed to contain consecutive silver-mediated base pairs with high propeller twist-like ones seen in a recent crystal structure of an emissive, DNA-templated silver cluster. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements with broadband probing from the near UV to the near IR reveal an unusually long-lived (&gt;10 ns) excited state in the dC 20 silver ion complex that is not seen in dC 20 in single-stranded or i-motif forms. This state is also absent in a concentrated solution of cytosine–silver ion complexes that are thought to assemble into planar ribbons or sheets that lack stacked silver(I) mediated CC base pairs. The large propeller twist angle present in metal-mediated base pairs may promote the formation of long-lived charged separated or triplet states in this metallo-DNA.},

At the macro level, V m can be experimentally measured or calculated using the Nernst or Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation. However, the atomic details responsible for its generation and impact on protein and lipid dynamics still need to be further elucidated. In this work, we performed a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of symmetric model membranes of various lipid compositions and cation contents to evaluate the relationship between membrane asymmetry and V m . Specifically, we studied the impact of the asymmetric distribution of POPS (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn- glycero -3-phospho- l -serine), PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate), as well as Na + and K + on V m using atomically detailed MD simulations of symmetric model membranes. The results suggest that, for an asymmetric POPC-POPC/POPS bilayer in the presence of NaCl, the presence of the monovalent anionic lipid POPS in the inner leaflet polarizes the membrane (Δ V m 0). These divergent effects arise from variations in the strength of cation–lipid interactions and are correlated with changes in lipid chain order and head-group orientation.},

  abstract = {In the present research, the sodium ion transport across the endothelial glycocalyx layer (EGL) under an imposed electric field is investigated, for the first time, using a series of molecular dynamics simulations. The electric field is perpendicularly imposed on the EGL with varying strengths. The sodium ion molarity difference between the inner and outer layers of EGL, Δ c , is used to quantify the sodium transport in the presence of the negatively charged glycocalyx sugar chains. Results suggest that a weak electric field increases Δ c , regardless of whether the electric field is imposed perpendicularly inward or outward. By contrast, a strong electric field drives sodium ions to travel in the same orientation as the electric field. Scrutiny of the charge distribution of the glycocalyx sugar chains suggests that the electric field modifies the spatial layouts of glycocalyx atoms as it drives the transport of sodium ions. The modification in glycocalyx layouts further changes the inter-molecular interactions between glycocalyx sugar chains and sodium ions, thereby limiting the electric field control of ion transport. The sodium ions, in turn, alter the apparent bending stiffness of glycocalyx. Moreover, the negative charges of the glycocalyx sugar chains play an important role in maintaining structural stability of endothelial glycocalyx. Based on the findings, a hypothesis is proposed regarding the existence of a strength threshold of the electric field in controlling charged particles in the endothelium, which offers an alternative explanation for contrasting results in previous experimental observations.},

  abstract = {The 26S eukaryotic proteasome is an ATP-dependent degradation machine at the center of the ubiquitin–proteasome system that maintains cell viability through unfolding and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Its 19S regulatory particle uses a powerful heterohexameric AAA+ ATPase motor that unfolds substrate proteins and threads them through the narrow central pore for degradation within the associated 20S peptidase. In this study, we probe unfolding and translocation mechanisms of the ATPase motor by performing coarse-grained simulations of mechanical pulling of the green fluorescent protein substrate through the pore. To discern factors controlling the N–C or C–N directional processing of the substrate protein, we use three distinct models involving continuous pulling, at constant velocity or constant force, or discontinuous pulling with repetitive forces. Our results reveal asymmetric unfolding requirements in N- and C-terminal pulling upon continuous application of force in accord with the softer mechanical interface near the N-terminal and restraints imposed by the heterogeneous pore surface. By contrast, repetitive force application that mimics variable gripping by the AAA+ motor results in slower unfolding kinetics when the force is applied at the softer N-terminal. This behavior can be attributed to the dynamic competition between, on the one hand, refolding and, on the other, rotational flexibility and translocation of the unfolded N-terminal α -helix. These results highlight the interplay between mechanical, thermodynamic, and kinetic effects in directional degradation by the proteasome.},

In addition to the geometrical restrictions imposed on the cocaptured dsDNA segment in between the pores, the presence of tug-of-war forces at each pore results in a variation of the local chain stiffness for the segment of the chain in between the pores, which increases the overall stiffness of the chain. We use the BD simulation results to understand how the intrinsic chain stiffness and the tug-of-war forces affect the escape dynamics by monitoring the local chain persistence length ℓ p , the residence time of the individual monomers W ( m ) in the nanopores, and the chain length dependence of the escape time ⟨ τ ⟩ and its distribution. Finally, we generalize the scaling theory for the unbiased single nanopore translocation for a fully flexible chain for the escape of a semi-flexible chain through a double nanopore in the presence of tug-of-war forces. We establish that the stiffness dependent part of the escape time is approximately independent of the translocation mechanism so that ⟨ τ ⟩ ∼ ℓ p 2 / D + 2 ⁠ , and therefore, the generalized escape time for a semi-flexible chain can be written as ⟨ τ ⟩ = A N α ℓ p 2 / D + 2 ⁠ . We use the BD simulation results to compare the predictions of the scaling theory. Our numerical studies supplemented by scaling analysis provide fundamental insights to design new experiments where a dsDNA moves slowly through a series of graphene nanopores.},

The totally symmetric Raman bands with symmetry a 1 exhibit maximum enhancement in SERS with a 514.5 nm wavelength and suggest the maximum electromagnetic mechanism in SERS with 514.5 nm. Few Raman-forbidden modes and silent modes are allowed in the SERS spectra due to the reduced symmetry of PTCDI in the proximity of the AgNIF.

For both Rh–Ga alloy droplets and Rh–Ga model catalyst nanoparticles, exposure to molecular oxygen leads to the formation of an oxide shell in which Rh is enriched. Transmission electron microscopy on the Rh–Ga nanoparticles confirms the formation of an ∼4 nm thick gallium oxide film containing Rh. Based on ab initio molecular dynamics and computational studies on the Ga 2 O 3 /Ga interface, it is concluded that Rh incorporation into the Ga 2 O 3 film occurs by substituting octahedrally coordinated Ga.},

  abstract = {Molecular adsorption at organic/metal interfaces depends on a range of mechanisms: covalent bonds, charge transfer, Pauli repulsion, and van der Waals (vdW) interactions shape the potential energy surface (PES), making it key to understanding organic/metal interfaces. Describing such interfaces with density functional theory requires carefully selecting the exchange correlation (XC) functional and vdW correction scheme. To explore the reproducibility of the PES with respect to the choice of method, we present a benchmark of common local, semi-local, and non-local XC functionals in combination with various vdW corrections. We benchmark these methods using perylene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride on Ag(111), one of the most frequently studied organic/metal interfaces. For each method, we determine the PES using a Gaussian process regression algorithm, which requires only about 50 density functional theory calculations as input. This allows a detailed analysis of the PESs’ features, such as the positions and energies of minima and saddle points. Comparing the results from different combinations of XC functionals and vdW corrections enables us to identify trends and differences between the approaches. PESs for different computation methods are in qualitative agreement but also display significant quantitative differences. In particular, the lateral positions of adsorption geometries agree well with experiment, while adsorption heights, energies, and barriers show larger discrepancies.},

  abstract = {The self-diffusion coefficient of water shows an anomalous increase with increasing hydrostatic pressure up to a broad maximum ( P mD ) near 1 kbar at 298 K, which has been attributed to pressure effects on the tetrahedral hydrogen bond network of water. Moreover, the ability of a water model to reproduce anomalous properties of water is a signature that it is reproducing the network. Here, water was simulated between 1 bar and 5 kbar using three water models, two four-site (with all charges in the molecular plane) and one single-site multipole (which accounts for out-of-molecular plane charge), that have reasonable pressure–temperature properties. For these three models, the diffusion coefficients display a maximum in the pressure dependence and the radial distribution functions show good agreement with the limited experimental structural data at high pressure that are available. In addition, a variety of properties associated with the network are examined, including hydrogen bond lifetimes and occupancies, three-body angle distributions, and tetrahedral order parameters. Results suggest that the initial increasing diffusion with pressure is because hydrogen bonds are distorted and thus weakened by pressure, but above P mD , the hydrogen bonds are weakened to the point it behaves more like a normal liquid. In other words, the P mD may be a measure of the angular strength of hydrogen bonds. In addition, since the four-site models over-predict the values of P mD while the multipole model under-predicts it, out-of-plane charge may improve four-site models.},

As a system of application, we chose the bidisperse Lennard-Jones-like mixture, discovered by Kob and Andersen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 73 , 1376 (1994)], possessing a slow dynamics due to the fluid’s multi-component character with its apparently unconventional choice for the pair potential of the type-A–type-B arrangement. We further established in a so-formed coarse-grained and temperature-independent monodisperse system an equilibrium structure with a radial distribution function resembling its mixture counterpart. This one-component system further possesses similar dynamic features such as glass transition temperature and critical exponents while subjected to Newtonian mechanics. This strategy may finally lead to the manufacturing of new nanoparticle/colloidal fluids by experimentally modeling only the outcoming effective pair potential(s) and no other macroscopic quantity.},

  abstract = {We investigate the atomistic mechanism of homogeneous nucleation during solidification in molybdenum employing transition path sampling. The mechanism is characterized by the formation of a pre-structured region of high bond-orientational order in the supercooled liquid followed by the emergence of the crystalline bulk phase within the center of the growing solid cluster. This precursor plays a crucial role in the process as it provides a diffusive interface between the liquid and crystalline core, which lowers the interfacial free energy and facilitates the formation of the bulk phase. Furthermore, the structural features of the pre-ordered regions are distinct from the liquid and solid phases and preselect the specific polymorph that nucleates. The similarity in the nucleation mechanism of Mo with that of metals that exhibit different crystalline bulk phases indicates that the formation of a precursor is a general feature observed in these materials. The strong influence of the structural characteristics of the precursors on the final crystalline bulk phase demonstrates that for the investigated system, polymorph selection takes place in the very early stages of nucleation.},

It is shown that the α relaxation is faster, its nonexponentiality is stronger, and the fragility is higher for bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions than that for tetrafluoroborate anions. 2 H NMR stimulated-echo studies reveal that the overall reorientation dynamics involved in the α relaxation is isotropic and composed of jumps about small angles, where the mean jump angles are smaller for larger cations. Moreover, we demonstrate that, in addition to a cation-specific β relaxation, all studied ionic liquids exhibit the genuine Johari–Goldstein β relaxation of glass-forming liquids. Various 2 H NMR results consistently indicate that the associated rotational motion is spatially highly restricted. Altogether, our findings show that, despite strong electrostatic interaction and prominent microphase separation of ionic liquids, their glassy dynamics resemble that of their nonionic counterparts, including similar microscopic mechanisms for intrinsic α and β relaxations.},

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate the pair distribution function, numbers of nearest neighbors, and the translational order parameter, analyzing the weakening of the fcc-symmetry due to emerging premelting effects. A range of dynamic properties, such as the mean-squared displacement, non-Gaussian parameter, Debye–Waller factor, and vibrational density of states, is considered for the analysis of the solid state. All of these parameters clearly show that bulk mobility is activated at about 2/3 of the melting temperature, known as the Tammann temperature.

  abstract = {Lithium based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are excellent candidates as eco-friendly electrolytes for lithium ion batteries. While some of these DESs have shown promising results, a clear mechanism of lithium ion transport in DESs is not yet established. This work reports the study on the solvation and transport of lithium in a DES made from lithium perchlorate and acetamide using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and inelastic neutron scattering. Based on hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) of acetamide with neighboring molecules/ions, two states are largely prevalent: (1) acetamide molecules that are H-bonded to lithium ions (∼36\%) and (2) acetamide molecules that are entirely free (∼58\%). Analyzing their stochastic dynamics independently, it is observed that the long-range diffusion of the former is significantly slower than that of the latter. This is also validated from the neutron scattering experiment on the same DES system. Furthermore, the analysis of the lithium dynamics shows that the diffusion of acetamide molecules in the first category is strongly coupled to that of lithium ions. On an average, the lithium ions are H-bonded to ∼3.2 acetamide molecules in their first solvation. These observations are further bolstered through the analysis of the H-bond correlation function between acetamide and lithium ions, which shows that ∼90\% of lithium ionic transport is achieved by vehicular motion where the ions diffuse along with their first solvation shell. It is also observed that the ionic motions are largely uncorrelated and the conductivity of lithium ions in the DES is found to be 11 mS/cm. The findings of this work are an important advancement in understanding solvation and transport of lithium in the DES.},

Only data expressed as Rosenfeld reduced properties could be scaled successfully. Two different methods were used to obtain the scaling parameter γ , one based on polynomial fits to the group ( TV γ ) and the other based on the Avramov equation. The two methods agree well, except for λ of CCl 4 . γ for the thermal conductivity is similar to those for the viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient for the smaller molecules. It is significantly larger for the Lennard-Jones fluid, possibly due to a different dependence on packing fraction, and much larger for polyatomic molecules where heat transfer through internal modes may have an additional effect. Methanol and ammonia, where energy can be transmitted through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, could not be scaled. This work is intended as a practical attempt to examine thermodynamic scaling of the thermal conductivity of real fluids. The divergence of the scaling parameters for different properties is unexpected, suggesting that refinement of theory is required to rationalize this result. For the Lennard-Jones fluid, the Ohtori–Iishi version of the Stokes–Einstein–Sutherland relation applies at high densities in the liquid and supercritical region.},

  abstract = {The origin of water anomalies hides in an experimentally inaccessible region of the phase diagram known as no-man’s land, bounded at low temperature by the domain of stability of amorphous glasses, and at high temperature by the homogeneous nucleation line, below which liquid water loses its metastability. The existence of at least two different forms of glass on one side, i.e., the low-density amorphous (LDA) and the high-density amorphous (HDA) ices, and of one anomalous liquid on the other side, points to a hidden connection between these states, whose understanding has the potential to uncover what happens in no-man’s land and shed light on the complex nature of water’s behavior. Here, we develop a Neural Network scheme capable of discerning local structures beyond tetrahedrality. Applied over a wide region of the water’s phase diagram, we show that the local structures that characterize both LDA and HDA amorphous phases are indeed embedded in the supercooled liquid phase. Remarkably, the rapid increase in the LDA-like population with supercooling occurs in the same temperature and pressure region where thermodynamic fluctuations are maximized, linking these structures with water’s anomalies. At the same time, the population of HDA-like environments rapidly increases with pressure, becoming the majority component at high density. Our results show that both LDA and HDA are genuine glasses, and provide a microscopic connection between the non-equilibrium and equilibrium phase diagrams of water.},

  abstract = {Predicting the functional properties of many molecular systems relies on understanding how atomistic interactions give rise to macroscale observables. However, current attempts to develop predictive models for the structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed-phase systems often rely on extensive parameter fitting to empirically selected functional forms whose effectiveness is limited to a narrow range of physical conditions. In this article, we illustrate how these traditional fitting paradigms can be superseded using machine learning. Specifically, we use the results of molecular dynamics simulations to train machine learning protocols that are able to produce the radial distribution function, pressure, and internal energy of a Lennard-Jones fluid with increased accuracy in comparison to previous theoretical methods. The radial distribution function is determined using a variant of the segmented linear regression with the multivariate function decomposition approach developed by Craven et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 4372 (2020)]. The pressure and internal energy are determined using expressions containing the learned radial distribution function and also a kernel ridge regression process that is trained directly on thermodynamic properties measured in simulation. The presented results suggest that the structural and thermodynamic properties of fluids may be determined more accurately through machine learning than through human-guided functional forms.},

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and energy decomposition analysis were also performed. Structures of two isomers identified were unambiguously determined through the analysis of IR spectra and DFT calculations. To discuss the strength of dihydrogen bond in various systems, we performed theoretical calculations on clusters of EDMS with several acidic molecules in addition to PhOH. It was revealed that charge-transfer interaction energies from a bonding σ orbital of SiH bond to an anti-bonding σ * orbital of OH bond well reflect strengths of dihydrogen bonds. Additionally, it was found that the red shift of SiH stretch frequencies can be used as a crude measure of the strength of dihydrogen bonds. Relationship between the red shifts of OH/SiH stretch frequencies and various electrostatic components of the interaction energy was examined. In the S 1 state, large increases in red shifts were observed for both the OH and SiH stretch frequencies. Since the EDMS moiety is not associated with the electronic excitation in a cluster, the strength of dihydrogen bonds in the S 1 and S 0 states was able to be directly compared based on the red shifts of the SiH stretch bands. A significant increase in the red shift of SiH stretch frequency indicates a strengthening of the dihydrogen bonds during the electronic excitation of the PhOH moiety.},

The structure of the latter species was nevertheless confirmed by the analysis of the spectrum of the isotopomer with three H 2 18 O molecules.

  abstract = {The reduction of 4-nitrothiophenol (NTP) to 4-4′-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) on laser illuminated noble metal nanoparticles is one of the most widely studied plasmon mediated reactions. The reaction is most likely triggered by a transfer of low energy electrons from the nanoparticle to the adsorbed molecules. Besides the formation of DMAB, dissociative side reactions of NTP have also been observed. Here, we present a crossed electron-molecular beam study of free electron attachment to isolated NTP in the gas-phase. Negative ion yields are recorded as a function of the electron energy, which helps to assess the accessibility of single electron reduction pathways after photon induced electron transfer from nanoparticles. The dominant process observed with isolated NTP is associative electron attachment leading to the formation of the parent anion of NTP. Dissociative electron attachment pathways could be revealed with much lower intensities, leading mainly to the loss of functional groups. The energy gained by one electron reduction of NTP may also enhance the desorption of NTP from nanoparticles. Our supporting experiments with small clusters, then, show that further reaction steps are necessary after electron attachment to produce DMAB on the surfaces.},

  abstract = {Radicals are prevalent in gas-phase environments such as the atmosphere, combustion systems, and the interstellar medium. To understand the properties of the processes occurring in these environments, it is helpful to study radical reaction systems in isolation—thereby avoiding competing reactions from impurities. There are very few methods for generating a pure beam of gas-phase radicals, and those that do exist involve complex setups. Here, we provide a straightforward and versatile solution. A magnetic radical filter (MRF), composed of four Halbach arrays and two skimming blades, can generate a beam of velocity-selected low-field-seeking hydrogen atoms. As there is no line-of-sight through the device, all species that are unaffected by the magnetic fields are physically blocked; only the target radicals are successfully guided around the skimming blades. The positions of the arrays and blades can be adjusted, enabling the velocity distribution of the beam (and even the target radical species) to be modified. The MRF is employed as a stand-alone device—filtering radicals directly from the source. Our findings open up the prospect of studying a range of radical reaction systems with a high degree of control over the properties of the radical reactants.},

  abstract = {The power of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) measurements for probing structure and dynamics of molecules has been long recognized. NMR pulse sequences that allow measurement of CSA values in an indirect dimension of a protein correlation spectrum have been employed for aliphatic groups, but for practical reasons, carbonyl functional groups have been little studied, despite the fact that carbonyls are expected to give particularly varied and informative CSA values. Specifically, the wide spectral widths of carbonyl tensors make their measurements difficult with typically attainable spectrometer settings. We present here an extended family of experiments that enable the recovery of static CSA lineshapes in an indirect dimension of magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR experiments, except for various real valued scaling factors. The experiment is suitable for uniformly labeled material, at moderate MAS rates (10 kHz–30 kHz) and at higher magnetic fields ( ν 0 H &gt; 600 MHz). Specifically, the experiments are based on pulse sequence elements from a previous commonly used pulse sequence for CSA measurement, recoupling of chemical shift anisotropy (ROCSA), while modification of scaling factors is achieved by interspersing different blocks of C -elements of the same C n n 1 cycle. Using experimental conditions similar to the parent ROCSA sequence, a CSA scaling factor between 0 and 0.272 can be obtained, thus allowing a useful practical range of possibilities in experimental conditions for measurement of larger CSA values. Using these blocks, it is also possible to make a constant-time CSA recoupling sequence. The effectiveness of this approach, f ROCSA, is shown on model compounds 1- 13 C-Gly, U– 13 C, 15 N- l -His, and microcrystalline U– 13 C, 15 N-Ubiquitin.},

  abstract = {Therapeutic implications of Li + , in many cases, stem from its ability to inhibit certain Mg 2+ -dependent enzymes, where it interacts with or substitutes for Mg 2+ . The underlying details of its action are, however, unknown. Molecular simulations can provide insights, but their reliability depends on how well they describe relative interactions of Li + and Mg 2+ with water and other biochemical groups. Here, we explore, benchmark, and recommend improvements to two simulation approaches: the one that employs an all-atom polarizable molecular mechanics (MM) model and the other that uses a hybrid quantum and MM implementation of the quasi-chemical theory (QCT). The strength of the former is that it describes thermal motions explicitly and that of the latter is that it derives local contributions from electron densities. Reference data are taken from the experiment, and also obtained systematically from CCSD(T) theory, followed by a benchmarked vdW-inclusive density functional theory. We find that the QCT model predicts relative hydration energies and structures in agreement with the experiment and without the need for additional parameterization. This implies that accurate descriptions of local interactions are essential. Consistent with this observation, recalibration of local interactions in the MM model, which reduces errors from 10.0 kcal/mol to 1.4 kcal/mol, also fixes aqueous phase properties. Finally, we show that ion–ligand transferability errors in the MM model can be reduced significantly from 10.3 kcal/mol to 1.2 kcal/mol by correcting the ligand’s polarization term and by introducing Lennard-Jones cross-terms. In general, this work sets up systematic approaches to evaluate and improve molecular models of ions binding to proteins.},

  abstract = {In the Monte Carlo many-body perturbation (MC-MP) method, the conventional correlation-correction formula, which is a long sum of products of low-dimensional integrals, is first recast into a short sum of high-dimensional integrals over electron-pair and imaginary-time coordinates. These high-dimensional integrals are then evaluated by the Monte Carlo method with random coordinates generated by the Metropolis–Hasting algorithm according to a suitable distribution. The latter algorithm, while advantageous in its ability to sample nearly any distribution, introduces autocorrelation in sampled coordinates, which, in turn, increases the statistical uncertainty of the integrals and thus the computational cost. It also involves wasteful rejected moves and an initial “burn-in” step as well as displays hysteresis. Here, an algorithm is proposed that directly produces a random sequence of electron-pair coordinates for the same distribution used in the MC-MP method, which is free from autocorrelation, rejected moves, a burn-in step, or hysteresis. This direct-sampling algorithm is shown to accelerate second- and third-order Monte Carlo many-body perturbation calculations by up to 222\% and 38\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {An accurate treatment of effective core potentials (ECPs) requires care in continuum quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. While most QMC studies have settled on the use of familiar non-local (NL) pseudopotentials with additional localization approximations, these approaches have been shown to result in moderate residual errors for some classes of molecular and solid state applications. In this work, we revisit an idea proposed early in the history of QMC ECPs that does not require localization approximations, namely, a differential class of potentials referred to as pseudo-Hamiltonians. We propose to hybridize NL potentials and pseudo-Hamiltonians to reduce residual non-locality of existing potentials. We derive an approach to recast pseudopotentials for 3d elements as hybrid pseudo-Hamiltonians with optimally reduced NL energy. We demonstrate the fidelity of the hybrid potentials by studying atomic ionization potentials of Ti and Fe and the binding properties of TiO and FeO molecules with diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). We show that localization errors have been reduced relative to potentials with the same NL channels for Sc–Zn by considering the DMC energy change with respect to the choice of approximate localization. While localization error decreases proportionate to the reduced NL energy without a Jastrow, with a Jastrow, the degree of reduction decreases at higher filling of the d-shell. Our results suggest that a subset of existing ECPs may be recast in this hybrid form to reduce the DMC localization error. They also point to the prospect of further reducing this error by generating ECPs within this hybrid form from the start.},

In this study, we introduce a novel compact data structure of the zero-suppressed binary decision diagram (ZDD) for enumerating derivative structures much more efficiently. We show its simple applications to the enumeration of structures derived from the face-centered cubic and hexagonal close-packed lattices in binary, ternary, and quaternary systems.

We introduce a benchmark set of four hydrogen model systems of different dimensionalities and distinctive electronic structures: a 1D chain, a 1D ring, a 2D triangular lattice, and a 3D close-packed pyramid. To assess the ability of a computational method to produce accurate and compact wave functions, we introduce the accuracy volume, a metric that measures the number of variational parameters necessary to achieve a target energy error. Using this metric and the hydrogen models, we examine the performance of three classical deterministic methods: (i) selected configuration interaction (sCI) realized both via an a posteriori (ap-sCI) and variational selection of the most important determinants, (ii) an a posteriori singular value decomposition (SVD) of the FCI tensor (SVD-FCI), and (iii) the matrix product state representation obtained via the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We find that the DMRG generally gives the most efficient wave function representation for all systems, particularly in the 1D chain with a localized basis. For the 2D and 3D systems, all methods (except DMRG) perform best with a delocalized basis, and the efficiency of sCI and SVD-FCI is closer to that of DMRG. For larger analogs of the models, the DMRG consistently requires the fewest parameters but still scales exponentially in 2D and 3D systems, and the performance of SVD-FCI is essentially equivalent to that of ap-sCI.},

  abstract = {Spin crossover materials are bi-stable systems with potential applications as molecular scale electronic switches, actuators, thermometers, barometers, and displays. However, calculating the enthalpy difference, Δ H , between the high spin and low spin states has been plagued with difficulties. For example, many common density functional theory (DFT) methods fail to even predict the correct sign of Δ H , which determines the low temperature state. Here, we study a collection of Fe(II) and Fe(III) materials, where Δ H has been measured, which has previously been used to benchmark density functionals. The best performing hybrid functional, TPSSh, achieves a mean absolute error compared to experiment of 11 kJ mol −1 for this set of materials. However, hybrid functionals scale badly in the solid state; therefore, local functionals are preferable for studying crystalline materials, where the most interesting spin crossover phenomena occur. We show that both the Liechtenstein and Dudarev DFT+U methods are a little more accurate than TPSSh. The Dudarev method yields a mean absolute error of 8 kJ mol −1 for U eff = 1.6 eV. However, the mean absolute error for both TPSSh and DFT+U is dominated by a single material, for which the two theoretical methods predict similar enthalpy differences—if this is excluded from the set, then DFT+U achieves chemical accuracy. Thus, DFT+U is an attractive option for calculating the properties of spin crossover crystals, as its accuracy is comparable to that of meta-hybrid functionals, but at a much lower computational cost.},

Ab initio calculations and experiments have consistently shown that the lowest energy isomers for small silver nanoparticles exhibit two-dimensional (2D) configurations and that a transition into three-dimensional (3D) configurations occurs with the addition of only a few atoms. We parameterized an e-ReaxFF potential for Ag nanoclusters ( N ≤ 20 atoms) that accurately reproduces the 2D–3D transition observed between the Ag 5 and Ag 7 clusters. This potential includes a four-body dihedral term that imposes an energetic penalty to 3D structures that is significant for small clusters but is overpowered by the bond energy from out-of-plane Ag–Ag bonds in larger 3D clusters. The potential was fit to data taken from density-functional theory and coupled-cluster calculations and compared to an embedded atom method potential to gauge its quality. We also demonstrate the potential of e-ReaxFF to model redox reactions in silver halides and plasmon motion using molecular dynamics simulations. This is the first case in which e-ReaxFF is used to describe metals. Furthermore, the inclusion of a bond-order dependent dihedral angle in this force field is a unique solution to modeling the 2D–3D transition seen in small metal nanoclusters.},

We not only use this disagreement to identify the most relevant configurations to build up the model’s training set in an active learning procedure but also monitor and bias it during simulations to control the generalization error. This facilitates the adaptive development of committee neural network potentials and their training sets while keeping the number of ab initio calculations to a minimum. To illustrate the benefits of this methodology, we apply it to the development of a committee model for water in the condensed phase. Starting from a single reference ab initio simulation, we use active learning to expand into new state points and to describe the quantum nature of the nuclei. The final model, trained on 814 reference calculations, yields excellent results under a range of conditions, from liquid water at ambient and elevated temperatures and pressures to different phases of ice, and the air–water interface—all including nuclear quantum effects. This approach to committee models will enable the systematic development of robust machine learning models for a broad range of systems.},

  abstract = {Practical ways to calculate the tunneling matrix elements and analyze the tunneling pathways for protein electron-transfer (ET) reactions with a fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method are presented. The straightforward use of minimal basis sets only for the atoms involved in the covalent bond detachment in FMO can properly describe the ETs through the protein main-chains with the cost-effective two-body corrections (FMO2) without losing the quality of double-zeta basis sets. The current FMO codes have been interfaced with density functional theory, polarizable continuum model, and model core potentials, with which the FMO-based protein ET calculations can consider the effects of electron correlation, solvation, and transition-metal redox centers. The reasonable performance of the FMO-based ET calculations is demonstrated for three different sets of protein-ET model molecules: (1) hole transfer between two tryptophans covalently bridged by a polyalanine linker in the ideal α -helix and β -strand conformations, (2) ET between two plastoquinones covalently bridged by a polyalanine linker in the ideal α -helix and β -strand conformations, and (3) hole transfer between ruthenium (Ru) and copper (Cu) complexes covalently bridged by a stretch of a polyglycine linker as a model for Ru-modified derivatives of azurin.},

  abstract = {The standard description of cavity-modified molecular reactions typically involves a single (resonant) mode, while in reality, the quantum cavity supports a range of photon modes. Here, we demonstrate that as more photon modes are accounted for, physicochemical phenomena can dramatically change, as illustrated by the cavity-induced suppression of the important and ubiquitous process of proton-coupled electron-transfer. Using a multi-trajectory Ehrenfest treatment for the photon-modes, we find that self-polarization effects become essential, and we introduce the concept of self-polarization-modified Born–Oppenheimer surfaces as a new construct to analyze dynamics. As the number of cavity photon modes increases, the increasing deviation of these surfaces from the cavity-free Born–Oppenheimer surfaces, together with the interplay between photon emission and absorption inside the widening bands of these surfaces, leads to enhanced suppression. The present findings are general and will have implications for the description and control of cavity-driven physical processes of molecules, nanostructures, and solids embedded in cavities.},

Due to this specific combination of polarizations, the asymmetric hyperpolarizability interaction potential, which remains the same as that in a linearly polarized two-color laser field, is created along the vertical component of the elliptically polarized second harmonic pulse. On the other hand, the horizontal component suppresses the otherwise strong symmetric polarizability potential responsible for alignment, increasing the tunneling probability from the shallower potential well to the deeper one. As a result, the degree of orientation increases and can be controlled by changing the intensity of the horizontal component of the elliptically polarized second harmonic pulse. This study is the generalization of the all-optical molecular orientation technique based on the anisotropic hyperpolarizability interaction.},

This work examines kernel ridge regression models built from an experimental dataset of 2212 ionic liquid melting points consisting of diverse ion types. Structural descriptors, which have been shown to predict quantum mechanical properties of small neutral molecules within chemical accuracy, benefit from the addition of first-principles data related to the target property (molecular orbital energy, charge density profile, and interaction energy based on the geometry of a single ion pair) when predicting the melting point of ionic liquids. Out of the two chosen structural descriptors, ECFP4 circular fingerprints and the Coulomb matrix, the addition of molecular orbital energies and all quantum mechanical data to each descriptor, respectively, increases the accuracy of surrogate models for melting point prediction compared to using the structural descriptors alone. The best model, based on ECFP4 and molecular orbital energies, predicts ionic liquid melting points with an average mean absolute error of 29 K and, unlike group contribution methods, which have achieved similar results, is applicable to any type of ionic liquid.},

  abstract = {A huge amount of water at supercritical conditions exists in Earth’s interior, where its dielectric properties play a critical role in determining how it stores and transports materials. However, it is very challenging to obtain the static dielectric constant of water, ϵ 0 , in a wide pressure–temperature (P–T) range as found in deep Earth either experimentally or by first-principles simulations. Here, we introduce a neural network dipole model, which, combined with molecular dynamics, can be used to compute P–T dependent dielectric properties of water as accurately as first-principles methods but much more efficiently. We found that ϵ 0 may vary by one order of magnitude in Earth’s upper mantle, suggesting that the solvation properties of water change dramatically at different depths. Although ϵ 0 and the molecular dipole moment increase with an increase in pressure along an isotherm, the dipolar angular correlation has its maximum at 5 GPa–7 GPa, which may indicate that hydrogen bonds become weaker at high pressure. We also calculated the frequency-dependent dielectric constant of water in the microwave range, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been calculated from first principles, and found that temperature affects the dielectric absorption more than pressure. Our results are of great use in many areas, e.g., modeling water–rock interactions in geochemistry. The computational approach introduced here can be readily applied to other molecular fluids.},

  abstract = {A variety of applications rely on the efficient generation of hot carriers within metal nanoparticles and charge transfer to surrounding molecules or materials. The optimization of such processes requires a detailed understanding of excited carrier spatial, temporal, and momentum distributions, which also leads to opportunities for active optical control over hot carrier dynamics on nanometer and femtosecond scales. Such capabilities are emerging in nanoplasmonic systems and typically rely on tuning optical polarization and/or frequency to selectively excite one or more discrete hot spots defined by the particle geometry. Here, we introduce a unique case in which hot electron excitation and emission distributions can instead be continuously controlled via linear laser polarization in the azimuthal plane of a gold nanoshell supported on a substrate. In this configuration, it is the laser field that breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the supported nanoshell and determines the plasmonic field distribution. Using angle-resolved photoelectron velocity map imaging, we find that the hot electrons are predominantly emitted orthogonal to the nanoshell dipolar surface plasmon resonance axis defined by the laser polarization. Furthermore, such anisotropic emission is only observed for nanoshells, while solid gold nanospheres are found to be isotropic emitters. We show that all of these effects are recapitulated via simulation of the plasmonic electric field distributions within the nanoparticle volume and ballistic Monte Carlo modeling of the hot electron dynamics. These results demonstrate a highly predictive level of understanding of the underlying physics and possibilities for ultrafast spatiotemporal control over hot carrier dynamics.},

This perspective reviews the current understanding of the ion transport and polymer dynamics in liquid and polymer electrolytes, comparing the similarities and differences in the two types of electrolytes. Combining recent experimental and theoretical findings, we attempt to connect and explain ion transport mechanisms in different types of small-molecule and polymer electrolytes from a theoretical perspective, linking the macroscopic transport coefficients to the microscopic, molecular properties such as the solvation environment of the ions, salt concentration, solvent/polymer molecular weight, ion pairing, and correlated ion motion. We emphasize universal features in the ion transport and polymer dynamics by highlighting the relevant time and length scales. Several outstanding questions and anticipated developments for electrolyte design are discussed, including the negative transference number, control of ion transport through precision synthesis, and development of predictive multiscale modeling approaches.},

  abstract = {We present a conspectus of recent joint spectroscopic and computational studies that provided novel insight into the photochemistry of hydrogen-bonded complexes of the heptazine (Hz) chromophore with hydroxylic substrate molecules (water and phenol). It was found that a functionalized derivative of Hz, tri-anisole-heptazine (TAHz), can photooxidize water and phenol in a homogeneous photochemical reaction. This allows the exploration of the basic mechanisms of the proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) process involved in the water photooxidation reaction in well-defined complexes of chemically tunable molecular chromophores with chemically tunable substrate molecules. The unique properties of the excited electronic states of the Hz molecule and derivatives thereof are highlighted. The potential energy landscape relevant for the PCET reaction has been characterized by judicious computational studies. These data provided the basis for the demonstration of rational laser control of PCET reactions in TAHz–phenol complexes by pump–push–probe spectroscopy, which sheds light on the branching mechanisms occurring by the interaction of nonreactive locally excited states of the chromophore with reactive intermolecular charge-transfer states. Extrapolating from these results, we propose a general scenario that unravels the complex photoinduced water-splitting reaction into simple sequential light-driven one-electron redox reactions followed by simple dark radical–radical recombination reactions.},

Extraction of the electron transfer rate constant requires deconvolution of the current associated with CO 2 reduction from the competing hydrogen evolution reaction and mass transport. Analysis of the inner-sphere electron transfer reaction reveals a driving force dependence of the rate constant that has similar characteristics to that of a Marcus–Hush–Levich outer-sphere electron transfer model. Consideration of simple assumptions for CO 2 adsorption on the electrode surface allows for the evaluation of a CO 2,ads /CO 2 •− ads standard potential of ∼−0.75 ± 0.05 V vs Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) and a reorganization energy on the order of 0.75 ± 0.10 eV. This standard potential is considerably lower than that observed for CO 2 reduction on planar metal electrodes (∼&gt;–1.4 V vs SHE for &gt;10 mA/cm 2 ), thus indicating that CO 2 reduction occurs at a significant overpotential and thus provides an imperative for the design of better CO 2 reduction electrocatalysts.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic flow can have complex and far-reaching consequences on the rate of homogeneous nucleation. We present a general formalism for calculating the nucleation rates of simply sheared systems. We have derived an extension to the conventional Classical Nucleation Theory, explicitly embodying the shear rate. Seeded molecular dynamics simulations form the backbone of our approach. The framework can be used for moderate supercooling, at which temperatures brute-force methods are practically infeasible. The competing energetic and kinetic effects of shear arise naturally from the equations. We show how the theory can be used to identify shear regimes of ice nucleation behavior for the mW water model, unifying disparate trends reported in the literature. At each temperature, we define a crossover shear rate in the limit of 1000 s −1 –10 000 s −1 , beyond which the nucleation rate increases steadily up to a maximum, at the optimal shear rate. For 235 K, 240 K, 255 K, and 260 K, the optimal shear rates are in the range of ≈10 6 s −1 –10 7 s −1 . For very high shear rates beyond 10 8 s −1 , nucleation is strongly inhibited. Our results indicate that the optimal shear rates have a non-monotonic dependence on temperature.},

  abstract = {Hydrophobic solutes significantly alter the water hydrogen bond network. The local alteration of solvation structures gets reflected in the vibrational spectroscopic signal. Although it is possible to detect this microscopic feature by modern infrared spectroscopy, bulk phase spectra often come with a formidable challenge of establishing the connection of experimental spectra to molecular structures. Theoretical spectroscopy can serve as a more powerful tool where spectroscopic data cannot provide the microscopic picture. In the present work, we build a theoretical spectroscopic map based on a hybrid quantum–classical molecular simulation approach using a methane–water system. The single oscillator O–H stretch frequency is well correlated with a collective variable solvation energy . We construct the spectroscopic maps for fundamental transition frequencies and also the transition dipoles. A bimodal frequency distribution with a blue-shifted population of transition frequency illustrates the presence of gas like water molecules in the hydration shell of methane. This observation is further complemented by a shell-wise decomposition of the O–H stretch frequencies. We observe a significant increase in the ordering of the first solvation water molecules, except those which are directly facing the methane molecule. This is manifested in the redshift of the observed transition frequencies. Temperature dependent simulations depict that the water molecules facing the methane molecule behave similarly to the high temperature water, and a few of the first shell water molecules behave more like cold water.},

The kinetic equations for the populations of the spin sublevels of the excited state are derived and then used to obtain analytical expressions for the evolution of the spin polarization of excited triplet states under specific conditions. The time dependence of the triplet state polarization patterns is also obtained by numerical solution of the kinetic equations. It is shown that the reversible energy hopping can lead to significant changes in the properties of the triplet state, including changes in the shape of the observed spectrum and, in some cases, the inversion of the sign of the polarization, the generation of the net polarization, and anisotropic spin-lattice relaxation. The relations between the parameters that can be observed experimentally by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and the kinetic and dynamic parameters of the system are discussed.},

  abstract = {Intramolecular singlet fission (SF) produces the multiexciton correlated triplet pair state, (T 1 T 1 ), prior to the formation of free triplet excitons. The nature of the multiexciton state is complex, as generation of the (T 1 T 1 ) state may involve a charge transfer (CT) intermediate and has been shown to have both mixed electronic and spin characters. According to transient absorption spectroscopy, a linear terrylene-3,4:11,12-bis(dicarboximide) dimer ( TDI 2 ) exhibits solvent-dependent excited-state dynamics. As solvent polarity increases from 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (ε = 2.2) to chlorobenzene (ε = 5.6) to 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ε = 9.9), the SF rate in TDI 2 increases and the multiexciton state, which can be thought of as a linear combination of the 1 (S 1 S 0 ), CT, and (T 1 T 1 ) states, gains more CT character. Eventually, the CT state becomes a trap state as indicated by symmetry-breaking charge separation in TDI 2 in pyridine (ε = 12.3). The dielectric environment influences not only the SF rate and the relative contributions of the 1 (S 1 S 0 ), CT, and (T 1 T 1 ) states to the overall multiexciton state but also the rate at which the state mixing evolves, with faster dynamics in higher polarity solvents. More importantly, the tunability and presence of strong CT character in the multiexciton state have implications for SF applications since they often rely on electron transfer from the free triplet excitons. This enhanced CT character in the (T 1 T 1 ) state may assist with two-electron transfer directly from the (T 1 T 1 ) state, allowing for facile extraction of charges in intramolecular SF systems whose (T 1 T 1 ) states do not always efficiently dissociate to two triplet excitons.},

While its spectroscopy was intensively studied earlier, our knowledge about the collision of H 3 O + with the abundant colliders in the interstellar medium is rather limited. In order to treat these collisional excitation processes, it is first necessary to calculate the potential energy surface (PES) of the interacting species. We have computed the five-dimensional rigid-rotor PES of the H 3 O + –H 2 system from the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory at the level of singles and doubles with perturbative corrections for triple excitations [CCSD(T)-F12] with the moderate-size augmented correlation-consistent valence triple zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis set. The well depth of the PES is found to be rather large, about 1887.2 cm −1 . The ab initio potential was fitted over an angular expansion in order to effectively use it in quantum scattering codes. As a first application, we computed dissociation energies for the different nuclear spin isomers of the H 3 O + –H 2 complex.},

Combining concepts from each of these fields, there is now an opportunity to create and manipulate photonic matter via strong coupling of molecules to the electromagnetic field. Toward this goal, here we demonstrate a first principles framework to calculate polaritonic excited-state potential-energy surfaces, transition dipole moments, and transition densities for strongly coupled light–matter systems. In particular, we demonstrate the applicability of our methodology by calculating the polaritonic excited-state manifold of a formaldehyde molecule strongly coupled to an optical cavity. This proof-of-concept calculation shows how strong coupling can be exploited to alter photochemical reaction pathways by influencing avoided crossings with tuning of the cavity frequency and coupling strength. Therefore, by introducing an ab initio method to calculate excited-state potential-energy surfaces, our work opens a new avenue for the field of polaritonic chemistry.},

  abstract = {The reliability of molecular mechanics (MM) simulations in describing biomolecular ion-driven processes depends on their ability to accurately model interactions of ions simultaneously with water and other biochemical groups. In these models, ion descriptors are calibrated against reference data on ion–water interactions, and it is then assumed that these descriptors will also satisfactorily describe interactions of ions with other biochemical ligands. The comparison against the experiment and high-level quantum mechanical data show that this transferability assumption can break down severely. One approach to improve transferability is to assign cross terms or separate sets of non-bonded descriptors for every distinct pair of ion type and its coordinating ligand. Here, we propose an alternative solution that targets an error-source directly and corrects misrepresented physics. In standard model development, ligand descriptors are never calibrated or benchmarked in the high electric fields present near ions. We demonstrate for a representative MM model that when the polarization descriptors of its ligands are improved to respond to both low and high fields, ligand interactions with ions also improve, and transferability errors reduce substantially. In our case, the overall transferability error reduces from 3.3 kcal/mol to 1.8 kcal/mol. These improvements are observed without compromising on the accuracy of low-field interactions of ligands in gas and condensed phases. Reference data for calibration and performance evaluation are taken from the experiment and also obtained systematically from “gold-standard” CCSD(T) in the complete basis set limit, followed by benchmarked vdW-inclusive density functional theory.},

In this work, we build on the analogous role of partition functions (or free energies) in isothermal ensembles and that of entropy in adiabatic ensembles. In particular, we show that the grand-isobaric adiabatic ( μ , P , R ) ensemble, or Ray ensemble, provides a direct route to determine the entropy. This allows us to follow the variations of entropy with the thermodynamic conditions and thus explore phase transitions. We test this approach by carrying out Monte Carlo simulations on argon and copper in bulk phases and at phase boundaries. We assess the reliability and accuracy of the method through comparisons with the results from flat-histogram simulations in isothermal ensembles and with the experimental data. Advantages of the approach are multifold and include the direct determination of the μ – P relation, without any evaluation of pressure via the virial expression, the precise control of the system size (number of atoms) via the input value of R , and the straightforward computation of enthalpy differences for isentropic processes, which are key quantities to determine the efficiency of thermodynamic cycles. A new insight brought by these simulations is the highly symmetric pattern exhibited by both systems along the transition, as shown by scaled temperature–entropy and pressure–entropy plots.},

Quantitative understanding of conformational distribution in SGLD has been achieved by separating microscopic properties according to frequency. However, a missing link between the guiding factors and conformational distributions makes it highly empirical and system dependent when choosing the values of the guiding parameters. Based on the understanding that molecular interactions are the source of energy barriers and diffusion friction, this work reformulates the equation of the low frequency motion to resemble Langevin dynamics. This reformulation leads to new forms of guiding forces and establishes a relation between the guiding factors and conformational distributions. We call simulations with these new guiding forces the generalized self-guided molecular/Langevin dynamics (SGMDg/SGLDg). In addition, we present a new way to calculate low frequency properties and an efficient algorithm to implement SGMDg/SGLDg that minimizes memory usage and inter-processor communication. Through example simulations with a skewed double well system, an argon fluid, and a cryo-EM map flexible fitting case, we demonstrate the guiding effects on conformational distributions and conformational searching.},

We demonstrate how symmetry and geometric constraints can be combined to efficiently generate crystal structures that are composed of diatomic molecules. Our algorithm extends the symmetry driven structure search method [R. Domingos et al. , Phys. Rev.

As a method of validation, we have tested our approach for dense hydrogen and reproduced the known molecular structures of Cmca -12 and Cmca -4. We apply our algorithm to study chlorine and fluorine in the pressure range of 10 GPa–4000 GPa while considering crystal structures with up to 40 atoms per unit cell. We predict chlorine to follow the same series of phase transformations as elemental iodine from Cmca to Immm to Fm 3 ¯ m , but at substantially higher pressures.

Good training sets should at once contain a very diverse set of configurations while avoiding redundancies that incur cost without providing benefits.

Here, we complete this theoretical framework with a rigorous theory for kinetic energy flows: potential and kinetic energies interconvert when impressed forces oppose inertial forces, whereas kinetic energy transfers directly from one coordinate to another when inertial forces oppose each other. This theory is applied to analyzing a prototypic system for biomolecular conformational dynamics: the isomerization of an alanine dipeptide. Among the two essential energy flow channels for this process, dihedral ϕ confronts the activation barrier, whereas dihedral θ 1 receives energy from potential energy flows. Intriguingly, θ 1 helps ϕ to cross the activation barrier by transferring to ϕ via direct kinetic energy flow all the energy it received—an increase in θ ̇ 1 caused by potential energy flow converts into an increase in ϕ ̇ ⁠ . As a compensation, θ 1 receives kinetic energy from bond angle α via a direct mechanism and bond angle β via an indirect mechanism.},

  abstract = {The use of many control variates is proposed as a method to accelerate the second- and third-order Monte Carlo (MC) many-body perturbation (MC-MP2 and MC-MP3) calculations. A control variate is an exactly integrable function that is strongly correlated or anti-correlated with the target function to be integrated by the MC method. Evaluating both integrals and their covariances in the same MC run, one can effect a mutual cancellation of the statistical uncertainties and biases in the MC integrations, thereby accelerating its convergence considerably. Six and thirty-six control variates, whose integrals are known a priori , are generated for MC-MP2 and MC-MP3, respectively, by systematically replacing one or more two-electron-integral vertices of certain configurations by zero-valued overlap-integral vertices in their Goldstone diagrams. The variances and covariances of these control variates are computed at a marginal cost, enhancing the overall efficiency of the MC-MP2 and MC-MP3 calculations by a factor of up to 14 and 20, respectively.},

  abstract = {Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are propagating waves generated at the interface of a metal (metamaterial) and a dielectric. The intensity of SPPs often exponentially decays away from the surface, while their wavelengths can be tuned by the confinement effect. We present here a computational method based on quantum-mechanical theory to fully describe the interaction between confined SPPs and adsorbed molecules at the interface. Special attention has been paid to the roles of the confinement factor. Taking a prototype dye sensitized solar cell as an example, calculated results reveal that with the increase in the confinement factor in metal/dielectric interfaces, the breakdown of the conventional dipole approximation emerges, which allows efficient harvesting of SPPs with low excitation energies and, thus, increases the efficiency of the solar energy conversion by dye molecules. Furthermore, at the metamaterial/dielectric interface, SPPs with large confinement factors could directly excite the dye molecule from its ground singlet state to the triplet state, opening an entirely new channel with long-living carriers for the photovoltaic conversion. Our results not only provide a rigorous theory for the SPP–molecule interaction but also highlight the important role played by the momentum of the light in plasmon related studies.},

Here, we introduce a new formulation based on filtered densities and a particle–mesh formalism that allows for Hamiltonian dynamics and alias-free force computation. This is achieved by introducing a length scale for the particle–field interactions independent of the numerical grid used to represent the density fields, enabling systematic convergence of the forces upon grid refinement. Our scheme generalizes the original particle–field molecular dynamics implementations presented in the literature, finding them as limit conditions. The accuracy of this new formulation is benchmarked by considering simple monoatomic systems described by the standard hybrid particle–field potentials. We find that by controlling the time step and grid size, conservation of energy and momenta, as well as disappearance of alias, is obtained. Increasing the particle–field interaction length scale permits the use of larger time steps and coarser grids. This promotes the use of multiple time step strategies over the quasi-instantaneous approximation, which is found to not conserve energy and momenta equally well. Finally, our investigations of the structural and dynamic properties of simple monoatomic systems show a consistent behavior between the present formulation and Gaussian core models.},

The use of spin-independent set of pair-natural orbitals ensures exact agreement with the closed-shell formalism reported previously, with only marginally impact on the cost (e.g., the open-shell formalism is only 1.5 times slower than the closed-shell counterpart for the C 160 H 322 n-alkane, with the measured size complexity of ≈1.2). Evaluation of coupled-cluster energies near the complete-basis-set (CBS) limit for open-shell systems with more than 550 atoms and 5000 basis functions is feasible on a single multi-core computer in less than 3 days.

To overcome this problem, we combine Fermi smearing (FS) DFT with a fractional-occupation variant of the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA) of TDDFT in the generalized gradient approximation. The resulting method (which we denote as FS-TDA) gives access to ground- and excited-state energies, gradients, and nonadiabatic coupling vectors, which are physically correct even in the vicinity of S 1 –S 0 conical intersections. This is shown for azobenzene, a widely used photoswitch, via single point calculations and NAMD simulations of its cis – trans photoisomerization. We conclude that FS-TDA may be used as an efficient alternative to investigate these processes.},

In particular, the advancement of spectroscopic methods for probing molecular structures has benefited enormously from such theoretical pursuits. Nonetheless, the validity of the approximations and the exactness of the proposed effective Hamiltonians have always remained a contentious issue.

Most of these techniques solve the Young–Laplace equation many times over to find the material parameters that provide a fit to a supplied image of a real droplet. Here, we introduce a machine learning approach to solve this problem in a computationally more efficient way. We train a deep neural network to determine the surface tension of a given droplet shape using a large training set of numerically generated droplet shapes. We show that the deep learning approach is superior to the current state of the art shape fitting approach in speed and precision, in particular if shapes in the training set reflect the sensitivity of the droplet shape with respect to surface tension. In order to derive such an optimized training set, we clarify the role of the Worthington number as a quality indicator in conventional shape fitting and in the machine learning approach. Our approach demonstrates the capabilities of deep neural networks in the material parameter determination from rheological deformation experiments, in general.},

We benchmark the method using a set of one- and two-dimensional models, for which the results compare favorably with numerically exact quantum calculations. Using the ring-polymer instanton approach, we apply the method to compute the level splittings in various isotopomers of malonaldehyde in full dimensionality and analyze the relative contributions from the zero-point energy difference and tunneling effects.},

Here, we present an extensive computational study for a model protein adsorbed on a TIP4P/Ice crystal, computing Δ T max as a function of the average distance d between AFPs, with simulations spanning over 1 µ s. First, we show that the lower the d , the larger the Δ T max . Then, we find that the water–ice–protein contact angle along the line Δ T max ( d ) is always larger than 0°, and we provide a theoretical interpretation. We compute the curvature radius of the stable solid–liquid interface at a given supercooling Δ T ≤ Δ T max , connecting it with the critical ice nucleus at Δ T . Finally, we discuss the antifreeze capability of AFPs in terms of the protein–water and protein–ice interactions. Our findings establish a unified description of the AFPs in the contest of homogeneous ice nucleation, elucidating key aspects of the antifreeze mechanisms and paving the way for the design of novel ice-controlling materials.},

In the case of the relativistic electronic structure, if time-reversal symmetry is not enforced in calculations of molecules not subject to a magnetic field, it is possible to artificially break Kramers degeneracy in open shell systems. This leads to a description of excited states that may be qualitatively incorrect. Despite this, different electronic structure methods to incorporate correlation and excited states can partially restore Kramers degeneracy from a broken symmetry solution. For single-reference techniques, the inclusion of double and possibly triple excitations in the ground state provides much of the needed correction. Formally, however, this imbalanced treatment of the Kramers-paired spaces is a multi-reference problem, and so methods such as complete-active-space methods perform much better at recovering much of the correct symmetry by state averaging. Using multi-reference configuration interaction, any additional corrections can be obtained as the solution approaches the full configuration interaction limit. A recently proposed “Kramers contamination” value is also used to assess the magnitude of symmetry breaking.},

An open question is how the dynamic facilitation perspective on the glass transition may be reconciled with thermodynamic theories that posit collective reorganization accompanied by a growing static length scale and, eventually, a vanishing configurational entropy. In contrast, dynamic facilitation theory invokes a dynamical phase transition between an active phase (close to the normal liquid) and an inactive phase, which is glassy and whose order parameter is either a time-averaged dynamic or structural quantity. In particular, the dynamical phase transition in systems with non-trivial thermodynamics manifests signatures of a lower critical point that lies between the mode-coupling crossover and the putative Kauzmann temperature, at which a thermodynamic phase transition to an ideal glass state would occur. We review these findings and discuss such criticality in the context of the low-temperature decrease in configurational entropy predicted by thermodynamic theories of the glass transition.},

  abstract = {We investigate the disappearance of the critical points of a model consisting of particles decorated with two patches of type A and a variable number ( n ) of patches of type B (2 AnB patchy particles), in which only AA and AB bonds can form. This has been shown to exhibit a very rich phase behavior including one, two, or no liquid–vapor critical points, depending on two parameters: the ratio of the volumes available to each type of bond and the ratio of the bond strengths. We apply Wertheim’s theory in the limit of strong AA bonds to a lattice version of the model [Almarza et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 244902 (2012)] and show that the critical point does not always vanish at zero density and temperature, in contrast with results for particles decorated with only one type of patch. We uncover two remnants of the critical points—the lines of maximum and ideal compressibility—that survive even when no critical points are present.},

We focus on the development of orientational order of chains from a random state to a neatly ordered one. Two new methods, the map of symmetry breaking and the information entropy of chain orientations, are introduced to characterize the emerge and remelting phenomena of a primary nucleus at the early stage of crystallization. Stepwise nucleation, as well as the surface induced nucleation, of large droplets is observed. We elucidate the kinetic process of the formation of a primary nucleus and the rearrangement of every single molecule involved in a primary nucleus. We found that density fluctuation and orientational preordering are coupled together and occur simultaneously in nucleation. Our results show the pathway of orientational symmetry breaking in the crystallization of n -alkane droplets that are heuristic for the deeper understanding of the crystallization in more complex molecules such as polymers.},

In this work, the phase transition in active suspension is considered within a minimal model, in which self-propelled particles are moving with a constant speed, while their direction of propagation is governed by mutual collisions. The final stage of cluster formation in active suspension is studied when the larger clusters grow by consuming the smaller ones. The analysis of kinetic equation for the evolution of the number of particles in a cluster and conservation of particles law in active suspension shows that the number of clusters decreases with time according to a power of minus three fifths and the average number of particles in a cluster depends on their speed and time in the power of three fifths. The size distribution function of clusters is obtained, which is found to be asymmetric with respect to the average number of particles in clusters.},

  abstract = {Colloids that interact via a short-range attraction serve as the primary building blocks for a broad range of self-assembled materials. However, one of the well-known drawbacks to this strategy is that these building blocks rapidly and readily condense into a metastable colloidal gel. Using computer simulations, we illustrate how the addition of a small fraction of purely repulsive self-propelled colloids, a technique referred to as active doping, can prevent the formation of this metastable gel state and drive the system toward its thermodynamically favored crystalline target structure. The simplicity and robust nature of this strategy offers a systematic and generic pathway to improving the self-assembly of a large number of complex colloidal structures. We discuss in detail the process by which this feat is accomplished and provide quantitative metrics for exploiting it to modulate the self-assembly. We provide evidence for the generic nature of this approach by demonstrating that it remains robust under a number of different anisotropic short-ranged pair interactions in both two and three dimensions. In addition, we report on a novel microphase in mixtures of passive and active colloids. For a broad range of self-propelling velocities, it is possible to stabilize a suspension of fairly monodisperse finite-size crystallites. Surprisingly, this microphase is also insensitive to the underlying pair interaction between building blocks. The active stabilization of these moderately sized monodisperse clusters is quite remarkable and should be of great utility in the design of hierarchical self-assembly strategies. This work further bolsters the notion that active forces can play a pivotal role in directing colloidal self-assembly.},

The most commonly used synthesis method comprises decomposition of organometallic compounds in an oxygen-free environment and subsequent infliction of a biocompatible layer on the particle surface. In this work, hydroxyl–carboxyl (—OH/—COOH) type of chelating agents (citric acid and sodium citrate) are used in situ for the solvothermal synthesis of hydrophilic NaY 0.5 Gd 0.3 F 4 :Yb,Er UCNPs from rare earth nitrate salts and different fluoride sources (NaF, NH 4 F, and NH 4 HF 2 ). X-ray powder diffraction showed crystallization of cubic and hexagonal NaY 0.5 Gd 0.3 F 4 :Yb,Er phases in nano- and micro-sized particles, respectively. The content of the hexagonal phase prevails in the samples obtained when Na-citrate is used, while the size and shape of the synthesized mesocrystals are affected by the choice of fluoride source used for precipitation. All particles are functionalized with citrate ligands and emit intense green light at 519 nm and 539 nm ( 2 H 11/2 , 4 S 3/2 → 4 I 15/2 ) under near infrared light. The intensity of this emission is distressed by the change in the origin of phonon energy of the host matrix revealed by the change in the number of the excitation photons absorbed per emitted photon.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric materials may be used as effective photoelectrocatalysts for water splitting due to enhanced charge carrier separation driven by their spontaneous polarization induced internal electric field. Compared to other ferroelectric materials, BiFeO 3 exhibits a high catalytic efficiency due to its comparatively smaller bandgap, which enables light absorption from a large part of the solar spectrum and its higher bulk ferroelectric polarization. Here, we compare the photoelectrochemical properties of three different BiFeO 3 morphologies, namely, nanofibers, nanowebs, and thin films synthesized via electrospinning, directly on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. A significant photocathodic current in the range from −86.2 to −56.5 μ A cm −2 at −0.4 V bias (vs Ag/AgCl) has been recorded for all three morphologies in 0.1M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8). Among these morphologies, BiFeO 3 nanofibers exhibit higher efficiency because of their larger surface area and improved charge separation resulting from rapid diffusion of photoinduced charge carriers along the axis of the nanofiber. In the case of BiFeO 3 nanofibers, we obtained the highest photocurrent density of −86.2 µ A/cm 2 at −0.4 V bias (vs Ag/AgCl electrode) and an onset potential of 0.22 V. We also observed that the onset potential of the photocathodic current can be increased by applying a positive polarization voltage, which leads to favorable bending of band edges at the electrode/electrolyte interface resulting in increased charge carrier separation.},

In this work, we predict the properties of these two structurally similar pyrovanadates upon Cu/Mn substitution in their corresponding lattices via density functional theory calculations to explore the suitability of their band structure for water splitting and to assess their ease of synthesis. We predict that a concentration of up to 20\% Cu and Mn into β -Mn 2 V 2 O 7 and β -Cu 2 V 2 O 7 , respectively, leads to a narrowing of the bandgap, which, in the former case, is experimentally confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy.

Moreover, we predict the materials with higher substitution levels to be increasingly difficult to synthesize, implying that low substitution levels are most relevant in terms of bandgaps and ease of synthesis.},

However, the fabrication of the UC devices has not been fully optimized; thus, there is room for improvement. Here, we apply techniques that have been successful in enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells in order to also improve perovskite-sensitized UC devices. In particular, we investigate the use of a post-fabrication thermal annealing step, overstoichiometric vs stoichiometric addition of PbI 2 to the perovskite precursors, methylammonium vs formamidinium cation-rich lead halide perovskite compositions, and the use of different solvents for the annihilator molecules on the perovskite/annihilator interface. We find that excess PbI 2 does not significantly affect the UC process, while the perovskite composition is crucial for the yield of extracted carriers across the interface. Comparing toluene and chlorobenzene, we find that the solvent used to deposit the annihilator is also a key factor in the overall device performance. Moreover, we find that thermal annealing of the whole device architecture significantly improves the UC performance by a factor of three.},

The structure of metallic (a mixture of T and T′) and semiconducting (2H) phases was unambiguously characterized by Raman spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence imaging, and transmission electron microscope observations. The amount of NaCl, reaction temperature, reaction time, and locations of substrates are essential for controlling the percentage of metallic/semiconducting phases in lateral heterostructures; loading a large amount of NaCl at low temperatures with short reaction times prefers metallic phases. The existence of the semiconducting phase in MoS 2 lateral heterostructures significantly enhances the stability of the metallic phases through passivation of reactive edges. The same approach can be applied to other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as WS 2 , leading to boosting of basic research and application of TMDs in metallic phases.},

In this device, graphene and AAO are used as the sensing material and the substrate, respectively. We characterize the sensitivity and the response time using the experimental results and simulation data. The real-time resistance change of graphene is monitored depending on the temperature, and the response time is also analyzed by COMSOL Multiphysics. To confirm the porous substrate effect, we compare the device performance of the AAO substrate to the performance of the glass substrate. From these results, the suspended graphene on the AAO substrate shows about two times higher sensitivity and a much faster response time than the glass substrate.},

  abstract = {The harmonic angle bending potential is used in many force fields for (bio)molecular simulation. The force associated with this potential is discontinuous at angles close to 180°, which can lead to numeric instabilities. Angle bending of linear groups, such as alkynes or nitriles, or linear molecules, such as carbon dioxide, can be treated by a simple harmonic potential if we describe the fluctuations as a deviation from a reference position of the central atom, the position of which is determined by the flanking atoms. The force constant for the linear angle potential can be derived analytically from the corresponding force constant in the traditional potential. The new potential is tested on the properties of alkynes, nitriles, and carbon dioxide. We find that the angles of the linear groups remain about 2° closer to 180° using the new potential. The bond and angle force constants for carbon dioxide were tuned to reproduce the experimentally determined frequencies. An interesting finding was that simulations of liquid carbon dioxide under pressure with the new flexible model were stable only when explicitly modeling the long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions due to the very long-range nature of the LJ interactions (&gt;1.7 nm). In the other tested liquids, we find that a Lennard-Jones cutoff of 1.1 nm yields similar results as the particle mesh Ewald algorithm for LJ interactions. Algorithmic factors influencing the stability of liquid simulations are discussed as well. Finally, we demonstrate that the linear angle potential can be used in free energy perturbation calculations.},

The hydrogen-bonded carbonyl stretch of the molecular pair was monitored in dilute mixtures of methyl acetate in trifluoromethane at near-critical temperatures, from gas- to liquid-like densities. In the gas region, it was possible to discriminate the carbonyl signal of the hydrogen-bonded complex from that of the free ester and have access to their relative concentration. The equilibrium constant of the hydrogen bonding reaction and the standard enthalpy and entropy changes in the process were determined using the spectroscopic data. CH⋯O bonding was favored by lowering temperature or pressurizing F 3 CH in the mixture, remaining essentially no free carbonyl groups about the critical density. The carbonyl band of the hydrogen-bonded pair appeared as a single symmetric peak up to liquid-like densities, suggesting that the 1:1 methyl acetate-trifluoromethane complex has the most abundant stoichiometry. Spectral features as frequency shift and bandwidth of the hydrogen-bonded carbonyl were studied as a function of temperature and solvent-density. A bathochromic (red) vibrational shift was registered for the bound carbonyl band against density, with a sudden change in behavior in the near-critical region, while the width of this band remains mostly unresponsive.},

Here, we employ non-equilibrium molecular dynamics of water in heterogeneous environments experiencing direct contact with a propane gas phase at various temperatures in externally applied static electric fields, elucidating significant external-field effects in inducing poly - crystalline cubic-ice formation.

The frequency of the coherent oscillation observed for CBA in nonpolar n -hexane solution (Hex) was 377 cm −1 , while this oscillation was undetectable in DemeBF 4 . For BA in DemeBF 4 , coherent oscillation with a frequency of 394 cm −1 was observed, which is similar to that for CBA in Hex. CS of CBA occurs in the ultrashort time range of ≤100 fs, while that of BA occurs in a few picosecond range [E. Takeuchi et al. , J. Phys. Chem. C 120 , 14502–14512 (2016)]. Hence, the oscillation of CBA in Hex and that of BA in DemeBF 4 are assigned to the molecular vibration in the locally excited state, while this oscillation dephases instantaneously for CBA in DemeBF 4 due to the ultrafast CS and no oscillation was generated in the CS state.

  abstract = {Internal conversion decay dynamics associated with the potential energy surfaces of three low-lying singlet excited electronic states, S 1 ( ππ * , A′), S 2 ( ππ * , A′), and S 3 ( nπ * , A″), of tropolone are investigated theoretically. Energetic and spatial aspects of conical intersections of these electronic states are explored with the aid of the linear vibronic coupling approach. Symmetry selection rules suggest that non-totally symmetric modes would act as coupling modes between S 1 and S 3 as well as between S 2 and S 3 . We found that the S 1 –S 2 interstate coupling via totally symmetric modes is very weak. A diabatic vibronic Hamiltonian consisting of 32 vibrational degrees of freedom is constructed to simulate the photoinduced dynamics of S 0 → S 1 and S 0 → S 2 transitions. We observe a direct nonadiabatic population transfer from S 1 to S 3 , bypassing S 2 , during the initial wavepacket propagation on S 1 . On the other hand, the initial wavepacket evolving on S 2 would pass through the S 2 –S 3 and S 1 –S 3 conical intersections before reaching S 1 . The presence of multiple proton transfer channels on the S 1 –S 2 –S 3 coupled potential energy surfaces of tropolone is analyzed. Our findings necessitate the treatment of proton tunneling dynamics of tropolone beyond the adiabatic symmetric double well potentials.},

In the gas phase, ions were generated in a supersonic molecular beam by a pulsed electrical discharge. After extraction into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer, the ions were mass selected and probed by infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy in the 700 cm −1 –3500 cm −1 region. Spectra were measured using either argon or neon tagging, as well as tagging with an excess CO molecule. In solid para -hydrogen, ions were generated by electron bombardment of a mixture of CO and hydrogen, and absorption spectra were recorded in the 400 cm −1 –4000 cm −1 region with a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. A comparison of the measured spectra with the predictions of anharmonic theory at the CCSD(T)/ANO1 level suggests that the predominant isomers formed by either argon tagging or para -hydrogen isolation are higher lying (+7.8 kcal mol −1 ), less symmetric isomers, and not the global minimum proton-bound dimer. Changing the formation environment or tagging strategy produces other non-centrosymmetric structures, but there is no spectroscopic evidence for the centrosymmetric proton-bound dimer. The formation of higher energy isomers may be caused by a kinetic effect, such as the binding of X (=Ar, Ne, or H 2 ) to H + (CO) prior to the formation of X H + (CO) 2 . Regardless, there is a strong tendency to produce non-centrosymmetric structures in which HCO + remains an intact core ion.},

It is found that these large systems meet the energy level matching conditions of efficient SF and exhibit superior third-order NLO properties (second hyperpolarizability γ at the molecular scale) to a typical SF molecule, pentacene. In addition, we investigate SF rates and γ in the correlated triplet pair [ 1 (TT)] state generated by SF for various slip-stacked dimer models of these systems. For molecular packing with relatively large 1 (TT) yields, a significant increase in γ/monomer in the 1 (TT) state is observed, which is in good agreement with the electronic-coupling-based design guidelines obtained from our previous study. In particular, the butterfly-shaped acenes involving heteroatoms are found to exhibit a significant increase in γ/monomer as compared to the other systems. By analyzing the excitation properties in the 1 (TT) state and intermolecular orbital interactions, we clarify the origin of such γ enhancement. The obtained results contribute to the construction of design guidelines for efficient SF-induced-NLO materials and demonstrate that butterfly-shaped acenes have the potential to surpass conventional NLO systems.},

We identified seven dimer ( n = 1) and nine trimer species ( n = 2) with open C 2 v and cyclic D 3 h ozone. Calculations at the CCSD(T)/CBS level of theory for C 2 v O 3 (H 2 O) on the counterpoise (CP)-corrected potential energy surface yield a dissociation energy of D e = 2.31 kcal/mol and an O 3 central-oxygen (O c ) H 2 O oxygen (O w ) distance r [O c ⋯O w ] of 3.097 Å, which is in good agreement with an experimental value of 2.957 Å [J. Z. Gillies et al. , J. Mol. Spectrosc. 146 , 493 (1991)]. Combining our CCSD(T)/CBS value of D e for C 2 v O 3 (H 2 O) with our best estimate anharmonic CCSD(T)/aVTZ ΔZPE yields a D o value of 1.82 kcal/mol; the CCSD(T)/CBS value of D e for D 3 h O 3 (H 2 O) is 1.51 kcal/mol and yields an anharmonic CCSD(T)/aVTZ D o = 0.99 kcal/mol. CCSD(T)/aVTZ dissociation energies and structures for C 2 v O 3 (H 2 O) 2 are D e = 4.15 kcal/mol, (D o = 3.08 kcal/mol) and r [O c ⋯O w ] = 2.973 Å, and D e = 2.64 kcal/mol (D o = 1.68 kcal/mol) with r [O c ⋯O w ] = 2.828 Å for D 3 h O 3 (H 2 O) 2 . The results from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which consider dynamic and thermal effects in O 3 (H 2 O), show that the O 3 (H 2 O) complex remains stable at 50 K and dynamically interconverts between two hydrogen-bonded conformers with short O c ⋯O w contacts (3.85 Å). Carr–Parrinello molecular dynamic (CPMD) simulations for O 3 (H 2 O) and O 3 (H 2 O) 2 at 100 K demonstrate that O 3 (H 2 O) 2 remains structurally intact, whereas O 3 (H 2 O) dissociates to free ozone and water, a feature consistent with the larger average binding energy in O 3 (H 2 O) 2 (2.2 kcal/mol) vs that in O 3 (H 2 O) (1.8 kcal/mol). Finally, the results from CCSD(T)/CBS and CPMD simulations demonstrate that the large inter-trimer binding energies in O 3 (H 2 O) 2 would give rise to an elevated trimer/dimer population ratio, making O 3 (H 2 O) 2 a particularly stable and spectroscopically detectable complex.},

In this proof-of-principle demonstration, we transfer population to an nf Rydberg state of the calcium atom by stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, in which an optical and a millimeter-wave field couple the initial and final states via an intermediate nd Rydberg state. Numerical simulations reproduce the observed time and frequency dependences of the population transfer and suggest the utility of this scheme to populate high- ℓ Rydberg states of molecules.},

  abstract = {Selective recoupling of protons (SERP) is a method to selectively and quantitatively measure magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between protons and, in turn, the proton–proton distance in solid-state samples at fast magic-angle spinning. We present a bimodal operator-based Floquet approach to describe the numerically optimized SERP recoupling sequence. The description calculates the allowed terms in the first-order effective Hamiltonian, explains the origin of selectivity during recoupling, and shows how different terms are modulated as a function of the radio frequency amplitude and the phase of the sequence. Analytical and numerical simulations have been used to evaluate the effect of higher-order terms and offsets on the polarization transfer efficiency and quantitative distance measurement. The experimentally measured 1 H– 1 H distances on a fully protonated thymol sample are ∼10\%–15\% shorter than those reported from diffraction studies. A semi-quantitative model combined with extensive numerical simulations is used to rationalize the effect of the third-spin and the role of different parameters in the experimentally observed shorter distances. Measurements at high magnetic fields improve the match between experimental and diffraction distances. The measurement of 1 H– 1 H couplings at offsets different from the SERP-offset has also been explored. Experiments were also performed on a perdeuterated ubiquitin sample to demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously measuring multiple quantitative distances and to evaluate the accuracy of the measured distance in the absence of multispin effects. The estimation of proton–proton distances provides a boost to structural characterization of small pharmaceuticals and biomolecules, given that the positions of protons are generally not well defined in x-ray structures.},

The design takes advantage of recent developments in radio-frequency components, notably, high-frequency, high-power solid-state amplifiers. The spectrometer had a flatness of 5.5 dB across the spectral range, produced harmonic signals below −20 dBc, and the recorded signal scaled well to 6 × 10 6 averages. The new spectrometer was used to determine pressure broadening coefficients with a helium collider at room temperature for three molecules relevant to astrochemistry, applying the Voigt function to fit the magnitude of the Fourier-transformed data in the frequency domain. The pressure broadening coefficient for carbonyl sulfide was determined to be (2.45 ± 0.02) MHz mbar -1 at room temperature, which agreed well with previous measurements. Pressure broadening coefficients were also determined for multiple transitions of vinyl cyanide and benzonitrile. Additionally, the spectrometer was coupled with a cold, uniform flow from a Laval nozzle. The spectrum of vinyl cyanide was recorded in the flow, and its rotational temperature was determined to be (24 ± 11) K. This temperature agreed with a prediction of the composite temperature of the system through simulations of the experimental environment coupled with calculations of the solution to the optical Bloch equations. These results pave the way for future quantitative studies in low-temperature and high-pressure environments using CP-FTMW spectroscopy.},

Recently, thermally assisted-occupation DFT (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai, J. Chem. Phys. 136 , 154104 (2012)], a DFT with fractional orbital occupations, was proposed, explicitly incorporating the non-dynamical correlation effects in the ground-state calculations with low computational complexity.

With tests on the excited states of H 2 , the first triplet excited state ( ⁠ 1 3 Σ u + ⁠ ) was described well, with non-imaginary excitation energies. TDTAO-DFT also yields zero singlet–triplet gap in the dissociation limit for the ground singlet ( ⁠ 1 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) and the first triplet state ( ⁠ 1 3 Σ u + ⁠ ). In addition, as compared to traditional TDDFT, the overall excited-state potential energy surfaces obtained from TDTAO-DFT are generally improved and better agree with results from the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles.},

Such representations include density fitting (DF), the continuous fast multipole method (CFMM), and, more recently, hierarchical matrices. We apply the H 2 hierarchical matrix representation to the ERI tensor with Gaussian basis sets to rapidly calculate the Coulomb matrices in Hartree–Fock and density functional theory calculations. The execution time and storage requirements of the hierarchical matrix approach and the DF approach are compared. The hierarchical matrix approach has very modest storage requirements, allowing large calculations to be performed in memory without recomputing ERIs. We interpret the hierarchical matrix approach as a multilevel, localized DF method and also discuss the close relationship between the hierarchical matrix approaches with CFMM. Like CFMM, the hierarchical matrix approach is asymptotically linear scaling, but the latter requires severalfold less memory (or severalfold less computation, if quantities are computed dynamically) due to being able to efficiently employ low-rank approximations for far more blocks.},

  abstract = {Constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) is at the core of the modern density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and its time dependent formulation. For the DMRG to be conveniently used in different problems described by different Hamiltonians, in this work, we propose a new generic algorithm to construct the MPO of an arbitrary operator with a sum-of-products form based on the bipartite graph theory. We show that the method has the following advantages: (i) it is automatic in that only the definition of the operator is required; (ii) it is symbolic thus free of any numerical error; (iii) the complementary operator technique can be fully employed so that the resulting MPO is globally optimal for any given order of degrees of freedom; and (iv) the symmetry of the system could be fully employed to reduce the dimension of MPO. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm, the MPOs of Hamiltonians ranging from the prototypical spin–boson model and the Holstein model to the more complicated ab initio electronic Hamiltonian and the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian with the sextic force field are constructed. It is found that for the former three cases, our automatic algorithm can reproduce exactly the same MPOs as the optimally hand-crafted ones already known in the literature.},

  abstract = {The meta-generalized-gradient approximation (meta-GGA) of the exchange–correlation energy functional can provide appealing performance for the wide range of quantum chemistry and solid-state properties. So far, several meta-GGAs are proposed by fitting to the test sets or/and satisfying as many as known exact constraints. Although the density overlap is treated by meta-GGA functionals efficiently, for non-covalent interactions, a long-range dispersion correction is essential. In this work, we assess the benchmark performance of different variants of the Tao–Mo meta-GGA semilocal functional, i.e., TM [J. Tao and Y. Mo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 117 , 073001 (2016)] and revTM [S. Jana, K. Sharma, and P. Samal, J. Phys. Chem. A 123 , 6356 (2019)], with Grimme’s D3 correction for several non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen-bonded systems. We consider the zero, Becke–Johnson (BJ), and optimized power (OP) damping functions within the D3 method with both TM and revTM functionals. It is observed that the overall performance of the functionals gradually improved from zero to BJ and to OP damping. However, the constructed “OP” corrected (rev)TM + D3(OP) functionals perform considerably better compared to other well-known dispersion corrected functionals. Based on the accuracy of the proposed functionals, the future applicability of these methods is also discussed.},

  abstract = {Theoretical methods able to screen large sets (e.g., conformers) of possibly large compounds are needed in many typical quantum chemistry applications. For this purpose, we here extend the well-established simplified time-dependent density functional theory (sTD-DFT) method for the calculation of optical rotation. This new scheme is benchmarked against 42 compounds of the OR45 set as well as thirteen helicene derivatives and one bio-molecular system. The sTD-DFT method yields optical rotations in good quantitative agreement with experiment for compounds with a valence-dominated response, e.g., conjugated π -systems, at a small fraction of the computational cost compared to TD-DFT (1–3 orders of magnitude speed-up). For smaller molecules with a Rydberg state dominated response, the agreement between TD-DFT and the simplified version using standard hybrid functionals is somewhat worse but still reasonable for typical applications. Our new implementation in the stda code enables computations for systems with up to 1000 atoms, e.g., for studying flexible bio-molecules.},

  abstract = {The framework of transition state theory relies on the determination of a geometric structure identifying reactivity. It replaces the laborious exercise of following many trajectories for a long time to provide chemical reaction rates and pathways. In this paper, recent advances in constructing this geometry even in time-dependent systems are applied to the LiCN ⇌ LiNC isomerization reaction driven by an external field. We obtain decay rates of the reactant population close to the transition state by exploiting local properties of the dynamics of trajectories in and close to it. We find that the external driving has a large influence on these decay rates when compared to the non-driven isomerization reaction. This, in turn, provides renewed evidence for the possibility of controlling chemical reactions, like this one, through external time-dependent fields.},

The technique is capable of folding proteins with very low computational effort and requires only an energy parameter. The path correlated MD (CORE-MD) method uses the autocorrelation of the path integral over the reduced action and propagates the system along the history dependent path correlation. We validate the new technique in simulations of the conformational landscapes of dialanine and the TrpCage mini-peptide. We find that the novel method accelerates the sampling by three orders of magnitude and observe convergence of the conformational sampling in both cases. We conclude that the new method is broadly applicable for the enhanced sampling in MD simulations. The CORE-MD algorithm reaches a high accuracy compared with long time equilibrium MD simulations.},

Using synergetics, we will indicate how the master-slave dynamics can suitably be exploited to develop a novel coupled-cluster algorithm in a much reduced dimension.},

The scheme is based on an expectation-value ansatz, similar to the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method or the intermediate state representation (ISR) approach of the algebraic–diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme. Due to the UCC ansatz, the resulting equations cannot be given by closed-form expressions but need to be approximated. Explicit expressions for the expectation value of a general one-particle operator correct through second order in perturbation theory have been derived and coded for the electronic ground state as well as for excited states of predominant single-excitation character. The resulting equations are shown to be equivalent to those of the second-order ADC/ISR procedure. As first computational tests, the second-order UCC method (UCC2) and the one employing third-order amplitudes (also eigenvectors) together with the second-order density matrix, denoted as UCC3(2), are applied to the calculation of dipole moments for a series of small closed- and open-shell systems as well as 4-cyanoindole and 2,3-benzofuran and compared to full configuration interaction or experimental results. For the aromatic organic molecules, the UCC2 method is shown to be sufficient for the ground-state dipole moment, whereas the UCC3(2) scheme is superior for excited-state dipole moments.},

This approach (named TDDFT-as, for auxiliary s-type) predicts excitation energies for silver nanoparticles with different sizes and shapes with an average error of only 12 meV compared to reference TDDFT calculations. The TDDFT-as approach resembles tight-binding approximation schemes for the linear-response treatment, but for the atomic transition charges, which are here computed exactly (i.e., without approximation from population analysis). We found that the exact computation of the atomic transition charges strongly improves the absorption spectra in a wide energy range.},

In addition to advances in machine learning architectures and training techniques, achieving this ambitious goal requires a method to convert a 3D atomic system into a feature representation that preserves rotational and translational symmetries, smoothness under small perturbations, and invariance under re-ordering. The atomic orbital wavelet scattering transform preserves these symmetries by construction and has achieved great success as a featurization method for machine learning energy prediction. Both in small molecules and in the bulk amorphous Li α Si system, machine learning models using wavelet scattering coefficients as features have demonstrated a comparable accuracy to density functional theory at a small fraction of the computational cost. In this work, we test the generalizability of our Li α Si energy predictor to properties that were not included in the training set, such as elastic constants and migration barriers. We demonstrate that statistical feature selection methods can reduce over-fitting and lead to remarkable accuracy in these extrapolation tasks.},

The primary cause of this shortcoming is an inadequate description of bond breaking. While reactive force fields such as ReaxFF show improvements compared to traditional force fields, the charge models used yield unphysical partial charges, especially during dissociation of ionic bonds. This flaw may be remedied by using the atom-condensed Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) approximated to a second order (ACKS2) charge model for determining partial charges. In this work, we present a new ACKS2-enabled Reax force field for fracture simulations of lithium oxide systems, which was obtained by training against an extensive set of DFT, multireference configuration interaction (MRCI), and MRCI+Q reference data using genetic optimization techniques. This new force field significantly improves the bond breaking behavior, but still cannot fully capture the brittle fracture in MD simulations, suggesting more research is needed to improve simulation of brittle fracture.},

We demonstrate the application of this theory by deriving a Lennard-Jones (LJ)-like potential for arbitrary geometries along with a Weeks–Chandler–Anderson-like repulsive variant, showing that the resulting potentials behave very similarly to standard LJ potentials while also providing a nearly conformal mapping of the underlying shape. We then describe an implementation of this potential in the simulation engine HOOMD-blue and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to achieve a sufficiently robust and performant implementation. The resulting potential can be applied to smooth geometries like ellipsoids and to convex polytopes. We contextualize these applications with reference to the existing methods for simulating such particles. The pair potential is validated using standard criteria, and its performance is compared to existing methods for comparable simulations. Finally, we show the results of self-assembly simulations, demonstrating that this method can be used to study the assembly of anisotropic particles into crystal structures.},

The approach is based on the kinetics of single-electron transitions between many-body molecular states. This study shows that the EL polarity arises due to asymmetric coupling of molecular orbitals of the photochromic part of the molecule to the electrodes. The gate voltage controls the power of the EL through the occupancy of the excited singlet state. The shifting of the orbital energies forms a resonant or a non-resonant path for the transmission of electrons through the molecule. The action of the gate voltage is reflected in specific critical voltages. An analytical dependence of the critical voltages on the energies of molecular states involved in the formation of EL, as well as on the gate voltage, was derived for both positive and negative polarities. Conditions under which the gate voltage lowers the absolute value of the bias voltage that is responsible for the activation of the resonance mechanism of EL formation were also established. This is an important factor in control of EL in molecular junctions.},

Organic polaritons hold great interest for optoelectronic applications; however, progress toward this end has been impeded by the lack of a first principles approach that quantifies light–matter interactions in these systems, which would allow the formulation of molecular design rules. Here, we present a theoretical framework that combines first principles calculations for excitons with classical electrodynamics in order to quantify light–matter interactions. We exemplify our approach by studying variants of the conjugated polymer polydiacetylene, and we show that a large polymer conjugation length is critical toward strong exciton–photon coupling, hence underlying the importance of pure structures without static disorder. By comparing to our experimental reflectivity measurements, we show that the coupling of excitons to vibrations, manifested by phonon side bands in the absorption, has a strong impact on the magnitude of light–matter coupling over a range of frequencies. Our approach opens the way toward a deeper understanding of polaritons in organic materials, and we highlight that a quantitatively accurate calculation of the exciton–photon interaction would require accounting for all sources of disorder self-consistently.},

A Lie group-based method is also proposed for the derivation of the reference configuration in the internal axis system.

  abstract = {This work proposes to describe open-shell molecules or radicals using the framework of the doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) treatments, so far limited to closed-shell system studies. The proposal is based on considering molecular systems in singlet states generated by adding extra hydrogen atoms located at infinite distance from the target radical system. The energy of this radical is obtained by subtracting the energies of the dissociated hydrogen atoms from that provided by the two-electron reduced density matrix corresponding to the singlet state system in the DOCI space, which is variationally calculated by imposing a set of N -representability conditions. This method is numerically assessed by describing potential energy curves and reduced density matrices in selected ionic and neutral open-shell systems in the doublet spin symmetry ground state.},

  abstract = {Directional control over surface plasmon polariton (SPP) waves is a prerequisite for the development of miniaturized optical circuitry. Here, the efficacy of single and dual component SPP steering elements is explored through photoemission electron microscopy. Our imaging scheme relies on two-color photoemission and counter-propagating SPP generation, which collectively allow SPPs to be visualized in real space. Wave-vector difference mixing between the two-dimensional nanohole array and photon momenta enables SPP steering with directionality governed by the array lattice constant and input photon direction. In our dual component configuration, separate SPP generation and Bragg diffraction based steering optics are employed. We find that array Bragg planes principally influence the SPP angles through the array band structure, which allows us to visualize both positive and negative refractory waves.},

High relative collision energies (up to ≈56 000 K) and high rovibrational levels of HD (up to ≈50 000 K), relevant to various non thermal equilibrium astrophysical media, are considered. We have validated the accuracy of our QCT calculations with a new efficient adaptation of the Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method to compute the reaction probability of a specific reactive channel. Our study has revealed that the high temperature regime favors the production of H 2 in its highly rovibrationnally excited states, which can de-excite radiatively (cooling the gas) or collisionally (heating the gas). Those new state-to-state QCT reaction rate constants represent a significant improvement in our understanding of the possible mechanisms leading to the destruction of HD by its collision with a H atom.},

The assumption behind this is the localized nature of the electronic state for representing the charge carriers, being holes or electrons. As far as the quantitative description of carrier mobility is concerned, the direct application of Marcus semiclassical theory usually led to underestimation of the experimental data. A number of effects going beyond such a semiclassical description will be introduced here, including the quantum nuclear effect, dynamic disorder, and delocalization effects. The recently developed quantum dynamics simulation at the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group theory is briefly discussed. The latter was shown to be a quickly emerging efficient quantum dynamics method for the complex system.},

  abstract = {In 2020, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people worldwide and caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Spike (S) glycoproteins on the viral membrane bind to ACE2 receptors on the host cell membrane and initiate fusion, and S protein is currently among the primary drug target to inhibit viral entry. The S protein can be in a receptor inaccessible (closed) or accessible (open) state based on down and up positions of its receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. However, conformational dynamics and the transition pathway between closed to open states remain unexplored. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from closed and open states of the S protein trimer in the presence of explicit water and ions. MD simulations showed that RBD forms a higher number of interdomain interactions and exhibits lower mobility in its down position than its up position. MD simulations starting from intermediate conformations between the open and closed states indicated that RBD switches to the up position through a semi-open intermediate that potentially reduces the free energy barrier between the closed and open states. Free energy landscapes were constructed, and a minimum energy pathway connecting the closed and open states was proposed. Because RBD-ACE2 binding is compatible with the semi-open state, but not with the closed state of the S protein, we propose that the formation of the intermediate state is a prerequisite for the host cell recognition.},

Through the posterior variance of the MFGP, our framework naturally enables uncertainty quantification, providing estimates of confidence in the predictions. We used density functional theory as high-fidelity prediction, while a ML interatomic potential is used as low-fidelity prediction. Practical materials’ design efficiency is demonstrated by reproducing the ternary composition dependence of a quantity of interest (bulk modulus) across the full aluminum–niobium–titanium ternary random alloy composition space. The MFGP is then coupled to a Bayesian optimization procedure, and the computational efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by performing an on-the-fly search for the global optimum of bulk modulus in the ternary composition space. The framework presented in this manuscript is the first application of MFGP to atomistic materials simulations fusing predictions between density functional theory and classical interatomic potential calculations.},

Our configuration consists of alkanes molecules strongly coupled to the silicon surfaces via covalent bonds. In phase 1 of AEMD, the two Si blocks are thermalized at high and low temperatures to form the hot and cold reservoirs. During phase 2 of AEMD, a transfer between reservoirs occurs until thermal equilibrium is reached. The transfer across the interface dominates the transient over heat conduction within the reservoirs. The value of the thermal interface conductance is in agreement with the experimental data obtained for analogous bonding cases between molecules and reservoirs. The dependence on the length of the thermal interface resistance features two contributions. One is constant (the resistance at the silicon/molecule interface), while the other varies linearly with the length of the molecular chains (diffusive transport). The corresponding value of the thermal conductivity agrees well with experiments.},

  abstract = {Triplet energy transfer (TET) from quantum dots (QDs) to molecular acceptors has received intense research interest because of its promising application as triplet sensitizers in photon up-conversion. Compared to QD band edge excitons, the role and mechanism of trap state mediated TET in QD-acceptor complexes have not been well understood despite the prevalence of trap states in many QDs. Herein, TET from trap states in CdSe QDs to adsorbed 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (ACA) is studied with steady state photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved photoluminescence. We show that both band edge and trap excitons undergo direct Dexter energy transfer to form the triplet excited state of ACA. The rate of TET decreases from (0.340 ± 0.002) ns −1 to (0.124 ± 0.004) ns −1 for trap excitons with decreasing energy from 2.25 eV to 1.57 eV, while the TET rate from band edge excitons is 13–37 times faster than trapped excitons. Despite slightly higher TET quantum efficiency from band edge excitons (∼100\%) than trapped excitons (∼95\%), the overall TET process from CdSe to ACA is dominated by trapped excitons because of their larger relative populations. This result demonstrates the important role of trap state mediated TET in nanocrystal sensitized triplet generation.},

We focus here on the emerging use of liquid Cu catalysts, which have high potential for fast and efficient industrial-scale production of high-quality graphene. The interface between graphene and liquid Cu is studied using force field and ab initio molecular dynamics, revealing a complete or partial embedding of finite-sized flakes. By analyzing flakes of different sizes, we find that the size-dependence of the embedding can be rationalized based on the energy cost of embedding vs bending the graphene flake. The embedding itself is driven by the formation of covalent bonds between the under-coordinated edge C atoms and the liquid Cu surface, which is accompanied by a significant charge transfer. In contrast, the central flake atoms are located around or slightly above 3 Å from the liquid Cu surface and exhibit weak van der Waals–bonding and much lower charge transfer. The structural and electronic properties of the embedded state revealed in our work provide the atomic-scale information needed to develop effective models to explain the special growth observed in experiments where various interesting phenomena such as flake self-assembly and rotational alignment, high growth speeds, and low defect densities in the final graphene product have been observed.},

A combined experimental and theoretical study on the resultant 2D graphene electrodes revealed that a single-layer graphene sheet exhibited a significantly higher electrocatalytic activity at its edge than that over the surface of its basal plane. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity of a single-layer 2D graphene sheet was significantly enhanced by simply punching microholes through the graphene electrode due to the increased edge population for the hole-punched graphene electrode. In a good consistency with the experimental observations, our density function theory calculations confirmed that the introduction of holes into a graphene sheet generated additional positive charge along the edge of the punched holes and hence the creation of more highly active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. The demonstrated concept for less graphene material to be more electrocatalytically active shed light on the rational design of low-cost, but efficient electrocatalysts from 2D graphene for various potential applications ranging from electrochemical sensing to energy conversion and storage.},

These densities fluctuate obeying the distribution ∝ exp ( − F / k B T ) ⁠ . Eliminating the solvent density deviation in F ⁠ , we obtain the effective non-Coulombic interactions among the ions, which consist of the direct ones and the solvent-mediated ones. We then derive general expressions for the ion correlation, the apparent partial volume, and the activity and osmotic coefficients up to linear order in the average salt density n s . Second, we perform numerical analysis using the Mansoori–Carnahan–Starling–Leland model [J. Chem. Phys. 54 , 1523 (1971)] for three-component hardspheres. The effective interactions sensitively depend on the cation and anion sizes due to competition between the steric and hydration effects, which are repulsive between small–large ion pairs and attractive between symmetric pairs. These agree with previous experiments and Collins’ rule [Biophys. J. 72 , 65 (1997)]. We also give simple approximate expressions for the ionic interaction coefficients valid for any ion sizes.},

Thermodynamic integration based on path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) and lattice dynamics calculations are used to study the phase stability of the hcp and fcc LJ solids. The hcp phase is shown to be stabilized by quantum effects in PIMD, while fcc is shown to be favored by lattice dynamics, which suggests a possible re-entrant low pressure fcc phase for highly quantum systems. Implications for the phase stability of noble gas solids are discussed. For parameters equating to helium, the expansion due to zero-point vibrations is associated with quantum melting: neither crystal structure is stable at zero pressure.},

However, most ML-FFs have been used to study the phenomena relatively close to the equilibrium ground states. In this work, we have studied a far from equilibrium system of liquid to crystal Si growth using ML-FF. We found that our ML-FF based on ab initio decomposed atomic energy can reproduce all the aspects of ab initio simulated growth, from local energy fluctuations to transition temperatures, to diffusion constant, and growth rates. We have also compared the growth simulation with the Stillinger–Weber classical force field and found significant differences. A procedure is also provided to correct a systematic fitting bias in the ML-FF training process, which exists in all training models, otherwise critical results like transition temperature will be wrong.},

Using the technique of isolated-core multiphoton Rydberg-dissociation spectroscopy, we have recorded rotationally resolved spectra of the B + 2 Σ + ( ⁠ v ′) ← X + 2 Σ + ( ⁠ v ″ = 7) transitions, which extend from the vibrational ground state ( ⁠ v ′ = 0) to the dissociation continuum above the Mg + (3p 2 P 3/2 ) + Ar( 1 S 0 ) dissociation threshold. The analysis of the rotational structure reveals a transition from Hund’s angular-momentum-coupling case (b) at low v ′ values to case (c) at high v ′ values caused by the spin–orbit interaction. Measurements of the kinetic-energy release and the angular distribution of the Mg + fragments detected in the experiments enabled the characterization of the dissociation mechanisms. The vibrational levels of the B + state above v ′ = 6 are subject to predissociation into the Mg + (3p 2 P 1/2 ) + Ar( 1 S 0 ) continuum, and the fragment angular distributions exhibit anisotropy β parameters around 0.5, whereas direct dissociation into the continuum above the Mg + (3p 2 P 3/2 ) + Ar( 1 S 0 ) asymptote is characterized by β parameters approaching 2. Molecular ions excited to the B + state with v ′ = 0–6 efficiently absorb a second photon to the repulsive part of the 2 Σ + state associated with the Mg + (3d 2 D 3/2,5/2 ) + Ar( 1 S 0 ) continua. The interpretation of the data is validated by the results of ab initio calculations of the low-lying electronic states of MgAr + , which provided initial evidence for the existence of bound vibrational levels of the B + state and for the photodissociation mechanisms of its low vibrational levels.},

  abstract = {The vacuum-ultraviolet threshold photoelectron spectrum of methyl isocyanate CH 3 NCO has been recorded from 10.4 eV to 12 eV using synchrotron radiation and a coincidence technique allowing for a mass-discrimination of the photoelectron signal. A significant improvement is achieved over previous investigations as this experimental setup leads to a much more resolved spectrum. Ten sharp peaks and a broad feature spanning 1.2 eV were recorded. This spectrum consists of X ̃ + 2 A ″ ← X ̃ 1 A ′ and Ã + 2 A ′ ← X ̃ 1 A ′ ionizing transitions. For the former, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined experimentally to be 10.596(6) eV; for the latter, its value was estimated to be 10.759(50) eV. Seven sharp peaks could be assigned to vibrational modes of the cation X ̃ + 2 A ″ and neutral X ̃ 1 A ′ ground electronic states involving only the NCO group atoms. Theoretical modeling of the threshold photoelectron spectrum has proven difficult as methyl isocyanate is a non-rigid molecule displaying large amplitude internal rotation of the methyl group and ∠ CNC bending mode, leading to the quasi-symmetry. With the help of ab initio calculations, a theoretical model in which these two large amplitude motions are included in addition to the five small amplitude vibrational modes involving NCO group atoms is proposed. Comparison with the experimental spectrum shows that the broad feature and the strongest peak line positions are well accounted for; their intensities are also fairly well reproduced after adjusting a few parameters.},

  abstract = {Photodissociation of pyruvic acid (PA) was studied in the gas-phase at 193 nm using two complementary techniques. The time-sliced velocity map imaging arrangement was used to determine kinetic energy release distributions of fragments and estimate dissociation timescales. The multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometer setup was used to identify and quantify photoproducts, including isomers and free radicals, by their mass-to-charge ratios, photoionization spectra, and kinetic time profiles. Using these two techniques, it is possible to observe the major dissociation products of PA photodissociation: CO 2 , CO, H, OH, HCO, CH 2 CO, CH 3 CO, and CH 3 . Acetaldehyde and vinyl alcohol are minor primary photoproducts at 193 nm, but products that are known to arise from their unimolecular dissociation, such as HCO, H 2 CO, and CH 4 , are identified and quantified. A multivariate analysis that takes into account the yields of the observed products and assumes a set of feasible primary dissociation reactions provides a reasonable description of the photoinitiated chemistry of PA despite the necessary simplifications caused by the complexity of the dissociation. These experiments offer the first comprehensive description of the dissociation pathways of PA initiated on the S 3 excited state. Most of the observed products and yields are rationalized on the basis of three reaction mechanisms: (i) decarboxylation terminating in CO 2 + other primary products (∼50\%); (ii) Norrish type I dissociation typical of carbonyls (∼30\%); and (iii) O—H and C—H bond fission reactions generating the H atom (∼10\%). The analysis shows that most of the dissociation reactions create more than two products. This observation is not surprising considering the high excitation energy (∼51 800 cm −1 ) and fairly low energy required for dissociation of PA. We find that two-body fragmentation processes yielding CO 2 are minor, and the expected, unstable primary co-fragment, methylhydroxycarbene, is not observed because it probably undergoes fast secondary dissociation and/or isomerization. Norrish type I dissociation pathways generate OH and only small yields of CH 3 CO and HOCO, which have low dissociation energies and further decompose via three-body fragmentation processes. Experiments with d 1 -PA (CH 3 COCOOD) support the interpretations. The dissociation on S 3 is fast, as indicated by the products’ recoil angular anisotropy, but the roles of internal conversion and intersystem crossing to lower states are yet to be determined.},

Detailed modeling of kinetics was needed to derive the rate constants at temperatures of 700 K and higher. In the 400 K–600 K range, upper limits are given. The data from 700 K to 1000 K follow the Arrhenius equation behavior described by 2.4 × 10 −8 e −0.288 eV/kT cm 3 s −1 . The activation energy derived from the Arrhenius plot is equal to the endothermicity of the reaction. However, calculations at the CCSD(T)/complete basis set level suggest that the lowest energy crossing between the neutral and anion surfaces lies 0.6 eV above the N 2 O equilibrium geometry and 0.3 eV above the endothermicity of the dissociative attachment. Kinetic modeling under this assumption is in modest agreement with the experimental data. The data are best explained by attachment occurring below the lowest energy crossing of the neutral and valence anion surfaces via vibrational Feshbach resonances.},

  abstract = {Through the use of resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy, sharp predissociation thresholds have been identified in the spectra of CrO, MoO, RuO, and RhO. Similar thresholds have previously been used to measure the bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of many molecules that have a high density of vibronic states at the ground separated atom limit. A high density of states allows precise measurement of the BDE by facilitating prompt dissociation to ground state atoms when the BDE is exceeded. However, the number of states required for prompt predissociation at the thermochemical threshold is not well defined and undoubtedly varies from molecule to molecule. The ground separated atom limit generates 315 states for RuO, 252 states for RhO, and 63 states for CrO and MoO. Although comparatively few states derive from this limit for CrO and MoO, the observation of sharp predissociation thresholds for all four molecules nevertheless allows BDEs to be assigned as 4.863(3) eV (RuO), 4.121(3) eV (RhO), 4.649(5) eV (CrO), and 5.414(19) eV (MoO). Thermochemical cycles are used to derive the enthalpies of formation of the gaseous metal oxides and to obtain IE(RuO) = 8.41(5) eV, IE(RhO) = 8.56(6) eV, D 0 (Ru–O − ) = 4.24(2) eV, D 0 (Cr–O − ) = 4.409(8) eV, and D 0 (Mo–O − ) = 5.243(20) eV. The mechanisms leading to prompt predissociation at threshold in the cases of CrO and MoO are discussed. Also presented is a discussion of the bonding trends for the transition metal oxides, which are compared to the previously measured transition metal sulfides.},

  abstract = {Arrays of hydroporphyrins with boron complexes of dipyrromethene (BODIPY) are a promising platform for biomedical imaging or solar energy conversion, but their photophysical properties have been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we use time-resolved fluorescence, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and density-functional-theory calculations to elucidate solvent-dependent energy and electron-transfer processes in a series of chlorin- and bacteriochlorin-BODIPY arrays. Excitation of the BODIPY moiety results in ultrafast energy transfer to the hydroporphyrin moiety, regardless of the solvent. In toluene, energy is most likely transferred via the through-space Förster mechanism from the S 1 state of BODIPY to the S 2 state of hydroporphyrin. In DMF, substantially faster energy transfer is observed, which implies a contribution of the through-bond Dexter mechanism. In toluene, excited hydroporphyrin components show bright fluorescence, with quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime comparable to those of the benchmark monomer, whereas in DMF, moderate to significant reduction of both quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime are observed. We attribute this quenching to photoinduced charge transfer from hydroporphyrin to BODIPY. No direct spectral signature of the charge-separated state is observed, which suggests that either (1) the charge-separated state decays very quickly to the ground state or (2) virtual charge-separated states, close in energy to S 1 of hydroporphyrin, promote ultrafast internal conversion.},

  abstract = {We develop a density matrix formalism to describe coupled electron–nuclear dynamics. To this end, we introduce an effective Hamiltonian formalism that describes electronic transitions and small (quantum) nuclear fluctuations along a classical trajectory of the nuclei. Using this Hamiltonian, we derive equations of motion for the electronic occupation numbers and for the nuclear coordinates and momenta. We show that, in the limit, when the number of nuclear degrees of freedom coupled to a given electronic transition is sufficiently high (i.e., the strong decoherence limit), the equations of motion for the electronic occupation numbers become Markovian. Furthermore, the transition rates in these (rate) equations are asymmetric with respect to the lower-to-higher energy transitions and vice versa. In thermal equilibrium, such asymmetry corresponds to the detailed balance condition. We also study the equations for the electronic occupations in the non-Markovian regime and develop a surface hopping algorithm based on our formalism. To treat the decoherence effects, we introduce additional “virtual” nuclear wave packets whose interference with the “real” (physical) wave packets leads to the reduction in coupling between the electronic states (i.e., decoherence) as well as to the phase shifts that improve the accuracy of the numerical approach. Remarkably, the same phase shifts lead to the detailed balance condition in the strong decoherence limit.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models of diffusive transport underpin our understanding of chemical, biochemical, and biological transport phenomena. Analysis of such models often focuses on relatively simple geometries and deals with diffusion through highly idealized homogeneous media. In contrast, practical applications of diffusive transport theory inevitably involve dealing with more complicated geometries as well as dealing with heterogeneous media. One of the most fundamental properties of diffusive transport is the concept of mean particle lifetime or mean exit time , which are particular applications of the concept of first passage time and provide the mean time required for a diffusing particle to reach an absorbing boundary. Most formal analysis of mean particle lifetime applies to relatively simple geometries, often with homogeneous (spatially invariant) material properties. In this work, we present a general framework that provides exact mathematical insight into the mean particle lifetime, and higher moments of particle lifetime, for point particles diffusing in heterogeneous discs and spheres with radial symmetry. Our analysis applies to geometries with an arbitrary number and arrangement of distinct layers, where transport in each layer is characterized by a distinct diffusivity. We obtain exact closed-form expressions for the mean particle lifetime for a diffusing particle released at an arbitrary location, and we generalize these results to give exact, closed-form expressions for any higher-order moment of particle lifetime for a range of different boundary conditions. Finally, using these results, we construct new homogenization formulas that provide an accurate simplified description of diffusion through heterogeneous discs and spheres.},

  abstract = {Exact density functionals for the exchange and correlation energies are approximated in practical calculations for the ground-state electronic structure of a many-electron system. An important exact constraint for the construction of approximations is to recover the correct non-relativistic large- Z expansions for the corresponding energies of neutral atoms with atomic number Z and electron number N = Z , which are correct to the leading order (−0.221 Z 5/3 and −0.021 Z ln Z , respectively) even in the lowest-rung or local density approximation. We find that hydrogenic densities lead to E x ( N , Z ) ≈ −0.354 N 2/3 Z (as known before only for Z ≫ N ≫ 1) and E c ≈ −0.02 N ln N . These asymptotic estimates are most correct for atomic ions with large N and Z ≫ N , but we find that they are qualitatively and semi-quantitatively correct even for small N and N ≈ Z . The large- N asymptotic behavior of the energy is pre-figured in small- N atoms and atomic ions, supporting the argument that widely predictive approximate density functionals should be designed to recover the correct asymptotics. It is shown that the exact Kohn–Sham correlation energy, when calculated from the pure ground-state wavefunction, should have no contribution proportional to Z in the Z → ∞ limit for any fixed N .},

  abstract = {In this manuscript, we develop multiple machine learning (ML) models to accelerate a scheme for parameterizing site-based models of exciton dynamics from all-atom configurations of condensed phase sexithiophene systems. This scheme encodes the details of a system’s specific molecular morphology in the correlated distributions of model parameters through the analysis of many single-molecule excited-state electronic-structure calculations. These calculations yield excitation energies for each molecule in the system and the network of pair-wise intermolecular electronic couplings. Here, we demonstrate that the excitation energies can be accurately predicted using a kernel ridge regression (KRR) model with Coulomb matrix featurization. We present two ML models for predicting intermolecular couplings. The first one utilizes a deep neural network and bi-molecular featurization to predict the coupling directly, which we find to perform poorly. The second one utilizes a KRR model to predict unimolecular transition densities, which can subsequently be analyzed to compute the coupling. We find that the latter approach performs excellently, indicating that an effective, generalizable strategy for predicting simple bimolecular properties is through the indirect application of ML to predict higher-order unimolecular properties. Such an approach necessitates a much smaller feature space and can incorporate the insight of well-established molecular physics.},

The extended jump model (EJM) provides a quantitative description of OH reorientation in water based on contributions from hydrogen-bond exchanges, or jumps, and the “frame” reorientation of intact hydrogen-bond pairs. Here, we show that the activation energies of OH reorientation in bulk water can be calculated accurately from the EJM and that the model provides a consistent picture of hydrogen-bond exchanges based on molecular interactions. Specifically, we use the recently developed fluctuation theory for dynamics to calculate activation energies, from simulations at a single temperature, of the hydrogen-bond jumps and the frame reorientation, including their decompositions into contributions from different interactions. These are shown to be in accord, when interpreted using the EJM, with the corresponding activation energies obtained directly for OH reorientation. Thus, the present results demonstrate that the EJM can be used to describe the temperature dependence of reorientational dynamics and the underlying mechanistic details.},

  abstract = {Vacancy and self-interstitial atomic diffusion coefficients in concentrated solid solution alloys can have a non-monotonic concentration dependence. Here, the kinetics of monovacancies and ⟨100⟩ dumbbell interstitials in Ni–Fe alloys are assessed using lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC). The non-monotonicity is associated with superbasins, which impels using accelerated kMC methods. Detailed implementation prescriptions for first passage time analysis kMC (FPTA-kMC), mean rate method kMC (MRM-kMC), and accelerated superbasin kMC (AS-kMC) are given. The accelerated methods are benchmarked in the context of diffusion coefficient calculations. The benchmarks indicate that MRM-kMC underestimates diffusion coefficients, while AS-kMC overestimates them. In this application, MRM-kMC and AS-kMC are computationally more efficient than the more accurate FPTA-kMC. Our calculations indicate that composition dependence of migration energies is at the origin of the vacancy’s non-monotonic behavior. In contrast, the difference between formation energies of Ni–Ni, Ni–Fe, and Fe–Fe dumbbell interstitials is at the origin of their non-monotonic diffusion behavior. Additionally, the migration barrier crossover composition—based on the situation where Ni or Fe atom jumps have lower energy barrier than the other one—is introduced. KMC simulations indicate that the interplay between composition dependent crossover of migration energy and geometrical site percolation explains the non-monotonic concentration-dependence of atomic diffusion coefficients.},

Based on the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings model and the Kubo formula, we derive an exciton mobility expression in the framework of a temperature-dependent variational canonical transformation, which can cover a wide range of exciton–vibration coupling, exciton–cavity coupling, and temperatures. A closed-form expression for the coherent part of the total mobility is obtained in the zeroth order of the exciton–vibration coupling, which demonstrates the significance of vibrationally dressed dark excitons in the determination of the transport mechanism. By performing numerical simulations on both the H- and J-aggregates, we find that the exciton–cavity coupling has significant effects on the total mobility: (1) At low temperatures, there exists an optimal exciton–cavity coupling strength for the H-aggregate at which a maximal mobility is reached, while the mobility in the J-aggregate decreases monotonically with an increase in the exciton–cavity coupling and (2) at high temperatures, the mobility in both types of aggregates get enhanced by the cavity. We illustrate the above-mentioned low-temperature optimal mobility observed in the H-aggregate by using realistic parameters at room temperature.},

  abstract = {We present efficient yet rigorous, full-dimensional quantum bound-state calculations of the fully coupled J = 0 and one intra- and intermolecular rovibrational levels of H 2 O–CO and D 2 O–CO complexes. The new ab initio nine-dimensional (9D) potential energy surface (PES) [Y. Liu and J. Li, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 21 , 24101 (2019)] is employed. In the spirit of the recently introduced general procedure [P. M. Felker and Z. Bačić, J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 024305 (2019)], the 9D rovibrational Hamiltonian is partitioned into a 5D (rigid-monomer) intermolecular Hamiltonian, two intramolecular vibrational Hamiltonians—one for the water monomer (3D) and another for the CO monomer (1D), and a 9D remainder term. The low-energy eigenstates of the three reduced-dimension Hamiltonians are used to build up the 9D product contracted basis, in which the matrix of the full rovibrational Hamiltonian is diagonalized. In line with the findings of our earlier study referenced above, the 5D intermolecular eigenstates included in the 9D bases extend up to at most 230 cm −1 above the lowest-energy state of the given parity, much less than the intramolecular fundamentals of the two complexes that span the range of energies from about 1200 cm −1 to 3800 cm −1 . The resulting Hamiltonian matrices are small for the 9D quantum problem considered, ≈ 10 000 for J = 0 and 13 500 for J = 1 calculations, allowing for direct diagonalization. The 9D calculations permit exploring a number of features of the rovibrational level structure of H 2 O–CO and D 2 O–CO that are beyond the quantum 5D rigid-monomer treatments reported to date. These include the differences in the magnitudes of the hydrogen-exchange tunneling splittings computed in 9D and 5D, the sensitivity of the tunneling splittings to the intramolecular vibrational excitation, the frequency shifts of the intramolecular vibrational modes, which, depending on the mode, can be either blue- or redshifts, and the effects of the excitation of the intramolecular fundamentals on the low-lying intermolecular eigenstates. Also examined is the extent of the eigenstate delocalization over the two minima on the PES. Whenever possible, a comparison is made with the experimental data in the literature.},

With the analytic gradient, the geometry optimizations are performed, which naturally include the nuclear quantum effects and describe the geometric isotope effects. The full-quantum cNEO-DFT is tested on a series of small molecules and the transition states of two hydrogen transfer reactions. The results are compared with those from conventional DFT, DFT-VPT2, and NEO-DFT with only key protons treated quantum mechanically. It is found that the nuclear quantum effects have notable impacts on molecular equilibrium geometries and transition state geometries.

We find that good quality linear regression resulting in good energy–volume dependence is possible over density-dependent variables suggested in previous literature studies. This is achieved with weighted fitting based on the KED histogram. With Gaussian process regressions, excellent KED fit quality well exceeding that of linear regressions is obtained as well as a good energy–volume dependence, which was somewhat better than that of best linear regressions. We find that while the use of the effective potential as a descriptor improves linear KED fitting, it does not improve the quality of the energy–volume dependence with linear regressions but substantially improves it with Gaussian process regression. Gaussian process regression is also able to perform well without data weighting.},

The isotropic part of b αβ is even under the fundamental symmetry operations of charge conjugation C , parity P , and time reversal T and does not vanish for all matter and antimatter.

In the presence of optical fields, represented for simplicity by a monochromatic plane wave of frequency ω , dynamic anapole magnetizabilities and various anapole polarizabilities are taken into account. Assuming, within the electric quadrupole approximation for the impinging wave, that the electric field at the origin of the coordinate system is E ( 0 ), with uniform gradient ∇ E , and magnetic field is B , the anapolar response is interpreted by second-rank a αβ ( ω ), a α β ′ ( ω ), f αβ ( ω ), f α β ′ ( ω ) and third-rank g α , βγ ( ω ), g α , β γ ′ ( ω ) frequency-dependent tensors.

  abstract = {Nanoporous materials are promising as the next generation of absorbents for gas storage and separation with ultrahigh capacity and selectivity. The recent advent of data-driven approaches in materials modeling provides alternative routes to tailor nanoporous materials for customized applications. Typically, a data-driven model requires a large amount of training data that cannot be generated solely by experimental methods or molecular simulations. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of classical density functional theory with a graphic processing unit (GPU) for the fast yet accurate prediction of gas adsorption isotherms in nanoporous materials. In comparison to serial computing with the central processing unit, the massively parallelized GPU implementation reduces the computational cost by more than two orders of magnitude. The proposed algorithm renders new opportunities not only for the efficient screening of a large materials database for gas adsorption but it may also serve as an important stepping stone toward the inverse design of nanoporous materials tailored to desired applications.},

  abstract = {Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, with versatile experimentally accessible exciton species, offer an interesting platform for investigating the interaction between excitons and a Fermi sea of charges. Using hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated monolayer MoSe 2 , we study the impact of charge density tuning on the A and B series of exciton Rydberg states, including A:1s, A:2s, B:1s, and B:2s. The doping dependence of the A:2s state provides an opportunity to examine such interactions with greatly reduced exciton binding energy and more spatially diffuse structures, and we found that the impact of the Fermi sea becomes much more dramatic compared to the A:1s state. Using photoluminescence upconversion, we verify that the B:2s exciton state displays similar behavior when interacting with the Fermi sea despite being well above the bare bandgap in energy. Photoluminescence and reflection spectra of the A:1s state show clear evidence that the interaction of the exciton with a Fermi sea is best described by the exciton–polaron model, rather than a trion model. Our experimental results demonstrate that overall features of charge interaction are quite generic and highly robust, offering key insights into the dressed many body states in a Fermi sea.},

  abstract = {Dyson orbitals, their electron-binding energies, and probability factors provide descriptions of electrons in molecules that are experimentally verifiable and that generalize qualitatively useful concepts of uncorrelated, molecular-orbital theory to the exact limit of Schrödinger’s time-independent equation. Dyson orbitals are defined as overlaps between initial, N-electron states and final states with N ± 1 electrons and therefore are useful in the prediction and interpretation of many kinds of spectroscopic and scattering experiments. They also are characteristic of N-electron initial states and may be used to construct electron densities, one-electron properties, and total energies with correlated Aufbau procedures that include probability factors between zero and unity. Relationships with natural orbitals, Kohn–Sham orbitals, and Hartree–Fock orbitals facilitate insights into the descriptive capabilities of Dyson orbitals. Electron-propagator approximations that employ the Dyson quasiparticle equation or super-operator secular equations enable direct determination of Dyson orbitals and obviate the need for many-electron wavefunctions of initial or final states. Numerical comparisons of the amplitudes and probability factors of Dyson orbitals calculated with several self-energy approximations reveal the effects of electron correlation on these uniquely defined, one-electron wavefunctions.},

  abstract = {This is our current research perspective on models providing insight into statistical mechanics. It is necessarily personal, emphasizing our own interest in simulation as it developed from the National Laboratories’ work to the worldwide explosion of computation of today. We contrast the past and present in atomistic simulations, emphasizing those simple models that best achieve reproducibility and promote understanding. Few-body models with pair forces have led to today’s “realistic” simulations with billions of atoms and molecules. Rapid advances in computer technology have led to change. Theoretical formalisms have largely been replaced by simulations incorporating ingenious algorithm development. We choose to study particularly simple, yet relevant, models directed toward understanding general principles. Simplicity remains a worthy goal, as does relevance. We discuss hard-particle virial series, melting, thermostatted oscillators with and without heat conduction, chaotic dynamics, fractals, the connection of Lyapunov spectra to thermodynamics, and finally simple linear maps. Along the way, we mention directions in which additional modeling could provide more clarity and yet more interesting developments in the future.},

  abstract = {The phase behavior of complex fluids is a challenging problem for molecular simulations. Supervised machine learning (ML) methods have shown potential for identifying the phase boundaries of lattice models. In this work, we extend these ML methods to continuous-space systems. We propose a convolutional neural network model that utilizes grid-interpolated coordinates of molecules as input data of ML and optimizes the search for phase transitions with different filter sizes. We test the method for the phase diagram of two off-lattice models, namely, the Widom–Rowlinson model and a symmetric freely jointed polymer blend, for which results are available from standard molecular simulations techniques. The ML results show good agreement with results of previous simulation studies with the added advantage that there is no critical slowing down. We find that understanding intermediate structures near a phase transition and including them in the training set is important to obtain the phase boundary near the critical point. The method is quite general and easy to implement and could find wide application to study the phase behavior of complex fluids.},

We find that universal scaling exponents of the bulk system also apply in the confined case; however, certain important differences arise. First, due to confinement effects, the static and threading properties of the rings depend on their radial position within the confining sphere. Second, the rings’ dynamics is overall subdiffusive, but anisotropic along the directions parallel and perpendicular to the sphere’s radius. The radial center of mass displacements of the rings are in general much smaller than the angular ones, which is caused by the confinement-induced inhomogeneous radial distribution of the whole rings within the sphere. Finally, we find enhanced contact times between rings as compared to the bulk, which indicates slow and predominantly coordinated pathways of the relaxation of the system.},

However, most of these models rely on a simple pairwise interaction, which is usually a valid approximation only in the limit of small deformations, i.e., low densities. In this work, we consider a many-body yet simple model for the evaluation of the elastic energy associated with the deformation of a spherical shell. The resulting energy evaluation, however, is relatively expensive for direct use in simulations. We significantly reduce the associated numerical cost by fitting the potential using a set of symmetry functions. We propose a method for selecting a suitable set of symmetry functions that capture the most relevant features of the particle’s environment in a systematic manner. The fitted interaction potential is then used in Monte Carlo simulations to draw the phase diagram of the system in two dimensions. The system is found to form both a fluid and a hexagonal crystal phase.},

  abstract = {Understanding the conformation of a polyelectrolyte (PE) is not only a fundamental challenge in polymer science but also critical for understanding the folding and aggregation of proteins. Here, we develop a theory by systematically including the electrostatic interactions into the self-consistent field theory for polymers to study the conformational behaviors of a single PE in poor solvents. As the backbone charge fraction of the PE increases, our theory predicts that the spherical globule (Sph) can either be elongated to a series of pearl-necklace (PN) structures or be flattened to two novel structures that have not been reported before: biconcave red cell and toroid. While the PN structures are stable conformations, the two fattened structures are metastable. We find that the cylindrical globule, the stability of which is under debate, is an unstable structure. The signature of the PN structures obtained by our calculation is less pronounced than that reported by other theoretical works due to the continuous change in the curvature from the pearl to the necklace, which, however, is in good agreement with the results from molecular simulations and neutron scattering experiments. In addition, our theory reveals different characteristics of the globule to PN transition: the transition from the Sph to the PN with double pearls is discontinuous, whereas those from adjacent PN structures are continuous at finite salt concentrations. Furthermore, we observe different scaling behaviors: the string width is not a constant as a thermal blob but decays as the backbone charge fraction increases.},

Starting from the original Hamiltonian of the adsorbate–surface system, the HEM representation is constructed via iterative orthogonal transformations, which are efficiently implemented with Householder matrices. The detailed description of the HEM representation and its construction are given in the second quantization representation. The hierarchical nature of this representation allows access to the exact quantum dynamics of the adsorbate–surface system over finite time intervals, controllable via the truncation order of the hierarchy. To study the convergence properties of the effective mode representation, we solve the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the truncated system–bath HEM Hamiltonian, with the help of the multilayer extension of the Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method. The results of the HEM representation are compared with those obtained with a quantum-mechanical tier-model. The convergence of the HEM representation with respect to the truncation order of the hierarchy is discussed for different initial conditions of the adsorbate–surface system. The combination of the HEM representation with the ML-MCTDH method provides information on the time evolution of the system (adsorbate) and multiple effective modes of the bath (surface). This permits insight into mechanisms of vibration–phonon coupling of the adsorbate–surface system, as well as inter-mode couplings of the effective bath.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the adsorption and thermal reaction processes of NO with silicene spontaneously formed on the ZrB 2 /Si(111) substrate using synchrotron radiation x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density-functional theory calculations. NO is dissociatively adsorbed on the silicene surface at 300 K. An atomic nitrogen is bonded to three Si atoms most probably by a substitutional adsorption with a Si atom of silicene (N≡Si 3 ). An atomic oxygen is inserted between two Si atoms of the silicene (Si—O—Si). With increasing NO exposure, the two-dimensional honeycomb silicene structure gets destroyed, judging from the decay of typical Si 2 p spectra for silicene. After a large amount of NO exposure, the oxidation state of Si becomes Si 4+ predominantly, and the intensity of the XPS peaks of the ZrB 2 substrate decreases, indicating that complicated silicon oxinitride species have developed three-dimensionally. By heating above 900 K, the oxide species start to desorb from the surface, but nitrogen-bonded species still exist. After flashing at 1053 K, no oxygen species is observed on the surface; SiN species are temporally formed as a metastable species and BN species also start to develop. In addition, the silicene structure is restored on the ZrB 2 /Si(111) substrate. After prolonged heating at 1053 K, most of nitrogen atoms are bonded to B atoms to form a BN layer at the topmost surface. Thus, BN-covered silicene is formed on the ZrB 2 /Si(111) substrate by the adsorption of NO at 300 K and prolonged heating at 1053 K.},

  abstract = {Upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) composed of NaYF 4 and doped with photoactive Yb 3+ and Er 3+ (NaYF 4 :Yb/Er) are highly desirable for many biological applications, but obtaining stable dispersions of UCNPs is challenging. Traditional synthetic methods often use complicated synthetic steps, produce toxic side products, and require post modifications to make UCNPs more dispersible in aqueous solutions. In this study, we demonstrate that laser ablation in liquid (LAL) is a novel approach to synthesize water-dispersible and -stable UCNPs with advantages of particle-size tuning, in situ coating of UCNPs with capping agents, no use of toxic or high boiling point solvents, and short reaction times. NaYF 4 :Yb/Er UCNPs were produced through LAL of annealed targets using water as the liquid, and their compositions and properties were investigated at a laser fluence of 0.57 J cm −2 –6.22 J cm −2 by direct capping with citric acid and ethylene glycol and by comparing with the UCNPs prepared from the traditional hydrothermal method. Low laser fluences produced polydisperse particles consisting of no photoactive species through a thermal evaporation mechanism, while high laser fluences generated UCNPs with more uniform morphologies and compositions similar to the target material by an explosive ejection mechanism. The inclusion of capping agents during LAL allowed for direct coating of the UCNP surface without the need of post modifications, and the concentrations of capping agents affected the UCNP photoluminescence lifetimes. As compared to the hydrothermal method, the LAL-prepared samples showed better size control and no degradation of the capping agents.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of the autoxidation reaction of tartaric acid in an air-saturated solution in the presence of Fe(II) show autocatalytic behavior with distinct initiation, propagation, and termination phases. The initiation phase, which involves activation of dissolved oxygen, decreases with increasing pH, over the test range of pH of 2.5–4.5, indicating that activation of oxygen is catalyzed by an Fe(II)–tartrate complex. The autocatalytic nature of this reaction indicates the presence of a catalytic intermediate that is produced during the initiation phase and regenerated during the propagation phase. The addition of catalase, as well as direct measurements, provided evidence of the presence and kinetic action of hydrogen peroxide as one of the intermediates. Direct addition of hydrogen peroxide resulted in shortening of the initiation stage and the propagation phase with similar rates as in the autoxidation reaction at low pH. The propagation is approximately a zero order reaction with respect to oxygen and iron. The kinetic analysis suggests that an intermediate catalytic complex(s) involving a ferryl ion (FeO 2+ ) controls the rate of the propagation reaction. The Fe(III) formation shows autocatalytic behavior that mirrors the dissolved oxygen consumption patterns under all pH conditions studied. At pH values of 2.5 and 3.0, Fe(III) accumulated to a maximum, before it was partially consumed. This maximum coincided with the depletion of dissolved oxygen. The consumption of Fe(III), or the reduction of Fe(III) back to Fe(II), reflects the catalytic nature of Fe(II) and the essential role of tartaric acid in the initiation phase of Fenton’s original reaction.},

  abstract = {In the five-decade search for efficient photocatalysts to convert natural sunlight into hydrogen via photoelectrochemical (PEC) dissociation of water, the underlying physics and chemistry of PEC processes taking place at metal-oxide photocatalysts remains relatively poorly understood and is an active area of research by both theorists and experimentalists. This is surely the case for water structuring at metal-oxide surfaces, including their “self-ordering.” In this work, we apply classical molecular-dynamics techniques to investigate and classify the structure and ordering of water layers at two TiO 2 surfaces—anatase ⟨101⟩ and rutile ⟨110⟩. We are interested in identifying and classifying layers using local order parameters to distinguish the layered-water superstructure from bulk-like water configurations as observed in liquid water and common ice polymorphs. In particular, we look for the formation of regions with reduced molecular mobility and assess whether they are “ice-like,” as has been proposed in recent interpretations in the literature, or, instead, how these interfacial-water structures might be otherwise described. We leverage quantitative and order-parameter analysis techniques to categorize the structural properties of layers of water molecules formed and compare them to both cubic and hexagonal polytypes of bulk ice I, as well as bulk liquid water. In doing so, we propose a general structural recognition/classification framework suitable for identifying and describing molecules at any condensed-state-water interface.},

Up to now, unexploited iodine EXAFS reveals to be extremely informative and confirms the progressive formation of iodine–iodine short bonds close to 2.85 Å. A coordination number increase of Sn in the crystalline phase-II region appears to be excluded, while the deformation of the tetrahedral units proceeds through a flattening that keeps the average I–Sn–I angle close to 109.5°.

Our simulations provide substantial reaction probabilities and sharply increasing cross sections with an increase in collision energy for this early- and negative-barrier reaction.

The complex is dynamically quenched by di- n -heptyl-viologen, C 7 C 7 V 2+ , in solution and when the acceptor is embedded into negatively charged and neutral micelles. Addition of NaCl to solutions containing C 7 C 7 V 2+ bound to negatively charged dodecyl sulfate sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles results in a monotonic increase in the quenching rate constant from k q = 6.0 × 10 7 to 1.7 × 10 9 M −1 s −1 . In contrast, k q was independent of [NaCl] and diffusion limited in water and neutral micellar solution. Activated rate constants, k act , revealed that electron transfer was slowed by a factor of 450 when occurring in negatively charged micelle solution relative to neutral octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8) micelles. In the 3* [Ru III (phen) 2 (bps •− )] 0 excited state, the bps ligand is oriented away from the anionic micelle surface potential, −141 ≤ ψ ≤ −67 mV, due to a Frumkin effect operative in the deceleration of k act . Frumkin corrected rate constants were within a factor of three of those measured in C12E8 solution. Distance-dependent reorganization energies resulting from the orientation vary from 0.47 eV to 0.35 eV, while electronic coupling decreases by a factor of 10. The collective data show that orientation control over bimolecular rate constants in micellar solution can be achieved by screening micellar surface charges.},

De-excitation of D 2 shows a strong dependence on the spin–orbit excitation of NO. We observe translation-to-rotation energy transfer as well as direct rotation-to-rotation energy transfer at the lowest collision energy probed. The experimental results are in good agreement with cross sections obtained from quantum coupled-channels calculations based on recent NO–D 2 potential energy surfaces.

Previously, restricted active space-spin flip (RAS-SF) methods have been applied to describe multi-exciton states, but these have not yet been shown to be useful for charge-transfer states. Herein, a variant of RAS-SF is introduced to treat charge-transfer states and electronic couplings. This approach relies on partitioning of the full RAS-SF Hamiltonian into charge-transfer and non-charge-transfer blocks, allowing the different types of diabatic states to be resolved in a straightforward fashion. To demonstrate this approach in practice, model dimer systems, intramolecular charge-transfer dyads, and an intramolecular singlet fission system were examined. Being low-cost and relatively accurate, RAS-SF provides important insight into electron transfer pathways in conventional donor–acceptor systems, as well as characterizations of charge transfer mechanisms involving strongly correlated multi-exciton states. Studies of electron transfer from an intramolecular singlet fission chromophore to an anthraquinone acceptor demonstrate the unique capabilities of the proposed RAS-SF method.},

  abstract = {Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives are widely used materials for luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) applications due to their attractive optical and electronic properties. In this work, we study aggregation-induced exciton quenching pathways in four PDI derivatives with increasing steric bulk, which were previously synthesized. We combine molecular dynamics and quantum chemical methods to simulate the aggregation behavior of chromophores at low concentration and compute their excited state properties. We found that PDIs with small steric bulk are prone to aggregate in a solid state matrix, while those with large steric volume displayed greater tendencies to isolate themselves. We find that for the aggregation class of PDI dimers, the optically accessible excitations are in close energetic proximity to triplet charge transfer (CT) states, thus facilitating inter-system crossing and reducing overall LSC performance. While direct singlet fission pathways appear endothermic, evidence is found for the facilitation of a singlet fission pathway via intermediate CT states. Conversely, the insulation class of PDI does not suffer from aggregation-induced photoluminescence quenching at the concentrations studied here and therefore display high photon output. These findings should aid in the choice of PDI derivatives for various solar applications and suggest further avenues for functionalization and study.},

Density fitting coefficients from the robust method are compared to coefficients from a variational method applied to wave function orbital products in bulk Ne. Four center Coulomb matrix elements from density fitting are applied to time dependent (TDHF) calculations in diamond, magnesium oxide, and anatase and rutile polytypes of titanium dioxide. Shifting virtual states downwards uniformly relative to occupied states and scaling the electron–hole attraction term in the TDHF Hamiltonian by 0.4 yields good agreement with either experiment or Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations.

  abstract = {We continue our work on the long-range corrected double-hybrid density functionals (LC-DHDFs) ω B2PLYP and ω B2GP-PLYP that we developed in the context of time-dependent (TD) Density Functional Theory (DFT) to enable the robust description of singlet–singlet excitations [M. Casanova-Páez, M. B. Dardis, and L. Goerigk, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15 , 4735 (2019)]. In our initial study, we only assessed the impact of a LC on BLYP-based DHDFs, and herein, we extend our understanding by providing the first test of PBE-based LC-DHDFs within the established TD-DHDF scheme. Moreover, this study is one of few that provides a direct comparison between TD-DHDFs and their faster Tamm–Dancoff-approximation variants (TDA-DHDFs). Most importantly, this is the first TDA-DHDF study since Grimme and Neese’s TDA-B2PLYP [J. Chem. Phys. 127 , 154116 (2007)] and the first work on TD-DHDFs that addresses singlet–triplet excitations. We show how the difference between TD-DHDFs and TDA-DHDFs is often negligible for singlet–singlet excitations, but how one has to apply TDA-DHDFs for triplet excitations. For both excitation types, the LC is beneficial to the BLYP-based DHDFs, but detrimental to the PBE-based ones. For local-valence and Rydberg excitations, ω B2PLYP and ω B2GP-PLYP as well as the global DHDF PBE-QIDH can be recommended. If a transition exhibits charge-transfer character, ω B2PLYP and ω B2GP-PLYP should be applied. An analysis of the gaps between the first singlet and triplet excited states of our systems revealed that there is room for further improvements to reach better robustness. Until that goal has been achieved, we recommend ω B2PLYP and ω B2GP-PLYP as some of the currently best TDA-DFT methods.},

  abstract = {We present a new iterative scheme for potential energy surface (PES) construction, which relies on both physical information and information obtained through statistical analysis. The adaptive density guided approach (ADGA) is combined with a machine learning technique, namely, the Gaussian process regression (GPR), in order to obtain the iterative GPR–ADGA for PES construction. The ADGA provides an average density of vibrational states as a physically motivated importance-weighting and an algorithm for choosing points for electronic structure computations employing this information. The GPR provides an approximation to the full PES given a set of data points, while the statistical variance associated with the GPR predictions is used to select the most important among the points suggested by the ADGA. The combination of these two methods, resulting in the GPR–ADGA, can thereby iteratively determine the PES. Our implementation, additionally, allows for incorporating derivative information in the GPR. The iterative process commences from an initial Hessian and does not require any presampling of configurations prior to the PES construction. We assess the performance on the basis of a test set of nine small molecules and fundamental frequencies computed at the full vibrational configuration interaction level. The GPR–ADGA, with appropriate settings, is shown to provide fundamental excitation frequencies of an root mean square deviation (RMSD) below 2 cm −1 , when compared to those obtained based on a PES constructed with the standard ADGA. This can be achieved with substantial savings of 65\%–90\% in the number of single point calculations.},

Our previous inclusion of geometry dependent charge flux into the atomic multipole-based polarizable AMOEBA+ force field has shown significant improvement of water properties from gaseous to condensed phases [C. Liu et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 (2), 419–426 (2020)]. In this work, the parameterization of the CF model for a broad range of organic and biomolecular fragments is presented. Atom types are automatically assigned by matching the predefined SMARTS patterns. Comparing to the current AMOEBA+ model without the CF component, it is shown that the AMOEBA+ (CF) model improves the description of molecular dipole moments for the molecules we studied over both equilibrium and distorted geometries. For the equilibrium-geometry structures, AMOEBA+ (CF) reduces the mean square error (MSE) from 6.806 × 10 −1 (without CF) to 4.249 × 10 −4 D 2 . For non-equilibrium structures, the MSE is reduced from 5.766 × 10 −1 (without CF) to 2.237 × 10 −3 D 2 . Finally, the transferability of the CF model and parameters were validated on two sets of molecules: one includes molecules in the training set but with different geometries, and the other one involves new molecules outside of the training set. A similar improvement on dipole surfaces was obtained on the validation sets. The CF algorithms and parameters derived in this work are general and can be implemented into any existing molecular mechanical force fields.},

For comparison, the trajectory was analyzed using popular bonding criteria commonly used in analysis of reactive MD simulations, including distance, distance–time, and bond-order criteria.

  abstract = {We present a new force field, AMBER ff15ipq-m, for simulations of protein mimetics in applications from therapeutics to biomaterials. This force field is an expansion of the AMBER ff15ipq force field that was developed for canonical proteins and enables the modeling of four classes of artificial backbone units that are commonly used alongside natural α residues in blended or “heterogeneous” backbones: chirality-reversed D -α-residues, the C α -methylated α-residue Aib, homologated β-residues (β 3 ) bearing proteinogenic side chains, and two cyclic β residues (β cyc ; APC and ACPC). The ff15ipq-m force field includes 472 unique atomic charges and 148 unique torsion terms. Consistent with the AMBER IPolQ lineage of force fields, the charges were derived using the Implicitly Polarized Charge (IPolQ) scheme in the presence of explicit solvent. To our knowledge, no general force field reported to date models the combination of artificial building blocks examined here. In addition, we have derived Karplus coefficients for the calculation of backbone amide J -coupling constants for β 3 Ala and ACPC β residues. The AMBER ff15ipq-m force field reproduces experimentally observed J -coupling constants in simple tetrapeptides and maintains the expected conformational propensities in reported structures of proteins/peptides containing the artificial building blocks of interest—all on the μ s timescale. These encouraging results demonstrate the power and robustness of the IPolQ lineage of force fields in modeling the structure and dynamics of natural proteins as well as mimetics with protein-inspired artificial backbones in atomic detail.},

Using single-particle nonlinear optical measurements, we compare PL signals resulting from both the plasmon-resonant and non-resonant excitations. In both cases, spectrally broad interband PL emission was observed. However, we also show that resonant excitation of the longitudinal plasmon mode leads to an increased photonic density of states at energies corresponding to the transverse plasmon resonance. This increased density of states is achieved by a multi-step mechanism, which is initiated by three-photon excitation and followed by an Auger relaxation process. Importantly, the results show that nonlinear excitation can lead to energy and polarization modulation of nanoparticle optical signals that are not observed using linear excitation. This work also demonstrates the effectiveness of single-nanoparticle PL studies for understanding how plasmon-resonant excitations can be used to modify hot carrier distributions.},

Using coupled cluster data in the completed basis set limit as a reference, we examine the accuracy of the polarizable models in reproducing individual many-body contributions to interaction energies and harmonic frequencies of water clusters and compare their performance with that of MB-pol, an explicit many-body model that has been shown to correctly predict the properties of water across the entire phase diagram. Based on these comparisons, we use MB-pol as a reference to analyze the ability of the polarizable models to reproduce the energy landscape of liquid water under ambient conditions. We find that, while correctly reproducing the energetics of minimum-energy structures, the polarizable models examined in this study suffer from inadequate representations of many-body effects for distorted configurations. To investigate the role played by geometry-dependent representations of 1-body charge distributions in reproducing coupled cluster data for both interaction and many-body energies, we introduce a simplified version of MB-pol that adopts fixed atomic charges and demonstrate that the new model retains the same accuracy as the original MB-pol model. Based on the analyses presented in this study, we believe that future developments of both polarizable and explicit many-body models should continue in parallel and would benefit from synergistic efforts aimed at integrating the best aspects of the two theoretical/computational frameworks.},

We demonstrate that this highly tunable approach results in arbitrarily small long-range density fluctuations in the liquid state. Our simulations also indicate that long-ranged density fluctuation of the whole polymeric material is remarkably insensitive to molecular topology (linear chain, unknotted ring, star, and bottlebrush) and depends on temperature in an apparently near universal fashion. Our findings open the way for the creation of nearly perfect hyperuniform polymeric materials.},

We find that the dried supraparticle morphologies are homogeneous when HI are included but are stratified in core–shell structures (with the short polymers forming the shell) when HI are neglected. The simulation methodology unambiguously attributes this difference to the treatment of the solvent in the two models. We rationalize the presence (or absence) of stratification by measuring phenomenological multicomponent diffusion coefficients for the polymer mixtures. The diffusion coefficients show the importance of not only solvent backflow but also HI between polymers in controlling the dried supraparticle morphology.},

  abstract = {Chirality detection of gas-phase molecules at low concentrations is challenging as the molecular number density is usually too low to perform conventional circular dichroism absorption experiments. In recent years, new spectroscopic methods have been developed to detect chirality in the gas phase. In particular, the angular distribution of photoelectrons after multiphoton laser ionization of chiral molecules using circularly polarized light is highly sensitive to the enantiomeric form of the ionized molecule [multiphoton photoelectron circular dichroism (MP-PECD)]. In this paper, we employ the MP-PECD as an analytic tool for chirality detection of the bicyclic monoterpene fenchone desorbing from a Ag(111) crystal. We record velocity-resolved kinetics of fenchone desorption on Ag(111) using pulsed molecular beams with ion imaging techniques. In addition, we measure temperature-programmed desorption spectra of the same system. Both experiments indicate weak physisorption of fenchone on Ag(111). We combine both experimental techniques with enantiomer-specific detection by recording MP-PECD of desorbing molecules using photoelectron imaging spectroscopy. We can clearly assign the enantiomeric form of the desorption product fenchone in sub-monolayer concentration. The experiment demonstrates the combination of MP-PECD with surface science experiments, paving the way for enantiomer-specific detection of surface reaction products on heterogeneous catalysts for asymmetric synthesis.},

The dynamic and nano-scale process of H 2 diffusion into binary structure II hydrates, where the large cages are occupied by larger molecules, was studied using molecular dynamics simulation. As the H 2 molecules diffused from one cage to another, two types of diffusion processes were observed: (i) when moving between a pair of large cages, the H 2 molecules pass through the central part of the hexagonal rings; (ii) however, when the H 2 molecules move from a large cage to a small one, it requires one of the pentagonal rings to partially break, as this allows the H 2 molecule to pass through the widened space. While the diffusion of H 2 molecules between large cages was found to occur more frequently, the presence of SF 6 molecules in the large cages was found to inhibit diffusion. Therefore, in order to attain higher H 2 storage capacities in binary hydrates, it is suggested that there is an optimal number of large cages that should be occupied by SF 6 molecules.},

Therefore, both the electron transfer and hole transfer channels could occur at the donor/acceptor interface for generating free charge carriers in NFA based OSCs. However, in many molecular and DNA systems, recent studies revealed that the high charge transfer (CT) efficiency cannot be reasonably explained by a CT model with only highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of donor and acceptor molecules. In this work, taking an example of a full-polymer blend consisting of benzodithiophene-alt-benzotriazole copolymers (J51) as donor and naphthalene diimide-bithiophene (N2200) as acceptor, in which the ultrafast hole transfer has been recently reported, we investigate its CT process and examine the different roles of various frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Through a joint study of quantum mechanics electronic structure calculation and nonadiabatic dynamics simulation, we find that the hole transfer between HOMOs of J51 and N2200 can hardly happen, but the hole transfer from HOMO of N2200 to HOMO − 1 of J51 is much more efficient. This points out the underlying importance of the deep hole channel in the CT process and indicates that including FMOs other than HOMOs and LUMOs is highly necessary to build a robust physical model for studying the CT process in molecular optoelectronic materials.},

  abstract = {Water molecules adsorbed on noble metal surfaces are of fundamental interest in surface science, in heterogeneous catalysis, and as a model for the metal/water interface. Herein, we analyze 28 water structures adsorbed on five noble metal surfaces (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt) via density functional theory and energy decomposition analysis based on the block localized wave function technique. Structures, ranging from monomers to ice adlayers, reveal that the charge transfer from water to the surface is nearly independent from the charge transfer between the water molecules, while the polarization energies are cooperative. Dense water–water networks with small surface dipoles, such as the 39 × 39 unit cell [experimentally observed on Pt(111)], are favored compared to the highly ordered and popular H up and H down phases. The second main result of our study is that the many-body interactions, which stabilize the water assemblies on the metal surfaces, are dominated by the polarization energies, with the charge transfer scaling with the polarization energies. Hence, if an empirical model could be found that reproduces the polarization energies, the charge transfer could be predicted as well, opening exciting perspectives for force field development.},

AuCu bimetallic alloys are currently receiving attention for their potential to tailor catalytic activity. Here, we synthesized a dilute AuCu alloy nanostructure with an AuCu atomic composition ratio of 3\% by using a simple electrochemical treatment method on a 200 nm-thick Au thin film. The dilute AuCu alloy catalyst shows an exceptional CO 2 reduction activity in terms of selectivity and overpotential for CO production. In addition, the stability property is more significantly enhanced as compared to pure Au nanostructures. In addition, we describe an in situ tailoring method of catalytic activity for Au nanostructures by repeating an electrochemical treatment process that is performed for forming the Au nanostructure. This approach will be a promising and facile strategy not only for reactive Au catalysts but also to increase the stability activity simultaneously by utilizing Cu impurities existing in an aqueous electrolyte for CO 2 reduction.},

  abstract = {Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ), a metal-free and visible light responsive photocatalyst, has garnered much attention due to its wide range of applications. In order to elucidate the role of dimensionality on the properties of photo-generated charge carriers, we apply nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional theory to investigate nonradiative relaxation of hot electrons and holes, and electron–hole recombination in monolayer and bulk g-C 3 N 4 . The nonradiative charge recombination occurs on a nanosecond timescale and is faster in bulk than the nanosheet, in agreement with the experiment. The difference arises due to the smaller energy gap and participation of additional vibrations in the bulk system. The long carrier lifetimes are favored by small NA coupling and rapid phonon-induced loss of quantum coherence between the excited and ground electronic states. Decoherence is fast because g-C 3 N 4 is soft and undergoes large scale vibrations. The NA coupling is small since electrons and holes are localized on different atoms, and the electron–hole overlap is relatively small. Phonon-driven relaxation of hot electrons and holes takes 100–200 fs and is slightly slower at higher initial energies due to participation of fewer vibrational modes. This feature of two-dimensional g-C 3 N 4 contrasts traditional three-dimensional semiconductors, which exhibit faster relaxation at higher energies due to larger density of states, and can be used to extract hot carriers to perform useful functions. The ab initio quantum dynamics simulations present a comprehensive picture of the photo-induced charge carrier dynamics in g-C 3 N 4 , guiding design of photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.},

This enables us to generate nonequilibrium steady-states of the LDL and HDL polymorphs that remain stabilized in their liquid forms for as long as the shear is applied. This is unlike the LDL and HDL forms at rest, which are metastable under those conditions and, when at rest, rapidly undergo a transition toward the crystal, i.e., the thermodynamically stable equilibrium phase. In particular, through a detailed analysis of the structural and energetic features of the liquids under shear, we identify the range of densities, as well as the range of shear rates, which give rise to the two forms. We also show how the competition between shear and tetrahedral order impacts the two-body entropy in steady-states of Si under shear. These results open the door to new ways of utilizing shear to stabilize forms that are metastable at rest and can exhibit unique properties, since, for instance, experiments on Si have shown that HDL is metallic with no bandgap, while LDL is semimetallic with a pseudogap.},

The experimental results were complemented by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and phonon calculations. Observation of three hydrogen vibrons in As 4 O 6 ·2H 2 is reported in the entire temperature and pressure range studied (up to 24 GPa). While the experiments performed with protium and deuterium at variable temperatures allowed for the assignment of two vibrons as Q 1 (1) and Q 1 (0) transitions of ortho and para spin isomers of hydrogen trapped in the inclusion compound, the origin of the third vibron could not be unequivocally established. Low-temperature spectra revealed that the lowest-frequency vibron is actually composed of two overlapping bands of A g and T 2g symmetries dominated by H 2 stretching modes as predicted by our previous density functional theory calculations. We observed low-frequency modes of As 4 O 6 ·2H 2 vibrations dominated by H 2 “librations,” which were missed in a previous study. A low-temperature fine structure was observed for the J = 0 → 2 and J = 1 → 3 manifolds of hydrogen trapped in As 4 O 6 ·2H 2 , indicating the lifting of degeneracy due to an anisotropic environment. A non-spherical distribution was captured by molecular dynamics simulations, which revealed that the trajectory of H 2 molecules is skewed along the crystallographic ⟨111⟩ direction.

This model can account for the dissociation cascades and provides values for the dissociation energies. These values, of the order of 0.7 eV–1 eV, are in excellent agreement with those previously derived from thermal evaporation. They confirm the charge resonance stability enhancement predicted by theoretical calculations. In addition, remarkable agreement is obtained with theoretical predictions for the two smaller sizes n = 2 and 3. For the larger sizes, the agreement remains good, although the theoretical values obtained for the most stable structures are systematically higher by 0.2 eV. This offset could be attributed to approximations in the calculations. Still, there is an indication in the results of an incomplete description of the role of isomerization and/or direct dissociation upon collisions. Finally, by-product clusters containing dehydrogenated species are found to dissociate at energies comparable to the non-dehydrogenated ones, which shows no evidence for covalent bonds within the clusters.},

  abstract = {Energy transfer between vibrational modes can be quite facile, and it has been proposed as the dominant mechanism for energy pooling in extreme environments such as nonthermal plasmas and laser cavities. To understand such processes, we perform quasi-classical trajectory studies of CO( v ) + CO( v ) collisions on a new full-dimensional potential energy surface fit to high-level ab initio data using a neural network method and examine the key vibrational energy transfer channels. In addition to the highly efficient CO( v + 1) + CO( v − 1) channel, there exists a significant, sometimes dominant, CO( v + 2) + CO( v − 2) channel for large v states at low collision energies. The latter is shown to stem from the substantially increased interaction between highly vibrationally excited CO, which has a much larger dipole moment than at its equilibrium bond length. Finally, the vibrational state-specific cross sections and their energy dependence on the thermal range are predicted from a limited dataset using Gaussian process regression. The relevance of these results to plasma chemistry and laser engineering and the recently observed flipping of highly vibrationally excited CO adsorbates on a cold NaCl surface is discussed.},

In this series, the ligand in the palladium photosensitizer was varied from bis-dipyrrinato to porphodimethenato and to a porphyrin. With the porphyrin photosensitizer, no charge separated state could be reached. This is caused by the direct relaxation of the excited photosensitizer to the ground state by intersystem crossing. The bis-dipyrrinato-palladium photosensitizer gave only a little yield (7\%) of the charge separated state, which is due to the population of a metal centered triplet state and a concomitant geometrical rearrangement to a disphenoidal coordination sphere. This state relaxes rapidly to the ground state. In contrast, in the porphodimethenato-palladium triads, a long lived ( μ s to ms) charge separated state could be generated in high quantum yields (66\%–74\%) because, here, the population of a triplet metal centered state is inhibited by geometrical constraints. The magnetic field dependent transient absorption measurement of one of the porphodimethenato triads revealed a giant magnetic field effect by a factor of 26 on the signal amplitude of the charge separated state. This is the consequence of a magnetic field dependent triplet–singlet interconversion that inhibits the fast decay of the charge separated triplet state through the singlet recombination channel. A systematic comparative analysis of the spin-dependent kinetics in terms of three classical and one fully quantum theoretical methods is provided, shedding light on the pros and cons of each of them.},

Dyson orbitals show that the first two electronic states of the cation arise by symmetry breaking of the doubly degenerate e g orbitals in cyclohexane as perturbed by the halogen or by perturbation of the halogen lone pair by the cyclohexane ring scaffold in the case of light and heavy halogen substituents, respectively. When the resulting two states (A″ and A′) are coupled via a conical intersection in C S symmetry, they are smoothly connected by molecular orbital rotation when the nuclear symmetry is relaxed. Even then, barriers at avoided crossings lead to distinct A′ and pseudo-A″ minima, which contribute to the TPES separately. As axial and equatorial conformers are present in commensurate abundance at room temperature, four transitions are conceivable for each substituent in the low-energy range. Three of these could be identified, and their energy could be determined for each sample. Transitions to A′ states are associated with a smaller geometry change and exhibit stronger origin transitions. Yet, most notably in X = Br, they do not correspond to the adiabatic ionization energy, which is indicated by a weak and broad band to the pseudo-A″ state with a lower onset energy. Franck–Condon vibrational analysis of the TPES coupled with quantum chemical calculations can provide insights into the behavior of conformers as well as strongly coupled electronic states.},

The mixed trihalides are asymmetric analogs of the well-studied I 3 − anion, with distinguishable dissociation asymptotes and the potential for selective bond breaking. The high beam energy PPC spectrometer used in this study couples an electrospray ionization source, a hexapole accumulation ion trap, and a linear accelerator to produce a 21 keV beam of a particular trihalide. Total, stable, and dissociative photoelectron spectra have been recorded for all the anions, except ICl 2 − that does not photodetach at 266 nm. A bound ground state ( X ) is observed for all the anions, and a dissociative first excited ( A ) state is also seen for I 2 Br − and I 2 Cl − at low electron kinetic energies (eKE). A 258 nm photoelectron spectrum recorded for I 2 Br − and I 2 Cl − rules out autodetachment of a dipole-bound state as the origin of the low eKE feature. The threshold detachment energy (TDE) of I 2 X − to the X state of the radical is similar to I 3 − , whereas the TDE to the radical A state increases with substitution of iodine for a lighter halogen. Two-body DPD is observed for I 2 Br − and I 2 Cl − , resulting in IBr/ICl + I + e − . For IBr 2 − and ICl 2 − , the charge symmetric three-body photodissociation of [Br–I–Br] − and [Cl–I–Cl] − is seen yielding Br + Br and Br + Br * , and Cl + Cl and Cl + Cl * neutral fragments. Evidence for the minimum energy anion structure is observed in all cases, where the iodine atom is located at the center of the trihalide.},

The electronic structure computations have been carried out at the explicitly correlated coupled cluster theory [CCSD(T)-F12] with an augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set and an additional bond function. Analytic five-dimensional intermolecular PESs for ν 2 (H 2 O) = 0 and 1 are obtained by fitting to the multi-dimensional Morse/long-range potential function form. These fits to 40 890 points have the root-mean-square (rms) discrepancy of 0.88 cm −1 for interaction energies less than 2000.0 cm −1 . The resulting vibrationally averaged PESs provide good representations of the experimental microwave and infrared data: for microwave transitions of H 2 O–N 2 , the rms discrepancy is only 0.0003 cm −1 , and for infrared transitions of the A 1 symmetry of the H 2 O( ν 2 = 1 ← 0)–N 2 , the rms discrepancy is 0.001 cm −1 . The calculated infrared band origin shifts associated with the ν 2 bending vibration of water are 2.210 cm −1 and 1.323 cm −1 for H 2 O–N 2 and D 2 O–N 2 , respectively, in good agreement with the experimental values of 2.254 cm −1 and 1.266 cm −1 .

Compared to the classical treatment, our results reveal important reductions in the free energy barriers and changes at a qualitative level in the overall profile. Most notable are those manifested by a plateau behavior, ascribed to nuclear tunneling, which bridges reactant and product states, contrasting with the usual symmetric double-well profile. The characteristics of the proton localizations along the pathway are examined. An imaginary time analysis of the rotational degrees of freedom of the partners in the dimer at the vicinities of transition states shows a clear “anticorrelation” between intermolecular interactions coupling beads localized in connective and dangling basins of attractions. As such, the transfer is operated by gradual concerted inter-basin migrations in opposite directions, at practically no energy costs. Modifications operated by partial deuteration and by the asymmetries in the hydrogen bonding characteristics prevailing in water–methanol heterodimers are also examined.},

Local curve fitting exposed groups of sharp vibrational peaks, which are assigned to Rydberg states. The vertical excitation profile of the VUV spectrum, reproduced by time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), gives a good interpretation of the principal regions of absorption. Fourth order Möller–Plessett perturbation theory, including single, double, and quadruple excitations, showed that the lowest singlet and triplet states retain C S symmetry. This contrasts with TDDFT where several low-lying excited states are planar. Detailed vibrational analysis of the first UV band was performed by Franck–Condon, Herzberg–Teller, and their combined methods. These show the dominance of mid-range frequencies, while the lowest frequency (75 cm −1 ) has negligible importance. In contrast, the second excited (Rydberg) state shows a major progression with separations of 115 (6) cm −1 . This is interpreted by re-analysis of the X 2 A′ ionic state at the anharmonic level. Extremely low exponent Gaussian functions enabled several low-lying Rydberg state energies to be determined theoretically; extrapolation of the 3 s -, 4 s -, and 5 s -Rydberg state calculated energies gives the adiabatic ionization energy as 7.837 eV (4) with δ 0.964 (2). Similarly, extrapolation of the centroids of the observed Rydberg states gave the vertical ionization energy (VIE) as VIE 1 = 8.675 ± 0.077, close to the photoelectron spectroscopy VIE value [8.55 (1) eV].},

Computational simulations play an important role in unraveling the effects of the interfacial structure of the electrolyte solution and the applied voltage on the energetics and kinetics. In such simulations, it is important to know the chemical potentials of the electrons in the cathode and the anode and the nonequilibrium response of the interface to the abrupt change in the charge distribution in the system. We have developed a classical fully polarizable molecular dynamics method to deal with the interfacial nonadiabatic ET processes in which both the metal electrodes and the solvent molecules are electronically polarizable. The chemical potential of the electrons in each electrode is introduced based on the chemical potential equalization principle, and their difference between the cathode and the anode is kept equal to the applied voltage. We have investigated the effects of the electronic polarization of the solvent molecules on the interfacial structure of the electrolyte solution and the Marcus free energy curves. The effects are non-negligible for the accurate evaluation of the reorganization energies but become less significant as the redox species comes closer to the electrode surface, where the electronic polarization of the metal electrode plays a more dominant role.},

  abstract = {In an infrequent metadynamics (iMetaD) simulation, a well-tempered metadynamics bias accumulates in the reactant basin, accelerating escapes to the product state. Like the earlier hyperdynamics strategy, iMetaD enables estimates of the unbiased escape rates. However, iMetaD applies the bias to visited locations in a collective variable (CV) space, not to the more specific visited locations in a full configuration space as done in hyperdynamics. This difference makes rate estimates from iMetaD sensitive to the choice of CVs, to parameters that control the bias deposition rate, and to the preparation of the initial state within the reactant basin. This paper uses an extremely simple discrete state model to illustrate complications that can arise in systems that exhibit fluxional transitions between sub-basins of the reactant state. Specifically, we show how the reactant-to-product escape time and relaxation times within the reactant basin(s) impose bounds on the admissible parameter choices for an iMetaD calculation. Predictions from the discrete state model are validated by iMetaD simulations on a corresponding two-dimensional potential energy surface.},

  abstract = {There is significant interest in improving the performance of batteries to increase electrification of transportation and aviation. Recently, performance improvements have been in large part due to changes in the composition of the cathode material family, LiNi x Mn y Co (1− x − y ) O 2 (e.g., 111–622–811). Despite the importance of these materials and tremendous progress with density functional theory (DFT) calculations in understanding basic design principles, it is computationally prohibitively expensive to make this problem tractable. Specifically, predicting the open circuit voltage for any cathode material in this family requires evaluation of stability in a quaternary phase space. In this work, we develop machine-learning potentials using fingerprinting based on atom-centered symmetry functions, used with a neural network model, trained on DFT calculations with a prediction accuracy of 3.7 meV/atom and 0.13 eV/Å for energy and force, respectively. We perform hyperparameter optimization of the fingerprinting parameters using Bayesian optimization through the Dragonfly package. Using this ML calculator, we first test its performance in predicting thermodynamic properties within the Debye–Grüneisen model and find good agreement for most thermodynamic properties, including the Gibbs free energy and entropy. Then, we use this to calculate the Li-vacancy ordering as a function of Li composition to simulate the process of discharging/charging of the cathode using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The predicted voltage profiles are in good agreement with the experimental ones and provide an approach to rapidly perform design optimization in this phase space. This study serves as a proof-point of machine-learned DFT surrogates to enable battery materials optimization.},

Despite the preparatory minimizations and simulations being ubiquitous and essential for stable production simulations, there are currently no general recommended procedures to perform them and very few criteria to decide whether the system is capable of producing a stable simulation trajectory.

Our objective is to employ matrix completion to reduce computational effort associated with the calculation of multiple quantum chemical Hessians, which are necessary for identification of temperature-dependent free energy maxima under canonical variational transition state theory (VTST). We demonstrate proof-of-principle of an algebraic variety-based matrix completion method for recovering missing elements in a matrix of transverse Hessian eigenvalues constituting the minimum energy path (MEP) of a reaction. The algorithm, named harmonic variety-based matrix completion (HVMC), utilizes the fact that the points lying on the MEP of a reaction step constitute an algebraic variety in the reaction path Hamiltonian representation. We demonstrate that, with as low as 30\% random sampling of matrix elements for the largest system in our test set (46 atoms), the complete matrix of eigenvalues can be recovered. We further establish algorithm performance for VTST rate calculations by quantifying errors in zero-point energies and vibrational free energies. Motivated by this success, we outline next steps toward developing a practical HVMC algorithm, which utilizes a gradient-based sampling protocol for low-cost VTST rate computations.},

  abstract = {Dispersion corrections are essential in the description of intermolecular interactions; however, dispersion-corrected functionals must also be transferrable to hard solids. The exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model has demonstrated excellent performance for non-covalent interactions. In this article, we examine its ability to describe the relative stability, geometry, and compressibility of simple ionic solids. For the specific cases of the cesium halides, XDM-corrected functionals correctly predict the energy ranking of the B1 and B2 forms, and a dispersion contribution is required to obtain this result. Furthermore, for the lattice constants of the 20 alkali halides, the performance of XDM-corrected functionals is excellent, provided that the base functional’s exchange enhancement factor properly captures non-bonded repulsion. The mean absolute errors in lattice constants obtained with B86bPBE-XDM and B86bPBE-25X-XDM are 0.060 Å and 0.039 Å, respectively, suggesting that delocalization error also plays a minor role in these systems. Finally, we considered the calculation of bulk moduli for alkali halides and alkaline-earth oxides. Previous claims in the literature that simple generalized gradient approximations, such as PBE, can reliably predict experimental bulk moduli have benefited from large error cancellations between neglecting both dispersion and vibrational effects. If vibrational effects are taken into account, dispersion-corrected functionals are quite accurate (4 GPa–5 GPa average error), again, if non-bonded repulsion is correctly represented. Careful comparisons of the calculated bulk moduli with experimental data are needed to avoid systematic biases and misleading conclusions.},

Starting from restricted open-shell calculations, i.e., a closed-shell description of the non-magnetic core electrons, a low-order perturbation expansion identifies the spin-polarization contribution to the energy of mono-radicals and to singlet–triplet energy differences in diradicals. Broken-symmetry (BS) single-determinant calculations introduce only a fraction of spin-polarization effects, and in a biased manner, since BS determinants are not spin eigenfunctions. We propose a simple technique to correctly evaluate spin-polarization energies by taking into account the effect of spin-flip components on one-hole one-particle excited configurations. Spin-decontamination corrections are shown to play a non-negligible role in the BS evaluation of bond energies. The importance of spin decontamination is illustrated in cases for which spin polarization is the leading contribution to the singlet–triplet gap, which characterizes twisted conjugated double bonds and disjoint diradicals.},

  abstract = {The presence of a confining boundary can modify the local structure of a liquid markedly. In addition, small samples of finite size are known to exhibit systematic deviations of thermodynamic quantities relative to their bulk values. Here, we consider the static structure factor of a liquid sample in slab geometry with open boundaries at the surfaces, which can be thought of as virtually cutting out the sample from a macroscopically large, homogeneous fluid. This situation is a relevant limit for the interpretation of grazing-incidence diffraction experiments at liquid interfaces and films. We derive an exact, closed expression for the slab structure factor, with the bulk structure factor as the only input. This shows that such free boundary conditions cause significant differences between the two structure factors, in particular, at small wavenumbers. An asymptotic analysis of this result yields the scaling exponent and an accurate, useful approximation of these finite-size corrections. Furthermore, the open boundaries permit the interpretation of the slab as an open system, supporting particle exchange with a reservoir. We relate the slab structure factor to the particle number fluctuations and discuss conditions under which the subvolume of the slab represents a grand canonical ensemble with chemical potential μ and temperature T . Thus, the open slab serves as a test-bed for the small-system thermodynamics in a μT reservoir. We provide a microscopically justified and exact result for the size dependence of the isothermal compressibility. Our findings are corroborated by simulation data for Lennard-Jones liquids at two representative temperatures.},

  abstract = {State space truncation methods are widely used to approximate solutions of the chemical master equation. While most methods of this kind focus on truncating the state space directly, in this work, we propose modifying the underlying chemical reaction network by introducing slack reactants that indirectly truncate the state space. More specifically, slack reactants introduce an expanded chemical reaction network and impose a truncation scheme based on desired mass conservation laws. This network structure also allows us to prove inheritance of special properties of the original model, such as irreducibility and complex balancing. We use the network structure imposed by slack reactants to prove the convergence of the stationary distribution and first arrival times. We then provide examples comparing our method with the stationary finite state projection and finite buffer methods. Our slack reactant system appears to be more robust than some competing methods with respect to calculating first arrival times.},

  abstract = {Hyperdynamics (HD) is a method for accelerating the timescale of standard molecular dynamics (MD). It can be used for simulations of systems with an energy potential landscape that is a collection of basins, separated by barriers, where transitions between basins are infrequent. HD enables the system to escape from a basin more quickly while enabling a statistically accurate renormalization of the simulation time, thus effectively boosting the timescale of the simulation. In the work of Kim et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 139 , 144110 (2013)], a local version of HD was formulated, which exploits the intrinsic locality characteristic typical of most systems to mitigate the poor scaling properties of standard HD as the system size is increased. Here, we discuss how both HD and local HD can be formulated to run efficiently in parallel. We have implemented these ideas in the LAMMPS MD code, which means HD can be used with any interatomic potential LAMMPS supports. Together, these parallel methods allow simulations of any size to achieve the time acceleration offered by HD (which can be orders of magnitude), at a cost of 2–4× that of standard MD. As examples, we performed two simulations of a million-atom system to model the diffusion and clustering of Pt adatoms on a large patch of the Pt(100) surface for 80 μ s and 160 µ s.},

  abstract = {We propose a cross-entropy minimization method for finding the reaction coordinate from a large number of collective variables in complex molecular systems. This method is an extension of the likelihood maximization approach describing the committor function with a sigmoid. By design, the reaction coordinate as a function of various collective variables is optimized such that the distribution of the committor p B * values generated from molecular dynamics simulations can be described in a sigmoidal manner. We also introduce the L 2 -norm regularization used in the machine learning field to prevent overfitting when the number of considered collective variables is large. The current method is applied to study the isomerization of alanine dipeptide in vacuum, where 45 dihedral angles are used as candidate variables. The regularization parameter is determined by cross-validation using training and test datasets. It is demonstrated that the optimal reaction coordinate involves important dihedral angles, which are consistent with the previously reported results. Furthermore, the points with p B * ∼ 0.5 clearly indicate a separatrix distinguishing reactant and product states on the potential of mean force using the extracted dihedral angles.},

This approach allows us to target such states with high specificity, albeit introducing an error. We report the implementation of a post-processing step for CVS excitations obtained within the algebraic–diagrammatic construction scheme for the polarization propagator, which removes this error. Based on this, we provide a detailed analysis of the CVS scheme, identifying its accuracy to be dominated by an error balance between two neglected couplings, one between core and valence single excitations and the other between single and double core excitations. The selection of the basis set is shown to be vital for a proper description of both couplings, with tight polarizing functions being necessary for a good balance of errors. The CVS error is confirmed to be stable across multiple systems, with an element-specific spread for K -edge spectrum calculations of only about ±0.02 eV. A systematic lowering of the CVS error by 0.02 eV–0.03 eV is noted when considering excitations to extremely diffuse states, emulating ionization.},

Often, the protein backbone is held fixed and its degrees of freedom are modeled implicitly to reduce the complexity of the conformational space. We present a hybrid method where short molecular dynamics (MD) segments are used to explore conformations and alternate with Monte Carlo (MC) moves that apply mutations to side chains. The backbone is fully flexible during MD. As a test, we computed side chain acid/base constants or p K a ’s in five proteins. This problem can be considered a special case of protein design, with protonation/deprotonation playing the role of mutations. The solvent was modeled as a dielectric continuum. Due to cost, in each protein we allowed just one side chain position to change its protonation state and the other position to change its type or mutate. The p K a ’s were computed with a standard method that scans a range of pH values and with a new method that uses adaptive landscape flattening (ALF) to sample all protonation states in a single simulation. The hybrid method gave notably better accuracy than standard, fixed-backbone MC. ALF decreased the computational cost a factor of 13.},

In the present work, we found that individual neural networks do not always converge under training. The use of bags and weighted means for consensus predictions provides a mechanism for effectively pruning the effects from the diverging networks without requiring prior conditioning.

This study also assesses the performance of different approximations for the hopping rates. Three different methods for solving the PME, a fourth order Runge–Kutta method, numerical diagonalization of the rate matrix followed by analytic propagation, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation method, are tested and confirmed to produce virtually identical values of time dependent mean square displacement, diffusion constant, and mobility. Five different rate expressions, exact numerical evaluation of Fermi’s Golden Rule (FGR) rate, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical approximation, classical Marcus rate, and Miller–Abrahams rate, are tested to help understand the effects of approximations in representing quantum environments in the presence of energy gradients. The results based on direct numerical evaluation of FGR rate exhibit transition from diffusive to non-diffusive behavior with the increase in the gradient and show that the charge transport in the quantum bath is more sensitive to the magnitude of the gradient and the disorder than in the classical bath. Among all the four approximations for the hopping rates, the SPI approximation is confirmed to work best overall. A comparison of two different methods to calculate the mobility identifies drift motion of the population distribution as the major source of non-diffusive behavior and provides more reliable information on the contribution of quantum bath.},

  abstract = {In their native state, many proteins/peptides display an ensemble of conformations, rather than a unique tertiary structure. Novel experimental techniques have enabled a quantitative analysis of this structural heterogeneity. In molecular dynamics simulations, however, capturing this conformational ensemble quantitatively remains a major challenge even with all atom simulations. In coarse grained (CG) simulations, with fewer degrees of freedom, representation of the conformational ensemble becomes more problematic. Here, we revisit a CG model from our group, which was designed to address the conformational transferability problem by using the LKα 14 peptide as a model system. The LKα 14 peptide transitions from a random/unstructured state in dilute solution to a solely α -helical conformation upon aggregation as evidenced by circular dichroism. Here, we demonstrate that the structure/physics based approach, used in the original parameterization of our CG model, strongly depends on the reference system chosen and excluded volume interactions that are often considered to be of secondary importance. We first tune the excluded volume parameters by using both α -helix and β -sheet type structures as reference and then update the nonbonded interactions by using a goodness-of-fit metric for representation of the conformational ensemble of LKα 14. We demonstrate that the updated model can recover the whole conformational ensemble quantitatively while maintaining the aggregation driven conformational transition. This balanced parametrization with regard to alternative secondary structures opens the door for the generalization of the CG model to other sequences, which we demonstrate on a β -sheet forming triblock peptide.},

However, the presence of other exits influences the statistical properties and dynamics measured at any specific exit. Here, we present theoretical arguments to explicitly show the existence of different time scales, such as mean exit times and inverse exit fluxes, for dynamic processes with multiple exits. This implies that the statistics of any specific exit dynamics cannot be considered without taking into account the presence of other exits. Several illustrative examples are described in detail using analytical calculations, mean-field estimates, and kinetic Monte Carlo computer simulations. The underlying microscopic mechanisms for the existence of different time scales are discussed. The results are relevant for understanding the mechanisms of various biological, chemical, and industrial processes, including transport through channels and pores.},

Thanks to recent developments, it is also possible to explicitly include in the simulations a time-dependent laser pulse, thereby accessing the transient excitation regime. However, the complexity entailed in these calculations calls for in-depth analysis of the accessible and yet approximate (either “dressed” or “bare”) quantities in order to evaluate their ability to provide us with a realistic picture of the simulated processes. In this work, we analyze the ultrafast dynamics of three small molecules (ethylene, benzene, and thiophene) excited by a resonant laser pulse in the framework of the adiabatic local-density approximation. The electronic response to the laser perturbation in terms of induced dipole moment and excited-state population is compared to the results given by an exactly solvable two-level model. In this way, we can interpret the charge-carrier dynamics in terms of simple estimators, such as the number of excited electrons. From the computed transient absorption spectra, we unravel the appearance of nonlinear effects such as excited-state absorption and vibronic coupling. In this way, we observe that the laser excitation affects the vibrational spectrum by enhancing the anharmonicities therein, while the coherent vibrational motion contributes to stabilizing the electronic excitation already within a few tens of femtoseconds.},

Herein, we uncover fundamental properties of biexciton decay in nanoplatelets by comparing the Auger recombination lifetimes based on interacting and noninteracting formalisms with measurements based on transient absorption spectroscopy. Specifically, we report that electron–hole correlations in the initial biexcitonic state must be included in order to obtain Auger recombination lifetimes in agreement with experimental measurements and that Auger recombination lifetimes depend nearly linearly on the lateral area and somewhat more strongly on the thickness of the nanoplatelet.

Our C/O modeling approach exhibits a 10 4 increase in efficiency for the same system size (i.e., 128 atoms) and a linear system size scalability over standard quantum molecular dynamics methods, allowing the simulation of significantly larger systems than previously possible. We find that the model captures the condensed-phase reaction-coupled formation of carbon clusters implied by recent experiments, and that this process is susceptible to strong finite size effects. Overall, we find the present ChIMES model to be well suited for studying chemical processes and cluster formation at pressures and temperatures typical of shock waves. We expect that the present C/O modeling paradigm can serve as a template for the development of a broader high pressure–high temperature force-field for condensed phase chemistry in organic materials.},

  abstract = {Safe and efficient use of ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs) in biomedicine requires numerous independent conditions to be met, including colloidal stability, selectivity for proteins and membranes, binding specificity, and low affinity for plasma proteins. The ability of a NP to satisfy one or more of these requirements depends on its physicochemical characteristics, such as size, shape, and surface chemistry. Multiscale and pattern recognition techniques are here integrated to guide the design of NPs with preferential nano-bio behaviors. Data systematically collected from simulations (or experiments, if available) are first used to train one or more artificial neural networks, each optimized for a specific kind of nano–bio interaction; the trained networks are then interconnected in suitable arrays to obtain the NP core morphology and layer composition that best satisfy all the nano–bio interactions underlying more complex behaviors. This reverse engineering approach is illustrated in the case of NP-membrane interactions, using binding modes and affinities and early stage membrane penetrations as training data. Adaptations for designing NPs with preferential nano-protein interactions and for optimizing solution conditions in the test tube are discussed.},

  abstract = {The free energy of pore formation in lipid bilayers has been previously calculated using a variety of reaction coordinates. Here, we use free energy perturbation of a cylindrical lipid exclusion restraint to compute the free energy profile as a function of pore radius in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. Additionally restraining the headgroups to lie on the membrane surface allows us to also calculate the free energy profile of hydrophobic pores, i.e., cylindrical pores lined by acyl chains. For certain pore radii, the free energy of wetting of hydrophobic pores is calculated using the density bias method. It is found that wetting of hydrophobic pores becomes thermodynamically favorable at 5.0 Å for DMPC and 6.5 Å for DOPC, although significant barriers prevent spontaneous wetting of the latter on a nanosecond time scale. The free energy of transformation of hydrophilic pores to hydrophobic ones is also calculated using free energy perturbation of headgroup restraints along the bilayer normal. This quantity, along with wetting and pore growth free energies, provides complete free energy profiles as a function of radius. Pore line tension values for the hydrophilic pores obtained from the slope of the free energy profiles are 37.6 pN for DMPC and 53.7 pN for DOPC. The free energy profiles for the hydrophobic pores are analyzed in terms of elementary interfacial tensions. It is found that a positive three-phase line tension is required to explain the results. The estimated value for this three-phase line tension (51.2 pN) lies within the expected range.},

One such class of technology aims to improve the precision of optical measurements using engineered quantum states of light. In this study, we investigate transmission measurement of frequency-entangled broadband photon pairs generated via parametric down-conversion with a monochromatic laser. It is observed that state-to-state dynamics in the system under study are temporally resolved by adjusting the path difference between the entangled twin beams when the entanglement time is sufficiently short. The non-classical photon correlation enables time-resolved spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping. It is further demonstrated that the signal corresponds to the spectral information along anti-diagonal lines of, for example, two-dimensional Fourier-transformed photon-echo spectra. This correspondence inspires us to anticipate that more elaborately engineered photon states would broaden the availability of quantum light spectroscopy.},

Large near-field enhancements of the electric fields used for spectroscopic interrogation of molecules at the nanostructure surface result in enhancement of the spectroscopic signatures. This enhancement scales with the nonlinear order of the method, providing particularly large signal gains for third- and fifth-order IR methods, reaching 10 6 and 10 8 raw enhancement factors, not adjusted to the amount of interrogated sample. In this perspective, we overview the advances in the development of nano-arrays of antenna-like nanostructures for mid-IR measurements and illustrate their use in linear and especially nonlinear two-dimensional IR approaches. We discuss how studies of the interaction mechanisms between light, plasmonic antennas, and molecular excitations benefit from the nonlinear two-dimensional time-resolved methods, which involve high-order scaling of the signal with the excitation field, high sensitivity to signal localization, and coherence of the excitation over a broad bandwidth. On the other hand, we demonstrate how studies of molecular structure and ultrafast dynamics by these advanced spectroscopic methods benefit from surface enhancement of signals by plasmonic antennas.},

However, the results of the simulations can only be as trustworthy as the underlying simulation model. In many of these processes, interactions between charged moieties play a critical role. Current empirical force fields tend to overestimate such interactions, often in a dramatic way, when polyvalent ions are involved. The source of this shortcoming is the missing electronic polarization in these models. Given the importance of such biomolecular systems, there is great interest in fixing this deficiency in a computationally inexpensive way without employing explicitly polarizable force fields. Here, we review the electronic continuum correction approach, which accounts for electronic polarization in a mean-field way, focusing on its charge scaling variant. We show that by pragmatically scaling only the charged molecular groups, we qualitatively improve the charge–charge interactions without extra computational costs and benefit from decades of force field development on biomolecular force fields.},

  abstract = {In this period of intense interest in human immunity, we attempt here to quantify the immune response against pathogen invasion through T-cell population dynamics. Borrowing concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics, we introduce a new description of the immune response function (IMRF) in terms of fluctuations in the population number of relevant biological cells (effector and regulatory T-cells). We use a coarse-grained chemical reaction network model (CG-CRNM) to calculate the number fluctuations and show that the response function derived as such can, indeed, capture the crossover observed in a T-cell driven immune response. We employ the network model to learn the effect of vitamin-D as an immunomodulator. We solve our CG-CRNM using a stochastic Gillespie algorithm. Depending on the effector T-cell concentration, we can classify immune regulation regimes into three categories: weak, strong, and moderate. The IMRF is found to behave differently in these three regimes. A damped cross-regulatory behavior found in the dynamics of effector and regulatory T-cell concentration in the diseased states correlates well with the same found in a cohort of patients with specific malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Importantly, the crossover from the weakly regulated steady state to the other (the strongly regulated) is accompanied by a divergence-like growth in the fluctuation of both the effector and the regulatory T-cell concentration, characteristic of a dynamic phase transition. We believe such steady-state IMRF analyses could help not only to phase-separate different immune stages but also aid in the valuable connection between autoimmunity, optimal vitamin-D, and consequences of immunosuppressive stress and malignancy.},

Grb2 contains three SH domains: N-terminal SH3 (nSH3), SH2, and C-terminal SH3 (cSH3). The C-terminal proline-rich (PR) domain of SOS1 regulates nSH3 open/closed conformations. Earlier, several nSH3 binding motifs were identified in the PR domain. More recently, we characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and replica exchange simulations possible cSH3 binding regions. Among them, we discovered a cSH3-specific binding region. However, how PR binding at these sites regulates the nSH3/cSH3 conformation has been unclear. Here, we explore the nSH3/cSH3 interaction with linked and truncated PR segments using molecular dynamics simulations. Our 248 μ s simulations include 620 distinct trajectories, each 400 ns. We construct the effective free energy landscape to validate the nSH3/cSH3 binding sites. The nSH3/cSH3–SOS1 peptide complex models indicate that strong peptide binders attract the flexible nSH3 n-Src loop, inducing a closed conformation of nSH3; by contrast, the cSH3 conformation remains unchanged. Inhibitors that disrupt the Ras–SOS1 interaction have been designed; the conformational details uncovered here may assist in the design of polypeptides inhibiting Grb2–SOS1 interaction, thus SOS1 recruitment to the membrane where Ras resides.},

Molecular dynamics simulations employing the Go-like model for the proteins show that at intermediate and high temperatures, including a presumable physiological temperature, the protein escape process at the atomistic tunnel is quantitatively similar to that at a cylinder tunnel of length L = 72 Å and diameter d = 16 Å. At low temperatures, the atomistic tunnel, however, yields an increased probability of protein trapping inside the tunnel, while the cylinder tunnel does not cause the trapping. All- β proteins tend to escape faster than all- α proteins, but this difference is blurred on increasing the protein’s chain length. A 29-residue zinc-finger domain is shown to be severely trapped inside the tunnel. Most of the single-domain proteins considered, however, can escape efficiently at the physiological temperature with the escape time distribution following the diffusion model proposed in our previous works. An extrapolation of the simulation data to a realistic value of the friction coefficient for amino acids indicates that the escape times of globular proteins are at the sub-millisecond scale. It is argued that this time scale is short enough for the smooth functioning of the ribosome by not allowing nascent proteins to jam the ribosome tunnel.},

  abstract = {The brain is strictly protected by the blood brain barrier preventing the crossing of therapeutics to treat brain diseases. The high and low intensity focused ultrasound methods have been used to temporarily open the blood brain barrier, facilitating the transport of drugs. The methods are very promising because the opening is transient, localized, and noninvasive. However, the molecular mechanism of the opening is unknown, and this limits the development and application of these methods. With this in mind, we carry out a molecular dynamics simulation study to understand the interaction of ultrasound with the cell membrane and the tight junction. Our minimal blood brain barrier model is composed of two lipid bilayers, mimicking two portions of neighboring cells, connected together by a tight junction formed by a pair of two cis -dimers of the claudin-5 protein. Using an experimental ultrasound frequency of 50 MHz, simulations show that at low intensities, ultrasound does not impact the structure of the cell membranes and tight junction, implying that the direct interaction of ultrasound with the blood brain barrier is not responsible for the experimentally observed opening. At high intensities, the ultrasound pulls the monolayers of individual cell membrane lipid bilayers apart, creating air compartments inside the bilayers. This reduces the free energy barrier for the translocation of drugs across the lipid bilayer and enhances drug permeability. At very high intensities, the two monolayers are largely separated, resulting in cell damage and implying that the blood brain barrier is primarily opened at the experimentally observed damaged areas.},

It enables the interpretation of the dielectric data of MetHb solutions in a unified manner using the previously developed 3D trajectory method driven by the protein concentration. It was shown that protein hydration is determined by the interaction of water dipoles with the charges and dipoles located on the rough surfaces of the protein macromolecules. In the case of the buffered solution, the transition from a dipole-charged to a dipole–dipole interaction with the protein concentration is observed {see Paper III [A. Puzenko et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 137 , 194502 (2012)]}. A new approach is proposed for evaluating the amount of hydration water molecules bounded to the macromolecule that takes into account the number of positive and negative charges on the protein’s surface. In the case of the MetHb solution in PBS, the hydration of the solvent ions and their interaction with charges on the protein’s surface are also taken into consideration. The difference in hydration between the two solutions of MetHb is discussed.},

  abstract = {We investigate the role of excitonic coupling between retinal chromophores of Krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin 2 (KR2) in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum using an exciton model combined with the transition density fragment interaction (TDFI) method. Although the multimer formation of retinal protein commonly induces biphasic negative and positive CD bands, the KR2 pentamer shows only a single positive CD band. The TDFI calculation reveals the dominant contribution of the Coulomb interaction and negligible contributions of exchange and charge-transfer interactions to the excitonic coupling energy. The exciton model with TDFI successfully reproduces the main features of the experimental absorption and CD spectra of KR2, which allow us to investigate the mechanism of the CD spectral shape observed in the KR2 pentamer. The results clearly show that the red shift of the CD band is attributed to the excitonic coupling between retinal chromophores. Further analysis reveals that the weak excitonic coupling plays a crucial role in the shape of the CD spectrum. The present approach provides a basis for understanding the origin of the KR2 CD spectrum and is useful for analyzing the mechanism of chromophore–chromophore interactions in biological systems.},

  abstract = {In this work, the dynamics of inertial (mass and moment of inertia) active Brownian particles trapped in a harmonic well is studied. This scenario has seen success when characterizing soft passive and active overdamped matter. Motivated by the variety of applications of this system, we analytically find the effect of translational and rotational inertia on the mean-square displacement (MSD), mean-square speed (MSS), swim, Reynolds, and total pressures of a system of inertial active Brownian particles subject to a weak and a strong harmonic trap. Following a Langevin formalism, we explicitly find that as inertia grows, the systems’ MSD and total pressure are enhanced, but its MSS and swim pressure decrease. The use of Langevin dynamics simulations enables us to observe that as inertia grows, inertial active matter under a strong trap no longer “condensates” at the “border” of the trap, but it rather tends to uniformly spread in space. Our analytical results are also numerically validated.},

Self-propulsion in our model is incorporated via the Vicsek-like activity, i.e., particles have the tendency of aligning their velocities with the average directions of motion of their neighbors. In addition to this dynamic or active interaction, there exists passive inter-particle interaction in the model for which we have chosen the standard Lennard-Jones form. Following quenches of homogeneous configurations to a point deep inside the region of coexistence between high and low density phases, as the systems exhibit formation and evolution of particle-rich clusters, we investigate properties related to the morphology, growth, and aging. A focus of our study is on the understanding of the effects of structure on growth and aging. To quantify the latter, we use the two-time order-parameter autocorrelation function. This correlation, as well as the growth, is observed to follow power-law time dependence, qualitatively similar to the scaling behavior reported for passive systems. The values of the exponents have been estimated and discussed by comparing with the previously obtained numbers for other dimensions as well as with the new results for the passive limit of the considered model. We have also presented results on the effects of temperature on the activity mediated phase separation.},

  abstract = {When a highly charged globular macromolecule, such as a dendritic polyelectrolyte or charged nanogel, is immersed into a physiological electrolyte solution, monovalent and divalent counterions from the solution bind to the macromolecule in a certain ratio and thereby almost completely electroneutralize it. For charged macromolecules in biological media, the number ratio of bound monovalent vs divalent ions is decisive for the desired function. A theoretical prediction of such a sorption ratio is challenging because of the competition of electrostatic (valency), ion-specific, and binding saturation effects. Here, we devise and discuss a few approximate models to predict such an equilibrium sorption ratio by extending and combining established electrostatic binding theories such as Donnan, Langmuir, Manning, and Poisson–Boltzmann approaches, to systematically study the competitive uptake of monovalent and divalent counterions by the macromolecule. We compare and fit our models to coarse-grained (implicit-solvent) computer simulation data of the globular polyelectrolyte dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) in salt solutions of mixed valencies. The dPGS molecule has high potential to serve in macromolecular carrier applications in biological systems and at the same time constitutes a good model system for a highly charged macromolecule. We finally use the simulation-informed models to extrapolate and predict electrostatic features such as the effective charge as a function of the divalent ion concentration for a wide range of dPGS generations (sizes).},

Apart from providing a sound theoretical framework generally applicable to any such problem, our novel findings, all of which contradict common beliefs, include the following: first, quantitative and qualitative differences between the interactions obtained within the linear and the nonlinear PB theories; second, the importance of the electrostatic interaction between the omnipresent three-phase contact lines in interfacial systems; and, third, the occurrence of an attractive electrostatic interaction between a pair of identical metal colloids. The unusual attraction we report largely stems from an attractive line interaction, which although scales linearly with the size of the particle can compete with the surface interactions and can be strong enough to alter the nature of the total electrostatic interaction. Our results should find applications in metal or metal-coated particle-stabilized emulsions where densely packed particle arrays are not only frequently observed but also sometimes required.},

We use ellipsometry to compare the temperature-dependent refractive index with decreasing thickness n ( h ) for supported films of poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polystyrene (PS), as these polymers have different silica substrate interactions. We observe similar n ( h ) trends for all three polymers, with near equivalence of P2VP and PS, characterized by a large apparent increase in refractive index for h ≤ 40 nm–65 nm depending on the polymer. Possible sources of molecular dipole orientation within the film are tested by varying molecular weight, polydispersity, chain conformation, and substrate chemistry. Such film inhomogeneities associated with non-uniform polarizability would invalidate the use of homogeneous layer approximations inherent in most thin film analysis methods, which we believe likely explains recent reports of large unphysical increases in film density with decreasing thickness by a variety of different experimental techniques.},

We have studied the dielectric properties of PVA cryogels within the freeze–thaw cycles as a function of both frequency and temperature in order to understand the physical changes that take place during the thermal cycling process. Our results indicate that most of the changes in dielectric properties occur during the cooling phase of the first cycle and suggest that the solution must be cooled below a critical temperature of about 263 K for the formation of a gel that persists after thawing. The material’s dielectric spectrum shows the presence of several relaxation processes. We identify one of these with the dielectric relaxation of ice and two others with motions of the PVA polymer chains. The temperature dependence of the polymeric relaxation times suggests that they are both thermally activated, with an activation energy of roughly 300 kJ/mol.},

Using density functional theory calculations under the harmonic approximation for n = 2 BA:MAPbI, we assign several longitudinal/transverse optical phonon modes between 30 cm −1 and 100 cm −1 , the eigendisplacements of which are analogous to that observed previously for octahedral twists/distortions in bulk MAPbI. Additionally, we propose an alternative assignment for low-frequency modes below this band (&lt;30 cm −1 ) as zone-folded longitudinal acoustic phonons corresponding to the periodicity of the entire layered structure. We compare measured spectra to predictions of the Rytov elastic continuum model for zone-folded dispersion in layered structures. Our results are consistent across the various 2D LHPs studied herein, with energetic shifts of optical phonons corresponding to microscopic structural differences between materials and energetic shifts of acoustic phonons according to changes in the periodicity and elastic properties of the perovskite/organic subphases.

The incorporated rCDs evidently promote the light harvesting and charge separation of the binary hybrid system, resulting in highly enhanced photocatalytic Cr(VI) degradation performance. Ultrafast time-resolved spectra reveal that the surface C—OH bonds of rCDs play a crucial role at the heterointerfaces to regulate the charge dynamics. The long-lived surface C—OH states not only act as electron donors but also become electron mediators to rapidly capture the photoelectrons from the intrinsic state in the time-domain of 1 ps and induce a much longer lifetime for achieving highly efficient photoelectron injection from rCDs to ZnO. These results manifest that rCDs can be a promising photosensitizer to apply in photocatalytic pollutant treatment and energy conversion fields.},

Potential-step and potential-scan ESPR measurements are used to probe the dynamics of the electric double layer (EDL) structure that exhibit anomalously slow and asymmetrical characteristics depending on the direction of potential perturbation. EDL dynamics respond at least 30 times more slowly to changes of potential in the positive direction than in the negative direction. ESPR experiments with the positive-going potential scan are significantly affected by the slow dynamics even at a slow scan. The surface charge density that reflects the relative static capacitance is obtained from the negative-going potential scans. The evaluated quasi-static differential capacitance exhibits a camel-shaped potential dependence, thereby agreeing with the prediction of the mean-field lattice gas model of the EDL in ILs.

We have performed time-domain ab initio calculations to study the exited state dynamics in mixed phase TiO 2 and to investigate the impact of an oxygen vacancy on the dynamics. The anatase(100)/rutile(001) heterostructures with and without an oxygen vacancy used in this work exhibit type II band alignment with the conduction band of rutile residing above that of anatase. The oxygen vacancy introduces a hole trap state inside the bandgap. Owing to a strong coupling between the donor and acceptor states, the electron and hole transfers across the anatase/rutile interface occur on an ultrafast 100 fs timescale in both systems. The decoupling of electron and hole favors a long-lived charge separated state. The electron–hole recombination across the pristine anatase/rutile interface takes 6.6 ns and is significantly slower than that in the pure anatase and rutile phases, showing good agreement with experiments. The electron transfer dynamics is independent of the oxygen vacancy, which has some influence on the hole transfer and a strong effect on carrier recombination. By creating a hole trap state, the vacancy accelerates carrier losses by over an order of magnitude. The fast charge separation and the long lifetime of the charge separated state rationalize the enhanced photocatalytic performance of mixed phase TiO 2 compared to the pure phases.},

Using broadband micro-area ultrafast spectroscopy, we firmly established a type I band alignment in the WS 2 –MoTe 2 heterostructure and ultrafast (∼60 fs) hot-electron transfer from photoexcited MoTe 2 to WS 2 . The hot-electron transfer efficiency increases with excitation energy or excess energy as a result of a more favorable continuous competition between resonant electron transfer and cooling, reaching 90\% for hot electrons with 0.3 eV excess energy. This study reveals exciting opportunities of designing extremely thin absorber and hot-carrier devices using 2D semiconductors and also sheds important light on the photoinduced interfacial process including charge transfer and generation in 2D heterostructures and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast control of electron dynamics is essential for future innovations in nanoelectronics, catalysis, and molecular imaging. Recently, we developed a general scheme (Stark Control of Electrons at Interfaces or SCELI) to control electron dynamics at interfaces [A. J. Garzón-Ramírez and I. Franco, Phys. Rev. B 98 , 121305 (2018)] that is based on using few-cycle lasers to open quantum tunneling channels for interfacial electron transfer. SCELI uses the Stark effect induced by non-resonant light to create transient resonances between a donor level in material B and an acceptor level in material A, resulting in B → A electron transfer. Here, we show how SCELI can be employed to generate net charge transport in ABA heterojunctions without applying a bias voltage, a phenomenon known as laser-induced symmetry breaking. The magnitude and sign of such transport can be controlled by simply varying the time asymmetry of the laser pulse through manipulation of laser phases. In particular, we contrast symmetry breaking effects introduced by manipulation of the carrier envelope phase with those introduced by relative phase control in ω + 2 ω laser pulses. The ω + 2 ω pulse is seen to be far superior as such pulses exhibit a larger difference in field intensity for positive and negative amplitudes. The results exemplify the power of Stark-based strategies for controlling electrons using lasers.},

  abstract = {Infrared (IR) spectra of an organic thin film are mostly understood by considering the normal modes of a single molecule, if the dipole–dipole (D–D) interaction is ignorable in the film. When the molecules have a chemical group having a large permanent dipole moment such as the C=O and C—F groups, the D–D interaction induces vibrational couplings across the molecules, which produces an extra band as a surface phonon or polariton band because of the small thickness. Since the dipole moment of an organic compound is much less than that of an inorganic ionic crystal, we have a problem that the extra band looks like a normal-mode band, which are difficult to be discriminated from each other. In fact, this visual similarity sometimes leads us to a wrong direction in chemical discussion because the direction of the transition moment of the extra band is totally different from those of the normal modes. Here, we show useful selection rules for discussing IR spectra of a thin film without performing the permittivity analysis. The apparent change in the spectral shape on decrease in the thickness of the sample can be correlated with the morphological change in the film surface, which can also be discussed with changes in the molecular packing. This analytical technique has effectively been applied for studying the chemical properties of perfluoroalkanes as a chemical demonstration, which readily supports the stratified dipole-array theory for perfluoroalkyl compounds.},

The simulations are used to study the dynamic equilibrium of the gases at the water–gas interface, to determine the z -density profiles for the gases and water, and calculate the interfacial tension γ under the different temperature/pressure conditions close to those of the formation of clathrate hydrates of these gases. At the same hydrostatic gas phase pressure, the CO 2 –water interface has a lower interfacial tension than the CH 4 –water interface. A greater number of CO 2 molecules, as much as three times more than methane at the same pressure, were adsorbed at the interfacial layer, which reflects the stronger electrostatic quadrupolar and van der Waals interactions between CO 2 and water molecules at the interface. The water surfaces are covered by less than a monolayer of gas even when the pressure of the system goes near the saturation pressure of CO 2 . The surface adsorbed molecules are in dynamic equilibrium with the bulk gas and with exchange between the gas and interface regions occurring repeatedly within the timescale of the simulations. The effects of the changes in the CO 2 –water interfacial tension with external temperature and pressure conditions on the formation of the clathrate hydrates and other CO 2 capture and sequestration processes are discussed.},

  abstract = {The low melting point of room temperature ionic liquids is usually explained in terms of the presence of bulky, low-symmetry, and flexible ions, with the first two factors related to the lattice energy while an entropic effect is attributed to the latter. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, the melting points of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate and 1-decyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate were determined, and the effect of the molecular flexibility over the melting point was explicitly computed by restraining the rotation of dihedral angles in both the solid and the liquid phases. The rotational flexibility over the bond between the ring and the alkyl chain affects the relative ordering of the anions around the cations and results in substantial effects over both the enthalpy and the entropy of melting. For the other dihedral angles of the alkyl group, the contributions are predominantly entropic and an alternating behavior was found. The flexibility of some dihedral angles has negligible effects on the melting point, while others can lead to differences in the melting point as large as 20 K. This alternating behavior is rationalized by the different probabilities of conformation defects in the crystal.},

  abstract = {Mobility of ions in polar liquids is diminished when the ionic charge is increased. This phenomenon, known as dielectric friction, is caused by the retarded response of the liquid’s dipoles to the charge movement. Linear response theories predict linear scaling of the inverse diffusion coefficient with the squared ionic charge. This prediction is analyzed here by molecular dynamics simulations of model ions with fractional charge q in the simple point charge water and by microscopic theory formulated in terms of the dynamic electric-field susceptibility of the solvent. The results of the analytical theory, and of its dielectric continuum limit, are in excellent agreement with simulations at sufficiently small charges q &lt; 0.5 when linear response holds. At higher ionic charges, the hydration shell contracts, resulting in deviations from linear response in both static and dynamic properties of the electric field produced by water at the ion. Nevertheless, dielectric friction continues to rise in the nonlinear regime, resulting in an overall factor of 3.7 slower diffusion upon placing a single charge q = 1 on the solute. An approximately linear scaling of the inverse diffusion coefficient with the squared ionic charge comes from a mutual compensation between nonlinear solvation and correlations between non-electrostatic and electrostatic forces. Mobility of common electrolyte ions in water is predicted to occur in the regime of nonlinear dielectric friction.},

Comparing both results allows one to dissect the 2D-Raman-THz response into contributions from mechanical anharmonicity, as well as electrical dipole and polarizability anharmonicities. Mechanical anharmonicity dominates the 2D-Raman-THz response of the hydrogen-bond stretching and hydrogen-bond bending bands of water, and dipole anharmonicity dominates that of the librational band, while the contribution of polarizability anharmonicity is comparably weak. A distinct echo of the hydrogen-bond stretching band is observed for the THz-Raman-THz pulse sequence, again dominated by mechanical anharmonicity. A peculiar mechanism is discussed, which is based on the coupling between the many normal modes within the hydrogen-bond stretching band and which will inevitably generate such an echo for an amorphous structure.},

We review, organize, and critically discuss various methods to estimate very long relaxation times. We also perform computer simulations of three dimensional ultrastable hard spheres glasses to test and quantitatively compare some of these methods for a single model system. The various estimation methods disagree significantly, and non-linear and non-equilibrium methods lead to a strong underestimate of the actual relaxation time.

Since several low-energy, thermodynamically accessible isomers exist for C s + ( H 2 O ) 3 ⁠ , even small changes in the description of the underlying potential energy surface can result in large differences in the relative stability of the various isomers.

The initial electron attached state is found to be localized in the bulk water, and this water-bound state acts as a doorway to the formation of the final nucleobase bound state. The electron transfer from water to uracil takes place because of the mixing of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. The water molecules around the uracil stabilize the uracil-bound anion by creating an extensive hydrogen-bonding network and accelerate the rate of electron attachment to uracil. The complete transfer of the electron from water to the uracil occurs in a picosecond time scale, which is consistent with the experimentally observed rate of reduction of nucleobases in the presence of water. The degree of solvation of the aqueous electron can lead to a difference in the initial stabilization of the uracil-bound anion. However, the anions formed due to the attachment of both surface-bound and bulk-solvated electrons behave similarly to each other at a longer time scale.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of the weakly bound anisole⋯CH 4 complex found a dual mode of binding, featuring both C/H⋯π and C/H⋯O noncovalent interactions. In this work, we examine the dissociation energies of related aniline⋯(CH 4 ) n ( n = 1, 2) van der Waals clusters, where both C/H⋯π and C/H⋯N interactions are possible. Using a combination of theory and experiments that include mass-selected two-color resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy, two-color appearance potential (2CAP) measurements, and velocity-mapped ion imaging (VMI), we derive the dissociation energies of both complexes in the ground (S 0 ), excited (S 1 ), and cation radical (D 0 ) states. As the amide group is non-planar in the ground state, the optimized ground state geometry of the aniline⋯CH 4 1:1 complex shows two isomers, each with the methane positioned above the aniline ring. The observed redshift of the electronic origin from the aniline monomer is consistent with TDDFT calculations for the more stable isomer, where the methane sits on the same face as the amino hydrogens. The dissociation energies of the 1:1 complex, obtained from 2CAP measurements, are in good agreement with the calculated theoretical values from selected density functional theory methods. VMI data for the 1:1 complex gave a binding energy value overestimated by ∼179 cm −1 when compared to the 2CAP results, indicating that dissociative ionization selectively populates an excited vibrational level of the aniline cation radical. Given that the electron donating ability of aromatic substituents trends as –NH 2 &gt; –OCH 3 &gt; –CH 3 , it is noteworthy that the strength of methane binding also trends in this order, as found by experiment (dissociation energies in kJ/mol: 6.6 &gt; 5.8 &gt; 4.5) and predicted by theory (PBE0-D3/def2-QZVPPD, in kJ/mol: 6.9 &gt; 6.0 &gt; 5.0). For the 1:2 complex of aniline and methane, calculations predict that the more stable conformer is the one where the two methane molecules lie on opposite faces of the ring, consistent with the observed redshift of the electronic origin. Unlike the anisole–methane 1:2 complex, which shows an enhanced dissociation energy for the loss of one methane in comparison with the 1:1 complex, here, we find that the energy required to remove one methane from the ground state aniline–methane 1:2 complex is smaller than that of the 1:1 complex, consistent with theoretical expectations.},

  abstract = {The fundamental vibrational frequencies and higher vibrationally excited states for the N 3 + ion in its electronic ground state have been determined from quantum bound state calculations on three-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) computed at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)]-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ-f12 and multireference configuration interaction singles and doubles with quadruples (MRCISD+Q)/aug-cc-pVTZ levels of theory. The vibrational fundamental frequencies are 1130 cm −1 ( ν 1 , symmetric stretch), 807 cm −1 ( ν 3 , asymmetric stretch), and 406 cm −1 ( ν 2 , bend) on the higher-quality CCSD(T)-F12b surface. Bound state calculations based on even higher level PESs [CCSD(T)-F12b/aug-cc-pVQZ-f12 and MRCISD+Q-F12b/aug-cc-pVTZ-f12] confirm the symmetric stretch fundamental frequency as ∼1130 cm −1 . This compares with an estimated frequency from experiment at 1170 cm −1 and previous calculations [Chambaud et al. , Chem. Phys. Lett. 231 , 9–12 (1994)] at 1190 cm −1 . The remaining disagreement with the experimental frequency is attributed to uncertainties associated with the widths and positions of the experimental photoelectron peaks. Analysis of the reference complete active space self-consistent field wave function for the MRCISD+Q calculations provides deeper insight into the shape of the PES and lends support for the reliability of the Hartree–Fock reference wave function for the coupled cluster calculations. According to this, N 3 + has a mainly single reference character in all low-energy regions of its electronic ground state ( 3 A″) PES.},

  abstract = {Kinetics of photoinduced intramolecular charge separation (CS) and the ensuing ultrafast charge recombination (CR) in electron-donor–acceptor dyads are studied numerically, taking into account the excitation of charge-transfer active intramolecular vibrations and multiple relaxation time scales of the surrounding polar solvent. Both energetic and dynamic properties of intramolecular and solvent reorganization are considered, and their influence on the CS/CR kinetics and quantum yield of ultrafast CS is explored. Particular attention is paid to the energy efficiency of CS, as one of the most important parameters indicating the promise of using a molecular compound as a basis for emerging optoelectronic devices. The CS quantum yield and the energy efficiency of CS are shown to depend differently on the key model parameters. Necessary conditions for the highly efficient CS are evaluated using analytic formulae for the electron transfer rates and derived from numerical simulation data. The reasons why low-exergonic CS taking place in the Marcus normal region can be much slower than CR in the deep inverted region are discussed.},

  abstract = {For the first time, equations are derived for computing stationary vibrational states with extended vibrational coupled cluster (EVCC) and for propagating nuclear wave packets using time-dependent EVCC (TDEVCC). Expressions for energies, properties, and auto-correlation functions are given. For TDEVCC, convergence toward the ground state for imaginary-time propagation is shown, as well as separability in the case of non-interacting subsystems. The analysis focuses substantially on the difference between bra and ket parameterizations for EVCC and TDEVCC compared to normal vibrational coupled cluster (VCC) and time-dependent VCC (TDVCC). A pilot implementation is presented within a new full-space framework that offers easy access to completely general, albeit not efficient, implementations of alternative VCC variants, such as EVCC. The new methods were tested on 35 three- and six-mode molecular systems. Both EVCC[ k ] and TDEVCC[ k ] showed good, hierarchical convergence toward the exact limit. This convergence was generally better than for normal VCC[ k ] and TDVCC[ k ] and better still than for (time-dependent) vibrational configuration interaction, though this should be balanced with the higher computational complexity of EVCC. The results highlight the importance of exponential parameterizations and separability in general, as seen, in particular, for the TDEVCC bra parameterization, which is in contrast to the partially linear one of TDVCC. With the results being rooted in the general structures of coupled cluster (CC) theory, they are expected to be relevant to other applications of both normal and extended CC theory as well.},

While only zero-momentum exciton states are coupled to light, radiative recombination of non-zero momentum trions is also allowed. This leads to an asymmetric broadening of the trion spectral peak and redshift of the emitted light with increasing temperature. The lowest energy trion state is dark, which is manifested by the sharply non-monotonic temperature dependence of the PL intensity. Our calculations combine the Dirac model for the single-particle states, with parameters obtained from the first-principles calculations, and the direct solution of the three-particle problem within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation. The numerical results are well captured by a simple model that yields analytical expressions for the temperature dependencies of the PL spectra.},

  abstract = {We explore the use of the stochastic resolution-of-the-identity (sRI) with the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) method. sRI is combined with four existing local energy evaluation strategies in ph-AFQMC, namely, (1) the half-rotated electron repulsion integral tensor (HR), (2) Cholesky decomposition (CD), (3) tensor hypercontraction (THC), or (4) low-rank factorization (LR). We demonstrate that HR–sRI achieves no scaling reduction, CD–sRI scales as O ( N 3 ) ⁠ , and THC–sRI and LR–sRI scale as O ( N 2 ) ⁠ , albeit with a potentially large prefactor. Furthermore, the walker-specific extra memory requirement in CD is reduced from O ( N 3 ) to O ( N 2 ) with sRI, while sRI-based THC and LR algorithms lead to a reduction from O ( N 2 ) extra memory to O ( N ) ⁠ . Based on numerical results for one-dimensional hydrogen chains and water clusters, we demonstrated that, along with the use of a variance reduction technique, CD–sRI achieves cubic-scaling without overhead . In particular, we find that for the systems studied, the observed scaling of standard CD is O ( N 3 – 4 ) ⁠ , while for CD–sRI, it is reduced to O ( N 2 – 3 ) ⁠ . Once a memory bottleneck is reached, we expect THC–sRI and LR–sRI to be preferred methods due to their quadratic-scaling memory requirements and their quadratic-scaling of the local energy evaluation (with a potentially large prefactor). The theoretical framework developed here should facilitate large-scale ph-AFQMC applications that were previously difficult or impossible to carry out with standard computational resources.},

  abstract = {NAMD is a molecular dynamics program designed for high-performance simulations of very large biological objects on CPU- and GPU-based architectures. NAMD offers scalable performance on petascale parallel supercomputers consisting of hundreds of thousands of cores, as well as on inexpensive commodity clusters commonly found in academic environments. It is written in C++ and leans on Charm++ parallel objects for optimal performance on low-latency architectures. NAMD is a versatile, multipurpose code that gathers state-of-the-art algorithms to carry out simulations in apt thermodynamic ensembles, using the widely popular CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS, and GROMOS biomolecular force fields. Here, we review the main features of NAMD that allow both equilibrium and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations with numerical efficiency. We describe the underlying concepts utilized by NAMD and their implementation, most notably for handling long-range electrostatics; controlling the temperature, pressure, and pH; applying external potentials on tailored grids; leveraging massively parallel resources in multiple-copy simulations; and hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical descriptions. We detail the variety of options offered by NAMD for enhanced-sampling simulations aimed at determining free-energy differences of either alchemical or geometrical transformations and outline their applicability to specific problems. Last, we discuss the roadmap for the development of NAMD and our current efforts toward achieving optimal performance on GPU-based architectures, for pushing back the limitations that have prevented biologically realistic billion-atom objects to be fruitfully simulated, and for making large-scale simulations less expensive and easier to set up, run, and analyze.

Therefore, it would be interesting to see which effect dominates when the number density of B as well as the number density of the crowders increases.

This equation is written via the non-inertial Langevin equations for the evolution of the Eulerian angles and their associated Smoluchowski equation. These equations govern the normal rotational diffusion of an assembly of non-interacting dipolar molecules with similar internal interacting polar groups hindering their rotation owing to their mutual potential energy. The resulting fractional Smoluchowski equation is then solved in the frequency domain using scalar continued fractions yielding the linear dielectric response as a function of the fractional parameter for extensive ranges of the interaction parameter and friction ratios. The complex susceptibility comprises a multimode Cole–Cole-like low frequency band with width dependent on the fractional parameter and is analogous to the discrete set of Debye mechanisms of the normal diffusion.

We show that for a harmonic model system, the third order cumulant correction captures effects introduced by a mismatch in curvatures of ground and excited state potential energy surfaces, as well as effects of mode mixing. We also demonstrate that 2DES signals can be accurately reconstructed from purely classical correlation functions using quantum correction factors. We then compute nonlinear optical spectra for the Nile red and methylene blue chromophores in solution, assessing the third order cumulant contribution for realistic systems. We show that the third order cumulant correction is strongly dependent on the treatment of the solvent environment, revealing the interplay between environmental polarization and the electronic-vibrational coupling.},

The vector descriptors are used to identify sub-classes of elementary steps, and linear discriminant analysis is used to accurately identify the reaction type and reduce the dimension of the vectors. The resulting descriptors are applied to predict gas-phase reaction energies using linear regression with accuracies that exceed the commonly employed group additivity approach. They are also applied to quantitatively assess model compound similarity, and the results are consistent with chemical intuition.

  abstract = {We show how to evaluate mobility profiles, characterizing the transport of confined fluids under a perturbation, from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The correlation functions derived with the Green–Kubo formalism are difficult to sample accurately, and we consider two complementary strategies: improving the spatial sampling, thanks to a new estimator of the local fluxes involving the forces acting on the particles in addition to their positions and velocities, and improving the temporal sampling, thanks to the Einstein–Helfand approach instead of the Green–Kubo one. We illustrate this method in the case of a binary mixture confined between parallel walls, under a pressure or chemical potential gradient. All equilibrium methods are compared to standard non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) and provide the correct mobility profiles. We recover quantitatively fluid viscosity and diffusio-osmotic mobility in the bulk part of the pore. Interestingly, the matrix of mobility profiles for local fluxes is not symmetric, unlike the Onsager matrix for the total fluxes. Even the most computationally efficient equilibrium method (the Einstein–Helfand approach combined with the force-based estimator) remains less efficient than NEMD to determine a specific mobility profile. However, the equilibrium approach provides all responses to all perturbations simultaneously, whereas NEMD requires the simulation of several types of perturbations to determine the various responses, each with different magnitudes to check the validity of the linear regime. While NEMD seems more competitive for the present example, the balance should be different for more complex systems, in particular for electrolyte solutions for the responses to pressure, salt concentration, and electric potential gradients.},

Lipopolysaccharide diffuses at least an order of magnitude slower than phospholipids, which can cause issues for molecular dynamics simulations in terms of adequate sampling. Here, we test a number of simulation protocols for their ability to achieve convergence with reasonable computational effort using the MARTINI coarse-grained force-field. This is tested in the context both of potential of mean force (PMF) calculations for lipid extraction from membranes and of lateral mixing within the membrane phase. We find that decoupling the cations that cross-link the lipopolysaccharide headgroups from the extracted lipid during PMF calculations is the best approach to achieve convergence comparable to that for phospholipid extraction. We also show that lateral lipopolysaccharide mixing/sorting is very slow and not readily addressable even with Hamiltonian replica exchange. We discuss why more sorting may be unrealistic for the short (microseconds) timescales we simulate and provide an outlook for future studies of lipopolysaccharide-containing membranes.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for simulating ungrounded charged metal slabs inside an electrolyte solution. The ions are free to move between the interior and exterior regions of the slab–electrolyte system. This leads to polarization of both sides of each slab, with a distinct surface charge induced on each surface. Our simulation method is based on the exact solution of the Poisson equation using periodic Green functions. To efficiently perform the calculations, we decouple the electrostatic energy due to surface polarization from that of purely Coulomb interaction between the ions. This allows us to combine a fast 3D Ewald summation technique with an equally fast calculation of polarization. As a demonstration of the method, we calculate ionic density profiles inside an electrolyte solution and explore charge neutrality violation in between charged metal slabs.},

The vibrational modes are considered to be resonant/quasi-resonant with the energy gap between electronic excitons. These resonant vibrations, along with the remaining nuclear degrees of freedom, constitute the environment/bath to the electronically excited system and contribute to two major phenomena: (a) decoherence and (b) incoherent phonon-mediated population relaxation. In this work, we explore the subtle interplay among the electronic excitation, the resonant vibrations, and the environment in dictating environment assisted quantum transport in light-harvesting complexes. We conclusively show that resonant vibrations are capable of boosting the incoherent population relaxation pathways and cause rapid decoherence.},

The first approach projects the operator form of the standard QCLE onto the diabatic Floquet basis and then transforms to the adiabatic representation. The second approach directly projects the QCLE onto the Floquet adiabatic basis. Both approaches yield a form that is similar to the usual QCLE with two modifications: (1) The electronic degrees of freedom are expanded to infinite dimension and (2) the nuclear motion follows Floquet quasi-energy surfaces. However, the second approach includes an additional cross derivative force due to the dual dependence on time and nuclear motion of the Floquet adiabatic states. Our analysis and numerical tests indicate that this cross derivative force is a fictitious artifact, suggesting that one cannot safely exchange the order of Floquet state projection with adiabatic transformation. Our results are in accord with similar findings by Izmaylov et al. , [J. Chem. Phys. 140, 084104 (2014)] who found that transforming to the adiabatic representation must always be the last operation applied, although now we have extended this result to a time-dependent Hamiltonian.

  abstract = {Combining multiple levels of theory in free energy simulations to balance computational accuracy and efficiency is a promising approach for studying processes in the condensed phase. While the basic idea has been proposed and explored for quite some time, it remains challenging to achieve convergence for such multi-level free energy simulations as it requires a favorable distribution overlap between different levels of theory. Previous efforts focused on improving the distribution overlap by either altering the low-level of theory for the specific system of interest or ignoring certain degrees of freedom. Here, we propose an alternative strategy that first identifies the degrees of freedom that lead to gaps in the distributions of different levels of theory and then treats them separately with either constraints or restraints or by introducing an intermediate model that better connects the low and high levels of theory. As a result, the conversion from the low level to the high level model is done in a staged fashion that ensures a favorable distribution overlap along the way. Free energy components associated with different steps are mostly evaluated explicitly, and thus, the final result can be meaningfully compared to the rigorous free energy difference between the two levels of theory with limited and well-defined approximations. The additional free energy component calculations involve simulations at the low level of theory and therefore do not incur high computational costs. The approach is illustrated with two simple but non-trivial solution examples, and factors that dictate the reliability of the result are discussed.},

The FPMD simulation based on density functional theory has become a powerful computational approach for studying a wide range of condensed phase systems. However, its large computational cost makes it difficult to incorporate NQEs in the simulation and investigate temperature dependence of various properties. To circumvent this difficulty, we use an artificial neural network model and employ the thermostatted ring polymer MD approach for studying the temperature dependence of NQEs on various properties. The NQEs generally bring the radial distribution functions closer to the experimental measurements. Translational diffusivity and rotational dynamics of water molecules are both slowed down by the NQEs. The competing inter-molecular and intra-molecular quantum effects on hydrogen bonds, as discussed by Habershon, Markland, and Manolopoulos [J. Chem.

Evolution produces progressively fitter agents, potentially allowing the calculation of a piece of a large-deviation rate function for a particular model and path-extensive quantity. For models with small state spaces, the evolutionary process acts directly on rates, and for models with large state spaces, the process acts on the weights of a neural network that parameterizes the model’s rates.

  abstract = {Intermolecular interactions are critical to many chemical phenomena, but their accurate computation using ab initio methods is often limited by computational cost. The recent emergence of machine learning (ML) potentials may be a promising alternative. Useful ML models should not only estimate accurate interaction energies but also predict smooth and asymptotically correct potential energy surfaces. However, existing ML models are not guaranteed to obey these constraints. Indeed, systemic deficiencies are apparent in the predictions of our previous hydrogen-bond model as well as the popular ANI-1X model, which we attribute to the use of an atomic energy partition. As a solution, we propose an alternative atomic-pairwise framework specifically for intermolecular ML potentials, and we introduce AP-Net—a neural network model for interaction energies. The AP-Net model is developed using this physically motivated atomic-pairwise paradigm and also exploits the interpretability of symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). We show that in contrast to other models, AP-Net produces smooth, physically meaningful intermolecular potentials exhibiting correct asymptotic behavior. Initially trained on only a limited number of mostly hydrogen-bonded dimers, AP-Net makes accurate predictions across the chemically diverse S66x8 dataset, demonstrating significant transferability. On a test set including experimental hydrogen-bonded dimers, AP-Net predicts total interaction energies with a mean absolute error of 0.37 kcal mol −1 , reducing errors by a factor of 2–5 across SAPT components from previous neural network potentials. The pairwise interaction energies of the model are physically interpretable, and an investigation of predicted electrostatic energies suggests that the model “learns” the physics of hydrogen-bonded interactions.},

  abstract = {Finding the stopping site of the muon in a muon-spin relaxation experiment is one of the main problems of muon spectroscopy, and computational techniques that make use of quantum chemistry simulations can be of great help when looking for this stopping site. The most thorough approach would require the use of simulations, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), to test and optimize multiple possible sites, accounting for the effect that the added muon has on its surroundings. However, this can be computationally expensive and sometimes unnecessary. Hence, in this work, we present a software implementation of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Potential (UEP) Method: an approach used for finding the muon stopping site in crystalline materials. The UEP method requires only one DFT calculation, necessary to compute the electronic density. This, in turn, is used to calculate the minima of the crystalline material’s electrostatic potential and the estimates of the muon stopping site, relying on the approximation that the muon’s presence does not significantly affect its surroundings. One of the main UEP’s assumptions is that the muon stopping site will be one of the crystalline material’s electrostatic potential minima. In this regard, we also propose some symmetry-based considerations about the properties of this crystalline material’s electrostatic potential, in particular, which sites are more likely to be its minima and why the unperturbed approximation may be sufficiently robust for them. We introduce the Python software package pymuon-suite and the various utilities it provides to facilitate these calculations, and finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with some chosen example systems.},

By carefully tuning the parameters for this modulating function, our method can eliminate the problematic angle-dependent singularity while being combined with existing models. As an example, we optimized the modulating function of the torsion angle potential for popular CG models of biomolecules based on the statistics over experimental structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. By applying our method to designed and natural biomolecules, we show that the new torsion angle potential is able to eliminate the singularity problem while maintaining the structural features in the original models. Furthermore, by comparing our design with previous methods, we found that our new potential has advantages in computational efficiency and numerical stability.

Our simulations illustrate how the branching between nonradiative intersystem crossing and radiative decay through the cavity can be tuned by selecting specific cavity photon energies resonant at specific molecular geometries.

  abstract = {In classical molecular dynamics, general purpose atomistic force-fields (FFs) often deliver inaccurate results when dealing with halogen bonds (XBs), notwithstanding their crucial role in many fields of science, ranging from material design to drug development. Given the large dimensions of the systems of interest, it would be therefore desirable to increase the FF accuracy maintaining the simplicity of the standard Lennard-Jones (LJ) plus point charge description to avoid an excessive computational cost. A simple yet effective strategy consists in introducing a number of virtual sites able to mimic the so-called “explicit σ -hole.” In this work, we present an automated FF parameterization strategy based on a global optimization of both LJ and charge parameters with respect to accurate quantum mechanical data, purposely computed for the system under investigation. As a test case, we report on two homologue series, characterized either by weak or strong XBs, namely, the di-halogenated methanes and the mono-, di-, and tri-substituted acetonitriles, taking into consideration Cl, Br, and I substituents. The resulting quantum mechanically derived FFs are validated for each compound in the gas and in the condensed phase by comparing them to general purpose and specific FFs without virtual sites and to highly accurate reference quantum mechanical data. The results strongly support the adoption of the specific FFs with virtual sites, which overcome the other investigated models in representing both gas phase energetics and the structural patterns of the liquid phase structure related to the presence of XBs.},

  abstract = {Charge transfer rate constants were calculated for the carotenoid-porphyrin-C 60 (CPC 60 ) molecular triad dissolved in explicit tetrahydrofuran. The calculation was based on mapping the all-atom anharmonic Hamiltonian of this system onto the spin-boson Hamiltonian. The mapping was based on discretizing the spectral density from the time correlation function of the donor–acceptor potential energy gap, as obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Different spin-boson Hamiltonians were constructed for each of the possible transitions between the three excited electronic states in two different triad conformations. The rate constants of three possible transitions were calculated via the quantum-mechanically exact Fermi’s golden rule (FGR), as well as a progression of more approximate expressions that lead to the classical Marcus expression. The advantage of the spin-boson approach is that once the mapping is established, the quantum-mechanically exact FGR and the hierarchy of approximations are known in closed form. The classical Marcus charge transfer rate constants obtained with the spin-boson Hamiltonians were found to reproduce those obtained from all-atom simulations with the linearized semiclassical approximation, thereby confirming the equivalence of the two approaches for this system. Within the spin-boson Hamiltonian, we also found that the quantum-mechanically exact FGR rate constants were significantly enhanced compared to the classical Marcus theory rate constants for two out of three transitions in one of the two conformations under consideration. The results confirm that mapping to the spin-boson model can yield accurate predictions for charge transfer rate constants in a system as complex as CPC 60 dissolved in tetrahydrofuran.},

Here, we address the methodological question of how one can fit GAP models that accurately predict vibrational properties in specific regions of configuration space while retaining flexibility and transferability to others. We use an adaptive regularization of the GAP fit that scales with the absolute force magnitude on any given atom, thereby exploring the Bayesian interpretation of GAP regularization as an “expected error” and its impact on the prediction of physical properties for a material of interest. The approach enables excellent predictions of phonon modes (to within 0.1 THz–0.2 THz) for structurally diverse silicon allotropes, and it can be coupled with existing fitting databases for high transferability across different regions of configuration space, which we demonstrate for liquid and amorphous silicon. These findings and workflows are expected to be useful for GAP-driven materials modeling more generally.},

Under the finite-state lead condition (the two electrodes have finite states), we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the steady-state current in the two limits of electronic relaxation. Under the infinite-state lead condition, the steady-state solutions of the two model systems can be cast as Landauer-type current formulas. According to the formulas, we show that the transmission functions near the resonant peak and the antiresonant dip can be significantly influenced by electronic relaxation in the electrodes. Moreover, under intermediate and strong electronic relaxation conditions, we analytically show that the steady-state current of the DLvN approach dramatically deviates from the Landauer current when destructive quantum interference occurs. In the regime of zero electronic relaxation, our results are reduced to the Landauer formula, indicating that the DLvN approach is equivalent to the Landauer approach when the leads have infinite states without any electronic relaxation.},

  abstract = {This work proposes perturbation approaches for describing dipolar fluids as well as model and aqueous electrolyte solutions. The electrostatic pair potentials are split into short- and long-ranged contributions, whereas a third order perturbation expansion is applied for the short-ranged potentials. This circumvents the problem of divergent correlation integrals. The dipolar perturbation terms are represented through a [2,1]-Padé approximation to resum the poorly convergent series. For the remaining charge–charge and charge–dipole contributions, we present a new approximant, which provides a (quasi)linear dependence of the Helmholtz energy. The underlying correlation integrals are adjusted to results from molecular simulations. The long-ranged contribution to the electrostatic interactions is treated through an analytic expression developed by Rodgers and Weeks [J. Chem. Phys. 131 , 244108 (2010)]. Theoretical predictions of our perturbation theory are compared to results from a widely used integral equation theory, namely, the mean spherical approximation, and we find that our perturbation theory provides much more accurate results. Furthermore, the theory shows some quantities in rather good agreement with reference data, namely, Helmholtz energies, internal energies, and densities at higher densities of solutions. Limitations of the approach, however, are observed for several other partial molar quantities, such as the mean activity coefficient.},

  abstract = {Recently, trapped-particle experiments have probed the instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion revealing that, at early times, hydrodynamic history forces dominate Stokes damping. In these experiments, nonuniform particle motion is well described by the Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen (BBO) equation, which captures the unsteady Basset history force at a low Reynolds number. Building off of these results, earlier we showed that, at low temperature, BBO particles could exploit fluid inertia in order to overcome potential barriers (generically modeled as a tilted washboard), while its Langevin counter-part could not. Here, we explore the behavior of neutrally buoyant BBO particles at finite temperature for moderate Stokes damping. Remarkably, we find that the transport of particles injected into a bumpy potential with sufficiently high barriers can be completely quenched at intermediate temperatures, whereas itinerancy may be possible above and below that temperature window. This effect is present for both Langevin and BBO dynamics, though these occur over drastically different temperature ranges. Furthermore, hydrodynamic memory mitigates these effects by sustaining initial particle momentum, even in the difficult intermediate temperature regime.},

Restoring details at a finer scale requires us to generate information following embedded physics and statistics of the models at two different levels of description. Techniques designed to address this persistent challenge balance among accuracy, efficiency, and general applicability. In this work, we present an image-based approach for structural backmapping from coarse-grained to atomistic models with cis -1,4 polyisoprene melts as an illustrative example. Through machine learning, we train conditional generative adversarial networks on the correspondence between configurations at the levels considered. The trained model is subsequently applied to provide predictions of atomistic structures from the input coarse-grained configurations. The effect of different data representation schemes on training and prediction quality is examined. Our proposed backmapping approach shows remarkable efficiency and transferability over different molecular weights in the melt based on training sets constructed from oligomeric compounds. We anticipate that this versatile backmapping approach can be readily extended to other complex systems to provide high-fidelity initial configurations with minimal human intervention.},

Already, rather generic models, such as ensembles of active Brownian particles, exhibit phenomena, which are absent at equilibrium, particularly motility-induced phase separation and collective motion. Further intriguing nonequilibrium effects emerge in assemblies of bound active agents as in linear polymers or filaments. The interplay of activity and conformational degrees of freedom gives rise to novel structural and dynamical features of individual polymers, as well as in interacting ensembles. Such out-of-equilibrium polymers are an integral part of living matter, ranging from biological cells with filaments propelled by motor proteins in the cytoskeleton and RNA/DNA in the transcription process to long swarming bacteria and worms such as Proteus mirabilis and Caenorhabditis elegans , respectively. Even artificial active polymers have been synthesized. The emergent properties of active polymers or filaments depend on the coupling of the active process to their conformational degrees of freedom, aspects that are addressed in this article. The theoretical models for tangentially and isotropically self-propelled or active-bath-driven polymers are presented, both in the presence and absence of hydrodynamic interactions. The consequences for their conformational and dynamical properties are examined, with emphasis on the strong influence of the coupling between activity and hydrodynamic interactions. Particular features of emerging phenomena in semi-dilute systems, induced by steric and hydrodynamic interactions, are highlighted. Various important, yet theoretically unexplored, aspects are featured, and future challenges are discussed.},

However, because of the experimental difficulty in measuring the membrane properties for each leaflet separately, the differences are not well understood at a molecular level. In this study, we constructed two lipid bilayer systems, modeling outer and inner leaflets of plasma membranes of mouse hepatocytes based on experimental composition data. The ion concentration in the interlamellar water phase was also set to match the concentration in extra- and intracellular fluids. The differences in physical properties between the outer and inner leaflets of mouse hepatocyte cell membrane models were investigated by performing 1.2 μ s-long all-atomistic molecular dynamics calculations under physiological temperature and pressure conditions (310.15 K and 1 atm). The calculated electron density profiles along the bilayer normal for each model bilayer system captured well the asymmetric feature of the experimental electron density profile across actual cell plasma membranes, indicating that our procedure of modeling the outer and inner leaflets of the cell plasma membranes was satisfactory. We found that compared to the outer leaflet model, the inner leaflet model had a very bulky and soft structure in the lateral direction. To confirm the differences, membrane fluidity was measured from the lateral diffusivity and relaxation times. The fluidity was significantly higher in the inner leaflet model than in the outer leaflet model. We also discuss two topics that are of wide interest in biology, i.e., the interdigitation of acyl tails of lipid molecules between two monolayers and the lateral concentration fluctuation of lipid molecules in the bilayers.},

Amphiphilic dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is known to alter biomembrane permeability. Atomistic simulation-based studies to explore the impact of amphiphilic molecules on the model lipid membranes are of immense importance. These studies provide molecular details on how the membrane physical properties, such as fluidity and thickness, are modulated by amphiphile–lipid interactions. However, such approaches are usually limited to short simulation time and length scales. To circumvent such limitations, the use of coarse-grained (CG) models is a current computational strategy. In this article, we have presented a new CG force-field for DMSO for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The model is designed to reproduce experimental bulk properties of DMSO and its aqueous mixtures, molecular-level structure of liquid DMSO, and the phase transfer energy of a single DMSO molecule from the aqueous phase to the lipid bilayer hydrophobic interior. The current CG DMSO model successfully mimics the structural variation in phospholipid bilayer systems (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn- glycero -3-phosphocholine and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn- glycero -3-phosphoethanolamine) including alteration in bilayer thickness, lipid tail ordering, lipid lateral packing, and electron density profiles at various DMSO concentrations when compared to those obtained from parallel atomistic simulations.},

By providing closed-form explicit algebraic expressions for the concentration profiles inside charged nanopores, this theory allows the prediction of baseline and translocation resistive signals without the need for numerical simulation of the electrokinetic phenomena. A transversely homogenized theory and an asymptotic expansion for weakly charged pores capture DC or quasi-static rectification due to field-induced intrapore concentration polarization (as a result of pore charge inhomogeneity or a translocating molecule). This theory, validated by simulations and experiments, is then used to explain why the amplitude of a single stranded DNA molecule can be twice as high as the amplitude of its double stranded counterpart. It also suggests designs for intrapore concentration polarization and volume exclusion effects that can produce biphasic and other amplitude fingerprints for high-throughput and yet discriminating molecular identification.},

  abstract = {Omega-3 dietary supplements provide a rich source of the active moieties eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which exist in the form of triacylglycerols or ethyl esters. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides a rapid and quantitative tool to assess the quality of these products as specific normal modes, in particular the ester carbonyl stretch modes, exhibit characteristic spectral features for the two ester forms of omega-3 fatty acids. To uncover the origin of the observed spectra, in this work, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of EPA and DHA ethyl esters and triacylglycerols to characterize their conformation, packing, and dynamics in the liquid phase and use a mixed quantum/classical approach to calculate their IR absorption spectra in the ester carbonyl stretch region. We show that the ester liquids exhibit slow dynamics in spectral diffusion and translational and rotational motion, consistent with the diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy measurements. We further demonstrate that the predicted IR spectra are in good agreement with experiments and reveal how a competition between intermolecular and intramolecular interactions gives rise to distinct absorption peaks for the fatty acid esters.},

  abstract = {We consider depletion effects of a pear-shaped colloidal particle in a hard-sphere solvent for two different model realizations of the pear-shaped colloidal particle. The two models are the pear hard Gaussian overlap (PHGO) particles and the hard pears of revolution (HPR). The motivation for this study is to provide a microscopic understanding for the substantially different mesoscopic self-assembly properties of these pear-shaped colloids, in dense suspensions, that have been reported in the previous studies. This is done by determining their differing depletion attractions via Monte Carlo simulations of PHGO and HPR particles in a pool of hard spheres and comparing them with excluded volume calculations of numerically obtained ideal configurations on the microscopic level. While the HPR model behaves as predicted by the analysis of excluded volumes, the PHGO model showcases a preference for splay between neighboring particles, which can be attributed to the special non-additive characteristics of the PHGO contact function. Lastly, we propose a potentially experimentally realizable pear-shaped particle model, the non-additive hard pear of revolution model, which is based on the HPR model but also features non-additive traits similar to those of PHGO particles to mimic their depletion behavior.},

  abstract = {The role of particle shape in self-assembly processes is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, particle shape and particle elongation are often considered the most fundamental determinants of soft matter structure formation. On the other hand, structure formation is often highly sensitive to details of shape. Here, we address the question of particle shape sensitivity for the self-assembly of hard pear-shaped particles by studying two models for this system: (a) the pear hard Gaussian overlap (PHGO) and (b) the hard pears of revolution (HPR) model. Hard pear-shaped particles, given by the PHGO model, are known to form a bicontinuous gyroid phase spontaneously. However, this model does not replicate an additive object perfectly and, hence, varies slightly in shape from a “true” pear-shape. Therefore, we investigate in the first part of this series the stability of the gyroid phase in pear-shaped particle systems. We show, based on the HPR phase diagram, that the gyroid phase does not form in pears with such a “true” hard pear-shaped potential. Moreover, we acquire first indications from the HPR and PHGO pair-correlation functions that the formation of the gyroid is probably attributed to the small non-additive properties of the PHGO potential.},

We identify the consequences of the exchange interaction for the trion fine structure in tungsten-based monolayer materials from variational calculations and experimentally determine the resulting characteristic differences in their oscillator strength. It allows us to quantitatively extract trion populations from time-resolved photoluminescence measurements and monitor their dynamics after off-resonant optical injection. At liquid helium temperature, we observe a pronounced non-equilibrium distribution of the trions during their lifetime with comparatively slow equilibration that occurs on time-scales up to several hundreds of ps. In addition, we find an intriguing regime of population inversion at lowest excitation densities, which builds up and is maintained for tens of picoseconds. At a higher lattice temperature, the equilibrium is established more rapidly and the inversion disappears, highlighting the role of thermal activation for efficient scattering between exchange-split trions.},

We use quantum scattering methods to describe the direct reaction of methane on Ir(111) at high energy and rate theory to examine the indirect pathway at low energy. Overall, we find good agreement with the experiment with respect to the variation of sticking with the incident energy, surface temperature, and vibrational state. Compared with methane dissociation on other metals, vibrational excitation is found to be less effective at promoting the reaction, while coupling to the lattice motion is unusually strong. We show how step defects, even at low concentrations, can contribute significantly to indirect chemisorption. We explore indirect chemisorption on Ni(111) and Pt(111) and find that the indirect path can be important when relaxed lattice barriers are sufficiently low and the temperature is sufficiently high so that the indirect sticking is within detection limits and the incident energy is low enough so that the trapping is large and the direct component is small.},

Of special interest are the manifestations of the charged excitons, also known as trions, in the optical properties of two-dimensional semiconductors. In order to describe the optical response of such a system, the exciton interaction with resident electrons should be explicitly taken into account. In this paper, we demonstrate that this can be done in both the trion (essentially, few-particle) and Fermi-polaron (many-body) approaches, which produce equivalent results, provided that the electron density is sufficiently low and the trion binding energy is much smaller than the exciton one. Here, we consider the oscillator strengths of the optical transitions related to the charged excitons, fine structure of trions, and Zeeman effect, as well as photoluminescence of trions illustrating the applicability of both few-particle and many-body models.},

  abstract = {We present an accurate machine learning (ML) model for atomistic simulations of carbon, constructed using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) methodology. The potential, named GAP-20, describes the properties of the bulk crystalline and amorphous phases, crystal surfaces, and defect structures with an accuracy approaching that of direct ab initio simulation, but at a significantly reduced cost. We combine structural databases for amorphous carbon and graphene, which we extend substantially by adding suitable configurations, for example, for defects in graphene and other nanostructures. The final potential is fitted to reference data computed using the optB88-vdW density functional theory (DFT) functional. Dispersion interactions, which are crucial to describe multilayer carbonaceous materials, are therefore implicitly included. We additionally account for long-range dispersion interactions using a semianalytical two-body term and show that an improved model can be obtained through an optimization of the many-body smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor. We rigorously test the potential on lattice parameters, bond lengths, formation energies, and phonon dispersions of numerous carbon allotropes. We compare the formation energies of an extensive set of defect structures, surfaces, and surface reconstructions to DFT reference calculations. The present work demonstrates the ability to combine, in the same ML model, the previously attained flexibility required for amorphous carbon [V. L. Deringer and G. Csányi, Phys. Rev.

The force expressions were derived by a purely mechanical approach, which is exact and ensures the force balance on the control volumes arbitrarily set in the system, and are valid as long as the solid–liquid (SL) and solid–vapor (SV) interactions can be described by mean-fields. In addition, we revealed that the local forces around the bottom and top of the solid plate can be related to the SL and SV interfacial tensions γ SL and γ SV , and this was verified through the comparison with the SL and SV works of adhesion obtained by the thermodynamic integration (TI). From these results, it has been confirmed that γ SL and γ SV as well as the liquid–vapor interfacial tension γ LV can be extracted from a single equilibrium MD simulation without the computationally demanding calculation of the local stress distributions and the TI.},

We then perform numerical calculations on three model systems. We demonstrate that electronic polarization of the solvent alters the solvent reorganization energy in two different ways. The first is the reorganization of the equilibrium solvation structure through the modification of the solute–solvent interaction, and the second is the stabilization of the nonequilibrium solvent fluctuation through the electronic polarization. The former increases, whereas the latter decreases the reorganization energy. In our model calculations, the solvent reorganization energy is reduced because the latter makes a larger contribution than does the former.},

While the isotropic–isotropic demixing transition can be ruled out using the scaled particle theory, the first order isotropic–nematic and the nematic–nematic demixing transition can be stabilized with strong fractionation between the components. It is observed that the demixing tendency is strongest in small rectangle–large ellipse mixtures.

Here, we evaluate the structures and structural motifs present in small cationic ammonium and aminium bisulfate clusters that have been studied both experimentally and computationally as seeds for new particles. For several previously studied clusters, multiple different minimum-energy structures have been predicted. Vibrational spectra of mass-selected clusters and quantum chemical calculations allow us to assign the minimum-energy structure for the smallest cationic cluster of two ammonium ions and one bisulfate ion to a C S -symmetry structure that is persistent under amine substitution. We derive phenomenological vibrational frequency scaling factors for key bisulfate vibrations to aid in the comparison of experimental and computed spectra of larger clusters. Finally, we identify a previously unassigned spectral marker for intermolecular bisulfate–bisulfate hydrogen bonds and show that it is present in a class of structures that are all lower in energy than any previously reported structure. Tracking this marker suggests that this motif is prominent in larger clusters as well as ∼180 nm ammonium bisulfate particles. Taken together, these results establish a set of structural motifs responsible for binding of gases at the surface of growing clusters that fully explain the spectrum of large particles and provide benchmarks for efforts to improve structure predictions, which are critical for the accurate theoretical treatment of this process.},

Four classes of ionic liquids are considered: 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium, 1-alkyl-pyridinium, 1-alkylsulfonium, and N -methyl- N -alkylpyrrolidinium. The influence of linear alkyl chains of ethyl, butyl, hexyl, octyl, and decyl is examined on the favorable binding modes with FeP, considering two widely different conformations: tail up and tail down with respect to FeP. Electronic structure calculations are performed at the M06 level of theory with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for C, H, and N atoms, while the Lanl2DZ basis set is employed for Fe. Donor–acceptor interactions contributing to the binding of ionic liquids to FeP are unraveled through the natural bond orbital analysis. The results from this study indicate that the binding energies are dependent not only on the class of ionic liquids but also on the conformations presented to FeP. The propensity of FeP to acquire an electron is significantly enhanced in the presence of ionic liquid cations, irrespective of the type and the alkyl chain length.},

  abstract = {Thanks to their specific molecular symmetry, aromatic molecules and their derivatives represent ideal model systems in understanding photo-induced chemistry of small molecules. Herein, ultraviolet photodissociation dynamics of the 1-bromo-2,6-difluorobenzene molecule has been visualized via imaging the recoiling velocity distributions of photofragments. The measured recoiling angular distributions of the Br( 2 P 3/2 ) product vary significantly with the increasing photon energy, arguing against the simple bond-fission mechanism within the C 2v symmetry. Ab initio calculations reveal that in addition to the C–Br bond cleavage, two additional internal molecular coordinates that break the molecular symmetry are likely involved. The Br out-of-plane bending opens a direct dissociation pathway on the S 1 - 1 A″ (S 1 - 1 ππ * ) state, while the asymmetric C–F stretching significantly changes the orientation of the transition dipole moment. The present study sheds new light on the effect of symmetry breaking in the photodissociation dynamics of symmetric aryl halides, highlighting the multi-dimensional feature of excited state potential energy surfaces.},

These molecules were synthesized in a DC discharge from the reaction of scandium vapor, produced via laser ablation, with 13 CH 4 or 13 CH 4 / 12 CH 4 , diluted in argon. The N Ka,Kc = 1 0,1 → 0 0,0, 2 0,2 → 1 0,1, 3 0,3 → 2 0,2 , and 4 0,4 → 3 0,3 transitions in the frequency range of 14 GHz–61 GHz were observed for both species, each exhibiting hyperfine splittings due to the nuclear spins of 13 C ( I = 1/2) and/or Sc ( I = 7/2). These data have been analyzed with an asymmetric top Hamiltonian, and rotational, spin-rotation, and hyperfine parameters have been determined for Sc 13 C 2 and Sc 12 C 13 C. In addition, a quartic force field was calculated for ScC 2 and its isotopologues using a highly accurate coupled cluster-based composite method, incorporating complete basis set extrapolation, scalar relativistic corrections, outer core and inner core electron correlation, and higher-order valence correlation effects. The agreement between experimental and computed rotational constants, including the effective constant ( B + C ), is ∼0.5\% for all three isotopologues. This remarkable agreement suggests promise in predicting rotational spectra of new transition metal-carbon bearing molecules. In combination with previous work on Sc 12 C 2 , an accurate structure for ScC 2 has been established using combined experimental ( B , C ) and theoretical ( A ) rotational constants. The radical is cyclic (or T-shaped) with r (Sc–C) = 2.048(2) Å, r (C–C) = 1.272(2) Å, and ∠ (C–Sc–C) = 36.2(1)°. The experimental and theoretical results also suggest that ScC 2 contains a C 2 − moiety and is largely ionic.},

  abstract = {A fresh perspective on the interaction of electron and nuclear motions in photon induced dynamical processes can be provided by the coupling of photoelectron angular distributions and cation vibrational states in the photoionization of chiral molecules using circularly polarized radiation. The chiral contributions, manifesting as a forward–backward asymmetry in the photoemission, can be assessed using Photoelectron Circular Dichroism (PECD), which has revealed an enhanced vibrational influence exerted on the outgoing photoelectron. In this paper, we investigate the PECD of a rigid chiral monoterpene, 3-carene, using single-photon vacuum ultraviolet ionization by polarized synchrotron radiation and selecting energies from the ionization threshold up to 19.0 eV. By judicious choice of these photon energies, two factors that influence PECD asymmetry values, electron kinetic energy and ion vibrational level, can be effectively isolated, allowing a clear demonstration of the very marked vibrational effects. A slow photoelectron spectrum is used to examine the vibrational structure of the isolated outermost valence (HOMO) photoelectron band, and peak assignments are made with the aid of a Franck–Condon simulation. Together, these provide an estimate of the adiabatic ionization energy as 8.385 eV. The reported chiral asymmetry from the randomly oriented 3-carene enantiomers reaches a maximum of over 21\%. Theoretical PECD calculations, made both for the fixed equilibrium molecular geometry and also modeling selected normal mode vibration effects, are presented to provide further insight.},

One of their most promising applications is as light-switchable electron acceptor or donor units. Here, we investigate a previously unexplored process that we postulate may occur in such systems: an ultrafast electron transfer triggered by a simultaneous photoisomerization of the donor or the acceptor moiety. We propose a theoretical model for this phenomenon and, with the aid of density functional theory calculations, apply it to the case of a dihydropyrene-type photochromic molecular donor. By considering the wavepacket dynamics and the photoisomerization yield, we show that the two processes involved, electron transfer and photoisomerization, are in general inseparable and need to be treated in a unified manner. We finish by discussing how the efficiency of photoisomerization-coupled electron transfer can be controlled experimentally.},

Jung et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 244105 (2018)], providing a practical method for incorporating nuclear quantum effects in nonlinear spectroscopy of condensed-phase systems. We showcase the DKT approach in the simulation of the fifth-order two-dimensional (2D) Raman spectroscopy of Lennard-Jones liquids as a prototypical example, which involves nontrivial nonlinear spectroscopic observables of systems described by anharmonic potentials. Our results show that the DKT can faithfully reproduce the 2D Raman response of liquid xenon at high temperatures, where the system behaves classically. In contrast, liquid neon at low temperatures exhibits moderate but discernible nuclear quantum effects in the 2D Raman response compared to the responses obtained with classical molecular dynamics approaches. Thus, the DKT formalism in combination with RPMD simulations enables simulations of multidimensional optical spectroscopy of condensed-phase systems that partially account for nuclear quantum effects.},

Various types of local excitations, charge-transfer (CT) excitations, and exciton–phonon couplings are explicitly included in a comprehensive model Hamiltonian, which is parameterized by first-principles calculations. The absorption spectral simulations clarify that the two absorption bands in the Q-band region observed in experiments can be assigned to the contribution from the CT-mediated interactions, rather than the mixtures of different-type aggregates, as prevailingly assumed. Furthermore, the relative intensities of the two bands are found to be closely related to the intermolecular distance and molecular number in a ZnPc aggregate. From the investigation of the decoherence process after optical excitation, it is found that CT states can induce coherence regeneration as the time scale of charge separation is much faster than that of the vibration-induced decoherence. However, they would instead boost the decoherence process as the two time scales become comparable. The two different effects of CT states may suggest a novel way to regulate the decoherence process in excitation energy relaxation.},

  abstract = {Understanding the permeation of molecules through lipid membranes is fundamental for predicting the cellular uptake of solutes and drug delivery mechanisms. In molecular simulations, the usual approach is to compute the free energy (FE) profile of a molecule across a model lipid bilayer, which can then be used to estimate the permeability of the molecule. Umbrella Sampling (US), which involves carrying out a series of biased simulations along a defined reaction coordinate (usually the bilayer normal direction), is a popular method for the computation of such FE profiles. However, US can be challenging to implement because the results are dependent on the strength of the biasing potential and the spacing of windows along the reaction coordinate, which, in practice, are usually optimized by an inefficient trial and error approach. The Steered Molecular Dynamics implementation of the Jarzynski Equality (JE-SMD) has been identified as an alternative to equilibrium sampling methods for measuring the FE change across a reaction coordinate. In the JE-SMD approach, equilibrium FE values are evaluated from the average of rapid non-equilibrium trajectories, thus avoiding the practical issues that come with US. Here, we use three different corrections of the JE-SMD method to calculate the FE change for the translocation of two aromatic substrates, phenylalanine and toluene, across a lipid bilayer and compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of these approaches to the results obtained using US. We show evidence that when computing the free energy profile, the JE-SMD approach suffers from insufficient sampling convergence of the bilayer environment and is dependent on the characteristic of the aromatic substrate itself. We deduce that, despite its drawbacks, US remains the more viable approach of the two for computing the FE profile.},

Event-driven MD simulations are carried out for three model systems in which the initial temperatures and the ratios of diameter and mass of two components are different to study the temporal evolution of each component temperature in nanoscale molecular conditions mimicking those in living cells. On the other hand, the temperature changes of the two components are also described in terms of a mean-field kinetic theory with the correlation functions calculated in the Percus–Yevick approximation. The calculated results by both the computational approaches have shown fair agreement with each other, whereas slight deviations have been found in the temporal range of femto- to picoseconds when the initial temperatures of the two components are significantly different, such as 300 K vs 1000 K. This discrepancy can be ascribed to the fast intra-component temperature relaxation assumed in the kinetic theory, and its violation in the MD simulations can be evaluated in terms of the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the equilibrated Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at each temperature and the actual non-equilibrium velocity distribution realized in the MD. Thus, the present analysis provides a quantitative basis for addressing the temperature inhomogeneities experimentally observed in nanoscale crowding conditions.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the electronic stopping curve for swift ions, S e ( v ), particularly around the Bragg peak, is important for understanding radiation damage. Experimentally, however, the determination of such a feature for light ions is very challenging, especially in disordered systems such as liquid water and biological tissue. Recent developments in real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) have enabled the calculation of S e ( v ) along nm-sized trajectories. However, it is still a challenge to obtain a meaningful statistically averaged S e ( v ) that can be compared to observations. In this work, taking advantage of the correlation between the local electronic structure probed by the projectile and the distance from the projectile to the atoms in the target, we devise a trajectory pre-sampling scheme to select, geometrically, a small set of short trajectories to accelerate the convergence of the averaged S e ( v ) computed via rt-TDDFT. For protons in liquid water, we first calculate the reference probability distribution function (PDF) for the distance from the proton to the closest oxygen atom, ϕ R ( r p → O ), for a trajectory of a length similar to those sampled experimentally. Then, short trajectories are sequentially selected so that the accumulated PDF reproduces ϕ R ( r p → O ) to increasingly high accuracy. Using these pre-sampled trajectories, we demonstrate that the averaged S e ( v p ) converges in the whole velocity range with less than eight trajectories, while other averaging methods using randomly and uniformly distributed trajectories require approximately ten times the computational effort. This allows us to compare the S e ( v p ) curve to experimental data and assess widely used empirical tables based on Bragg’s rule.},

We first rewrite the orbital-dependent stress tensor for real-space DFT in terms of the density matrix, thereby making it amenable to O ( N ) methods. We then describe its evaluation within the O ( N ) infinite-cell Clenshaw–Curtis Spectral Quadrature (SQ) method, a technique that is applicable to metallic and insulating systems, is highly parallelizable, becomes increasingly efficient with increasing temperature, and provides results corresponding to the infinite crystal without the need of Brillouin zone integration. We demonstrate systematic convergence of the resulting formulation with respect to SQ parameters to exact diagonalization results and show convergence with respect to mesh size to the established plane wave results. We employ the new formulation to compute the viscosity of hydrogen at 10 6 K from Kohn–Sham quantum molecular dynamics, where we find agreement with previous more approximate orbital-free density functional methods.},

It is shown that pure-amplitude terms dominate in the near-zone when chromophores are close in proximity to one another (within a few nanometers), and phase cross terms dominate toward the far-zone when phase differences between different Feynman pathways begin to emerge. This can be understood in terms of physical attributes of the mediating photon, whose character becomes more real at long distances, coinciding with vanishing longitudinal components of the field, as transverse components begin to dominate.},

  abstract = {We present a pair natural orbital (PNO)-based implementation of CC3 excitation energies, which extends our previously published state-specific PNO ansatz for the solution of the excited state eigenvalue problem to methods including connected triple excitations. A thorough analysis of the equations for the excited state triples amplitudes is presented from which we derive a suitable state-specific triple natural orbital basis for the excited state triples amplitudes, which performs equally well for local and non-local excitations. The accuracy of the implementation is evaluated using a large and diverse test set. We find that for states with small contributions from double excitations, a T0 approximation to PNO-CC3 yields accurate results with a mean absolute error (MAE) for T PNO = 10 −7 in the range of 0.02 eV. However, for states with larger double excitation contributions, the T0 approximation is found to yield significantly less accurate results, while the Laplace-transformed variant of PNO-CC3 shows a uniform accuracy for singly and doubly excited states (MAE and maximum error of 0.01 eV and 0.07 eV for T PNO = 10 −7 , respectively). Finally, we apply PNO-CC3 to the calculation of the first excited state of berenil at a S 1 minimum geometry, which is shown to be close to a conical intersection. This calculation in the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set (more than 1300 basis functions) is the largest calculation ever performed with CC3 on excitation energies.},

  abstract = {To know how liquid matter moves through a crowded medium due to the action of a force constitutes currently a problem of great practical importance, present in cases as diverse as the transport of particles through a cell membrane and through a particulate porous medium. To calculate the mass flow through the system, we present an approach that emulates the texture of the medium by using entropic barriers that the particles must overcome in order to move. The model reproduces the scaling behavior of the velocity with the force found in many systems in order to show how the scaling exponent depends on the micro-structure of the medium. Our model offers a new perspective that is able to characterize the flow of matter through the medium and may be useful in studies of nano-fluids, oil recovery, soil drainage, tissue engineering, and drug delivery.},

A number of enhancements of the bare FCIQMC algorithm are available within NECI, allowing us to use a partially deterministic formulation of the algorithm, working in a spin-adapted basis or supporting transcorrelated Hamiltonians.

  abstract = {Transitions between different stable configurations of biomolecules are important in understanding disease mechanisms, structure–function relations, and novel molecular-scale engineering. The corresponding pathways can be characterized efficiently using geometry optimization schemes based on double-ended transition state searches. An interpolation is first constructed between the known states and then refined, yielding a band that contains transition state candidates. Here, we analyze an example where various interpolation schemes lead to bands with a single step transition, but the correct pathway actually proceeds via an intervening, low-energy minimum. We compare a number of different interpolation schemes for this problem. We systematically alter the number of discrete images in the interpolations and the spring constants used in the optimization and test two schemes for adjusting the spring constants and image distribution, resulting in a total of 2760 different connection attempts. Our results confirm that optimized bands are not necessarily a good description of the transition pathways in themselves, and further refinement to actually converge transition states and establish their connectivity is required. We see an improvement in the optimized bands if we employ the adjustment of spring constants with doubly-nudged elastic band and a smaller improvement from the image redistribution. The example we consider is representative of numerous cases we have encountered in a wide variety of molecular and condensed matter systems.},

The effective ionic diameters of the solvent-implicit simulation model are obtained by fits to experimental activity coefficient data. The experimental activity coefficients at high salt concentrations are only reproduced if the ion-specific concentration-dependent decrement of the dielectric constant is included. The dielectric-constant dependent contribution of the single-ion solvation free energy to the activity coefficient is significant and is included. To account for the ion-specific excess interfacial tension of salt solutions, in addition to non-ideal solution effects and the salt-concentration-dependent dielectric decrement, an ion-specific ion–interface interaction must be included. This ion–interface interaction, which acts in addition to the dielectric image-charge repulsion, is modeled as a box potential, is considerably more long-ranged than the ion radius, and is repulsive for all ions considered except iodide, in agreement with previous findings and arguments. By comparing different models that include or exclude bulk non-ideal solution behavior, dielectric decrement effects, and ion–interface interaction potentials, we demonstrate how bulk and interfacial ion-specific effects couple and partially compensate each other. Our MC simulations, which correctly include ionic correlations and interfacial dielectric image-charge repulsion, are used to determine effective ion–surface interaction potentials that can be used in a modified Poisson–Boltzmann theory.},

In this manner, the structural modeling for solid solutions is transferred to a minimization problem in the configuration space. Moreover, we strive to enhance the practicality of this approach. The approach and implementation are demonstrated by cross validations with the special quasi-random structure method. We apply the SAE method to the typical quinary CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy, continuous binary Ta–W alloy, and ternary CoCrNi medium-entropy alloy with SRO as prototypes. In combination with ab initio calculations, we investigate the structural properties and compare the calculation results with experiments.},

We then use the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics of the π -system in the allene radical cation ( ⁠ • CH 2 =C=CH 2 ) + as a simple model of a pump–control experiment. We start (pump) with a two-state superposition of two cationic states. The resulting electron dynamics corresponds to the rapid oscillation of the unpaired electron between the two terminal methylenes. This electron dynamics is, in turn, coupled to the torsional motion of the terminal methylenes. There is a conical intersection at 90° twist, where the electron dynamics collapses because the adiabatic states become degenerate. After passing the conical intersection, the electron dynamics revives. The IR pulse (control) in our simulations is timed to have its maximum at the conical intersection. Our simulations show that the effect of the (control) pulse is to change the electron dynamics at the conical intersection and, as a consequence, the concomitant nuclear dynamics, which is dominated by the change in the torsional angle.},

As photovoltaic and electronic devices rely on solid-state materials, having the ability to track the evolving dynamics during their charge transfer and transport processes is crucial. Following the structural dynamics in these solid-state materials will lead to the identification of specific chemical structures responsible for various photoinduced charge transfer reactions, leading to a greater understanding of the structure–function relationships needed to improve upon current technologies. Isolating the specific nuclear motions and molecular structures that drive a desired physical process will provide a chemical blueprint, leading to the rational design and fabrication of efficient electronic and photovoltaic devices.

  abstract = {Biopolymer self-assembly pathways are complicated by the ability of their monomeric subunits to adopt different conformational states. This means nucleation often involves a two-step mechanism where the monomers first condense to form a metastable intermediate, which then converts to a stable polymer by conformational rearrangement of constituent monomers. Nucleation intermediates play a causative role in amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. While existing mathematical models neglect the conversion dynamics, experiments show that conversion events frequently occur on comparable timescales to the condensation of intermediates and growth of mature polymers and thus cannot be ignored. We present a model that explicitly accounts for simultaneous assembly and conversion. To describe conversion, we propose an experimentally motivated initiation-propagation mechanism in which the stable phase arises locally within the intermediate and then spreads by nearest-neighbor interactions, in a manner analogous to one-dimensional Glauber dynamics. Our analysis shows that the competing timescales of assembly and conversion result in a nonequilibrium critical point, separating a regime where intermediates are kinetically unstable from one where conformationally mixed intermediates accumulate. This strongly affects the accumulation rate of the stable biopolymer phase. Our model is uniquely able to explain experimental phenomena such as the formation of mixed intermediates and abrupt changes in the scaling exponent γ , which relates the total monomer concentration to the accumulation rate of the stable phase. This provides a first step toward a general model of two-step biopolymer nucleation, which can quantitatively predict the concentration and composition of biologically crucial intermediates.},

  abstract = {We consider the general problem of describing the dynamics of subnetworks of larger biochemical reaction networks, e.g., protein interaction networks involving complex formation and dissociation reactions. We propose the use of model reduction strategies to understand the “extrinsic” sources of stochasticity arising from the rest of the network. Our approaches are based on subnetwork dynamical equations derived by projection methods and path integrals. The results provide a principled derivation of different components of the extrinsic noise that is observed experimentally in cellular biochemical reactions, over and above the intrinsic noise from the stochasticity of biochemical events in the subnetwork. We explore several intermediate approximations to assess systematically the relative importance of different extrinsic noise components, including initial transients, long-time plateaus, temporal correlations, multiplicative noise terms, and nonlinear noise propagation. The best approximations achieve excellent accuracy in quantitative tests on a simple protein network and on the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling network.},

  abstract = {Elemental red phosphorus (red P) is a new class of photocatalysts with a desirable bandgap of ∼1.7 eV and has a strong visible-light response. Here, we show that the efficiency of red P is limited by severe electron trapping at deep traps that are intrinsic to the different crystal facets of the red P. To overcome this, we synthesized the red P/RGO (reduced graphene oxide) composite in a one-step ampoule chemical vapor deposition synthesis that formed a conducive interface between the red P photocatalyst and the RGO acceptor for efficient interfacial charge transport. As substantiated through photoelectrochemical characterization and ultrafast (femtoseconds) transient absorption spectroscopy, the interfacing with RGO provided a rapid pathway for the photocharges in red P to be interfacially separated, thereby circumventing the slower the charge trapping process. As a result, up to a sevenfold increase in the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate (apparent quantum yield = 3.1\% at 650 nm) was obtained for the red P/RGO relative to the pristine red P.},

As classic semiconductors for water splitting, the solid state solution GaN:ZnO based photoanodes exhibit poor water splitting efficiency mainly limited by its light absorption. To overcome this bottleneck, here we report that phosphorus modification shifts the absorption edge of GaN:ZnO from 480 nm to the red end of 650 nm and also leads to one order of magnitude increase of the carrier concentration. Further, taking the surface phosphate groups as anchors, cobalt can be adsorbed, leading to the in situ formation of cobalt phosphate as a cocatalyst for water oxidation, which results in drastically improved photocurrent density and stability. This work highlights the significance of phosphorization treatment in extending the light harvest and changing the surface reaction kinetics for an efficient solar conversion process.},

  abstract = {Tantalum nitride (Ta 3 N 5 ) is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, while the Ta 3 N 5 /Ta photoanode synthesized via general thermal oxidation and nitridation on a Ta foil method usually has serious carrier recombination at the surface, which usually reduces the PEC activities. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient strategy of decorating pyridine, a small organic molecule at the surface of the Ta 3 N 5 /Ta photoanode, to alleviate the surface recombination. Such decoration yields a stable photocurrent density of 4.4 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V RHE under AM 1.5G (air mass 1.5 global, 100 mW cm −2 ) simulated sunlight, which is about 1.4 times higher than that of Ta 3 N 5 /Ta without modification, and the photocurrent density still remained ∼100\% of its original value after a 5 h stability test. Further characterization of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency and absorbed photon-to-current efficiency of the pyridine/Ta 3 N 5 /Ta photoanode showed a significant increase to 62\% and 72\% at 500 nm, respectively. The enhanced pyridine/Ta 3 N 5 /Ta PEC performance can be attributed to minimizing the density of nitrogen vacancies due to the passivation of pyridine grafting, which results in the decreased recombination centers and improved charge separation efficiency at the surface. We thus believe that our study of surface passivation by using small organic molecules provides an alternative to address the surface recombination of Ta 3 N 5 based photoelectrodes.},

Here, we present theoretical predictions based on classical theory for pressure and temperature thresholds ( p c and T c ) at which unstable growth occurs for the case of air nanobubbles on a solid surface in water. We show that bubbles subjected to pinning have much lower p c and higher T c compared to both unpinned and bulk bubbles of similar size, indicating that pinned bubbles can withstand a larger tensile stress (negative pressure) and higher temperatures. The values of p c and T c obtained from many-body dissipative particle dynamics simulations of quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) surface nanobubbles are consistent with the theoretical predictions, provided that the lateral expansion during growth is taken into account. This suggests that the modified classical thermodynamic description is valid for pinned bubbles as small as several nanometers. While some discrepancies still exist between our theoretical results and previous experiments, further experimental data are needed before a comprehensive understanding of the stability of surface nanobubbles can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Gamma-phase cesium lead tri-bromide perovskite nanocrystals (γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs) possess potentially photo-catalytic degradation ability and long-term stability. However, their serious aggregation issue decreases their active surface area, and the recombination of photo-generated hole–electron pairs weakens their photo-catalytic property. Furthermore, these NCs can be easily absorbed on the surface of dyes [e.g., methylene blue (MB)] or dissolved in the dye solution during the photo-catalytic degradation process, thus reducing the amount of γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs and their photo-catalytic degradation ability. Besides, the residual γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs in the photo-catalytic degradation products also present the toxicity issue (containing Pb) and are hazardous to the ecological environment and human health. In the present study, we fabricated γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs/polymethyl methacrylate electrospun nanofibrous membranes (γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs/PMMA ENMs) by using electrospinning technology to solve the above problems. It is found that the synthesized γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs/PMMA ENMs show a large surface area and the abundant functional groups on their surfaces, which are benefit for forming multiple kinds of chemical bonding effect between γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs and PMMA ENMs. In addition, γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs could disperse homogeneously in or on the surface of PMMA ENMs. These abundant chemical bonds and homogeneous distributions of γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs on the surface of PMMA ENMs can significantly decrease the recombination of photo-generated hole–electron pairs and toxicity issue of γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs during the photo-catalytic degradation process. Exhilaratingly, γ-CsPbBr 3 NCs/PMMA ENMs could maintain a superior photo-catalytic degradation ability toward various dyes and reveal a high photo-catalytic degradation efficiency of 99.18\% in 60 min for MB.},

  abstract = {When layers of van der Waals materials are deposited via exfoliation or viscoelastic stamping, nanobubbles are sometimes created from aggregated trapped fluids. Though they can be considered a nuisance, nanobubbles have attracted scientific interest in their own right owing to their ability to generate large in-plane strain gradients that lead to rich optoelectronic phenomena, especially in the semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Determination of the strain within the nanobubbles, which is crucial to understanding these effects, can be approximated using elasticity theory. However, the Föppl–von Kármán equations that describe strain in a distorted thin plate are highly nonlinear and often necessitate assuming circular symmetry to achieve an analytical solution. Here, we present an easily implemented numerical method to solve for strain tensors of nanobubbles with arbitrary symmetry in 2D crystals. The method only requires topographic information from atomic force microscopy and the Poisson ratio of the 2D material. We verify that this method reproduces the strain for circularly symmetric nanobubbles that have known analytical solutions. Finally, we use the method to reproduce the Grüneisen parameter of the E′ mode for 1L-WS 2 nanobubbles on template-stripped Au by comparing the derived strain with measured Raman shifts from tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, demonstrating the utility of our method for estimating localized strain in 2D crystals.},

Herein, we prepared amorphous LaNiO x and crystalline La-doped NiO (c-LaNiO x ) cocatalysts through photochemical decomposition and ion-exchange of Ni(OH) 2 precipitation, respectively. Both lanthanum nickel oxides (LaNiO x ) showed considerable improvement of hematite photoanodes. By using electrochemical impedance measurements, we confirmed that the catalyst could store photogenerated charges with reduced transfer resistance and passivate the surface state, resulting in the overall charge transfer rate enhancement. This study may lead to a chance to uncover the kinetic bottleneck with an efficient cocatalyst in well-controlled crystallinity in the future.},

We analyze diffusivity and viscosity data by means of the rotational relaxation time and Arrhenius equation. Rotational relaxation times are calculated explicitly from the ether chain’s end-to-end vectors, and self-diffusion values are calculated from the mean square displacement. We find an increase in orientational alignment as temperature drops in both models and consistent differences in activation energies across the models and experiment. A clear relationship is observed between viscosity, rotational relaxation time, and diffusion time.

In this work, we evaluate the vapor pressure of a scaled-charge sodium chloride (NaCl) force field and compare the results against experiments and a non-polarizable full-charge force field. The scaled-charge force field predicts a higher vapor pressure than found in experiments, due to its overprediction of the liquid-phase chemical potential. Reanalyzing the trajectories generated from the scaled-charge model with full charges improves the estimation of the liquid-phase chemical potential but not the vapor pressure.},

  abstract = {The predissociation threshold of VO has been measured using resonant three-photon ionization (R3PI) spectroscopy. Given the high density of electronic states in the molecule, it is argued that the molecule dissociates rapidly as soon as the thermochemical bond dissociation energy (BDE) is exceeded, allowing the measured predissociation threshold to be assigned as the BDE. This is the first time a BDE has been measured using the R3PI method. The first photon is provided by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser that promotes VO into a high-energy, discrete vibronic state. A tunable dye laser then excites the molecule further to a resonant state close to the dissociation limit where there is a quasi-continuum of states. A second photon from the same dye laser pulse ionizes the molecule, generating VO + ions. The dye laser is then scanned to higher energies, and when the energy of one OPO photon plus one dye photon exceeds the BDE, the molecule dissociates before another dye photon can be absorbed to induce ionization. The combined photon energy at the sharp drop in the ion signal is assigned as the BDE. The experiment has been repeated using four different intermediate states, all yielding the same BDE, D 0 (VO) = 6.545(2) eV. Using thermochemical cycles, a revised value for the BDE of cationic VO is obtained, D 0 (V + –O) = 6.053(2) eV. The 0 K enthalpy of formation for VO(g) is also derived as Δ f H 0 K 0 VO ( g ) = 128.6(1.0) kJ mol −1 . Previous spectroscopic and thermochemical studies of VO are reviewed.},

The code to generate the molecular graphs and compute the descriptors is available at https://github.com/exalearn/molecular-graph-descriptors , and the graphs are available alongside the original database at https://sites.uw.edu/wdbase/ . A Continuous-Filter Convolutional Neural Network (CF-CNN) was trained on a subset of 500 000 networks to predict the potential energy, yielding a mean absolute error of 0.002 ± 0.002 kcal/mol per water molecule. Clusters of sizes not included in the training set exhibited errors of the same magnitude, indicating that the CF-CNN protocol accurately predicts energies of networks for both smaller and larger sizes than those used during training. The graph-theoretical descriptors were further employed to interpret the predictive power of the CF-CNN. Topological measures, such as the Wiener index, the average shortest path length, and the similarity index, suggested that all networks from the test set were within the range of values as the ones from the training set. The graph analysis suggests that larger errors appear when the mean degree and the number of polygons in the cluster lie further from the mean of the training set. This indicates that the structural space, and not just the chemical space, is an important factor to consider when designing training sets, as predictive errors can result when the structural composition is sufficiently different from the bulk of those in the training set. To this end, the developed descriptors are quite effective in explaining the results of the CF-CNN (a.k.a. the “black box”) model.},

The excitation cross sections of the metastable state C 3 Π u of N 2 show the maxima at the electron-impact energies 14.10 (ν′ = 0) eV and 14.50 (ν′ = 1) eV, which are potentially related to the core-excited vibrational Feshbach resonant state 2 Σ u + of N 2 − formed by electron attachment. The absolute cross sections of b 3 Σ + (ν′ = 0) → a 3 Π (ν″ = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) of CO are given by the calibrations with those of N 2 measured in this work. Besides the maximum excitation cross section 5.85 × 10 −18 cm 2 at 10.74 eV of the CO b 3 Σ + (ν′ = 0) state, some fine structures on the excitation function profile are attributed to different shapes and Feshbach resonant states of CO − formed by electron attachment, while the others arise from the direct electron-impact excitation. Some discrepancies, particularly for N 2 , between the present data and the results available in the literature studies arise from different experimental techniques and data-processing procedures. Furthermore, contributions of physical processes such as wave-packet evolution and non-Franck–Condon dynamics are highlighted here.},

  abstract = {The problem of flickering trajectories in standard kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations prohibits sampling of the transition path ensembles (TPEs) on Markovian networks representing many slow dynamical processes of interest. In the present contribution, we overcome this problem using knowledge of the metastable macrostates, determined by an unsupervised community detection algorithm, to perform enhanced sampling kMC simulations. We implement two accelerated kMC methods to simulate the nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics on arbitrary Markovian networks, namely, weighted ensemble (WE) sampling and kinetic path sampling (kPS). WE-kMC utilizes resampling in pathway space to maintain an ensemble of representative trajectories covering the state space, and kPS utilizes graph transformation to simplify the description of an escape trajectory from a trapping energy basin. Both methods sample individual trajectories governed by the linear master equation with the correct statistical frequency. We demonstrate that they allow for efficient estimation of the time-dependent occupation probability distributions for the metastable macrostates, and of TPE statistics, such as committor functions and first passage time distributions. kPS is particularly attractive, since its efficiency is essentially independent of the degree of metastability, and we suggest how the algorithm could be coupled with other enhanced sampling methodologies. We illustrate our approach with results for a network representing the folding transition of a tryptophan zipper peptide, which exhibits a separation of characteristic timescales. We highlight some salient features of the dynamics, most notably, strong deviations from two-state behavior, and the existence of multiple competing mechanisms.},

Our approach is based upon the latest version of the popular Martini CG model to which explicit proton mimicking particles are added. We verify our approach against experimental data involving several different molecules and different environmental conditions. In particular, we compute titration curves, pH dependent free energies of transfer, and lipid bilayer membrane affinities as a function of pH. Using oleic acid as an example compound, we further illustrate that our method can be used to study passive translocation in lipid bilayers via protonation. Finally, our model reproduces qualitatively the expansion of the macromolecule dendrimer poly(propylene imine) as well as the associated pKa shift of its different generations. This example demonstrates that our model is able to pick up collective interactions between titratable sites in large molecules comprising many titratable functional groups.},

  abstract = {First-principles electronic structure calculations are now accessible to a very large community of users across many disciplines, thanks to many successful software packages, some of which are described in this special issue. The traditional coding paradigm for such packages is monolithic , i.e., regardless of how modular its internal structure may be, the code is built independently from others, essentially from the compiler up, possibly with the exception of linear-algebra and message-passing libraries. This model has endured and been quite successful for decades. The successful evolution of the electronic structure methodology itself, however, has resulted in an increasing complexity and an ever longer list of features expected within all software packages, which implies a growing amount of replication between different packages, not only in the initial coding but, more importantly, every time a code needs to be re-engineered to adapt to the evolution of computer hardware architecture. The Electronic Structure Library (ESL) was initiated by CECAM (the European Centre for Atomic and Molecular Calculations) to catalyze a paradigm shift away from the monolithic model and promote modularization, with the ambition to extract common tasks from electronic structure codes and redesign them as open-source libraries available to everybody. Such libraries include “heavy-duty” ones that have the potential for a high degree of parallelization and adaptation to novel hardware within them , thereby separating the sophisticated computer science aspects of performance optimization and re-engineering from the computational science done by, e.g., physicists and chemists when implementing new ideas. We envisage that this modular paradigm will improve overall coding efficiency and enable specialists (whether they be computer scientists or computational scientists) to use their skills more effectively and will lead to a more dynamic evolution of software in the community as well as lower barriers to entry for new developers. The model comes with new challenges, though. The building and compilation of a code based on many interdependent libraries (and their versions) is a much more complex task than that of a code delivered in a single self-contained package. Here, we describe the state of the ESL, the different libraries it now contains, the short- and mid-term plans for further libraries, and the way the new challenges are faced. The ESL is a community initiative into which several pre-existing codes and their developers have contributed with their software and efforts, from which several codes are already benefiting, and which remains open to the community.},

  abstract = {Translational diffusion coefficients are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. Linear fits to mean squared displacement (MSD) curves have become the de facto standard, from simple liquids to complex biomacromolecules. Nonlinearities in MSD curves at short times are handled with a wide variety of ad hoc practices, such as partial and piece-wise fitting of the data. Here, we present a rigorous framework to obtain reliable estimates of the self-diffusion coefficient and its statistical uncertainty. We also assess in a quantitative manner if the observed dynamics is, indeed, diffusive. By accounting for correlations between MSD values at different times, we reduce the statistical uncertainty of the estimator and, thereby, increase its efficiency. With a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we check for possible anomalous diffusion. We provide an easy-to-use Python data analysis script for the estimation of self-diffusion coefficients. As an illustration, we apply the formalism to molecular dynamics simulation data of pure TIP4P-D water and a single ubiquitin protein. In another paper [S. von Bülow, J. T. Bullerjahn, and G. Hummer, J. Chem. Phys. 153 , 021101 (2020)], we demonstrate its ability to recognize deviations from regular diffusion caused by systematic errors in a common trajectory “unwrapping” scheme that is implemented in popular simulation and visualization software.},

The rotational symmetry of the plane–sphere and sphere–sphere geometries can be exploited by means of a discrete Fourier transform. The new technique is applied to a study of the interaction between a colloid particle made of polystyrene or mercury and another polystyrene sphere or a polystyrene wall in an aqueous solution. Special attention is paid to the influence of screening caused by a variable salt concentration in the medium. It is found that, in particular for low salt concentrations, the error implied by the proximity force approximation is larger than usually assumed. For a mercury droplet, a repulsive interaction is found for sufficiently large distances, provided that screening is negligible. We emphasize that the effective Hamaker parameter depends significantly on the scattering geometry on which it is based.},

  abstract = {X-ray processes involve interactions with high-energy photons. For these short wavelengths, the perturbing field cannot be treated as constant, and there is a need to go beyond the electric-dipole approximation. The exact semi-classical light–matter interaction operator offers several advantages compared to the multipole expansion such as improved stability and ease of implementation. Here, the exact operator is used to model x-ray scattering in metal K pre-edges. This is a relativistic two-photon process where absorption is dominated by electric-dipole forbidden transitions. With the restricted active space state-interaction approach, spectra can be calculated even for the multiconfigurational wavefunctions including second-order perturbation. However, as the operator itself depends on the transition energy, the cost for evaluating integrals for hundreds of thousands unique transitions becomes a bottleneck. Here, this is solved by calculating the integrals in a molecular-orbital basis that only runs over the active space, combined with a grouping scheme where the operator is the same for close-lying transitions. This speeds up the calculations of single-photon processes and is critical for the modeling of two-photon scattering processes. The new scheme is used to model K α resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of iron–porphyrin complexes with relevance to studies of heme enzymes, for which the total computational time is reduced by several orders of magnitude with an effect on transition intensities of 0.1\% or less.},

  abstract = {The molecular dipole moment ( μ ) is a central quantity in chemistry. It is essential in predicting infrared and sum-frequency generation spectra as well as induction and long-range electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, it can be extracted directly—via the ground state electron density—from high-level quantum mechanical calculations, making it an ideal target for machine learning (ML). In this work, we choose to represent this quantity with a physically inspired ML model that captures two distinct physical effects: local atomic polarization is captured within the symmetry-adapted Gaussian process regression framework which assigns a (vector) dipole moment to each atom, while the movement of charge across the entire molecule is captured by assigning a partial (scalar) charge to each atom. The resulting “MuML” models are fitted together to reproduce molecular μ computed using high-level coupled-cluster theory and density functional theory (DFT) on the QM7b dataset, achieving more accurate results due to the physics-based combination of these complementary terms. The combined model shows excellent transferability when applied to a showcase dataset of larger and more complex molecules, approaching the accuracy of DFT at a small fraction of the computational cost. We also demonstrate that the uncertainty in the predictions can be estimated reliably using a calibrated committee model. The ultimate performance of the models—and the optimal weighting of their combination—depends, however, on the details of the system at hand, with the scalar model being clearly superior when describing large molecules whose dipole is almost entirely generated by charge separation. These observations point to the importance of simultaneously accounting for the local and non-local effects that contribute to μ ; furthermore, they define a challenging task to benchmark future models, particularly those aimed at the description of condensed phases.},

Due to the simple analytical form, GB models are widely used in molecular dynamics simulations to account for (implicit) solvation effects. In this work, we extend the application of the GB model to polarizable charges by coupling it to the bond capacity (BC) model. The resulting BC–GB model is a non-variational polarization model where the reaction potential is calculated from a GB expression and included in the polarization equation to account for solvation effects. Being non-variational, the BC–GB makes use of a Lagrange formulation for an efficient evaluation of energy gradients. The stability of the algorithm in molecular dynamics simulations is tested in the microcanonical ensemble, and the results show energy conservation as well as small fluctuations. The inclusion of implicit solvation increases the computational cost by only 15\% compared to vacuum. Combined with a significant reduction in system size by describing the solvent as a continuum makes the BC–GB model an interesting model for applications requiring the combination of solute polarization and extensive conformational space sampling.},

  abstract = {The study of photochemical reaction dynamics requires accurate as well as computationally efficient electronic structure methods for the ground and excited states. While time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is not able to capture static correlation, complete active space self-consistent field methods neglect much of the dynamic correlation. Hence, inexpensive methods that encompass both static and dynamic electron correlation effects are of high interest. Here, we revisit hole–hole Tamm–Dancoff approximated ( hh -TDA) density functional theory for this purpose. The hh -TDA method is the hole–hole counterpart to the more established particle–particle TDA ( pp -TDA) method, both of which are derived from the particle–particle random phase approximation ( pp -RPA). In hh -TDA, the N -electron electronic states are obtained through double annihilations starting from a doubly anionic ( N +2 electron) reference state. In this way, hh -TDA treats ground and excited states on equal footing, thus allowing for conical intersections to be correctly described. The treatment of dynamic correlation is introduced through the use of commonly employed density functional approximations to the exchange-correlation potential. We show that hh -TDA is a promising candidate to efficiently treat the photochemistry of organic and biochemical systems that involve several low-lying excited states—particularly those with both low-lying ππ * and n π * states where inclusion of dynamic correlation is essential to describe the relative energetics. In contrast to the existing literature on pp -TDA and pp -RPA, we employ a functional-dependent choice for the response kernel in pp - and hh -TDA, which closely resembles the response kernels occurring in linear response and collinear spin-flip TDDFT.},

Approximately, 6600 energies and their associated gradients are obtained from direct-dynamics calculations using DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d) supplemented by grid calculations spanning an energy range up to roughly 35 000 cm −1 . Three fragmentation schemes are investigated with respect to efficiency and fit precision. In addition, several fits are done with reduced weight for gradient data relative to energies. These do result in more precision for the H-transfer barrier height. The properties of the fits such as stationary points, harmonic frequencies, and the barrier to H-atom transfer are reported and compared to direct calculations. A previous 1D model is used to obtain the tunneling splitting for the ground vibrational state and qualitative predictions for excited vibrational states. This model is applied to numerous fits with different barrier heights and then used to extrapolate the H and D atom tunneling splittings to values at the CCSD(T)-F12 barrier. The extrapolated values are 2.3 and 0.14 cm −1 , respectively for H and D. These are about a factor of two larger than experiment, but within the expected level of agreement with experiment for the 1D method used and the level of the electronic structure theory.},

  abstract = {A state-specific multireference coupled-cluster (MRCC) method based on Arponen’s bivariational principle is presented, the bivar-MRCC method. The method is based on single-reference theory and therefore has a relatively straightforward formulation and modest computational complexity. The main difference from established methods is the bivariational formulation, in which independent parameterizations of the wave function (ket) and its complex conjugate (bra) are made. Importantly, this allows manifest multiplicative separability of the state (exact in the extended bivar-MRECC version of the method and approximate otherwise), and additive separability of the energy, while preserving polynomial scaling of the working equations. A feature of the bivariational principle is that the formal bra and ket references can be included as bivariational parameters, which eliminates much of the bias toward the formal reference. A pilot implementation is described, and extensive benchmark calculations on several standard problems are performed. The results from the bivar-MRCC method are comparable to established state-specific multireference methods. Considering the relative affordability of the bivar-MRCC method, it may become a practical tool for non-experts.},

Patoz et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 9 , 2367 (2018)], which accounts for anharmonicity, mode–mode coupling, and Herzberg–Teller effects. Here, we generalize this method in order to evaluate spectra at non-zero temperature. In line with thermo-field dynamics, we transform the von Neumann evolution of the coherence component of the density matrix to the Schrödinger evolution of a wavefunction in an augmented space with twice as many degrees of freedom. Due to the efficiency of the extended thawed Gaussian approximation, this increase in the number of coordinates results in nearly no additional computational cost. More specifically, compared to the original, zero-temperature approach, the finite-temperature method requires no additional ab initio electronic structure calculations. At the same time, the new approach allows for a clear distinction among finite-temperature, anharmonicity, and Herzberg–Teller effects on spectra. We show, on a model Morse system, the advantages of the finite-temperature thawed Gaussian approximation over the commonly used global harmonic methods and apply it to evaluate the symmetry-forbidden absorption spectrum of benzene, where all of the aforementioned effects contribute.},

However, modeling the entire structure and full dimensionality of an interface can be computationally demanding. In this study, we investigate the validity of an efficient reduced one-dimensional Hamiltonian for calculating charge transport along interfaces by comparing to a two-dimensional model that accounts for additional charge transport pathways. We find that the one-dimensional model successfully predicts the qualitative trend of charge transmission probability among Pt/Fe 2 O 3 and Ag/Fe 2 O 3 interfaces. However, the two-dimensional model provides additional information on possible pathways that are not perpendicular to the interface direction. These charge transport pathways are directed along the lowest potential energy profile of the interface that correlates with the crystal structure of the constituting materials. However, the two-dimensional paths are longer and take more scattering time. Therefore, the one-dimensional model may hold sufficient information for qualitative estimation of charge transport through some material interfaces.},

  abstract = {It is well established that extrapolating the coupled-cluster single double triple [CCSD and (T)] correlation energies using empirically motivated extrapolation exponents can accelerate the basis set convergence. Here, we consider the extrapolation of coupled-cluster expansion terms beyond the CCSD(T) level to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. We obtain reference CCSDT–CCSD(T) [T 3 –(T)], CCSDT(Q)–CCSDT [(Q)], and CCSDTQ–CCSDT(Q) [T 4 –(Q)] contributions from cc-pV{5,6}Z extrapolations for a diverse set of 16 first- and second-row systems. We use these basis-set limit results to fit extrapolation exponents in conjunction with the cc-pV{D,T}Z, cc-pV{T,Q}Z, and cc-pV{Q,5}Z basis set pairs. The optimal extrapolation exponents result in noticeable improvements in performance (relative to α = 3.0) in conjunction with the cc-pV{T,Q}Z basis set pair; however, smaller improvements are obtained for the other basis sets. These results confirm that the basis sets and basis set extrapolations used for obtaining post-CCSD(T) components in composite thermochemical theories such as Weizmann-4 and HEAT are sufficiently close to the CBS limit for attaining sub-kJ/mole accuracy. The fitted extrapolation exponents demonstrate that the T 3 –(T) correlation component converges more slowly to the CBS limit than the (Q) and T 4 terms. A systematic investigation of the effect of diffuse functions shows that it diminishes (i) in the order T 3 –(T) &gt; (Q) &gt; T 4 –(Q) and (ii) with the size of the basis set. Importantly, we find that diffuse functions tend to systematically reduce the T 3 –(T) contribution but systematically increases the (Q) contribution. Thus, the use of the cc-pV n Z basis sets benefits from a certain degree of error cancellation between these two components.},

We start by introducing the formalism of the new velocity jump molecular dynamics, ergodic with respect to the canonical measure. We then introduce the new BOUNCE integrator that allows for long-range forces to be evaluated at random and optimal time steps, leading to strong savings in direct space. The accuracy and computational performances of a first BOUNCE implementation dedicated to classical (non-polarizable) force fields are tested in the cases of pure direct-space droplet-like simulations and of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) simulations using Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method. An analysis of the capability of BOUNCE to reproduce several condensed-phase properties is provided. Since electrostatics and van der Waals two-body contributions are evaluated much less often than with standard integrators using a 1 fs time step, up to a 400\% direct-space acceleration is observed. Applying the reversible reference system propagator algorithms [RESPA(1)] to reciprocal-space (many-body) interactions allows BOUNCE-RESPA(1) to maintain large speedups in PBC while maintaining precision. Overall, we show that replacing the BAOAB standard Langevin integrator by the BOUNCE adaptive framework preserves a similar accuracy and leads to significant computational savings.},

Ion-pair formation states of Σ g − 3 and 3 Π g symmetry are accessed through predissociation of optically dark continuum Rydberg states converging to the B Σ g − 2 ionic state, which are resonantly populated via a mixture of both parallel–parallel and parallel–perpendicular two-photon transitions. This mixture is evident in the angular distribution of the dissociation relative to the light polarization and varies with the kinetic energy release (KER) of the fragmenting ion pair. The KER-dependent photoion angular distribution reveals the underlying two-photon absorption dynamics involved in the ion-pair production mechanism and indicates the existence of two nearly degenerate continuum resonances possessing different symmetries, which can decay by coupling to ion-pair states of the same total symmetry through internal conversion.},

Improper accounting for box-volume fluctuations creates, at long times, unphysical trajectories and, in turn, grossly exaggerated diffusion coefficients. We propose an alternative unwrapping scheme that resolves this issue. At each time step, we add the minimal displacement vector according to periodic boundary conditions for the instantaneous box geometry. Here and in another paper [J. T.

  abstract = {An open quantum system refers to a system that is further coupled to a bath system consisting of surrounding radiation fields, atoms, molecules, or proteins. The bath system is typically modeled by an infinite number of harmonic oscillators. This system–bath model can describe the time-irreversible dynamics through which the system evolves toward a thermal equilibrium state at finite temperature. In nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic spectroscopy, dynamics can be studied easily by using simple quantum master equations under the assumption that the system–bath interaction is weak (perturbative approximation) and the bath fluctuations are very fast (Markovian approximation). However, such approximations cannot be applied in chemical physics and biochemical physics problems, where environmental materials are complex and strongly coupled with environments. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) can describe the numerically “exact” dynamics of a reduced system under nonperturbative and non-Markovian system–bath interactions, which has been verified on the basis of exact analytical solutions (non-Markovian tests) with any desired numerical accuracy. The HEOM theory has been used to treat systems of practical interest, in particular, to account for various linear and nonlinear spectra in molecular and solid state materials, to evaluate charge and exciton transfer rates in biological systems, to simulate resonant tunneling and quantum ratchet processes in nanodevices, and to explore quantum entanglement states in quantum information theories. This article presents an overview of the HEOM theory, focusing on its theoretical background and applications, to help further the development of the study of open quantum dynamics.},

  abstract = {Suspensions of chemically powered self-propelled colloidal particles are examples of active matter systems with interesting properties. While simple spherical Janus particles are often studied, it is known that geometry is important and recent experiments have shown that chemically active torus-shaped colloids behave differently from spherical colloids. In this paper, coarse-grained microscopic simulations of the dynamics of self-diffusiophoretic torus colloids are carried out in bulk solution in order to study how torus geometric factors influence their active motion. The concentration and velocity fields are key ingredients in self-diffusiophoretic propulsion, and the forms that these fields take in the colloid vicinity are shown to be strong functions of torus geometric parameters such as the torus hole size and thickness of the torus tube. This work utilizes a method where self-diffusiophoretic torus colloids with various geometric and dynamical characteristics can be built and studied in fluid media that include chemical reactions and fluid flows. The model can be used to investigate the collective properties of these colloids and their dynamics in confined systems, topics that are of general importance for applications that use colloidal motors with complex geometries.},

  abstract = {Capillary bridges can form between colloids immersed in a two-phase fluid, e.g., in a binary liquid mixture, if the surface of the colloids prefers the species other than the one favored in the bulk liquid. Here, we study the formation of liquid bridges induced by confining colloids to a slit, with the slit walls having a preference opposite to the one of the colloid surface. Using mean field theory, we show that there is a line of first-order phase transitions between the bridge and the no-bridge states, which ends at a critical point. By decreasing the slit width, this critical point is shifted toward smaller separations between the colloids. However, at very small separations and far from criticality, we observe only a minor influence of the slit width on the location of the transition. Monte Carlo simulations of the Ising model, which mimics incompressible binary liquid mixtures, confirm the occurrence of the bridging transitions, as manifested by the appearance of “spinodal” regions where both bridge and no-bridge configurations are stable or metastable. Interestingly, we find that there is no such spinodal region in the case of small colloids, but we observe a sharpening of the transition when the colloid size increases. In addition, we demonstrate that the capillary force acting between the colloids can depend sensitively on the slit width and varies drastically with temperature, thus achieving strengths orders of magnitude higher than at criticality of the fluid.},

Their compositional, structural, and functional properties were assessed using high-throughput characterization methods. Prior to the investigation of the quaternary system Cu–Fe–V–O, the compositions (Fe 61 V 39 )O x and (Cu 52 V 48 )O x with promising photoactivity were identified from their ternary subsystems Fe–V–O and Cu–V–O, respectively.

Seven mixed ternary and quaternary phase regions were identified: I (α-Cu 3 FeV 6 O 26 /FeVO 4 ), II (Cu 5 V 2 O 10 /FeVO 4 /α-Cu 3 Fe 4 V 6 O 26 ), III (Cu 5 V 2 O 10 ), IV (Cu 5 V 2 O 10 /FeVO 4 , V (FeVO 4 /γ-Cu 2 V 2 O 7 /α-Cu 3 Fe 4 V 6 O 26 ), VI (β-Cu 2 V 2 O 7 /α-Cu 3 Fe 4 V 6 O 26 /FeVO 4 ), and VII (β-Cu 3 Fe 4 V 6 O 26 /FeVO 4 ). In the investigated composition range, two photoactive regions, (Cu 53 Fe 7 V 40 )O x and (Cu 45 Fe 21 V 34 )O x , were identified, exhibiting 103 μ A/cm 2 and 108 μ A/cm 2 photocurrent density for the oxygen evolution reaction at 1.63 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. The highest photoactive region (Cu 45 Fe 21 V 34 )O x comprises the dominant α-Cu 3 Fe 4 V 6 O 24 phase and minor FeVO 4 phase. This photoactive region corresponds to having an indirect bandgap of 1.87 eV and a direct bandgap of 2.58 eV with an incident photon-to-current efficiency of 30\% at a wavelength of 310 nm.},

In this method, CsI and PbI 2 were first deposited via thermal evaporation, and then FAI/FABr mixed solution was sprayed on the CsI/PbI 2 substrate to form the Cs x FA 1−x PbI y Br 3−y film. As confirmed by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, a perovskite film with full surface coverage and small surface roughness was obtained. Then, the effect of interface modification materials on the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was investigated: the devices with the [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) interlayer incorporated via vacuum evaporation deposition between SnO 2 and perovskite showed remarkably higher performance than those with the C 60 interlayer, which was attributed to enhanced charge extraction and reduced recombination at the SnO 2 /PCBM/perovskite interface. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.21\% was obtained for the 0.16 cm 2 device. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest efficiency of Cs x FA 1−x PbI y Br 3−y based PSCs fabricated by the spray technique. Furthermore, we fabricated mini-modules with the size of 5 × 5 cm 2 and achieved a PCE of 14.7\%.},

Here, the interaction of hydrogen with actinide dioxide (AnO 2 , An = U, Np, or Pu) (011) surfaces by Hubbard corrected density functional theory (PBEsol+U) has been studied, including spin–orbit interactions and non-collinear 3k anti-ferromagnetic behavior. The actinide dioxides crystalize in the fluorite-type structure, and although the (111) surface dominates the crystal morphology, the (011) surface energetics may lead to more significant interaction with hydrogen. The dissociative adsorption of hydrogen on the UO 2 (0.44 eV), NpO 2 (−0.47 eV), and PuO 2 (−1.71 eV) (011) surfaces has been calculated. It is found that hydrogen dissociates on the PuO 2 (011) surface; however, UO 2 (011) and NpO 2 (011) surfaces are relatively inert. Recombination of hydrogen ions is likely to occur on the UO 2 (011) and NpO 2 (011) surfaces, whereas hydroxide formation is shown to occur on the PuO 2 (011) surface, which distorts the surface structure.},

Brown and S. Rundqvist, Acta Cryst. 19 , 684 (1965)]. Although the lattice parameters exhibited an anisotropic compressibility, the covalent P1–P2 and P1–P3 bond lengths were almost independent of pressure and only the P3–P1–P2 bond angle was reduced significantly. On the basis of our results, the significant discrepancy in the bond length reported by Cartz et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 71 , 1718 (1979)] has been resolved.

Through forming the mixed-anion Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 alloys, the bandgaps and lattice parameters can be tuned and a band structure engineering design of semiconductor heterostructures becomes possible. However, the properties of the disordered Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 alloys are currently not clear. Using first-principles calculations, we show that the alloys are highly miscible with low formation enthalpies, so composition-variable and uniform alloys can be fabricated under room temperature. The bandgaps of the alloys change almost linearly as the alloy composition (S/Se ratio) varies, indicating that the bandgap engineering can be quite flexible. The calculations of the defect properties show that there are dozens of detrimental defects producing deep levels in the bandgap of the alloy under the Sb-rich (Se-poor) condition, which can cause serious electron–hole non-radiative recombination and limit the minority carrier lifetime. The formation of these detrimental defects can be largely suppressed under the Sb-poor condition, so we propose that the Sb-poor (Se-rich) condition should be adopted for fabricating Sb 2 (S,Se) 3 alloys as photocatalytic and photovoltaic light-absorber semiconductors with long minority carrier lifetimes.},

For well-designed experiments, it is of particular importance to develop effective cleaning procedures, especially since standard surface science techniques are typically not applicable. We perform ion spectroscopy with highly charged ions transmitted through freestanding atomically thin materials and present two techniques to achieve clean samples, both based on thermal treatment. Ion charge exchange and energy loss are used to analyze the degree of sample contamination. We find that even after cleaning, heavily contaminated spots remain on single layer graphene. The contamination coverage, however, clusters in strand-like structures leaving large clean areas. We present a way to discriminate clean from contaminated areas with our ion beam spectroscopy if the heterogeneity of the surface is increased sufficiently enough. We expect a similar discrimination to be necessary in most other experimental techniques.},

Here, we report a detailed study of the dynamics of these diatomics in water–ethanol binary mixtures for the first time. We find multiple anomalous results, namely, (i) faster rotational motion of CO and NO than CN − , (ii) larger translational diffusion of CO and NO in pure ethanol than in water but the reverse for CN − , (iii) a pronounced anomaly in the composition dependence of translational–rotational dynamics at low ethanol composition, and (iv) a re-entrant type behavior in the viscosity dependence of orientational relaxation. We compare our simulation result-based observations with the existing experimental results wherever available and find that the simulation results are in reasonably good agreement with the experiments. We implement, for the first time, a calculation of the rotational binary friction following the sophisticated scheme of Evans and co-workers. We also calculate the hydrodynamic predictions for the solute molecules. On comparison with the simulation and experimental results, we find that neither the rotational binary friction nor the hydrodynamic expressions (both stick and slip) can reproduce the results. To rectify the situation, we develop a detailed mode-coupling theory and suggest that such an approach if completely implemented can provide a more reliable description than the hydrodynamic approach. Many of our results could be tested in experimental studies because these linear molecules are amenable to spectroscopic studies, such as 2D-IR.},

The measured spectra were fitted with a Debye relaxation model using a non-linear, weighted, least-squares analysis. Conductivity was measured independently to reduce uncertainty in obtaining other parameters by spectral fitting. Careful experimentation provided dielectric data of sufficiently low uncertainty to enable observation of polarization mechanisms that emerge only in the low-concentration regime. The data were fitted by a concentration-dependent parametric model that includes terms accounting for internal depolarizing fields and the solvent dilution effect (mixture relation), the kinetic depolarization effect, the dielectric saturation effect, and the Debye–Falkenhagen effect that accounts for the contribution of ionic atmosphere polarization. It has been shown that, in NaCl and NaNO 3 solutions at sufficiently low concentrations, the static permittivity increases due to the Debye–Falkenhagen effect. It has also been shown that, to calculate the number of irrotationally bound water molecules Z IB , the measured static permittivity values should be corrected to account for the contributions of kinetic depolarization and Debye–Falkenhagen effects. Otherwise, unrealistic values of Z IB are obtained. An explanation for the different strengths of the Debye–Falkenhagen effect observed for the different electrolyte solutions, essentially due to the electrophoretic effect and coordination number, is also presented.},

Ionic charge carriers were provided by adding 1\% of Li salt. The molecules of these compounds have nearly globular shape and, thus, the so-called revolving-door mechanism assumed to promote ionic charge transport via molecular reorientations in other PC electrolytes should not be active here. Indeed, a comparison of the dc resistivity and the reorientational α -relaxation times in the investigated PCs reveals complete decoupling of both dynamics. Similar to other PCs, we find a significant mixing-induced enhancement of the ionic conductivity. Finally, these solid-state electrolytes reveal a second relaxation process, slower than the α -relaxation, which is related to ionic hopping. Due to the mentioned decoupling, it can be unequivocally detected and is not superimposed by the reorientational contributions as found for most other ionic conductors.},

  abstract = {Concrete gains its strength from the precipitation of a calcium–alumino–silicate–hydrate (C–A–S–H) colloidal gel, which acts as its binding phase. However, despite concrete’s ubiquity in the building environment, the atomic-scale mechanism of C–A–S–H precipitation is still unclear. Here, we use reactive molecular dynamics simulations to model the early-age precipitation of a C–A–S–H gel. We find that, upon gelation, silicate and aluminate precursors condensate and polymerize to form an aluminosilicate gel network. Notably, we demonstrate that the gelation reaction is driven by the existence of a mismatch of atomic-level internal stress between Si and Al polytopes, which are initially experiencing some local tension and compression, respectively. The polymerization of Si and Al polytopes enables the release of these competitive stresses.},

Crossed molecular beam slice imaging experiments unequivocally probe the secondary abstraction channel showing backward angular distributions with mild energy release to product translation, which are accurately captured by trajectory calculations using a specific-reaction-parameter Hamiltonian. Experiments containing both reaction channels indicate a less marked backward character in the angular distribution, whose origin is shown by trajectory calculations to appear as an evolution toward more sideways scattering from the secondary to primary channel. While the two channels have markedly different angular distributions, their energy release is largely comparable, showing ample energy release into the water product. The synergistic combination of crossed-beam imaging and trajectories opens the door to detailed reaction-dynamics studies of chemical reactions with ever-increasing complexity.},

  abstract = {Extensive ab initio investigations of the ground and electronic excited states of the AlCH 2 free radical have been carried out in order to predict the spectroscopic properties of this, as yet, undetected species. Difficulties with erratic predictions of the ground state vibrational frequencies, both in the literature and in the present work, have been traced to serious broken-symmetry instabilities in the unrestricted Hartree-Fock orbitals at the ground state equilibrium geometry. The use of restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock or complete active space self consistent field orbitals avoids these problems and leads to consistent and realistic sets of vibrational frequencies for the ground state. Using the internally contracted multireference configuration interaction method with aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis sets, we have calculated the geometries, energies, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies of eight electronic states of AlCH 2 and AlCD 2 . In addition, we have generated Franck–Condon simulations of the expected vibronic structure of the A ̃ − X ̃ ⁠ , B ̃ − X ̃ ⁠ , C ̃ − X ̃ ⁠ , and C ̃ − A ̃ band systems, which will be useful in searches for the electronic spectra of the radical. We have also simulated the expected rotational structure of the 0–0 absorption bands of these transitions at modest resolution under supersonic expansion cooled conditions. Our conclusion is that if AlCH 2 can be generated in sufficient concentrations in the gas phase, it is most likely detectable through the B ̃ 2 A 2 – X ̃ 2 B 1 or C ̃ 2 A 1 – X ̃ 2 B 1 electronic transitions at 515 nm and 372 nm, respectively. Both band systems have vibrational and rotational signatures, even at modest resolution, that are diagnostic of the aluminum methylene free radical.},

For excited electronic states, as are involved in UV–Vis spectroscopy and photochemistry, analytic gradients are readily available and often affordable for calculations using a state-averaged complete active space self-consistent-field (SA-CASSCF) wave function. However, in most cases, a post-SA-CASSCF step is necessary for quantitative accuracy, and such calculations are often too expensive if carried out by perturbation theory or configuration interaction. In this work, we present the analytic gradients for multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory based on SA-CASSCF wave functions, which is a more affordable alternative. A test set of molecules has been studied with this method, and the stationary geometries and energetics are compared to values in the literature as obtained by other methods. Excited-state geometries computed with state-averaged pair-density functional theory have similar accuracy to those from complete active space perturbation theory at the second-order.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular dynamics play an important role in numerous biological processes. Markov State Models (MSMs) provide a powerful approach to study these dynamic processes by predicting long time scale dynamics based on many short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In an MSM, protein dynamics are modeled as a kinetic process consisting of a series of Markovian transitions between different conformational states at discrete time intervals (called “lag time”). To achieve this, a master equation must be constructed with a sufficiently long lag time to allow interstate transitions to become truly Markovian. This imposes a major challenge for MSM studies of proteins since the lag time is bound by the length of relatively short MD simulations available to estimate the frequency of transitions. Here, we show how one can employ the generalized master equation formalism to obtain an exact description of protein conformational dynamics both at short and long time scales without the time resolution restrictions imposed by the MSM lag time. Using a simple kinetic model, alanine dipeptide, and WW domain, we demonstrate that it is possible to construct these quasi-Markov State Models (qMSMs) using MD simulations that are 5–10 times shorter than those required by MSMs. These qMSMs only contain a handful of metastable states and, thus, can greatly facilitate the interpretation of mechanisms associated with protein dynamics. A qMSM opens the door to the study of conformational changes of complex biomolecules where a Markovian model with a few states is often difficult to construct due to the limited length of available MD simulations.},

In these algorithms, both of which can be viewed as Newton algorithms, the Jacobian matrix of a lower level coupled cluster model is used in Newton equations associated with the target model. Improvements in convergence then imply savings for sufficiently large molecular systems, since the computational cost of macroiterations scales more steeply with system size than the cost of microiterations. The multimodel approach is suitable when there is a lower level Jacobian matrix that is much more accurate than the zeroth order approximation. Applying the approach to the CC3 equations, using the CCSD approximation of the Jacobian, we show that the time spent to determine the ground and valence excited states can be significantly reduced. We also find improved convergence for core excited states, indicating that similar savings will be obtained with an explicit implementation of the core-valence separated CCSD Jacobian transformation.},

In this paper, we report a novel plasmonic enhanced water splitting photoanode based on hematite-lanthanide upconversion nanocomposites to harvest lost photons below the bandgap of hematite. NaYF 4 :Er, Yb upconversion nanoparticles can upconvert photons from 980 nm to 510 nm–570 nm within the bandgap of hematite. More importantly, a gold nanodisk array with a plasmonic peak centered ∼1000 nm can further boost the photocurrent by 93-fold. It is demonstrated that the excitation process of lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles can be significantly enhanced by plasmonic nanostructures and can thus improve the water oxidation activity via plasmonic enhanced upconversion and hot electron injection, respectively. This new promising strategy will pave the way for plasmonic enhanced lost photon harvesting for applications in solar energy conversion.},

Predicting the melting point of a substance represents a rigorous test of model quality. To this end, we compute the melting points of the alkali chlorides for a popular non-polarizable and polarizable model. Neither model yields more accurate predictions of the melting points across the entire family of alkali chlorides. Further calculations suggest that this may be because neither model simultaneously represents both the solid and liquid phases with sufficient accuracy across all four alkali chlorides. We find that the deviation from experiment in the model enthalpy of melting may be a good indicator of the deviation from experiment in the model melting temperature. Since the enthalpy of melting is easier to calculate in simulation than melting temperature, it may be a useful quantity to target when developing new force fields for molten salts.},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent molecular simulation studies of “collective” properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions, specifically free energies and activity coefficients, solubilities, nucleation rates of crystals, and transport coefficients. These are important fundamental properties for biology and geoscience, but also relevant for many technological applications. Their determination from molecular-scale calculations requires large systems and long sampling times, as well as specialized sampling algorithms. As a result, such properties have not typically been taken into account during optimization of force field parameters; thus, they provide stringent tests for the transferability and range of applicability of proposed molecular models. There has been significant progress on simulation algorithms to enable the determination of these properties with good statistical uncertainties. Comparisons of simulation results to experimental data reveal deficiencies shared by many commonly used models. Moreover, there appear to exist specific tradeoffs within existing modeling frameworks so that good prediction of some properties is linked to poor prediction for specific other properties. For example, non-polarizable models that utilize full charges on the ions generally fail to predict accurately both activity coefficients and solubilities; the concentration dependence of viscosity and diffusivity for these models is also incorrect. Scaled-charge models improve the dynamic properties and could also perform well for solubilities but fail in the prediction of nucleation rates. Even models that do well at room temperature for some properties generally fail to capture their experimentally observed temperature dependence. The main conclusion from the present review is that qualitatively new physics will need to be incorporated in future models of electrolyte solutions to allow the description of collective properties for broad ranges of concentrations, temperatures, and solvent conditions.},

  abstract = {Performing quasielastic neutron scattering measurements and analyzing both elastic and quasielasic contributions, we study protein and water dynamics of hydrated elastin. At low temperatures, hydration-independent methyl group rotation dominates the findings. It is characterized by a Gaussian distribution of activation energies centered at about E m = 0.17 eV. At ∼195 K, coupled protein–water motion sets in. The hydration water shows diffusive motion, which is described by a Gaussian distribution of activation energies with E m = 0.57 eV. This Arrhenius behavior of water diffusion is consistent with previous results for water reorientation, but at variance with a fragile-to-strong crossover at ∼225 K. The hydration-related elastin backbone motion is localized and can be attributed to the cage rattling motion. We speculate that its onset at ∼195 K is related to a secondary glass transition, which occurs when a β relaxation of the protein has a correlation time of τ β ∼ 100 s. Moreover, we show that its temperature-dependent amplitude has a crossover at the regular glass transition T g = 320 K of hydrated elastin, where the α relaxation of the protein obeys τ α ∼ 100 s. By contrast, we do not observe a protein dynamical transition when water dynamics enters the experimental time window at ∼240 K.},

Here, we measured the electro-phoretic mobility and the DC conductivity of aqueous charged sphere suspensions covering about three orders of magnitude in particle concentrations and transmissions as low as 40\%. The extended concentration range for the first time allows the demonstration of a non-monotonic concentration dependence of the mobility for a single particle species. Our observations reconcile previous experimental observations made on other species over restricted concentration ranges. We compare our results to the state-of-the-art theoretical calculations using a constant particle charge and the carefully determined experimental boundary conditions as input. In particular, we consider the so-called realistic salt free conditions, i.e., we respect the release of counterions by the particles, the solvent hydrolysis, and the formation of carbonic acid from dissolved neutral CO 2 . We also compare our results to previous results obtained under similarly well-defined conditions. This allows identification of three distinct regions of differing density dependence. There is an ascent during the build-up of double layer overlap, which is not expected by theory, an extended plateau region in quantitative agreement with theoretical expectation based on a constant effective charge and a sudden decrease, which occurs way before the expected gradual decrease. Our observations suggest a relation of the non-monotonic behavior to a decrease in particle charge, and we tentatively discuss possibly underlying mechanisms.},

Even though the impact of surface roughness has been frequently considered computationally and theoretically, almost no experimental studies exist investigating these effects. Using a hydrogen fluoride vapor treatment, we created silica substrates with an increase in roughness that left the surface chemistry unchanged. The local glass transition temperature T g near silica substrates with an increase in roughness was measured using fluorescence, finding an increase in local T g of 10 K with an increase in the root-mean-square roughness R rms from 0.5 nm to 11 nm. Characterization of the substrate roughness needed to create an experimental change in local T g was found to be quite large, leaving the mechanism for this observed behavior uncertain. We discuss possible causes associated with polymer chains being more readily able to make surface contacts and adsorb to roughened interfaces.},

The tetrahedral particles with {111} exposed facets demonstrate higher photocatalytic performance than the cubic particles with {100} exposed facets. However, the reason behind this large difference in photocatalytic performance is still not understood. In this work, we study the free charge carrier dynamics, such as mobility, lifetime, and diffusion lengths, for the {111}-faceted tetrahedral and the {100}-faceted cubic particles using time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements. An order of magnitude higher charge carrier mobility and diffusion length are found for the tetrahedral particles as compared to the cubic particles. The differences in crystal structure, surface composition, and optical properties are investigated in order to understand how these properties impact the charge carrier dynamics and the photocatalytic performance of differently faceted particles.},

  abstract = {The inelastic scattering dynamics of the isobaric molecules, naphthalene (C 10 H 8 ) and 2-octanone (C 8 H 16 O), on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) have been investigated as part of a broader effort to inform the inlet design of a mass spectrometer for the analysis of atmospheric gases during a flyby mission through the atmosphere of a planet or moon. Molecular beam–surface scattering experiments were conducted, and the scattered products were detected with the use of a rotatable mass spectrometer detector. Continuous, supersonic beams were prepared, with average incident translational energies, ⟨ E i ⟩, of 247.3 kJ mol −1 and 538.2 kJ mol −1 for naphthalene and 268.6 kJ mol −1 and 433.8 kJ mol −1 for 2-octanone. These beams were directed toward an HOPG surface, held at 530 K, at incident angles, θ i , of 30°, 45°, and 70°, and scattered products were detected as functions of their translational energies and scattering angles. The scattering dynamics of both molecules are very similar and mimic the scattering of atoms and small molecules on rough surfaces, where parallel momentum is not conserved, suggesting that the dynamics are dominated by a corrugated interaction potential between the incident molecule and the surface. The effective corrugation of the molecule–surface interaction is apparently caused by the structure of the incident molecule and the consequent myriad available energy transfer pathways between the molecule and the surface during a complex collision event. In addition, the HOPG surface contributes to the corrugation of the interaction potential because it can absorb significant energy from collisions with incident molecules that have high mass and incident energy. Small differences in the scattering dynamics of the two molecules are inferred to arise from the details of the molecule–surface interaction potential, with 2-octanone exhibiting dynamics that suggest a slightly stronger interaction with the surface than naphthalene. These results add to a growing body of work on the scattering dynamics of organic molecules on HOPG, from which insight into the hypervelocity sampling and analysis of such molecules may be obtained.},

The relationship between the photovoltaic properties and the different connection bridges of these organic dyes was studied systematically, showing that a strategical variation on the linkage ways of dithiophene can obviously affect the twisted degree of backbone and, thus, have a great effect on inhibiting the intermolecular aggregation. Compared with a bulky rigid group substituted on TPTZ3 , introducing flexible side chains at suitable sites on the TPTZ1 and TPTZ2 seems to be a more effective strategy to achieve high photoelectric performance for double anchoring dye. Indeed, the DSSCs based on TPTZ2 exhibit a high efficiency of 7.50\%, reaching 99\% of an N719-based standard cell at the same condition. This study provides a new approach for highly efficient anti-aggregation organic sensitizers.},

The obtained α-Fe 2 O 3 /TiO 2 /CoO x photoanode exhibits superior PEC performance as compared to bare α-Fe 2 O 3 , with a 3.3-time improvement in photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. This significant enhancement results from the formed heterojunction between α-Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 for the accelerated photogenerated charge separation and transfer as well as the passivated surface defects by the TiO 2 overlayer for reduced charge recombination. Additionally, the existence of CoO x as the oxygen evolution catalyst significantly facilitates the surface reaction kinetics and thus reduces the overpotential for water oxidation.

The effect of the difference in curvatures, the surface tension, and the interaction parameter between components is thoroughly explored. Our numerical results quantitatively agree with the previous analytical results obtained by Gueguen et al. [Eur. Phys. J. E 37 , 76 (2014)] in the disordered (high temperature) phase. Numerical simulations allow us to explore the full parameter space, especially close to and below the critical temperature, where analytical results are not accessible. Phase diagrams are constructed and domain morphologies are quantitatively studied by computing the structure factor and the domain size distribution.

Here, by using density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulation, we study the stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of a OsI 3 monolayer, of which crystalline bulk is predicted to be a van der Waals layered ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor. Our results reveal that the OsI 3 monolayer can be easily exfoliated from the bulk phase with small cleavage energy and is energetically and thermodynamically stable at room temperature. Intrinsic half-metallicity with a wide bandgap and FM ordering with an estimated T C = 35 K are found for the OsI 3 monolayer. Specifically, the FM ordering can be maintained under external biaxial strain from −2\% to 5\%. The in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy of the 2D OsI 3 monolayer reaches up to 3.89 meV/OsI 3 , which is an order larger than that of most magnetic 2D materials such as the representative monolayer CrI 3 . The excellent magnetic features of the OsI 3 monolayer therefore render it a promising 2D candidate for spintronic applications.},

  abstract = {Mixed phase TiO 2 (Degussa P25) exhibits superior photocatalytic performance and stability due to the formation of the hetero-phase junction between anatase and rutile. However, the large bandgap limits its visible light activity. CdS is a photocatalyst with a broad light absorption band up to 550 nm. Constructing a hetero-phase junction will greatly promote the photocatalytic activity of CdS. In this work, the one-step solvothermal method was used to synthesize CdS hetero-phase junction with both hexagonal wurtzite (WZ) and cubic zinc blende (ZB) phases. The ratio of WZ and ZB phases can be tuned by adjusting the solvent ratio and reaction time to construct type I junction and effectively separate the photogenerated electron–hole pair. Under visible-light illumination, the optimal photocatalytic activity of the prepared material reaches 7.96 mmol h −1 g −1 , and the quantum efficiency is 36.7\% at 420 nm, which is three times higher than that of any single-phase sample (cubic or hexagonal phase) and maintains high photocatalytic stability as well. It is expected that this work will provide a feasible prospect for the practical application of high-efficiency homogeneous junction photocatalysts.},

  abstract = {Well-defined anatase TiO 2 crystals with co-exposed {101} and {001} facets represent a promising platform for fundamental studies in photocatalysis and for the development of novel photocatalytic systems exhibiting higher than usual quantum efficiencies. Herein, we present protocols enabling the photoreductive deposition of Pt nanoparticles onto anatase TiO 2 micro-sized (1–3 µ m) crystals prepared by hydrothermal growth in fluoride-containing solutions to be carried out either facet-selectively (on {101} facets only) or facet-non-selectively (on both {101} and {001} facets). The photocatalytic behavior of the resulting photocatalysts is studied using investigations of oxidative photodegradation of a test pollutant [4-chlorophenol (4-CP)], photocurrent measurements, and kinetic analysis of the open-circuit photopotential decay. We demonstrate that the deposition of Pt nanoparticles effectively triggers the photocatalytic degradation of 4-CP at anatase crystals that are otherwise completely inactive. The role of Pt in triggering the photocatalysis is demonstrated to consist chiefly in the catalytic enhancement of the reaction rate of oxygen reduction by the photogenerated electrons. Only the platinized {101} facets contribute to photocatalysis, whereas the {001} facets, in the literature often referred to as “highly reactive”, are even after platinization completely inactive, most likely due to (1 × 4) surface reconstruction upon the heat treatment necessary to decrease the amount of surface fluorides. Based on our results, we highlight the eminent role of efficient surface catalysis for effective charge separation and provide specific design rules for further development of photocatalysts with high quantum efficiencies.},

  abstract = {Layer-number-dependent performance of metal–semiconductor junctions (MSJs) with multilayered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors has attracted increasing attention for their potential in ultrathin electronics and optoelectronics. However, the mechanism of the interaction and the resulting charge transfer/redistribution at the two kinds of interfaces in MSJ with multilayered 2D semiconductors, namely, the metal–semiconductor (M–S) and the semiconductor–semiconductor (S–S) interfaces, have not been well understood until now, although that is important for the overall Schottky barrier height and the energy-band-offset between different layers of the 2D semiconductors. Here, based on state-of-the-art density functional theory calculations, the mechanisms of bonding and asymmetric electron redistribution at the M–S and S–S interfaces of metal–bilayer MoS 2 junctions are revealed. Multiple mechanisms collectively contribute to the electron redistribution at the two kinds of interfaces, and the dominant mechanism depends on both the dimensionality (2D vs 3D) and the work function of metal electrodes. For the M–S interface, the pushback effect and metal-induced gap states play a dominant role for MSJs with 3D metal, while the covalent-like quasi-bonding feature appears for MSJs with medium-work-function 2D metals, and charge transfer plays a main role for MSJs with 2D metals that have very large or small work functions. For the S–S interface, it inherits the electron-redistribution behavior of the M–S interface for MSJs with 2D metal, while opposite electron-redistribution appears in MSJs with 3D metal. These mechanisms provide general insights and new concepts to better understand and use MSJs with multilayered 2D semiconductors.},

The majority of molecules are tetrahedrally coordinated (T molecules), via low-energy hydrogen bonds. The minority component, whose relative concentration decreases with a decrease in the temperature at constant pressure, is characterized by prevalently three-coordinated molecules, giving rise to a distorted local network around them (D molecules). The inter-conversion between T and D molecules explains the increasing specific heat at constant pressure on cooling. The local structure around a T molecule resembles the one found experimentally in low-density amorphous ice (a network structure mostly composed by T molecules), while the local structure around a D molecule is reminiscent of the structural properties of high-density amorphous ice (a network structure composed by a mixture of T and D molecules).},

Here, we investigated the stability of these modifications at high pressures in the laser heated diamond anvil cell upon decompression from 161 GPa. Pure LP-N was synthesized above 152 GPa upon laser heating of η-N to 2500 K, while cg-N forms below 150 GPa. Upon laser heating at 129 GPa and 123 GPa, the LP-N clearly diminished, indicating that the synthesis of cg-N becomes more favorable in a mixed phase region below 129 GPa. Upon unloading, cg-N and LP-N were metastable to at least 71 GPa at up to 2500 K and at room temperature, respectively. These observations clarified a complicated polymorphism of monatomic nitrogen at high pressures and large hysteretic phenomena related to a transition to nonmolecular nitrogen.},

  abstract = {Electron transfer (ET) quenching dynamics in non-polar solvents are investigated using ultrafast spectroscopy with a series of six fluorophore/quencher pairs, covering a driving force range of more than 1.3 eV. The intrinsic ET rate constants, k 0 , deduced from the quenching dynamics in the static regime, are of the order of 10 12 –10 13 M −1 s −1 , i.e., at least as large as in acetonitrile, and do not exhibit any marked dependence on the driving force. A combination of transient electronic and vibrational absorption spectroscopy measurements reveals that the primary product of static quenching is a strongly coupled exciplex that decays within a few picoseconds. More weakly coupled exciplexes with a longer lifetime are generated subsequently, during the dynamic, diffusion-controlled, stage of the quenching. The results suggest that static ET quenching in non-polar solvents should be viewed as an internal conversion from a locally excited state to a charge-transfer state of a supermolecule rather than as a non-adiabatic ET process.},

  abstract = {We detail an experimental strategy for tracking the generation and time-development of electronic coherence within the singly excited manifold of an energy-transfer dimer. The technique requires that the two monomers have nonparallel electronic transition-dipole moments and that these possess fixed orientations in space. It makes use of two-dimensional wave-packet interferometry (WPI or whoopee) measurements in which the A , B , C , and D pulses have respective polarizations e , e , e , and e ′. In the case of energy-transfer coupling that is weak or strong compared to electronic–nuclear interactions, it is convenient to follow the evolution of intersite or interexciton coherence, respectively. Under weak coupling, e could be perpendicular to the acceptor chromophore’s transition dipole moment and the unit vector e ′ would be perpendicular to the donor’s transition dipole. Under strong coupling, e could be perpendicular to the ground-to-excited transition dipole to the lower exciton level and e ′ would be perpendicular to the ground-to-excited transition dipole to the upper exciton level. If the required spatial orientation can be realized for an entire ensemble, experiments of the kind proposed could be performed by either conventional four-wave-mixing or fluorescence-detected WPI methods. Alternatively, fluorescence-detected whoopee experiments of this kind could be carried out on a single energy-transfer dimer of fixed orientation. We exhibit detailed theoretical expressions for the desired WPI signal, explain the physical origin of electronic coherence detection, and show calculated observed-coherence signals for model dimers with one, two, or three internal vibrational modes per monomer and both weak and strong energy-transfer coupling.},

These limitations can bypass, thanks to the introduction of the notions of angular defect and discrete Gauss curvature coming from discrete differential geometry. In particular, these quantities can be easily computed for arbitrary molecules, trivalent or not, with bond of equal lengths or not. All these quantities have been implemented. We then compute all these quantities over the Tománek database covering an almost exhaustive list of fullerene molecules. In particular, we discuss the interdependence of the pyramidalization angle with the spherical curvature, angular defect, and hybridization numbers. We also explore the dependence of the pyramidalization angle with respect to some characteristics of the molecule, such as the number of atoms, the group of symmetry, and the geometrical optimization process.},

  abstract = {We discuss the effect of molecular symmetry on coherent tunneling in symmetric double-well potentials whose two molecular equilibrium configurations are interconverted by nuclear permutations. This is illustrated with vibrational tunneling in ammonia molecules, electronic tunneling in the dihydrogen cation, and laser-induced rotational tunneling of homonuclear diatomics. In this contribution, we reexamine the textbook picture of coherent tunneling in such potentials, which is depicted with a wavepacket shuttling back and forth between the two potential-wells. We show that the common application of this picture to the aforementioned molecules contravenes the principle of the indistinguishability of identical particles. This conflict originates from the sole consideration of the dynamics of the tunneling-mode, connecting the double-well energy minima, and complete omission of all the remaining molecular degrees of freedom. This gives rise to double-well wavepackets that are nonsymmetric under nuclear permutations. To obey quantum statistics, we show that the double-well eigenstates composing these wavepackets must be entangled with the wavefunctions that describe all the omitted molecular modes. These wavefunctions have compensating and opposite nuclear permutation symmetry. This in turn leads to complete quenching of interference effects behind localization in one potential-well or another. Indeed, we demonstrate that the reduced density of probability of the symmetrized molecular wavefunction, where all the molecular coordinates but the tunneling-mode are integrated out, is symmetrically distributed over the two potential-wells, at all times. This applies to any multilevel wavepacket of isotropic or fully aligned symmetric double-well achiral molecules. However, in the case of coherent electronic or vibrational tunneling, fully aligned molecules may exhibit dynamical localization in the space-fixed frame, where the tunneling-mode density shuttles between the opposite directions of the alignment axis. This dynamical spatial-localization results from linear combinations of molecular states that have opposite parity. In summary, this study shows that dynamical localization of the tunneling-mode density on either of the two indistinguishable molecular equilibrium configurations of symmetric double-well achiral molecules is forbidden by quantum statistics, whereas its dynamical localization in the space-fixed frame is allowed by parity. The subtle distinction between these two types of localization has far-reaching implications in the interpretation of many ultrafast molecular dynamics experiments.},

Photoelectron spectra of MnB 3 − are obtained at six different photon energies, revealing rich vibrational information for the ground state detachment transition. The electron affinity of MnB 3 is determined to be 1.6756(8) eV, and the most Franck–Condon-active mode observed has a measured frequency of 415(6) cm −1 due to the Mn—B 3 stretch. Theoretical calculations show that MnB 3 − has a C 2v planar structure, with Mn coordinated to one side of the triangular B 3 unit. The ground states of MnB 3 − ( 6 B 2 ) and MnB 3 ( 5 B 2 ) are found to have high spin multiplicity with a significant decrease in the Mn—B bond distances in the neutral due to the detachment of an Mn—B 3 anti-bonding electron. The Mn atom is shown to have weak interactions with the B 3 unit, which maintains its double aromaticity with relatively small structural changes from the bare B 3 cluster.

  abstract = {The spectra of RuS, OsS, CoS, RhS, IrS, and PtS have been recorded near their respective bond dissociation energies using resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy. The spectra display an abrupt drop to baseline when the bond dissociation energy (BDE) is exceeded. It is argued that spin–orbit and nonadiabatic interactions among the myriad of states that result from the ground and low-lying separated atom limits cause the molecules to predissociate rapidly as soon as the ground separated atom limit is exceeded in energy. Thus, the observed sharp predissociation thresholds are assigned as the 0 K BDEs of the molecules. With this assumption, the BDEs are assigned as follows: 4.071(8) eV (RuS), 4.277(3) eV (OsS), 3.467(5) eV (CoS), 3.611(3) eV (RhS), 4.110(3) eV (IrS), and 4.144(8) eV (PtS). Using thermochemical cycles, the gas-phase enthalpies of formation at 0 K, Δ f H 0 K °, were calculated to be 531.8(4.3) kJ mol −1 (RuS), 651.2(6.3) kJ mol −1 (OsS), 365.3(2.2) kJ mol −1 (CoS), 481.5(2.1) kJ mol −1 (RhS), 546.7(6.3) kJ mol −1 (IrS), and 438.9(1.5) kJ mol −1 (PtS).

Combining these data with predissociation measurements of other transition metal sulfide BDEs, the periodic trends in the transition metal sulfide BDEs are discussed and the BDEs of the transition metal sulfides are compared to those of the corresponding selenides. The BDEs of the sulfides are found to be 15.4\% greater than those of the corresponding sulfides.},

  abstract = {We probe the transient anion states (resonances) in the dielectric gas C 4 F 7 N by the electron energy loss spectroscopy and the dissociative electron attachment spectroscopy. The vibrationally inelastic electron scattering leads to two excitation types. The first is the excitation of specific vibrational modes that are assigned with the help of an infrared spectrum of this molecule and quantum chemistry calculations. In the second type of vibrational excitation, the excess energy is randomized via internal vibrational redistribution in the temporary anion, and the electrons are emitted statistically. The electron attachment proceeds in three different regimes. The first is the formation of the parent C 4 F 7 N − anion at energies close to 0 eV. The second is a statistical evaporation of the F-atom, leading to the defluorinated anion C 4 F 6 N − . Finally, the third is dissociative electron attachment proceeding via the formation of several resonances and leading to a number of fragments. The present data explain the puzzling recent results of the pulsed-Townsend experiments with this gas.},

The H-atom photofragment yield spectra of the n -butyl, s -butyl, and t -butyl radicals show a broad feature centered around 247 nm, 244 nm, and 234 nm, respectively. The translational energy distributions of the H + C 4 H 8 products, P ( E T )’s, of the three radicals are bimodal, with a slow (low E T ) component peaking at ∼6 kcal/mol and a fast (high E T ) component peaking at ∼52 kcal/mol–57 kcal/mol, ∼43 kcal/mol, and ∼37 kcal/mol for n -butyl, s -butyl, and t -butyl, respectively. The fraction of the products’ translational energy in the available energy, ⟨ f T ⟩, is 0.31, 0.30, and 0.27 for n -butyl, s -butyl, and t -butyl, respectively. The H-atom product angular distributions of the slow component are isotropic for all three radicals, while those of the fast component are anisotropic for n -butyl and s -butyl with an anisotropy parameter β ∼ 0.7 and ∼ 0.3 and that of the fast component of t -butyl is nearly isotropic. The bimodal product translational energy and angular distributions indicate two dissociation pathways to the H + C 4 H 8 products in these three radicals, a direct, prompt dissociation on the repulsive potential energy surface coupling with the Rydberg excited states, and a unimolecular dissociation of the hot radical on the ground electronic state after internal conversion from the Rydberg states.},

  abstract = {We report computed differential cross sections (DCSs) for electron impact excitation of the lower-lying states of both trans and gauche tautomers of ethanol, as well as total cross sections for the 15 eV–50 eV energy range. The Schwinger multichannel (SMC) method with pseudopotentials has been employed, and in our most sophisticated calculation in terms of multichannel coupling, 431 open target states have been considered. We found an overall good agreement with the available experimental data at intermediate scattering angles and at higher impact energies. Although we have used a Born-closure scheme for the higher partial waves, we have found discrepancies in the forward direction that were assigned to a poor description of the long-range component of the lower partial waves. Meanwhile, the lack of more Rydberg states could be related to the overestimated DCSs at lower energies. Missing open channels are usually evoked to explain the remaining discrepancies to experiment, but here, we argue that other factors should also be involved. Aiming at an improved description of the target states, we have proposed a simple procedure for selecting the pairs of hole and particle orbitals while keeping the single excitation prescription of the current SMC implementation. A quantitative assessment of the collision process should further consider the individual contribution of each tautomer, which presented quite distinct DCSs in some cases. Our computed excitation energies also support that the second absorption band of ethanol is comprised of three singlet states of each tautomer, rather than the previously suggested two or four states.},

A fast (6 keV–8 keV) beam of neutral t -BuSS radicals is produced via photodetachment of the corresponding anion, followed by photodissociation at 248 nm (5.00 eV) or 193 nm (6.42 eV) and coincident detection of the neutral products. Photofragment mass and translational energy distributions are obtained at both wavelengths. At 248 nm, the dominant product channel (90\%) is found to be S loss, with a product translational energy distribution that peaks close to the maximum available energy and an anisotropic photofragment angular distribution, indicating dissociation along a repulsive excited state. A minor channel (10\%) leading to the formation of S 2 + t -Bu is also observed. At 193 nm, both two- and three-body dissociation are observed. The formation of S 2 + t -Bu is the dominant two-body product channel, with multiple electronic states of the S 2 molecule produced via excited-state dissociation processes. The formation of S + t -BuS is a minor two-body channel at this dissociation energy. The three-body channels are S 2 + H + isobutene, S 2 + CH 3 + propene, and S + SH + isobutene. The first two of these channels result from a sequential dissociation process in which the loss of S 2 from t -BuSS results in ground-state t -Bu with sufficient internal energy to undergo secondary fragmentation. The third three-body channel, S + SH + isobutene, is attributed to the loss of internally excited HS 2 from t -BuSS, which then rapidly dissociates to form S + SH in an asynchronous concerted dissociation process.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss extending the sub-system embedding sub-algebra coupled cluster formalism and the double unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) ansatz to the time domain. An important part of the analysis is associated with proving the exactness of the DUCC ansatz based on the general many-body form of anti-Hermitian cluster operators defining external and internal excitations. Using these formalisms, it is possible to calculate the energy of the entire system as an eigenvalue of downfolded/effective Hamiltonian in the active space, which is identifiable with the sub-system of the composite system. It can also be shown that downfolded Hamiltonians integrate out Fermionic degrees of freedom that do not correspond to the physics encapsulated by the active space. In this paper, we extend these results to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, showing that a similar construct is possible to partition a system into a sub-system that varies slowly in time and a remaining sub-system that corresponds to fast oscillations. This time-dependent formalism allows coupled cluster quantum dynamics to be extended to larger systems and for the formulation of novel quantum algorithms based on the quantum Lanczos approach, which has recently been considered in the literature.},

  abstract = {We present a scattering approach for the study of the transport and thermodynamics of quantum systems strongly coupled to their thermal environment(s). This formalism recovers the standard non-equilibrium Green’s function expressions for quantum transport and reproduces recently obtained results for the quantum thermodynamics of slowly driven systems. Using this approach, new results have been obtained. First, we derived a general explicit expression for the non-equilibrium steady-state density matrix of a system composed of multiple infinite baths coupled through a general interaction. Then, we obtained a general expression for the dissipated power for the driven non-interacting resonant level to the first order in the driving speeds, where both the dot energy level and its couplings are changing, without invoking the wide-band approximation. In addition, we also showed that the symmetric splitting of the system bath interaction, employed for the case of a system coupled to one bath to determine the effective system Hamiltonian [A. Bruch et al. , Phys. Rev. B 93 , 115318 (2016)], is valid for the multiple bath case as well. Finally, we demonstrated an equivalence of our method to the Landauer–Buttiker formalism and its extension to slowly driven systems developed by Bruch, Lewenkopf, and von Oppen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 , 107701 (2018)]. To demonstrate the use of this formalism, we analyze the operation of a device in which the dot is driven cyclically between two leads under strong coupling conditions. We also generalize the previously obtained expression for entropy production in such driven processes to the many-bath case.},

Our aim was to investigate the changes in the photodynamics that are brought about by extending the delocalization of the excited states beyond the minimal model of a dimer. In the simulations based on the trimer model, compared to the dimer-based ones, we observed a faster time evolution of the state populations, with the largest differences associated with both the rise and decay times for the intermediate charge transfer states. Moreover, for the trimer, we predicted a singlet fission quantum yield of ∼204\%, which is larger than both the one extracted for the dimer (∼179\%) and the theoretical upper limit of 200\% for the dimer-based model of singlet fission. Although our study cannot account for the effects of extending the delocalization beyond three molecules, our findings clearly indicate how and why the singlet fission dynamics can be affected.},

Multicomponent wave function based methods, such as NEO coupled cluster singles and doubles, and multicomponent density functional theory (DFT), such as NEO-DFT, require the appropriate selection of electronic and nuclear basis sets. Although a wide array of electronic basis sets are available, systematically developed nuclear basis sets that balance accuracy and efficiency have been lacking. Herein, a series of nuclear basis sets are developed and shown to be accurate and efficient for describing both ground and excited state properties of multicomponent systems in which electrons and specified protons are treated quantum mechanically. Three series of Gaussian-type nuclear basis sets, denoted PB4, PB5, and PB6, are developed with varying levels of angular momentum. A machine-learning optimization procedure relying on the Gaussian process regression method is utilized to accelerate the optimization process. The basis sets are validated in terms of predictions of ground state energies, proton densities, proton affinities, and proton vibrational excitation energies, allowing the user to select the desired balance between accuracy and efficiency for the properties of interest. These nuclear basis sets will enhance the tractability of NEO methods for applications to a wide range of chemical systems.},

  abstract = {Many proteins in cells are capable of sensing and responding to piconewton-scale forces, a regime in which conformational changes are small but significant for biological processes. In order to efficiently and effectively sample the response of these proteins to small forces, enhanced sampling techniques will be required. In this work, we derive, implement, and evaluate an efficient method to simultaneously sample the result of applying any constant pulling force within a specified range to a molecular system of interest. We start from simulated tempering in force, whereby force is added as a linear bias on a collective variable to the system’s Hamiltonian, and the coefficient is taken as a continuous auxiliary degree of freedom. We derive a formula for an average collective-variable-dependent force, which depends on a set of weights learned on-the-fly throughout a simulation, that reflect the limit where force varies infinitely quickly. Simulation data can then be used to retroactively compute averages of any observable at any force within the specified range. This technique is based on recent work deriving similar equations for infinite switch simulated tempering in temperature, which showed that the infinite switch limit is the most efficient for sampling. Here, we demonstrate that our method accurately samples molecular systems at all forces within a user defined force range simultaneously and show how it can serve as an enhanced sampling tool for cases where the pulling direction destabilizes states that have low free-energy at zero-force. This method is implemented in and freely distributed with the PLUMED open-source sampling library, and hence can be readily applied to problems using a wide range of molecular dynamics software packages.},

  abstract = {Ab initio calculations of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) often rely on damped response theory, which prevents the divergence of response solutions in the resonant regime. Within the damped response theory formalism, RIXS moments are expressed as the sum over all electronic states of the system [sum-over-states (SOS) expressions]. By invoking resonance arguments, this expression can be reduced to a few terms, an approximation commonly exploited for the interpretation of computed cross sections. We present an alternative approach: a rigorous formalism for deriving a simple molecular orbital picture of the RIXS process from many-body calculations using the damped response theory. In practical implementations, the SOS expressions of RIXS moments are recast in terms of matrix elements between the zero-order wave functions and first-order frequency-dependent response wave functions of the initial and final states such that the RIXS moments can be evaluated using complex response one-particle transition density matrices (1PTDMs). Visualization of these 1PTDMs connects the RIXS process with the changes in electronic density. We demonstrate that the real and imaginary components of the response 1PTDMs can be interpreted as contributions of the undamped off-resonance and damped near-resonance SOS terms, respectively. By analyzing these 1PTDMs in terms of natural transition orbitals, we derive a rigorous, black-box mapping of the RIXS process into a molecular orbital picture. We illustrate the utility of the new tool by analyzing RIXS transitions in the OH radical, benzene, para -nitroaniline, and 4-amino-4′-nitrostilbene. These examples highlight the significance of both the near-resonance and off-resonance channels.},

  abstract = {Marcus–Levich–Jortner (MLJ) theory is one of the most commonly used methods for including nuclear quantum effects in the calculation of electron-transfer rates and for interpreting experimental data. It divides the molecular problem into a subsystem treated quantum-mechanically by Fermi’s golden rule and a solvent bath treated by classical Marcus theory. As an extension of this idea, we here present a “reduced” semiclassical instanton theory, which is a multiscale method for simulating quantum tunneling of the subsystem in molecular detail in the presence of a harmonic bath. We demonstrate that instanton theory is typically significantly more accurate than the cumulant expansion or the semiclassical Franck–Condon sum, which can give orders-of-magnitude errors and, in general, do not obey detailed balance. As opposed to MLJ theory, which is based on wavefunctions, instanton theory is based on path integrals and thus does not require solutions of the Schrödinger equation nor even global knowledge of the ground- and excited-state potentials within the subsystem. It can thus be efficiently applied to complex, anharmonic multidimensional subsystems without making further approximations. In addition to predicting accurate rates, instanton theory gives a high level of insight into the reaction mechanism by locating the dominant tunneling pathway as well as providing similar information to MLJ theory on the bath activation energy and the vibrational excitation energies of the subsystem states involved in the reaction.},

  abstract = {The parameterization of torsional/dihedral angle potential energy terms is a crucial part of developing molecular mechanics force fields. Quantum mechanical (QM) methods are often used to provide samples of the potential energy surface (PES) for fitting the empirical parameters in these force field terms. To ensure that the sampled molecular configurations are thermodynamically feasible, constrained QM geometry optimizations are typically carried out, which relax the orthogonal degrees of freedom while fixing the target torsion angle(s) on a grid of values. However, the quality of results and computational cost are affected by various factors on a non-trivial PES, such as dependence on the chosen scan direction and the lack of efficient approaches to integrate results started from multiple initial guesses. In this paper, we propose a systematic and versatile workflow called TorsionDrive to generate energy-minimized structures on a grid of torsion constraints by means of a recursive wavefront propagation algorithm, which resolves the deficiencies of conventional scanning approaches and generates higher quality QM data for force field development. The capabilities of our method are presented for multi-dimensional scans and multiple initial guess structures, and an integration with the MolSSI QCArchive distributed computing ecosystem is described. The method is implemented in an open-source software package that is compatible with many QM software packages and energy minimization codes.},

  abstract = {In molecular dynamics (MD) calculations of the free energies of ions and ionic molecules, we often encounter net charged molecular systems where the electrical neutrality condition is broken. This charge causes a problem in the evaluation of long-range Coulombic interactions under periodic boundary conditions. A standard remedy for this problem is to consider a hypothetical homogeneous background charge density to neutralize the total system. Here, we present a new expression for the evaluation of Coulombic interactions for such systems including background charge using the fast multipole method (FMM). Furthermore, an efficient scheme is developed to evaluate solute–solvent interaction energies using the FMM, reducing the computational burden for the far-field part. We calculate the hydration free energies of Mg 2+ , Na + , and Cl − ions dissolved in a neutral solvent using the new expression. The calculated free energies show good agreement with the results obtained using the well-established particle mesh Ewald method. This demonstrates the validity of the proposed expression. This work should make a contribution to highly parallelized MD calculations for large-scale charged systems (particularly, those with over million particles).},

Commonly used models assume the exponentially decaying correlation function, characterized by a given characteristic time, which allows us to define the Markovian conditions and, hence, allows us to use rate equations for excitation dynamics. A long memory fractional correlation function is studied in this paper as an alternative model. Such a function has an infinite characteristic decay time, and thus, system decay to equilibrium becomes poorly defined. Consequently, it becomes impossible to define the Markovian regime. By assuming the weak system–bath coupling regime, we apply the non-Markovian equations of motion to describe the equilibration process in an excitonic molecular aggregate. The long memory model causes a weaker decay of coherent components in excitonic system relaxation dynamics. Nevertheless, the short time dynamics, which is important in optical spectroscopy, depends on the short time interval of the fluctuation correlation function. Excitation relaxation in this window appears to be well described by non-Markovian approaches.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is used in thousands of papers each year, yet lack of universality reduces DFT’s predictive capacity, and functionals may produce energy-density imbalances. The absolute electronegativity (χ) and hardness (η) directly reflect the energy–density relationship via the chemical potential ∂ E/ ∂ N and we thus hypothesized that they probe universality. We studied χ and η for atoms Z = 1–36 using 50 diverse functionals covering all major classes. Very few functionals describe both χ and η well. η benefits from error cancellation, whereas χ is marred by error propagation from IP and EA; thus, almost all standard GGA and hybrid functionals display a plateau in the MAE at ∼0.2 eV–0.3 eV for η. In contrast, variable performance for χ indicates problems in describing the chemical potential by DFT. The accuracy and precision of a functional is far from linearly related, yet for a universal functional, we expect linearity. Popular functionals such as B3LYP, PBE, and revPBE perform poorly for both properties. Density sensitivity calculations indicate large density-derived errors as occupation of degenerate p- and d-orbitals causes “non-universality” and large dependency on exact exchange. Thus, we argue that performance for χ for the same systems is a hallmark of an important aspect of universality by probing ∂ E/ ∂ N. With this metric, B98, B97-1, PW6B95D3, MN-15, rev-TPSS, HSE06, and APFD are the most “universal” among the tested functionals. B98 and B97-1 are accurate for very diverse metal–ligand bonds, supporting that a balanced description of ∂ E/ ∂ N and ∂ E 2 / ∂ N 2 , via χ and η, is probably a first simple probe of universality.},

Algorithms are presented for computing “residual energies” whose magnitude is essential for the computation of the eigenvalues. Their practical application is possible due to the usage of the Lanczos method for creating a tridiagonal representation of the operator under study. The theory is self-consistent, in the sense that a lower bound for one state may be used to improve the lower bounds for others, and this is then used self-consistently until convergence. The theory is exemplified for a toy model of a quartic oscillator, where with only five states the relative error in the lower bound for the ground state is reduced to 6 · 10 −6 , which is the same as the relative error of the least upper bound obtained with the same basis functions. The lower bound method presented in this paper suggests that lower bounds may become a staple of eigenvalue computations.},

  abstract = {In open quantum system dynamics, rich information about the major energy relaxation channels and corresponding relaxation rates can be elucidated by monitoring the vibrational energy flow among individual bath modes. However, such calculations often become tremendously difficult as the complexity of the subsystem–bath coupling increases. In this paper, we attempt to make this task feasible by using a mixed quantum–classical method, the Poisson-bracket mapping equation with non-Hamiltonian modification (PBME-nH) [H. W. Kim and Y. M. Rhee, J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 184106 (2014)]. For a quantum subsystem bilinearly coupled to harmonic bath modes, we derive an expression for the mode energy in terms of the classical positions and momenta of the nuclei, while keeping consistency with the energy of the quantum subsystem. The accuracy of the resulting expression is then benchmarked against a numerically exact method by using relatively simple models. Although our expression predicts a qualitatively correct dissipation rate for a range of situations, cases involving a strong vibronic resonance are quite challenging. This is attributed to the inherent lack of quantum back reaction in PBME-nH, which becomes significant when the subsystem strongly interacts with a small number of bath modes. A rigorous treatment of such an effect will be crucial for developing quantitative simulation methods that can handle generic subsystem–bath coupling.},

The combination of DFT with an explicit treatment of the electronic correlation with a Hubbard-like model, known as the DFT+ U method, has been extensively applied to open up the energy gap in materials. Here, we introduce a systematic study where the selection of the U parameter is analyzed considering two different basis sets: plane-waves and numerical atomic orbitals (NAOs), together with different implementations for including U , to investigate the structural and electronic properties of a well-defined bipyramidal (TiO 2 ) 35 nanoparticle. This study reveals, as expected, that a certain U value can reproduce the experimental value for the energy gap. However, there is a high dependence on the choice of basis set and on the U parameter employed. The present study shows that the linear combination of the NAO basis functions, as implemented in Fritz Haber Institute ab initio molecular simulation (FHI-aims), requires, requires a lower U value than the simplified rotationally invariant approach, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). Therefore, the transfer of U values between codes is unfeasible and not recommended, demanding initial benchmark studies for the property of interest as a reference to determine the appropriate value of U .},

Few-state models are often used to interpret experimental observations of non-linear optical properties. Not only the magnitude but also the relative orientation of the transition dipole moment vectors is needed for few-state models of the non-linear optical properties. The effect of the relative orientation of the transition dipole moment vectors is called dipole alignment, and this effect has previously been studied for multiphoton absorption properties. However, so far, no such studies are reported for the first hyperpolarizability. Here, we present a generalized few-state model for the static and dynamic first hyperpolarizability β , accounting for the effect of dipole alignment. The formulas derived in this work are general in the sense that they can be used for any few-state model, i.e., a two-state model, a three-state model, or, in general, an n -state model. Based on the formulas, we formulate minimization and maximization criteria for the alignment of transition dipole moment vectors. We demonstrate the importance of dipole alignment by applying the formulas to the static first hyperpolarizability of ortho -, meta -, and para -nitroaniline. The formulas and the analysis provide new ways to understand the structure–property relationship for β and can hence be used to fine-tune the magnitude of β in a molecule.},

The global hybrid B3LYP (Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr) functional has been used to generate orbitals. The present method, called DFT-SSMRPT, uses perturbers that are individual Slater determinants and accounts for the coupling between the nondynamical and dynamical correlation effects. We have applied the new method to compute excitation energies in conjugated systems of π -electrons such as trans -1,3-butadiene, trans,trans -1,3,5-hexatriene, and all-trans -1,3,5,7-octatetraene. The ordering of the excited states is correctly reproduced by the DFT-SSMRPT calculations. The relative ordering of low-lying excited 1 B u and 1 A g states alters when the length of the polyene changes. The results match reasonably well with the literature including experimental and best theoretical findings. The accuracy of the method is sufficient to discern the energy gap between the close low-lying singlet and triplet states. The DFT-SSMRPT appears as an affordable computational ab initio avenue for a qualitatively correct description of excitation energies.},

Benchmark calculations are provided for thioformaldehyde (H 2 CS), which shows strong Coriolis coupling effects and a complex rovibrational spectrum. The underlying multidimensional potential energy surface has been calculated at the level of explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory.},

  abstract = {The doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) approach can provide an accurate black-box description of nondynamic electron correlation at a computational cost that increases combinatorially with the system size. Remarkably, a pair coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) approach (also known as the antisymmetrized product of one-reference orbital geminals) can reproduce DOCI energies with only a quadratic number of wave function parameters, and, when neglecting the cost associated with any two-electron integral transformations, these parameters can be determined at a cubic computational cost. Other simpler seniority-zero approaches derived from size-extensive modified configuration interaction doubles functionals can also provide approximations to DOCI energies at similar computational costs. We develop seniority-zero formulations of the coupled-electron pair approximation, the averaged coupled-pair functional, averaged quadratic coupled-cluster, and the parametric two-electron reduced density matrix (p2RDM) approach. These methods are Hermitian and thus offer several potential advantages over pCCD theory, including a reduction in the number of variable parameters and simplified definitions of reduced density matrices. Of the methods investigated, only the pair p2RDM (pp2RDM) approach yields energies that are comparable in quality to pCCD and DOCI. For the molecular systems investigated, pp2RDM-derived RDMs are found to be better approximations to DOCI ones than those obtained from pCCD.},

  abstract = {The increasing number of protein-based metamaterials demands reliable and efficient theoretical and computational methods to study the physicochemical properties they may display. In this regard, we develop a simulation strategy based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) that addresses the geometric degrees of freedom of an auxetic two-dimensional protein crystal. This model consists of a network of impenetrable rigid squares linked through massless rigid rods. Our MD methodology extends the well-known protocols SHAKE and RATTLE to include highly non-linear holonomic and non-holonomic constraints, with an emphasis on collision detection and response between anisotropic rigid bodies. The presented method enables the simulation of long-time dynamics with reasonably large time steps. The data extracted from the simulations allow the characterization of the dynamical correlations featured by the protein subunits, which show a persistent motional interdependence across the array. On the other hand, non-holonomic constraints (collisions between subunits) increase the number of inhomogeneous deformations of the network, thus driving it away from an isotropic response. Our work provides the first long-timescale simulation of the dynamics of protein crystals and offers insights into promising mechanical properties afforded by these materials.},

Nuclear quantum effects are incorporated by computing the vibrational spectrum and its effect on the effective energy barrier. The Li diffusion coefficient in bulk Si calculated with such quantum effects is ∼33\% lower than the classical limit near room temperature due to higher effective energy barrier and tends to the classical limit at a high temperature (&gt;1000 K). The presence of anharmonicity, estimated by the quasiharmonic approximation and the cB Ω model, increases the diffusion coefficient by ∼60\%. For Li diffusion in LiSi with multiple vacancy jumps, we obtain an effective diffusion barrier of 0.27 eV ± 0.01 eV.

It has been established since the 19th century that such objects harbor a negative electrostatic potential roughly twice larger than the thermal energy. The source of this charge continues to be one of the core observations in relation to hydrophobicity, and its molecular explanation is still debated. What is clear though is that the stabilizing interaction in these systems is understood in terms of electrostatic repulsion via Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, and Overbeek theory. Recent work [A. P. Carpenter et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 116 , 9214 (2019)] has added another element into the discussion, reporting the creation of bare near-zero charged droplets of oil in neat water that are stable for several days. Key to the creation of the droplets is a rigorous glassware cleaning procedure. Here, we investigate these conclusions and show that the cleaning procedure of glassware has no influence on the electrophoretic mobility of the droplets and that oil droplets with near-zero charge are unstable. We provide an alternative possible explanation for the observations involving glass surface chemistry.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous electrolytes generally rely on empirical force fields, combining dispersion interactions—described by a truncated Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential—and electrostatic interactions—described by a Coulomb potential computed with a long-range solver. Recently, force fields using rescaled ionic charges [electronic continuum correction (ECC)], possibly complemented with rescaling of LJ parameters [ECC rescaled (ECCR)], have shown promising results in bulk, but their performance at interfaces has been less explored. Here, we started by exploring the impact of the LJ potential truncation on the surface tension of a sodium chloride aqueous solution. We show a discrepancy between the numerical predictions for truncated LJ interactions with a large cutoff and for untruncated LJ interactions computed with a long-range solver, which can bias comparison of force field predictions with experiments. Using a long-range solver for LJ interactions, we then show that an ionic charge rescaling factor chosen to correct long-range electrostatic interactions in bulk accurately describes image charge repulsion at the liquid–vapor interface, and the rescaling of LJ parameters in ECCR models—aimed at capturing local ion–ion and ion–water interactions in bulk— describes well the formation of an ionic double layer at the liquid–vapor interface. Overall, these results suggest that the molecular modeling of aqueous electrolytes at interfaces would benefit from using long-range solvers for dispersion forces and from using ECCR models, where the charge rescaling factor should be chosen to correct long-range electrostatic interactions.},

  abstract = {Photoelectrochemical water splitting has attracted significant attention as an environment-friendly method to generate H 2 and O 2 . Electrodes composed of powders exhibit a large surface area and are favorable for surface reactions; however, their high resistance prevents charge transportation. In contrast, photoelectrodes composed of a dense film exhibit high conductivity; however, they constitute a small surface area. Therefore, a combination of these two films can lead to higher photoelectrochemical activities. Herein, a particulate/dense TiO 2 hybrid electrode exhibited eightfold and twofold higher activities for water oxidation at sufficiently positive potentials as compared to those of the single particulate and dense film electrodes, respectively. Electrochemical impedance measurements and the light intensity dependence of the photocurrent suggest that the activity enhancement is responsible for the synergistic effects of effective charge separation in the highly conductive dense TiO 2 film and effective hole-consuming reaction at the particulate TiO 2 layer. However, the activity rather decreased near the onset potential of water oxidation (&lt;0.3 V) under the illumination of light near the bandgap energy (375 nm). Such an activity decrease was not observed for the 340 nm illumination; hence, the recombination of charge carriers generated in dense and particulate layers is responsible: the charge transfer resistance at the particulate/dense interface prevents the effective charge separation. These results demonstrate that the combination of particulate matter and dense films can produce a synergistic effect; however, the resistance at the junction remains a significant bottleneck, rendering resistance reduction necessary to maximize the advantages of hybrid electrodes, especially under the illumination of longer wavelength light.},

  abstract = {In a pandemic era, rapid infectious disease diagnosis is essential. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) promises sensitive and specific diagnosis including rapid point-of-care detection and drug susceptibility testing. SERS utilizes inelastic light scattering arising from the interaction of incident photons with molecular vibrations, enhanced by orders of magnitude with resonant metallic or dielectric nanostructures. While SERS provides a spectral fingerprint of the sample, clinical translation is lagged due to challenges in consistency of spectral enhancement, complexity in spectral interpretation, insufficient specificity and sensitivity, and inefficient workflow from patient sample collection to spectral acquisition. Here, we highlight the recent, complementary advances that address these shortcomings, including (1) design of label-free SERS substrates and data processing algorithms that improve spectral signal and interpretability, essential for broad pathogen screening assays; (2) development of new capture and affinity agents, such as aptamers and polymers, critical for determining the presence or absence of particular pathogens; and (3) microfluidic and bioprinting platforms for efficient clinical sample processing. We also describe the development of low-cost, point-of-care, optical SERS hardware. Our paper focuses on SERS for viral and bacterial detection, in hopes of accelerating infectious disease diagnosis, monitoring, and vaccine development. With advances in SERS substrates, machine learning, and microfluidics and bioprinting, the specificity, sensitivity, and speed of SERS can be readily translated from laboratory bench to patient bedside, accelerating point-of-care diagnosis, personalized medicine, and precision health.},

For HbI, water–protein interactions, long known to contribute to the thermodynamics of cooperativity, are seen to influence the dynamics of the protein not only around the protein–water interface but also into the core of each globule, where dynamic and entropic changes upon ligand binding are coupled to protein–water contact dynamics. Similarly, hydration waters trapped deep inside the core region of A 2A AR enable the formation of an allosteric network made of water-mediated inter-residue contacts. Extending from the ligand binding pocket to the G-protein binding site, this allosteric network plays key roles in regulating the activity of the receptor.},

A difference in chemical potential between these reservoirs can drive the system into a non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS). In reality, these processes take place in finite systems containing a finite number of molecules. In such systems, a NESS can be reached with the help of an externally driven pump for which we introduce a simple model. The crucial parameters are the pumping rate and the finite size of the chemical reservoir. We apply this model to a simple biochemical oscillator, the Brusselator, and quantify the performance using the number of coherent oscillations. As a surprising result, we find that higher precision can be achieved with finite-size reservoirs even though the corresponding current fluctuations are larger than in the ideal infinite case.},

The scaling estimations of the hydrodynamic radius of such polymer brushes as a function of the number of grafted macromolecules allow concluding that the HMPAM shells are in a globular state and that the region of the stretched chains adjacent to the grafting surface is a minor part of the grafted macromolecules and does not have a significant impact on the self-assembly of the HMPAM shell caused by the complex hydrophobic–hydrophilic composition of their monomer units. In mean-field theory, the amphiphilic nature of HMPAM was taken into account by attaching the hydrophobic side group H to some fraction of monomer units of the hydrophilic P backbone. The strong attraction of H groups causes the aggregation of macromolecules, whereas the affinity of hydrophilic P groups to solvent forces the aggregates to increase their surface. Due to such effective surface activity, in poor solvent, the grafted amphiphilic macromolecules could form a spherical compacted structure around the nanoparticle or self-assemble into a “hedgehog” structure with several “spines” having hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell. State diagrams, obtained theoretically, reveal that the “hedgehog” structure is preferable for a wide range of energetic parameters.},

The observed discrepancy is attributed to the approximations involved in constructing the microscopic friction as well as to the approximate forms for dynamic structure factors used in MCT. In a thorough test of underlying MCT assumptions and approximations, various structural and dynamical quantities required as input for MCT are obtained directly from MD simulations. We present the improved MCT approach, which involves splitting of the microscopic time-dependent friction into two terms: binary (originating from short-time dynamics) and collective (due to long-time dynamics). Using MD data as input in MCT, we demonstrate that the total friction is largely dominated by its binary short-time term, which, if neglected, leads to severe overestimation of D n . As a result, the revised version of MCT, in agreement with the present MD data, predicts 1 / R n 2 scaling of the probe diffusion coefficient in a non-hydrodynamic regime when R n &lt; R g . If the total friction is dominated by the collective long-time component, one would observe 1 / R n 3 scaling of D n in accordance with previous studies.},

  abstract = {We consider the phase stability of binary fluid mixtures with constituents of contrasting dielectric properties in the presence of a static applied electric field, E 0 . The dielectric fluid is modeled using a recently developed field-theoretic representation for the equilibrium behavior of a system of polarizable molecular species [J. M. Martin et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 145 , 154104 (2016)]. The dielectric displacement of the fluid, D , is obtained from a direct E 0 derivative of the fluid’s free energy, illuminating coupled structural and electrostatic fluctuations that manifest in the dielectric properties of the fluid. Linearizing D with respect to E 0 yields an explicit, molecularly based expression for the dielectric constant of the fluid mixture, ϵ , through the relation D = ϵ E 0 . In the linear response regime, the composition dependence of ϵ completely specifies the applied field-dependent contribution to the fluid’s miscibility, which we enumerate as a contribution χ E to a Flory interaction parameter. Using a Gaussian approximation to the field theory, we obtain an expression for χ E that relates structural and electrostatic contrast between dissimilar molecules to miscibility in the presence of an applied field. Specifically, contrast between wavevector-dependent, single-molecule correlation functions, Λ ^ A / B ( k ) ⁠ , emerges as a necessary ingredient for electric field-induced mixing, corresponding to χ E &lt; 0. The character of χ E is considered in three classes of binary systems: a binary simple fluid, a homopolymer blend, and a homopolymer solution. Within each system, the form for Λ ^ A / B accounts for molecular architecture effects, such as chain connectivity. Our findings elucidate the conditions for which one should expect electric field induced mixing or demixing for each class of mixture.},

  abstract = {The Derjaguin approximation (DA) relates the force between curved surfaces to the interaction free energy between parallel planes. It is typically derived by considering the direct interaction between the bodies involved, thus treating the effect of an intervening solvent implicitly by a rescaling of the corresponding Hamaker constant. Here, we provide a generalization of DA to the case of a molecular medium between the bodies, as is the case in most applications. The derivation is based on an explicit statistical–mechanical treatment of the contribution to the interaction force from a molecular solvent using a general expression for intermolecular and molecule–surface interactions. Starting from an exact expression for the force, DA is arrived at by a series of well-defined approximations. Our results show that DA remains valid in a molecular solvent as long as (i) the surface–molecule interactions are of a much shorter range than the radius R of the sphere and (ii) the density correlation length in the solvent is smaller than R . We then extend our analysis to the case where a phase transition occurs between the surfaces, which cannot easily be covered using a statistical–mechanical formalism due to the discontinuous change in the density of the medium. Instead, using a continuum thermodynamic description, we show that this phase transformation induces an attractive force between the bodies and that the force between curved surfaces can be related to the free energy in the corresponding planar case, in accordance with DA.},

For electrolyte solutions, the influence of these inhomogeneities is particularly strong because the corresponding characteristic length scale is the Debye length, which is large compared to molecular sizes. Here, a fully three-dimensional investigation is performed, which accounts explicitly for the solvent particles, and thus provides insight into effects caused by ion–solvent coupling. The present study introduces a versatile framework to analyze a broad range of types of surface charge heterogeneities even beyond the linear response regime.

  abstract = {Exfoliated flakes from molybdenite crystals often still serve as benchmark substrates for two-dimensional MoS 2 fundamental and device-oriented research. In this article, results are reported of a multi-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study on a series of natural 2H MoS 2 crystals taken from various (seven) geological sites with the intent to explore the variations in quality and properties in terms of occurring paramagnetic point defects, with particular focus on the assessment of the predominant type of impurity dopant. The sample set covers three types of overall doping regimes, i.e., p -type, n -type, and mixed ( n -type and p -type parts in one sample). The doping type appears primarily governed by substitutional impurities as evidenced by the observed As and N acceptor (both substituting for S) and Re donor (substituting for Mo) signals. For all p -type specimens, doping is found to be ruled by As where, however, a strong variation is revealed in doping uniformity, which appears not directly correlated with the As dopant density. Without specific precautions taken, surface contamination related EPR signals are observed in virtually all As-excavated geo-MoS 2 specimens. While several of these signals are of unassigned origin, two prominent ones are identified, one as concerning oxo-Mo 5+ compounds and the other Mn 2+ centers. The geo-MoS 2 sample with the foremost n -type doping shows, besides the prime Re donor EPR signal, an intense powder-pattern signal, tentatively typified by g ∥ = 2.076, g ⊥ = 2.253, which is suggested to originate from intercalation-related defects. The results bear out the necessity of rigorous surface cleaning, even including invasive removal of surface layers, to obtain pristine MoS 2 parent crystals suitable for enabling exfoliation of high quality flakes.},

  abstract = {We present a continuum theory for predicting the equilibrium shape and size of dipolar domains formed during liquid–liquid phase coexistence in planar and spherical monolayers. Our main objective is to assess the impact of the monolayer surface curvature on domain morphology. Following previous investigators, we base our analysis around minimizing the free energy, with contributions from line tension and electrostatic dipolar repulsions. Assuming a monodisperse system of circularly symmetric domains, we calculate self-energies and interaction energies for planar and spherical monolayers and determine the equilibrium domain size from the energy minima. We subsequently evaluate the stability of the circularly symmetric domain shapes to an arbitrary, circumferential distortion of the perimeter via a linear stability analysis. We find that the surface curvature generally promotes the formation of smaller, circularly symmetric domains instead of larger, elongated domains. We rationalize these results by examining the effect of the curvature on the intra- and inter-domain dipolar repulsions. We then present a phase diagram of domain shape morphologies, parameterized in terms of the domain area fraction and the monolayer curvature. For typical domain dimensions of 1–30 µ m, our theoretical results are relevant to monolayers (and possibly also bilayers) in liquid–liquid phase coexistence with radii of curvature of 1–100 µ m.},

  abstract = {In concentrated electrolytes with asymmetric or irregular ions, such as ionic liquids and solvent-in-salt electrolytes, ion association is more complicated than simple ion-pairing. Large branched aggregates can form at significant concentrations at even moderate salt concentrations. When the extent of ion association reaches a certain threshold, a percolating ionic gel network can form spontaneously. Gelation is a phenomenon that is well known in polymer physics, but it is practically unstudied in concentrated electrolytes. However, despite this fact, the ion-pairing description is often applied to these systems for the sake of simplicity. In this work, drawing strongly from established theories in polymer physics, we develop a simple thermodynamic model of reversible ionic aggregation and gelation in concentrated electrolytes accounting for the competition between ion solvation and ion association. Our model describes, with the use of several phenomenological parameters, the populations of ionic clusters of different sizes as a function of salt concentration; it captures the onset of ionic gelation and also the post-gel partitioning of ions into the gel. We discuss the applicability of our model, as well as the implications of its predictions on thermodynamic, transport, and rheological properties.},

It is found that such systems display two kinds of ordering processes, the type of which can be controlled by tuning the interactions between unlike particles. While strong inter-species repulsion leads to chemical ordering in terms of an unmixing process, weak repulsion gives rise to spontaneous crystallization, maintaining chemical homogeneity. This result indicates the existence of a transition in the topography of the underlying potential-energy landscape as the intra-species interaction strength is varied. Furthermore, the dual-type behavior appears to be universal for repulsive pair-interaction potential-energy functions in general, with the propensity for the crystallization process being related to their behavior in the neighborhood of zero separation.},

Karl Fischer titration, NMR, and FT-IR spectra confirmed the high purity of [DEMA][OMs]. The melting point (37.7 °C) and the freezing point (14.0 °C) obtained by DSC agree well with the values determined by BDS (40.0 °C and 14.0 °C). The dc conductivity ( σ dc ) above the melting/freezing point obeys the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) equation well, and thus, the proton conduction in [DEMA][OMs] is assumed to be dominated by the vehicle mechanism. In contrast, the σ dc below the melting/freezing point can be fitted by the Arrhenius equation separately, and therefore, the proton conduction is most likely governed by the proton hopping mechanism. The non-negligible influence of previously reported low water content on the physicochemical properties of [DEMA][OMs] is found, indicating the importance of reducing water content as much as possible for the study of “intrinsic” properties of protic ionic liquids.},

In BDS, four relaxation processes can be attributed to molecular dynamics. While the fastest process P1 obeys the Arrhenius law, the slowest process P4 shows prominent non-Arrhenius behavior typical of structural α relaxation. For the intermediate processes P2 and P3, the temperature dependence changes at the glass transition temperature T g . The 1 H and 2 H NMR results yield insights into the molecular origins of these relaxation phenomena. In these NMR analyses, we exploit, in addition to the isotope selectivity of the method, the possibility to distinguish between various types of motion based on their respective line-shape effects and the capability to single out specific molecular moieties based on different spin–lattice relaxation behaviors. In this way, we reveal that process P1 results from the rotation of side and end groups of the peptide, while process P2 is caused by a reorientation of essentially all water molecules, which are quasi-isotropic and survive well below T g . As for the peptide backbone dynamics, we find evidence that rotational motion of polar groups is involved in process P3 and that nonpolar regions show a dynamical process, which is located between P3 and P4. Thus, the NMR analyses do not yield evidence for coexisting fast peptide-decoupled and slow peptide-coupled water species, which contribute to BDS processes P2 and P3, respectively, but minor bimodality of water motion may remain undetected. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proton/deuteron exchange needs to be considered when interpreting experimental results for molecular dynamics in aqueous peptide solutions.},

In a supercooled liquid, when we make a small fraction of particles heavier, they exhibit slower dynamics than the original particles and also make the overall system slower. If one looks at the overlap correlation function to quantify dynamics in the system, it has different behaviors for the heavy and the light particles. In particular, at the relaxation time of the overall system, the degree of relaxation achieved by the heavier particles is lesser, on average, than that achieved by the lighter particles. This difference in relaxation, however, goes down drastically as a crossover temperature, T 0 , is crossed. Below this crossover temperature, particles in the system have similar relaxation times irrespective of their masses. This crossover temperature depends on the fraction of the heavy particles and their masses. Next, we isolate the effect of mass heterogeneity on the dynamics of supercooled liquids and find that its effect increases monotonically with temperature. We also see that the development of dynamical heterogeneity with decreasing temperature is less dramatic for the system with impurities than for the pure system. Finally, the introduction of heavy impurities can be seen as a way of reducing the kinetic fragility of a supercooled liquid.},

The results obtained revealed that the first solvation shell of the dimethylammonium consists mainly of two and, less frequently, three water molecules. The two nearest water neighbors form hydrogen bonds with the ammonium hydrogen atoms of the cation, whereas the third neighbor interacts with the methyl hydrogen atoms as well. The distribution of the trigonal order parameter exhibits a bimodal behavior, signifying the existence of local orientational heterogeneities in the solvation shell of the dimethylammonium cation. The calculated continuous and intermittent residence and hydrogen bond lifetimes for the cation–water pairs have also been found to be longer in comparison with the water–water ones. The very similar self-diffusion coefficients of the dimethylammonium cation and the water molecules in the bulk dilute solution indicate that the translational motions of the cation are mainly controlled by the translational mobility of the surrounding water molecules.},

We characterize the ionic reactants, products, and an entrance channel reaction complex in the gas phase using high-resolution mass spectrometry augmented by cryogenic ion IR photodissociation spectroscopy. Collisional activation of this trapped entrance channel complex does not drive the reaction to products but rather yields dissociation back to reactants. Electronic structure calculations indicate that there are four low-lying isomeric forms of the non-covalently bound complex. Comparison of their predicted vibrational spectra with the observed band pattern indicates that the C=O groups of the ortho-quinone attach to protons on two different –NH 2 groups of the reactant scaffold, exhibiting strong O–H–N contact motifs. Since collisional activation does not lead to the products observed in the liquid phase, these results indicate that the reaction most likely proceeds through reorientation of the H-atom donor ligand about the metal center.},

  abstract = {A recent high resolution photoabsorption study revealed that the Rydberg W 1 Π(ν = 1) level of carbon monoxide (CO) is perturbed by the valence E″ 1 Π(ν = 0) level, and the predissociation linewidth shows drastic variation at the crossing point due to the interference effect [Heays et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 141 (14), 144311 (2014)]. Here, we reinvestigate the Rydberg W 1 Π(ν = 1) level for the three CO isotopologues, 12 C 16 O, 13 C 16 O, and 12 C 18 O, by measuring the rotationally dependent photodissociation branching ratios. The C + ion photofragment spectra obtained here reproduce the recent high resolution photoabsorption spectra very well, including the presence of the valence E″ 1 Π(ν = 0) level. The photodissociation branching ratios into the spin-forbidden channel C( 1 D) + O( 3 P) show sudden increases at the crossing point between the W 1 Π(ν = 1) and E″ 1 Π(ν = 0) levels, which is in perfect accordance with the drastic variation of the linewidth observed in the recent spectroscopic study. Further analysis reveals that the partial predissociation rate into the lowest channel C( 3 P) + O( 3 P) shows a much more prominent decrease at the crossing point, which is caused by the interference effect between the W 1 Π(ν = 1) and E″ 1 Π(ν = 0) levels, than that into the spin-forbidden channel C( 1 D) + O( 3 P), and this is the reason of the sudden increase as observed in the photodissociation branching ratio measurements. We hope that the current experimental investigation will stimulate further theoretical studies, which could thoroughly address all the experimental observations in a quantitative way.},

The excitation spectra of the HeNeI 2 ( B , E ) decay product luminescence and the luminescence spectra of I 2 ion-pair states formed after HeNeI 2 ( E ) decay have been recorded and analyzed.

The HeNeI 2 ( B , v B ) state decay has been found to be sequential with the formation of the HeI 2 ( B , v B − 1) and NeI 2 ( B , v B − 1) complexes without intermolecular excitation at the first step. An analysis of the HeNeI 2 ( E ) decay process based on the relative probabilities of the I 2 ( ⁠ D 0 u + ⁠ ) and I 2 ( β 1 g ) formation after decay, as well as vibrational populations of these states obtained from luminescence spectra, has also been performed. Calculations of the HeNeI 2 ( X , B ) vibrational energies using potential energy surfaces (PESs) of HeNeI 2 ( X , B ) constructed as a sum of the HeNe, HeI 2 , and NeI 2 potentials have been carried out. The values obtained agree well with the experimental estimations, and the observed transitions can be ascribed to the HeNeI 2 trimer of a tetrahedral geometry. Besides, a comparison of the PES constructed as a sum of the coupled-cluster single double triple [CCSD(T)] potentials with the PES based on the “direct” CCSD(T) calculations has been performed for the HeNeI 2 ( X ) trimer to verify the applicability of this representation to the trimer under study.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of liquid jets disintegrating into droplets has attracted the attention of researchers for more than 200 years. An overwhelming fraction of these studies considered classical viscous liquid jets issuing into ambient atmospheric gases, such as air. Here, we present an optical shadowgraphy study of the disintegration of a cryogenic liquid helium jet produced with a 5 µ m diameter nozzle into vacuum. The physical properties of liquid helium, such as its density, surface tension, and viscosity, change dramatically as the jet flows through the nozzle and evaporatively cools in vacuum, eventually reaching the superfluid state. In this study, we demonstrate that, at different stagnation pressures and temperatures, droplet formation may involve spraying, capillary breakup, jet branching, and/or flashing and cavitation. The average droplet sizes produced in this work range from 3.4 × 10 12 to 6.5 × 10 12 helium atoms or 6.7–8.3 µ m in diameter. This paper also reports on the distributions of sizes and shapes of the resulting droplets.},

  abstract = {The fragmentation upon electron impact ionization of Ar 4 He 1000 is investigated by means of mixed quantum–classical dynamics simulations. The A r 4 + dopant dynamics is described by a surface hopping method coupled with a diatomics-in-molecules model to properly take into account the multiple A r 4 + electronic surfaces and possible transitions between them. Helium atoms are treated individually using zero-point averaged dynamics, a method based on the building of an effective He–He potential. Fast electronic relaxation is observed from less than 2 ps to ∼30 ps, depending on initial conditions. The main fragments observed are A r 2 + He q and A r 3 + He q ( q ≤ 1000), with a strong contribution of the bare A r 2 + ion, and neither Ar + nor Ar + He q fragments are found. The smaller fragments ( q ≤ 50) are found to mostly come from ion ejection, whereas larger fragments ( q &gt; 500) originate from long-term ion trapping. Although the structure of the trapped A r 2 + ions is the same as in the gas phase, trapped A r 3 + and A r 4 + are rather slightly bound A r 2 + ⋯ Ar and A r 2 + ⋯ Ar ⋯ Ar structures (i.e., an A r 2 + core with one or two argon atoms roaming within the droplet). These loose structures can undergo geminate recombination and release A r 3 + H e q or A r 4 + H e q ( q ≤ 50) in the gas phase and/or induce strong helium droplet evaporation. Finally, the translational energy of the fragment center of mass was found to be suitable to provide a clear signature of the broad variety of processes at play in our simulations.},

  abstract = {We present a five-dimensional intermolecular potential energy surface (PES) of the NH 3 –N 2 complex, bound state calculations, and new microwave (MW) measurements that provide information on the structure of this complex and a critical test of the potential. Ab initio calculations were carried out using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster [CCSD(T)-F12a] approach with the augmented correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The global minimum of the PES corresponds to a configuration in which the angle between the NH 3 symmetry axis and the intermolecular axis is 58.7° with the N atom of the NH 3 unit closest to the N 2 unit, which is nearly parallel to the NH 3 symmetry axis. The intermolecular distance is 7.01 a 0 , and the binding energy D e is 250.6 cm –1 . The bound rovibrational levels of the four nuclear spin isomers of the complex, which are formed when ortho / para ( o / p )-NH 3 combines with ( o / p )-N 2 , were calculated on this intermolecular potential surface. The computed dissociation energies D 0 are 144.91 cm −1 , 146.50 cm −1 , 152.29 cm −1 , and 154.64 cm −1 for ( o )-NH 3 –( o )-N 2 , ( o )-NH 3 –( p )-N 2 , ( p )-NH 3 –( o )-N 2 , and ( p )-NH 3 –( p )-N 2 , respectively. Guided by these calculations, the pure rotational transitions of the NH 3 –N 2 van der Waals complex were observed in the frequency range of 13–27 GHz using the chirped-pulse Fourier-transform MW technique. A complicated hyperfine structure due to three quadrupole 14 N nuclei was partly resolved and examined for all four nuclear spin isomers of the complex. Newly obtained data definitively established the K values (the projection of the angular momentum J on the intermolecular axis) for the lowest states of the different NH 3 –N 2 nuclear spin isomers.},

This study employs accurate, ab initio calculations of the interaction potential energy surfaces for these anions, treated as rigid rotors, and the He atom to obtain a wide range of state-changing quantum cross sections and rates at temperatures up to about 100 K.

  abstract = {The hydrogen-bonding networks of water have strong intra- and intermolecular vibrational coupling which influences the energy dissipation and proton transfer in water. Disentangling and quantitative characterization of different coupling effects in water at a single-molecular level still remains a great challenge. Using tip-enhanced inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) based on low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we report the direct quantitative assessment of the intermolecular coupling constants of the OH-stretch vibrational bands of an isolated water tetramer adsorbed on a Au(111)-supported NaCl(001) bilayer film. This is achieved by distinguishing various coupled modes of the H-bonded O–H stretching vibrations through tip-height dependent IET spectra. In contrast, such vibrational coupling is negligible in the half-deuterated water tetramer owing to the large energy mismatch between the OH and OD stretching modes. Not only do these findings advance our understanding on the effects of local environment on the intermolecular vibrational coupling in water, but also open up a new route for vibrational spectroscopic studies of extended H-bonded network at the single-molecular level.},

Starting from the least approximate method—the linearized DSRG truncated to one-, two-, and three-body operators [LDSRG(3)]—we develop several approximate LDSRG(3) models with reduced computational cost. Through a perturbative analysis, we motivate a family of iterative LDSRG(3)- n and - n ′ ( n = 1, 2, 3, 4) methods that contain a subset of the LDSRG(3) diagrams. Among these variants, the LDSRG(3)-2 scheme has the same computational complexity of coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT), but it outperforms CCSDT in the accuracy of the predicted correlation energies. We also propose and implement two perturbative triples corrections based on the linearized DSRG truncated to one- and two-body operators augmented with recursive semi-quadratic commutators [qDSRG(2)]. The resulting qDSRG(2)+(T) approach matches the accuracy of the “gold-standard” coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples model on the energetics of twenty-eight closed-shell atoms and small molecules.},

  abstract = {To directly simulate rare events using atomistic molecular dynamics is a significant challenge in computational biophysics. Well-established enhanced-sampling techniques do exist to obtain the thermodynamic functions for such systems. However, developing methods for obtaining the kinetics of long timescale processes from simulation at atomic detail is comparatively less developed an area. Milestoning and the weighted ensemble (WE) method are two different stratification strategies; both have shown promise for computing long timescales of complex biomolecular processes. Nevertheless, both require a significant investment of computational resources. We have combined WE and milestoning to calculate observables in orders-of-magnitude less central processing unit and wall-clock time. Our weighted ensemble milestoning method (WEM) uses WE simulation to converge the transition probability and first passage times between milestones, followed by the utilization of the theoretical framework of milestoning to extract thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the entire process. We tested our method for a simple one-dimensional double-well potential, for an eleven-dimensional potential energy surface with energy barrier, and on the biomolecular model system alanine dipeptide. We were able to recover the free energy profiles, time correlation functions, and mean first passage times for barrier crossing events at a significantly small computational cost. WEM promises to extend the applicability of molecular dynamics simulation to slow dynamics of large systems that are well beyond the scope of present day brute-force computations.},

  abstract = {We present a reduced scaling formulation of the extended multi-state CASPT2 (XMS-CASPT2) method, which is based on our recently developed state-specific CASPT2 (SS-CASPT2) formulation using supporting subspaces and tensor hyper-contraction. By using these two techniques, the off-diagonal elements of the effective Hamiltonian can be computed with only O ( N 3 ) operations and O( N 2 ) memory, where N is the number of basis functions. This limits the overall computational scaling to O( N 4 ) operations and O( N 2 ) memory. Thus, excited states can now be obtained at the same reduced (relative to previous algorithms) scaling we achieved for SS-CASPT2. In addition, we also investigate how the energy denominators can be factorized with the Laplace quadrature when some of the denominators are negative, which is critical for excited state calculations. An efficient implementation of the method has been developed using graphical processing units while also exploiting spatial sparsity in tensor operations. We benchmark the accuracy of the new method by comparison to non-THC formulated XMS-CASPT2 for the excited states of various molecules. In our tests, the THC approximation introduces negligible errors (≈0.01 eV) compared to the non-THC reference method. Scaling behavior and computational timings are presented to demonstrate performance. The new method is also interfaced with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM). In an example study of green fluorescent protein, we show how the XMS-CASPT2 potential energy surfaces and excitation energies are affected by increasing the size of the QM region up to 278 QM atoms with more than 2300 basis functions.},

  abstract = {Vibrational strong coupling has emerged as a promising route for manipulating the reactivity of molecules inside infrared cavities. We develop a full-quantum methodology to study the unitary dynamics of a single anharmonic vibrational mode interacting with a quantized infrared cavity field. By comparing multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree simulations for an intracavity Morse oscillator with an equivalent formulation of the problem in Hilbert space, we describe for the first time the essential role of permanent dipole moments in the femtosecond dynamics of vibrational polariton wavepackets. We classify molecules into three general families according to the shape of their electric dipole function d e ( q ) along the vibrational mode coordinate q . For polar species with a positive slope of the dipole function at equilibrium, an initial diabatic light–matter product state without vibrational or cavity excitations evolves into a polariton wavepacket with a large number of intracavity photons for interaction strengths at the conventional onset of ultrastrong coupling. This buildup of the cavity photon amplitude is accompanied by an effective lengthening of the vibrational mode that is comparable with a laser-induced vibrational excitation in free space. In contrast, polar molecules with a negative slope of the dipole function experience an effective mode shortening , under equivalent coupling conditions. We validate our predictions using realistic ab initio ground state potentials and dipole functions for HF and CO 2 molecules. We also propose a non-adiabatic state preparation scheme to generate vibrational polaritons with molecules near infrared nanoantennas for the spontaneous radiation of infrared quantum light.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of resetting on diffusion in a logarithmic potential. In this model, a particle diffusing in a potential U ( x ) = U 0 log | x | is reset, i.e., taken back to its initial position, with a constant rate r . We show that this analytically tractable model system exhibits a series of transitions as a function of a single parameter, βU 0 , the ratio of the strength of the potential to the thermal energy. For βU 0 −1, the potential is either weakly repulsive or attractive, and the diffusing particle eventually reaches the origin. In this case, we provide a closed-form expression for the subsequent first-passage time distribution and show that a resetting transition occurs at βU 0 = 5. Namely, we find that resetting can expedite arrival to the origin when −1 5. The results presented herein generalize the results for simple diffusion with resetting—a widely applicable model that is obtained from ours by setting U 0 = 0. Extending to general potential strengths, our work opens the door to theoretical and experimental investigation of a plethora of problems that bring together resetting and diffusion in logarithmic potential.},

To model this system, we utilize a quantum classical Liouville equation embedded inside of a classical master equation, which can be solved approximately with a recently developed algorithm combining diffusional effects and surface hopping between electronic states. We find that the addition of nuclear quantum effects through the proton coordinate can yield quantitatively (but not qualitatively) different IV curves under a potential sweep compared to electron transfer (ET). Additionally, we find that kinetic isotope effects give rise to a shift in the peak potential, but not the peak current, which would allow for quantification of whether an electrochemical ET event is proton-coupled or not. These findings suggest that it will be very difficult to completely understand coupled nuclear–electronic effects in electrochemical voltammetry experiments using only IV curves, and new experimental techniques will be needed to draw inferences about the nature of electrochemical PCET.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments suggest that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) may significantly modify ground-state chemical reactions and their rates even without external pumping. The intrinsic mechanism of this “vacuum-field catalysis” remains largely unclear. Generally, modifications of thermal reactions in the ground electronic states can be caused by equilibrium or non-equilibrium effects. The former are associated with modifications of the reactant equilibrium distribution as expressed by the transition state theory of chemical reaction rates, while the latter stem from the dynamics of reaching and leaving transition state configurations. Here, we examine how VSC can affect chemical reactions rates in a cavity environment according to transition state theory. Our approach is to examine the effect of coupling to cavity mode(s) on the potential of mean force (PMF) associated with the reaction coordinate. Within the context of classical nuclei and classical photons and also assuming no charge overlap between molecules, we find that while the PMF can be affected by the cavity environment, this effect is negligible for the usual micron-length cavities used to examine VSC situations.},

Incorporation and refinement of decoherence corrections into popular IT methods, e.g., Ehrenfest dynamics and trajectory surface hopping, is an important means of improving their accuracies. In this work, we identify a new challenge in the development of such decoherence corrections; when a system exists in a coherent superposition of three or more electronic states, coherences may decay unphysically when the decoherence correction is based on decoherence times assigned on a state-wise basis. As a solution, we introduce decoherence corrected Ehrenfest schemes based on decoherence times assigned on a state-pairwise basis. By application of these methods to a set of very simple one-dimensional model problems, we show that one of these state-pairwise methods (“collapse to a block”) correctly describes the loss of coherence between all pairs of states in our multistate model problems, whereas a method based on a state-wise description of coherence loss does not. The new one-dimensional models introduced here can serve as useful tests for other decoherence correction schemes.},

This indicates both that Na + transport will be more non-vehicular in nature and have improved kinetics vs Li + , and that increasing the salt concentration is beneficial. The systems studied were basically the first cation solvation shells of Li/NaPF 6 in propylene carbonate and acetonitrile using three solvent to salt ratios. Overall, the solvation shells are solvent rich at low salt concentrations, and as functions of concentration, the solvents are replaced by anions. As the SIB electrolytes display higher cation coordination and solvation numbers, we also expect an earlier onset of highly concentrated electrolyte behavior for SIB than LIB electrolytes. These observations should all have an impact on the design of electrolytes for optimal bulk properties, but also be useful with respect to interfacial dynamics.},

In this context, artificial neural networks (NNs) are promising candidates to construct the PES for a wide range of systems. However, the choice of suitable molecular descriptors remains a bottleneck for these algorithms. In this work, we show that a principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool to prepare an optimal set of descriptors and to build an efficient NN: this protocol leads to a substantial improvement of the NNs in learning and predicting a PES. Furthermore, the PCA provides a means to reduce the size of the input space (i.e., number of descriptors) without losing accuracy. As an example, we applied this novel approach to the computation of the high-dimensional PES describing the keto–enol tautomerism reaction occurring in the acetone molecule.},

It is not obvious how the choice of the descriptors affects the efficiency of the training and the accuracy of the final machine-learned model. In this work, we formulate an efficient method to calculate descriptors that can separately represent two- and three-body atomic distribution functions, and we examine the effects of including only two- or three-body descriptors, as well as including both, in the regression model. Our study indicates that non-linear mixing of two- and three-body descriptors is essential for an efficient training and a high accuracy of the final machine-learned model. The efficiency can be further improved by weighting the two-body descriptors more strongly. We furthermore examine a sparsification of the three-body descriptors. The three-body descriptors usually provide redundant representations of the atomistic structure, and the number of descriptors can be significantly reduced without loss of accuracy by applying an automatic sparsification using a principal component analysis. Visualization of the reduced descriptors using three-body distribution functions in real-space indicates that the sparsification automatically removes the components that are less significant for describing the distribution function.},

Key to this is the fact that the transformation that builds Cartesian angular momentum from the basic integrals, { [ 0 κ ] ( m + m ′ ) } ↦ { [ l κ ] ( m ) } ( κ ∈ { x , y , z }), can be phrased as a circulant-matrix/vector product, which is susceptible to FFTs.

  abstract = {We present a perspective on recent observations of the photoinduced phase separation of halides in multi-component lead-halide perovskites. The spontaneous phase separation of an initial homogeneous solid solution under steady-state illumination conditions is found experimentally to be reversible, stochastic, weakly dependent on morphology, yet strongly dependent on composition and thermodynamic state. Regions enriched in a specific halide species that form upon phase separation are self-limiting in size, pinned to specific compositions, and grow in number in proportion to the steady-state carrier concentration until saturation. These empirical observations of robustness rule out explanations based on specific defect structures and point to the local modulation of an existing miscibility phase transition in the presence of excess charge carriers. A model for rationalizing existing observations based on the coupling between composition, strain, and charge density fluctuations through the formation of polarons is reviewed.},

  abstract = {For particles diffusing in a potential, detailed balance guarantees the absence of net fluxes at equilibrium. Here, we show that the conventional detailed balance condition is a special case of a more general relation that works when the diffusion occurs in the presence of a distributed sink that eventually traps the particle. We use this relation to study the lifetime distribution of particles that start and are trapped at specified initial and final points. It turns out that when the sink strength at the initial point is nonzero, the initial and final points are interchangeable, i.e., the distribution is independent of which of the two points is initial and which is final. In other words, this conditional trapping time distribution possesses forward–backward symmetry.},

  abstract = {We propose edge expansion parallel cascade selection molecular dynamics (eePaCS-MD) as an efficient adaptive conformational sampling method to investigate the large-amplitude motions of proteins without prior knowledge of the conformational transitions. In this method, multiple independent MD simulations are iteratively conducted from initial structures randomly selected from the vertices of a multi-dimensional principal component subspace. This subspace is defined by an ensemble of protein conformations sampled during previous cycles of eePaCS-MD. The edges and vertices of the conformational subspace are determined by solving the “convex hull problem.” The sampling efficiency of eePaCS-MD is achieved by intensively repeating MD simulations from the vertex structures, which increases the probability of rare event occurrence to explore new large-amplitude collective motions. The conformational sampling efficiency of eePaCS-MD was assessed by investigating the open–close transitions of glutamine binding protein, maltose/maltodextrin binding protein, and adenylate kinase and comparing the results to those obtained using related methods. In all cases, the open–close transitions were simulated in ∼10 ns of simulation time or less, offering 1–3 orders of magnitude shorter simulation time compared to conventional MD. Furthermore, we show that the combination of eePaCS-MD and accelerated MD can further enhance conformational sampling efficiency, which reduced the total computational cost of observing the open–close transitions by at most 36\%.},

Our results demonstrate that the critical nucleus sizes and the heights of free-energy barriers do not significantly depend on the molecular weight of the polymer; however, the nucleation rate decreases with the increase in molecular weight. Moreover, an analysis of the composition of the critical nucleus suggests that intra-molecular growth of the nucleated cluster does not contribute significantly to crystallization for this system.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for the chiral separation and alignment of active paramagnetic particles in a two-dimensional square box with periodic boundary conditions. In a rotational magnetic field, the dynamic behavior of magnetized particles is strongly determined by the competition between the magnetic interaction and differing chirality. By suitably tailoring the parameters, active particles with different chirality can be aggregated into different clusters and separated. However, when either the magnetic interaction or chirality difference is dominant, the particles are prone to mixing. In addition, the external rotational magnetic field plays a decisive role in aligning particles. The numerical results show that there exists an optimal strength and rotation frequency of the magnetic field, as well as a rotational diffusion coefficient, self-propulsion velocity, and packing fraction, at which the separation coefficient takes its maximal value. The proposed method can be exploited to separate naturally occurring chiral active particles.},

  abstract = {We examine the symmetry-breaking effect of fixed constellations of particles on the surface-directed spinodal decomposition of binary blends in the presence of particles whose surfaces have a preferential affinity for one of the components. Our phase-field simulations indicate that the phase separation morphology in the presence of particle arrays can be tuned to have a continuous, droplet, lamellar, or hybrid morphology depending on the interparticle spacing, blend composition, and time. In particular, when the interparticle spacing is large compared to the spinodal wavelength, a transient target pattern composed of alternate rings of preferred and non-preferred phases emerges at early times, tending to adopt the symmetry of the particle configuration. We reveal that such target patterns stabilize for certain characteristic length, time, and composition scales characteristic of the pure phase-separating mixture. To illustrate the general range of phenomena exhibited by mixture-particle systems, we simulate the effects of single-particle, multi-particle, and cluster–particle systems having multiple geometrical configurations of the particle characteristic of pattern substrates on phase separation. Our simulations show that tailoring the particle configuration, or substrate pattern configuration, a relative fluid-particle composition should allow the desirable control of the phase separation morphology as in block copolymer materials, but where the scales accessible to this approach of organizing phase-separated fluids usually are significantly larger. Limited experiments confirm the trends observed in our simulations, which should provide some guidance in engineering patterned blend and other mixtures of technological interest.},

The current study has discovered that a liquid polymeric thin film is densified under the application of a high frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW). The experimental evidence is the decrease in film thickness and the increase in refractive index, measured by ellipsometry, of polyisobutylene thin films deposited on the solid substrates, when a high frequency SAW (39.5 MHz) is applied to the system. Further investigations by polarization-resolved single molecule fluorescence microscopy have demonstrated that the rotational motion of fluorescent probes doped inside the liquid film is retarded and the dynamical heterogeneity is reduced. The results demonstrate that the application of SAW of high frequency makes the thin polymeric liquid film densified and more dynamically homogeneous.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, computational tools have been instrumental in understanding the behavior of materials at the nano-meter length scale. Until recently, these tools have been dominated by two levels of theory: quantum mechanics (QM) based methods and semi-empirical/classical methods. The former are time-intensive but accurate and versatile, while the latter methods are fast but are significantly limited in veracity, versatility, and transferability. Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have shown the potential to bridge the gap between these two chasms due to their (i) low cost, (ii) accuracy, (iii) transferability, and (iv) ability to be iteratively improved. In this work, we further extend the scope of ML for atomistic simulations by capturing the temperature dependence of the mechanical and structural properties of bulk platinum through molecular dynamics simulations. We compare our results directly with experiments, showcasing that ML methods can be used to accurately capture large-scale materials phenomena that are out of reach of QM calculations. We also compare our predictions with those of a reliable embedded atom method potential. We conclude this work by discussing how ML methods can be used to push the boundaries of nano-scale materials research by bridging the gap between QM and experimental methods.},

The high order harmonic generation (HHG) spectra of SWCNTs are studied as a function of the intensity ( I 0 ) and frequency ( ω 0 ) of the incident field, and SWCNTs length as well. It is found that the near field generated by a Ag nanoparticle has an overall enhancement to the molecular HHG in all the energy range, and it extends the HHG spectra to high energy. The inhomogeneity of the near field results in the appearance of even-order harmonics, and their corresponding spectral intensities are sensitive to ω 0 , therefore the near field’s gradient. When ω 0 is far away from the frequency of plasmon resonance of the silver nanosphere ( ω c ), the interference between the incident and scattering light beams extends the spectral range and makes the HHG spectra more sensitive to I 0 , while at ω 0 = ω c , the impact of the interference on the spectra is negligible.},

We develop lattice-gas (LG) models within a cluster expansion framework, which includes about 50 interaction parameters. These LG models are developed based on density functional theory (DFT) analysis of the energetics of key adlayer configurations in combination with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the LG models to identify statistically relevant adlayer motifs, i.e., model development is based entirely on theoretical considerations. The MC simulation guides additional DFT analysis and iterative model refinement. Given their complexity, development of optimal models is also aided by strategies from supervised machine learning. The model for S successfully captures ordering motifs over a broader range of coverage than achieved by previous models, and models for Se and Te capture the features of ordering, which are distinct from those for S. More specifically, the modeling for all three chalcogens successfully explains the linear adatom rows (also subtle differences between them) observed at low coverages of ∼0.1 monolayer. The model for S also leads to a new possible explanation for the experimentally observed phase with a (5 × 5)-type low energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern at 0.28 ML and to predictions for LEED patterns that would be observed with Se and Te at this coverage.},

Simulation provides the equilibrium vapor phases at several subcritical temperatures, in which the clusters comprising up to 26 atoms are detected and analyzed. The cluster size distributions are found to match both the two-parameter model and the classical nucleation theory with the Tolman correction. For the gold liquid–vapor interface, the ratio of the Tolman length to the radius of a molecular cell in the liquid amounts to ∼0.16, almost exactly the value at which both models are identical. It is demonstrated that the lightest clusters have the chain-like structure, which is close to the freely jointed chain. Thus, the smallest clusters can be treated as the quasi-fractals with the fractal dimensionality close to two. Our analysis indicates that the cluster structural transition from the solid-like to chain-like geometry occurs in a wide temperature range around 2500 K.},

Modeling the excess electrons as interacting electrons confined to a sphere, we find that the excitation evolves from single-particle to plasmonic with increasing number of electrons at fixed density, and the threshold number of electrons to produce a plasmon increases with density due to quantum confinement and electron–hole attraction. In addition, the excitation passes through an intermediate regime where it is best characterized as an intraband exciton. We compare equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with those of more affordable single-excitation theories and identify the inclusion of electron–hole interactions as essential to describing the evolution of the excitation. Despite the simplicity of our model, the results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental spectra of doped ZnO nanoparticles at a doping density of 1.4 × 10 20 cm −3 .

  abstract = {Heat transfer across fluid–solid interfaces in nanoconfinement has received significant attention due to its relevance in nanoscale systems. In this study, we investigate the Kapitza resistance at the water–graphene interface with the help of classical molecular dynamics simulation techniques in conjunction with our recently proposed equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) method [S. Alosious et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 194502 (2019)]. The size effect of the Kapitza resistance on different factors such as the number of graphene layers, the cross-sectional area, and the width of the water block was studied. The Kapitza resistance decreases slightly with an increase in the number of layers, while the influence of the cross-sectional area and the width of the water block is negligible. The variation in the Kapitza resistance as a function of the number of graphene layers is attributed to the large phonon mean free path along the graphene cross-plane. An optimum water–graphene system, which is independent of size effects, was selected, and the same was used to determine the Kapitza resistance using the predicted EMD method. The values obtained from both the EMD and the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) methods were compared for different potentials and water models, and the results are shown to be in good agreement.

  abstract = {An investigation to optimize the application of the third-generation charge optimized many-body (COMB3) interatomic potential and associated input parameters was carried out through the study of solid–liquid interactions in classical molecular dynamics simulations. The rates of these molecular interactions are understood through the wetting rates of water nano-droplets on a bare copper (111) surface. Implementing the Langevin thermostat, the influence of simulation time step, the number of atoms in the system, the frequency at which charge equilibration is performed, and the temperature relaxation rate are all examined. The results indicate that time steps of 0.4 fs are possible when using longer relaxation times for the system temperature, which is almost double the typical time step used for reactive potentials. The use of the charge equilibration allows for a fewer atomic layers to be used in the Cu slab. In addition, charge equilibrium schemes do not need to be performed every time step to ensure accurate charge transfer. Interestingly, the rate of wetting for the nanodroplets is dominantly dependent on the temperature relaxation time, which is predicted to significantly change the viscosity of the water droplets. This work provides a pathway for optimizing simulations using the COMB3 reactive interatomic potential.},

  abstract = {Fundamental measure theory (FMT) is commonly considered within classical density functional theory (DFT) to describe inhomogeneous hard-sphere (HS) fluids. As opposed to the original FMT of Rosenfeld [Phys. Rev. Lett. 63 , 980 (1989)], the dimensional interpolation FMT (DI-FMT) is a specific version of FMT which is well adapted to accurately describe the freezing of HSs and adsorption in extreme confinements by including tensorial weighted densities. The computation of these weighted densities is generally performed analytically for specific simple scenarios (e.g., planar, cylindrical, or spherical geometries), and this method is challenging to apply to pores of generic geometry. On the other hand, numerical approaches, using fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, can be adapted to deal with arbitrary 3D geometries. Computations with tensorial weights are, however, generally not considered with these approaches. In our current work, the FFT computation of weighted densities is detailed for tensorial quantities. We present a DI-FMT in general 3D computational space, for an arbitrary pore geometry, to obtain density profiles of pure HS fluids or mixtures. The other thermodynamic quantities, such as surface tension or excess adsorption, can then be determined by using the standard DFT framework. As an example of the implementation of the method, we present the results for the adsorption on a hard-wall model, representative of the solid structure of an anisotropic zeolite cavity.},

Here, we combine transition interface sampling with an extensive committor analysis to investigate the atomistic mechanisms during the initial stages of nucleation in Ni 3 Al. The formation and growth of crystalline clusters from the melt are strongly influenced by the interplay between three descriptors: the size, crystallinity, and chemical short-range order of the emerging nuclei. We demonstrate that it is essential to include all three features in a multi-dimensional reaction coordinate to correctly describe the nucleation mechanism, where, in particular, the chemical short-range order plays a crucial role in the stability of small clusters. The necessity of identifying multi-dimensional reaction coordinates is expected to be of key importance for the atomistic characterization of nucleation processes in complex, multi-component systems.},

It is also found that the proper strength of the ppπ bonding between neighboring N atoms plays a prime role in the formation of the flatband. In addition, when the compound is doped with holes, the electrons at the flatband are fully polarized, showing a ferromagnetic character.

Finally, we employ our theory to study the first-order N – N TB phase transition, for which we find that K 33 as well as its renormalized version K 33 e ff remain positive at the transition, whereas K 33 e ff vanishes at the nematic spinodal.

  abstract = {Kinetic rate factors of crystallization have a direct effect on formation and growth of an ordered solid phase in supercooled liquids and glasses. Using the crystallizing Lennard-Jones liquid as an example, in the present work, we perform a direct quantitative estimation of values of the key crystallization kinetic rate factors—the rate g + of particle attachments to a crystalline nucleus and the rate g − of particle detachments from a nucleus. We propose a numerical approach, according to which a statistical treatment of the results of molecular dynamics simulations was performed without using any model functions and/or fitting parameters. This approach allows one to accurately estimate the critical nucleus size n c . We find that for the growing nuclei, whose sizes are larger than the critical size n c , the dependence of these kinetic rate factors on the nucleus size n follows a power law. In the case of the subnucleation regime, when the nuclei are smaller than n c , the n -dependence of the quantity g + is strongly determined by the inherent microscopic properties of a system, and this dependence cannot be described in the framework of any universal law (for example, a power law). It has been established that the dependence of the growth rate of a crystalline nucleus on its size goes into the stationary regime at the size n &gt; 3 n c particles.},

Using a least squares fitting procedure, we can then determine the structures and contributions of dimers, trimers, and tetramers embedded in small droplets. While dimers prefer a stable gas phase structure, trimers and tetramers seem to forgo the highly symmetric gas phase structures and prefer compact cuts from the crystalline structure of CS 2 . In larger droplets containing more than 12 CS 2 monomers, the diffraction profile is consistent with a three-dimensional nanostructure of bulk CS 2 .

For ttD in n -hexane, 2-photon-excited TA spectra indicate that the 2A g state is located above 1-photon allowed 1B u ( S 1 ) by ∼1000 cm −1 . Following S 0 → S 1 optical excitation, the isomerization occurs via torsion about a butadiene double bond to perpendicular molecular configuration P . The P -state is detected in ccD with an excited-state absorption band at 390 nm. This P -band develops during S 1 → P half-torsion with time of 0.15 ps, followed further by P → S 0 half-torsion and simultaneous decay with 1.6 ps in acetonitrile and 5 ps in n -hexane. In addition, two oscillation cycles between P and S 1 population are observed before equilibration in n -hexane. For ctD, an indication of rising and decaying P is found in acetonitrile. The vast majority of ctD species photoisomerizes to ttD and not to ccD, in agreement a with calculated low torsional barrier about the cis double bond and high barrier about the trans double bond. Photoisomerization yield Y and time τ i depend drastically on the solvent polarity. Thus, in n -hexane, the isomerization ttD → ctD has yield Y tt,ct = 0.1 and time τ i = 829 ps, while in acetonitrile, Y tt,ct = 0.4 and τ i = 27 ps. The 30-fold acceleration of the isomerization in acetonitrile clearly reflects a highly polar character of P , consistent with a dipole moment μ P &gt; 9.6 D.

First, we present a simple cross section model for dissociation that captures recent ab initio data accurately. The cross section model is analytically integrated over Boltzmann distributions and general non-Boltzmann distributions to derive a general non-equilibrium dissociation model. The general non-Boltzmann model systematically incorporates key physics such as dependence on translational energy, rotational energy, vibrational energy, internal energy, centrifugal barrier, and non-Boltzmann effects such as overpopulation and depletion of high energy states. The model is shown to reproduce the rates from quasi-classical trajectory calculations for Boltzmann distributions of internal energy states. The reduced rates in a non-equilibrium steady state due to depletion of high internal energy states are also predicted well by the model. Furthermore, the model predicts the enhanced rates as observed due to significant overpopulation of high vibrational states relative to Boltzmann distributions while the gas is in non-equilibrium in the transient phase. The model provides a computationally inexpensive way of incorporating non-equilibrium chemistry without incurring additional cost in the existing computational tools. Further comparisons of the model are carried out in Paper II, where simplifications to the model are proposed based on the results.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a generalized model for nonequilibrium vibrational energy distribution functions. The model can be used, in place of equilibrium (Boltzmann) distribution functions, when deriving reaction rate constants for high-temperature nonequilibrium flows. The distribution model is derived based on the recent ab initio calculations, carried out using potential energy surfaces developed using accurate computational quantum chemistry techniques for the purpose of studying air chemistry at high temperatures. Immediately behind a strong shock wave, the vibrational energy distribution is non-Boltzmann. Specifically, as the gas internal energy rapidly excites to a high temperature, overpopulation of the high-energy tail (relative to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) is observed in ab initio simulations. As the gas excites further and begins to dissociate, a depletion of the high-energy tail is observed, during a time-invariant quasi-steady state. Since the probability of dissociation is exponentially related to the vibrational energy of the dissociating molecule, the overall dissociation rate is sensitive to the populations of these high vibrational energy states. The non-Boltzmann effects captured by the new model either enhance or reduce the dissociation rate relative to that obtained assuming a Boltzmann distribution. This article proposes a simple model that is demonstrated to reproduce these non-Boltzmann effects quantitatively when compared to ab initio simulations.},

  abstract = {To investigate the chemical isotope-exchange reactions within a system composed of a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium (H/D) in the plasma media, the ReaxFF HD potential was parameterized against an appropriate quantum mechanics (QM)-based training set. These QM data involve structures and energies related to bond dissociation, angle distortion, and an exchange reaction of the tri-atomic molecular ions, H 3 + , D 3 + , H 2 D + , and D 2 H + , produced in the hydrogen plasma. Using the ReaxFF HD potential, a range of reactive molecular dynamics simulations were performed on different mixtures of H/D systems. Analysis of the reactions involved in the production of these tri-atomic molecular ions was carried out over 1 ns simulations. The results show that the ReaxFF HD potential can properly model isotope-exchange reactions of tri-atomic molecular ions and that it also has a perfect transferability to reactions taking place in these systems. In our simulations, we observed some intermediate molecules (H 2 , D 2 , and HD) that undergo secondary reactions to form the tri-atomic molecular ions as the most likely products in the hydrogen plasma. Moreover, there remains a preference for D in the produced molecular ions, which is related to the lower zero-point energy of the D-enriched species, showing the isotope effects at the heart of the ReaxFF HD potential.},

  abstract = {Developed over the past decade, TeraChem is an electronic structure and ab initio molecular dynamics software package designed from the ground up to leverage graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform large-scale ground and excited state quantum chemistry calculations in the gas and the condensed phase. TeraChem’s speed stems from the reformulation of conventional electronic structure theories in terms of a set of individually optimized high-performance electronic structure operations (e.g., Coulomb and exchange matrix builds, one- and two-particle density matrix builds) and rank-reduction techniques (e.g., tensor hypercontraction). Recent efforts have encapsulated these core operations and provided language-agnostic interfaces. This greatly increases the accessibility and flexibility of TeraChem as a platform to develop new electronic structure methods on GPUs and provides clear optimization targets for emerging parallel computing architectures.},

  abstract = {Many of the non-adiabatic processes in the condensed phase are affected by the interaction with the environment, as exemplified by Marcus theory. However, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations with explicitly including the environment are computationally expensive because of the extended system size, suggesting the need for an efficient scheme applicable to huge systems. In this work, time-derivative non-adiabatic coupling (TDNAC) calculation algorithms were developed in the framework of the divide-and-conquer (DC) time-dependent (TD) density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, which is an extension of the TD-DFTB for larger systems based on the fragmentation-based DC scheme. The developed algorithms were incorporated into a fewest-switches trajectory surface hopping (FSSH) routine. The calculated TDNAC and the FSSH results were sufficiently accurate compared to the conventional TD-DFTB results. Use of the DC-TD-DFTB provided a significant reduction in the central processing unit (CPU) time vs that of the TD-DFTB, where the CPU time remained constant irrespective of the total system size. It was also confirmed that the present method is not only efficient but also improves the numerical stability of TDNAC calculations.},

We start with a short historical perspective of how the project began and go on to discuss its current feature set. ORCA has grown into a rather comprehensive general-purpose package for theoretical research in all areas of chemistry and many neighboring disciplines such as materials sciences and biochemistry. ORCA features density functional theory, a range of wavefunction based correlation methods, semi-empirical methods, and even force-field methods. A range of solvation and embedding models is featured as well as a complete intrinsic to ORCA quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics engine. A specialty of ORCA always has been a focus on transition metals and spectroscopy as well as a focus on applicability of the implemented methods to “real-life” chemical applications involving systems with a few hundred atoms. In addition to being efficient, user friendly, and, to the largest extent possible, platform independent, ORCA features a number of methods that are either unique to ORCA or have been first implemented in the course of the ORCA development. Next to a range of spectroscopic and magnetic properties, the linear- or low-order single- and multi-reference local correlation methods based on pair natural orbitals (domain based local pair natural orbital methods) should be mentioned here. Consequently, ORCA is a widely used program in various areas of chemistry and spectroscopy with a current user base of over 22 000 registered users in academic research and in industry.},

CT states were determined by natural transition orbital hole–particle plots and CT distance D CT and the amount of charge transferred q CT indices. We first consider a resonance Raman (RR) model based on the Albrecht approach and calculate the ratio of the Herzberg–Teller (HT) B or C term to the Franck–Condon (FC) A term for a totally symmetric a 1 vibrational mode exciting in the lowest energy CT state. Using a dimensionless upper limit to the displacement factor ∆ = 0.05 in the FC term based on the examination of overtones in experimental spectra and a calculated HT coupling constant h CT = 0.439 eV/Å(amu) 1/2 in the HT term, we calculated the scattering ratio of the HT to FC intensities as 147. This example indicated that for totally symmetric modes, the scattering intensity would all come from HT scattering. To further verify this result, we used the general time-dependent-RR formulation of Baiardi, Bloino, and Barone with the adiabatic Hessian model to calculate the FC, the Frank–Condon and Herzberg–Teller (FCHT), and the HT terms for pyridine in the C 2v Ag 6 -pyridine complexes. For all cases we studied with pyridine in two orientations either parallel or perpendicular to the planar Ag 6 cluster, the HT terms, FCHT + HT, dominate the FC term in the CT RR spectrum. These results indicate that for CT SERS, the intensity of all the totally and non-totally symmetric vibrational modes should come from the HT effect.},

  abstract = {Water exchange between the coordination shells of metal cations in aqueous solutions is fundamental in understanding their role in biochemical processes. Despite the importance, the microscopic mechanism of water exchange in the first hydration shell of Mg 2+ has not been resolved since the exchange dynamics is out of reach for conventional all-atom simulations. To overcome this challenge, transition path sampling is applied to resolve the kinetic pathways, to characterize the reaction mechanism and to provide an accurate estimate of the exchange rate. The results reveal that water exchange involves the concerted motion of two exchanging water molecules and the collective rearrangement of all water molecules in the first hydration shell. Using a recently developed atomistic model for Mg 2+ , water molecules remain in the first hydration shell for about 40 ms, a time considerably longer compared to the 0.1 ms predicted by transition state theory based on the coordinates of a single water molecule. The discrepancy between these timescales arises from the neglected degrees of freedom of the second exchanging water molecule that plays a decisive role in the reaction mechanism. The approach presented here contributes molecular insights into the dynamics of water around metal cations and provides the basis for developing accurate atomistic models or for understanding complex biological processes involving metal cations.},

We derive exact expressions for underdamped and overdamped Langevin dynamics and examine its efficiency for a simple model system (Mueller’s potential) and for bond breaking in solution. The use of a biasing force (wind) significantly enhances the sampling of otherwise rare trajectories but also introduces an exponential weight to the trajectories that significantly impact the value of the statistics. In our examples, computing averages and standard deviations are not better using wind compared to straightforward Milestoning. However, the biasing force is useful for highly steep energy landscapes. On these landscapes, the probability of sampling straightforward Milestoning trajectories, which overcome the barrier, is low and the biasing force enables the observations of these rare events.},

The method is then applied to the 1D Hubbard model, the uniform electron gas (UEG) at warm, dense conditions, and some simple materials. The performance of model systems at high temperatures is encouraging: for the one-dimensional Hubbard model, FT-CCSD provides a qualitatively accurate description of finite-temperature correlation effects even at U = 8, and it allows for the computation of systematically improvable exchange–correlation energies of the warm, dense UEG over a wide range of conditions.

The method utilizes the fragment charge difference to define electronic diabatic states and to apply an electrostatic potential in a form of a uniform potential difference that mimics solvation effects on the relative energies of the electronic states. The two-state generalized Mulliken–Hush method is used to obtain the effective electronic coupling as the nondiagonal element of the effective Hamiltonian that is derived based on the Green’s function approach and the quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. A theoretical basis is provided for the dependence of the calculated effective electronic coupling on the applied potential and for how to find the optimal potential to give the desired effective electronic coupling that coincides with the result of the minimum energy splitting method. The method is applied to typical D–B–A molecules and gives the effective electronic couplings in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates.},

  abstract = {Atom-centered neural network (ANN) potentials have shown promise in computational simulations and are recognized as both efficient and sufficiently accurate to describe systems involving bond formation and breaking. A key step in the development of ANN potentials is to represent atomic coordinates as suitable inputs for a neural network, commonly described as fingerprints. The accuracy and efficiency of the ANN potentials depend strongly on the selection of these fingerprints. Here, we propose an optimization strategy of atomic fingerprints to improve the performance of ANN potentials. Specifically, a set of fingerprints is optimized to fit a set of pre-selected template functions in the f * g space, where f and g are the fingerprint and the pair distribution function for each type of interatomic interaction (e.g., a pair or 3-body). With such an optimization strategy, we have developed an ANN potential for the Pd 13 H 2 nanoparticle system that exhibits a significant improvement to the one based upon standard template functions. We further demonstrate that the ANN potential can be used with the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method, which has strict requirements for the smoothness of the potential. The algorithm proposed here facilitates the development of better ANN potentials, which can broaden their application in computational simulations.},

  abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites have been widely investigated for the selective adsorption of small molecules via redox mechanisms where charge transfer can take place between the binding site and the adsorbate of interest. Quantum-chemical screening methods based on density functional theory have emerged as a promising route to accelerate the discovery of MOFs with enhanced binding affinities toward various adsorbates. However, the success of this approach is linked to the accuracy of the underlying density functional approximations (DFAs). In this work, we compare commonly used generalized gradient approximation (GGA), GGA+ U , and meta-GGA exchange-correlation functionals in modeling redox-dependent binding at open metal sites in MOFs using O 2 and N 2 as representative small molecules. We find that the self-interaction error inherent to the widely used Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA predicts metal sites that are artificially redox-active, as evidenced by their strong binding affinities, short metal–adsorbate bond distances, and large degree of charge transfer. The incorporation of metal-specific, empirical Hubbard U corrections based on the transition metal oxide literature systematically reduces the redox activity of the open metal sites, often improving agreement with experiment. Additionally, the binding behavior shifts from strong chemisorption to weaker physisorption as a function of U . The M06-L meta-GGA typically predicts binding energies between those of PBE-D3(BJ) and PBE-D3(BJ)+ U when using empirically derived U values from the transition metal oxide literature. Despite the strong sensitivity of the binding affinities toward a given DFA, the GGA, GGA+ U , and meta-GGA approaches often yield the same qualitative trends and structure–property relationships.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of explicit representations of fluorescent dyes attached via a linker to a protein allow, e.g., probing commonly used approximations for dye localization and/or orientation or modeling Förster resonance energy transfer. However, setting up and performing such MD simulations with the AMBER suite of biomolecular simulation programs has remained challenging due to the unavailability of an easy-to-use set of parameters within AMBER. Here, we adapted the AMBER-DYES parameter set derived by Graen et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 10 , 5505 (2014)] into “AMBER-DYES in AMBER” to generate a force field applicable within AMBER for commonly used fluorescent dyes and linkers attached to a protein. In particular, the computationally efficient graphics processing unit (GPU) implementation of the AMBER MD engine can now be exploited to overcome sampling issues of dye movements. The implementation is compatible with state-of-the-art force fields such as GAFF, GAFF2, ff99SB, ff14SB, lipid17, and GLYCAM_06j, which allows simulating post-translationally modified proteins and/or protein–ligand complexes and/or proteins in membrane environments. It is applicable with frequently used water models such as TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, and OPC. For ease of use, a LEaP-based workflow was created, which allows attaching (multiple) dye/linker combinations to a protein prior to further system preparation steps. Following the parameter development described by Graen et al. [J. Chem.

The key result is the identification of the physical features driving this anomalous behavior. The intermediate-flexible boundary is associated with a dynamic onset with increasing depolymerization that enhances the growing atomic motion with a reduced internal stress, whereas the intermediate-stressed rigid boundary exhibits a substantial increase in the temperature at which the relaxation is maximum.

  abstract = {Inspired by advances in the chemical synthesis of interlocking polymer architectures, extensive molecular dynamics simulations have been conducted to study the dynamical properties of poly[ n ]catenanes—polymers composed entirely of interlocking rings—in the melt state. Both the degree of polymerization (number of links) and the number of beads per ring are systematically varied, and the results are compared to linear and ring polymers. A simple Rouse-like model is presented, and its analytical solution suggests a decomposition of the dynamics into “ring-like” and “linear-like” regimes at short and long times, respectively. In agreement with this picture, multiple sub-diffusive regimes are observed in the monomer mean-squared-displacements even though interchain entanglement is not prevalent in the system. However, the Rouse-type model does not account for the topological effects of the mechanical bonds, which significantly alter the dynamics at intermediate length scales both within the rings and at the chain segment scales. The stress relaxation in the system is extremely rapid and may be conveniently separated into ring-like and linear-like contributions, again in agreement with the Rouse picture. However, the viscosity has a non-monotonic dependence on the ring size for long chains, which disagrees strongly with theoretical predictions. This unexpected observation cannot be explained in terms of chain disentanglement and is inconsistent with other measures of polymer relaxation. Possible mechanisms for this behavior are proposed and implications for materials design are discussed.},

  abstract = {Iron over silica catalytic systems have attracted considerable attention due to their activity and selectivity in different reactions, for instance, in the hydrodeoxygenation process. Here, the grafting mechanisms of iron under various forms (one atom, two atoms, or a cluster) on silica surfaces are studied using ab initio calculations. Various geometries with different locations of iron on the silica structure have been investigated, and it is found that a strong interaction between iron and the silanol groups takes place, mostly driven by the formation of Fe–O–Si bonds, and in few cases by nearby surface OH groups, creating Fe–OH–Si bonds. For the cluster, we show that the most favorable adsorption mode induces a strong effect on the silica surface accompanied with a large charge transfer, making it very stable and promising for a large panel of applications.},

We observed a few ps long relaxation dynamics that can be ascribed to the band to band carrier recombination, in the absence of any contribution from many-body and trap assisted processes. The transient conductivity spectra show that the polaron dynamics is strongly modulated by the presence of a rich exciton population. The polarization field resulting from the exciton formation acts as the source of a restoring force that localizes polarons. This is revealed by the presence of a negative imaginary conductivity. Our results show that the dynamics of excitons in 2D perovskites at room temperature can be detected by monitoring their effect on the conductivity of the photoinduced polaronic carrier.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate the construction of heterojunction arrays for boosting solar water splitting by combining in situ guided growth of heterointerfaces and energy band tuning. By directly growing an ultrathin Fe 2 WO 6 layer on a preformed WO 3 nanosheet array in full coverage, a uniform and dense array of intimately contacted WO 3 /Fe 2 WO 6 heterojunction was created. The heterojunction array shows not only a largely broadened visible light absorption range but also a built-in interface polarization to accelerate hole transfer from WO 3 to Fe 2 WO 6 . Meanwhile, fine-tuning to match energy levels at the heterojunction was achieved by doping WO 3 with Fe (Fe-WO 3 ), leading to improved electrical conductivity and reduced charge recombination. Photoanodes based on such heterojunction arrays have shown significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance, clearly arising from the above-mentioned efforts. Furthermore, by decorating FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalysts on the heterojunction arrays in tandem, the surface water oxidation kinetics was considerably accelerated, and the resulting Fe-WO 3 /Fe 2 WO 6 /FeOOH/NiOOH photoanode achieved a photocurrent density of 2.78 mA/cm 2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. This work highlights the benefits of in situ construction of heterojunction arrays for enhancing the PEC performance.},

  abstract = {Quantum dot (QD) sensitized triplet exciton generation has demonstrated promising applications in various fields such as photon up-conversion through triplet–triplet annihilation. However, how direct triplet energy transfer from the QD to the acceptor through Dexter energy transfer (DET) competes with other processes, including Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and charge transfer, remains poorly understood. Herein, the competition of these pathways for QD-sensitized triplet excited state generation in CdSe QD-modified boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes is studied using transient absorption spectroscopy. After excitation of the CdSe QD with 500 nm pulses, the BODIPY triplet excited state is generated through charge recombination in a charge separated intermediate state (QD −· –BODIPY +· ). This intermediate state is populated either through FRET from the excited QD to BODIPY followed by electron transfer from the singlet excited state of BODIPY to the QD or through hole transfer from the excited QD to BODIPY. The triplet excited state generation efficiencies from the FRET and hole transfer pathways are estimated to be (6.18 ± 1.39)\% and (13.5 ± 3.1)\%, respectively. Compared to these indirect pathways, direct DET from the QD to the BODIPY triplet state is kinetically not competitive. These results demonstrate that sequential charge transfer can be an efficient pathway for triplet excited state generation in QD–acceptor complexes.},

In this work, the self-reduction of Ni 2+ was confirmed during the photocatalytic H 2 evolution in the CdS/Ni(OH) 2 hybrid materials. Meanwhile, in situ formed metallic Ni plays an important role in the increase in the catalytic activity. Fortunately, only a few photo-induced electrons participate in the reduction of Ni 2+ in CdS/Ni(OH) 2 hybrid materials. The existence of metallic Ni would prevent more Ni 2+ from self-reduction. The synergistic effect of Ni(OH) 2 and metallic Ni contributes to the improvement of H 2 evolution of CdS nanorods.},

  abstract = {Determining local structures of molecular systems helps the scientific and technological understanding of the function of materials. Molecular simulations provide microscopic information on molecular systems, but analyzing the resulting local structures is a non-trivial task. Many kinds of order parameters have been developed for detecting such local structures. Bond-orientational order parameters are promising for classifying local structures and have been used to analyze systems with such structures as body-centered cubic, face-centered cubic, hexagonal close-packed, and liquid. A specific set of order parameters derived from Lechner’s definitional equation are widely used to classify complex local structures. However, there has been no thorough investigation of the classification capability of other Lechner parameters, despite their potential to precisely distinguish local structures. In this work, we evaluate the classification capability of 112 species of bond-orientational order parameters including Lechner’s definitions. A total of 234 248 combinations of these parameters are also evaluated. The evaluation is systematically and automatically performed using machine learning techniques. To distinguish the four types of local structures, we determine the better set of two order parameters by comparing with a conventional set. A set of three order parameters is also suggested for better accuracy. Therefore, the machine learning scheme in the present study enables the systematic, accurate, and automatic mining of effective order parameters for classifying crystal structures.},

The photodetachment spectrum revealed a dipole-bound state (DBS) 202(4) cm −1 below the detachment threshold and 38 resonances corresponding to the vibrational levels of the DBS. By tuning the detachment laser to these above-threshold resonances, we obtained 38 resonantly enhanced photoelectron spectra, which were highly non–Franck–Condon as a result of mode-selective vibrational autodetachment from the DBS. The resonances were assigned by comparing the resonant and non-resonant photoelectron spectra, assisted by the computed vibrational frequencies. Specifically, vibrational features with low Franck–Condon factors or from Franck–Condon-forbidden vibrational modes were significantly enhanced in the resonant photoelectron spectra, resulting in much richer spectroscopic information. The electron affinity of the 2-naphthoxy radical was measured accurately to be 19 387(4) cm −1 or 2.4037(5) eV. In addition, a total of 17 vibrational frequencies were obtained for the 2-naphthoxy radical. In particular, seven Franck–Condon-forbidden out-of-plane bending modes, including the two lowest frequency modes (ν 48 at 102 cm −1 and ν 47 at 171 cm −1 ), were observed, demonstrating the advantages of combining photodetachment spectroscopy and resonant photoelectron spectroscopy in obtaining vibrational information for polar radical species via DBS.},

Harmonic vibrational frequency computations identify three ( H 2 S ) 2 configurations as minima, four as transition states, and five as higher-order saddle points (n i = 0, n i = 1, and n i ≥ 2, respectively, where n i is the number of imaginary frequencies).

The model takes into account the non-diagonality of the scattering operator within the line space as well as, in a correct way, the double degeneracy of the j, k levels when k ≠ 0. Transitions between such levels should be considered as doublets whose components may be coupled by the line mixing process. It has been shown that, at low pressure, the inversion of the experimental data will strongly depend on the splitting between the two components of a doublet. When it is significant, one can measure independently both the width of one component and the intra-doublet coupling matrix element. Otherwise, one can only measure the sum of these two elements. Comparisons with measurements show that the present formalism leads to accurate predictions of the experimental line shapes.},

The NN, trained on 432 399 reference structures from MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations, has a mean absolute error of 0.0453 kcal/mol and a root mean squared error of 1.186 kcal mol −1 for a test set of 27 399 structures. For the isomerization process AA → VA, the minimum dynamical path implies that the C–H vibration and the C–C–H (with H being the transferring H-atom) and the C–C–O angles are involved to surmount the 68.2 kcal/mol barrier. Using an excess energy of 93.6 kcal/mol—the typical energy available in the solar spectrum and sufficient to excite to the first electronically excited state—to initialize the molecular dynamics, no isomerization to VA is observed on the 500 ns time scale. Only with excess energies of ∼127.6 kcal/mol (including the zero point energy of the AA molecule), isomerization occurs on the nanosecond time scale. Given that collisional quenching times under tropospheric conditions are ∼1 ns, it is concluded that formation of VA following photoexcitation of AA from actinic photons is unlikely.

The Duschinsky mixings are different in the two molecules, owing to shifts in vibrational wavenumber and variations in the form of the fundamental vibrations between the different electronic states. There is a very unusual behavior for two of the m FT vibrations, where apparently different conclusions for the identity of two S 1 vibrations arise from the 2D-LIF and ZEKE spectra. We compare the experimental observations to the calculated Duschinsky matrices, finding that these successfully pick up the key geometric changes associated with each electronic transition and so are successful in qualitatively explaining the vibrational activity in the spectra. Experimental values for a number of vibrations across the S 0 , S 1 , and D 0 + states are reported and found to compare well to those calculated. Assignments are made for the observed vibration-torsion (“vibtor”) bands, and the effect of vibrational motion on the torsional potential is briefly discussed.},

Analytic 3D PES was obtained by least-squares fitting the multi-dimensional Morse/Long-Range (mdMLR) potential model to interaction energies, where the mdMLR function form was applied to the nonlinear ion–atom case for the first time. The 3D PES fitting to 1708 points has root-mean-square deviations of 0.19 cm −1 with only 108 parameters for interaction energies less than 500 cm −1 . With the 3D PES of the H 3 O + –Ar complex, we employed the combined radial discrete variable representation/angular finite basis representation method and Lanczos algorithm to calculate rovibrational energy levels. The rotational profiles of the O–H anti-stretching vibrational bands of v 3 + ( S ) ← 0 + and v 3 − ( A ) ← 0 − for the H 3 O + –Ar complex were predicted and were in good agreement with the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Oligonuclear complexes of d 4 –d 7 transition metal ion centers that undergo spin-switching have long been developed for their practical role in molecular electronics. Recently, they also have appeared as promising photochemical reactants demonstrating improved stability. However, the lack of knowledge about their photophysical properties in the solution phase compared to mononuclear complexes is currently hampering their inclusion into advanced light-driven reactions. In the present study, the ultrafast photoinduced dynamics in a solvated [2 × 2] iron(II) metallogrid complex are characterized by combining measurements with transient optical-infrared absorption and x-ray emission spectroscopy on the femtosecond time scale. The analysis is supported by density functional theory calculations. The photocycle can be described in terms of intra-site transitions, where the Fe II centers in the low-spin state are independently photoexcited. The Franck–Condon state decays via the formation of a vibrationally hot high-spin (HS) state that displays coherent behavior within a few picoseconds and thermalizes within tens of picoseconds to yield a metastable HS state living for several hundreds of nanoseconds. Systematic comparison with the closely related mononuclear complex [Fe(terpy) 2 ] 2+ reveals that nuclearity has a profound impact on the photoinduced dynamics. More generally, this work provides guidelines for expanding the integration of oligonuclear complexes into new photoconversion schemes that may be triggered by ultrafast spin-switching.},

However, it is not immediately clear how strongly the approximations related to the classical treatment of the system’s environment compromise the accuracy of these methods. In this work, we present the analysis of the accuracy of the forward–backward trajectory solution (FBTS) of the quantum-classical Liouville equation. To this end, we simulate the excitation dynamics in a molecular dimer using the FBTS and the exact hierarchical equations of motion approach. To facilitate the understanding of the possible benefits of the FBTS, the simulations are also performed using a closely related quantum-classical Poisson Bracket Mapping Equation (PBME) method, as well as the well-known Förster and Redfield theories. We conclude that the FBTS is considerably more accurate than the PBME and the perturbative approaches for most realistic parameter sets and is, therefore, more versatile. We investigate the impact each parameter has on the accuracy of the FBTS. Our results can be used to predict whether the FBTS may be expected to yield satisfactory results when calculating system dynamics for the given system parameters.},

  abstract = {We consider a proton transfer (PT) system described by a proton transfer reaction (PTR) coordinate and a rate promoting vibrational (RPV) coordinate interacting with a non-Markovian heat bath. While dynamics of PT processes has been widely discussed using two-dimensional potential energy surfaces, the role of the heat bath, in particular, in a realistic form of the system–bath interaction has not been well explored. Previous studies are largely based on a one-dimensional model and linear-linear system–bath interaction. In the present study, we introduce an exponential-linear (EL) system–bath interaction, which is derived from the analysis of a PTR–RPV system in a realistic situation. This interaction mainly causes vibrational dephasing in the PTR mode and population relaxation in the RPV mode. Numerical simulations were carried out using the hierarchical equations of motion approach. We analyze the role of the heat bath interaction in the chemical reaction rate as a function of the system–bath coupling strength at different temperatures and for different values of the bath correlation time. A prominent feature of the present result is that while the reaction rate predicted from classical and quantum Kramers theory increases as the temperature increases, the present EL interaction model exhibits opposite temperature dependence. The Kramers turn-over profile of the reaction rate as a function of the system–bath coupling is also suppressed in the present EL model, turning into a plateau-like curve for larger system–bath interaction strength. Such features arise from the interplay of the vibrational dephasing process in the PTR mode and the population relaxation process in the RPV mode.},

Approximate periodic extensions of Couette and Poiseuille flows are unstable at Reynolds numbers two orders of magnitude smaller than their aperiodic equivalents because the periodic boundaries impose fundamentally different constraints on the flow. This instability has important implications for simulating shear rheology and for designing nonequilibrium simulation methods that are compatible with periodic boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional electron–electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR) provides extensive insight into molecular motions. Recent developments permitting experiments at higher frequencies (95 GHz) provide molecular orientational resolution, enabling a clearer description of the nature of the motions. In this work, simulations are provided for the example of domain motions within proteins that are themselves slowly tumbling in solution. These show the nature of the exchange cross-peaks that are predicted to develop in real time from such domain motions. However, we find that the existing theoretical methods for computing 2D-ELDOR experiments over a wide motional range begin to fail seriously when applied to very slow motions characteristic of proteins in solution. One reason is the failure to obtain accurate eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the complex symmetric stochastic Liouville matrices describing the experiment when computed by the efficient Lanczos algorithm in the range of very slow motion. Another, perhaps more serious, issue is that these matrices are “non-normal,” such that for the very slow motional range even rigorous diagonalization algorithms do not yield the correct eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We have employed algorithms that overcome both these issues and lead to valid 2D-ELDOR predictions even for motions approaching the rigid limit. They are utilized to describe the development of cross-peaks in 2D-ELDOR at 95 GHz for a particular case of domain motion.},

  abstract = {In the spin-coupled generalized valence bond (SCGVB) description of Be 2 , there is a pair of electrons in highly overlapping “inner” orbitals corresponding to a traditional σ bond, but this bond is compromised by Pauli repulsion arising from its overlap with a second “outer” pair. The presence of this outer pair of electrons leads to a repulsive potential energy curve at long range and a bound, but metastable molecule at short range. To obtain further insights into the nature of the bond in Be 2 , we determined the non-dynamical and dynamical correlation contributions to the potential energy curve of Be 2 using four different choices for the zero-order wave function: Restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF), SCGVB, valence-CASSCF(4,4), and valence-CASSCF(4,8). The SCGVB and valence-CASSCF(4,4) wave functions yield similar breakdowns of the total correlation energy, with non-dynamical correlation being the more important contribution. For the RHF and valence-CASSCF(4,8) wave functions, dynamical correlation is critical, without which the potential energy curve is purely repulsive. High accuracy calculations on the HBe n −1 Be–BeBe n −1 H molecule as a function of n ( n = 1–6) suggest that the intrinsic strength of a Be–Be σ bond uncompromised by Pauli repulsion is on the order of 62–63 kcal/mol, and its length is 2.13–2.14 Å, ∼60 kcal/mol stronger and ∼0.35 Å shorter than in Be 2 .},

This Hamiltonian involves three types of Fock matrices. The original CASPT2 Fock matrix is retained for excitation classes where the excitation does not change the number of electrons in the complete active space (CAS). For excitation classes involving a change in the number of electrons in the CAS, two alternative Fock matrices corresponding to either positive or negative ionization of the CAS are introduced. These are constructed such that they exactly reproduce the Koopmans matrices for a singly ionized CAS. Test calculations indicate that the method gives better excitation energies than CASPT2 without using empirical parameters, for example, the ionization potential-electron affinity shift, which is also designed to improve excitation energies. The method is also less prone to intruder states than conventional CASPT2. Moreover, the dissociation curve for the chromium dimer looks much more reasonable than the one obtained with conventional CASPT2.},

  abstract = {The Perdew–Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) was designed to correct the one-electron limit of any approximate density functional for the exchange–correlation (xc) energy, while yielding no correction to the exact functional. Unfortunately, it spoils the slowly varying (in space) limits of the uncorrected approximate functionals, where those functionals are right by construction. The right limits can be restored by locally scaling down the energy density of the PZ SIC in many-electron regions, but then a spurious correction to the exact functional would be found unless the self-Hartree and exact self-xc terms of the PZ SIC energy density were expressed in the same gauge. Only the local density approximation satisfies the same-gauge condition for the energy density, which explains why the recent local-scaling SIC is found here to work excellently for atoms and molecules only with this basic approximation and not with the more advanced generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) and meta-GGAs, which lose the Hartree gauge via simplifying integrations by parts. The transformation of energy density that achieves the Hartree gauge for the exact xc functional can also be applied to approximate functionals. Doing so leads to a simple scaled-down self-interaction correction that is typically much more accurate than PZ SIC in tests for many molecular properties (including equilibrium bond lengths). The present work unambiguously shows that the largest errors of PZ SIC applied to standard functionals at three levels of approximation can be removed by restoring their correct slowly varying density limits. It also confirms the relevance of these limits to atoms and molecules.},

It has been particularly successful in elucidating the geometry dependence of the inter-atomic decay widths in clusters and facilitated the prediction of new electronic decay phenomena. However, the available Fano-ADC schemes are limited to the second-order treatment of the initial state and the first-order treatment of the final states of the decay. This confines the applicability of the Fano-ADC approach to first-order decay processes, e.g., normal but not double Auger decay (DAD), and compromises the numerical accuracy of the schemes through the unbalanced treatment of electronic correlation. Here, we introduce the ADC(2,2) approximation for singly ionized states, which describes both initial and final states of the decay up to second order. We use the new scheme to construct the Fano-ADC(2,2) approximation for the decay widths and show that it provides superior accuracy for the decay widths of a series of processes. Moreover, the Fano-ADC(2,2) method provides access to second-order decay processes, such as DAD, which are qualitatively beyond the reach of the previously available Fano-ADC implementations.},

  abstract = {The chirality-induced spin selectivity effect has been confirmed experimentally for a large class of organic molecules. Adequately modeling the effect remains a challenging task, with both phenomenological models and first-principles simulations yielding inconclusive results. Building upon a previously presented model by K. Michaeli and R. Naaman [J. Phys. Chem. C 123 , 17043 (2019)], we systematically investigate an effective 1-dimensional model derived as the limit of a 3-dimensional quantum system with strong confinement and including spin–orbit coupling. Having a simple analytic structure, such models can be considered a minimal setup for the description of spin-dependent effects. We use adiabatic perturbation theory to provide a mathematically sound approximation procedure applicable to a large class of spin-dependent continuum models. We take advantage of the simplicity of the models by analyzing its structure to gain a better understanding how the occurrence and magnitude of spin polarization effects relate to the model’s parameters and geometry. The obtained spin polarization is not strongly dependent on the strength of the spin–orbit interaction, but it rather results from breaking time-reversal invariance upon selection of a given angular momentum of the incoming electrons.},

For our purposes, a PES “hole” is defined as an unphysical saddle point, beyond which the potential energy drops (typically) without limit to negative infinity. PES holes are numerical artifacts that can arise when fitting PES functional forms to discrete ab initio data—even when the data is of high quality, and/or for comparatively few degrees of freedom (DOF). Often undetected, PES holes can have devastating effects on subsequent dynamical calculations, especially if they occur at low energies. In this paper, we present a highly efficient algorithm designed to systematically identify hole configurations and energies. The method is applied to a variety of molecular PESs ranging up to 30 DOF. A number of evidently previously undetected PES holes are reported here—surprisingly, even for PESs that have been available for decades. The code itself ( Crystal ) is presented together with a user manual. These tools may be of great benefit for PES developers, who can use the information they provide to fix holes, once identified. More generally, the methodology can be applied in any context involving multi-dimensional surfaces.},

This density-functional approximation for ensembles is specially designed for the computation of single and double excitations within Gross–Oliveira–Kohn DFT (i.e., eDFT for neutral excitations) and can be seen as a natural extension of the ubiquitous local-density approximation in the context of ensembles. The resulting density-functional approximation, based on both finite and infinite uniform electron gas models, automatically incorporates the infamous derivative discontinuity contributions to the excitation energies through its explicit ensemble weight dependence. Its accuracy is illustrated by computing single and double excitations in one-dimensional (1D) many-electron systems in the weak, intermediate, and strong correlation regimes. Although the present weight-dependent functional has been specifically designed for 1D systems, the methodology proposed here is general, i.e., directly applicable to the construction of weight-dependent functionals for realistic three-dimensional systems, such as molecules and solids.},

Here, we employ the correlation factor ansatz to combine multi-configurational, self-consistent field (MCSCF) with approximate density functionals. In the proposed correlation factor approach, the exchange–correlation hole ρ XC ( r , u ), a function of the reference point r and the electron–electron separation u , is written as a product of the correlation factor f C ( r , u ) and an exchange plus static-correlation hole ρ XS ( r , u ), i.e., ρ XC CFXS ( r , u ) = f C ( r , u ) ρ XS ( r , u ). ρ XS ( r , u ) is constructed to reproduce the exchange–correlation energy of an MCSCF reference wave function. The correlation factor f C ( r , u ) is designed to account for dynamic correlation effects that are absent in ρ XS ( r , u ). The resulting approximation to the exchange–correlation energy, which we refer to as CFXStatic, is free of empirical parameters, and it combines the qualitatively correct description of the electronic structure obtainable with MCSCF with the advantages of approximate density functionals in accounting for dynamic correlation.},

  abstract = {Superfluid helium has not only fascinated scientists for centuries but is also the ideal matrix for the investigation of chemical systems under ultra-cold conditions in helium nanodroplet isolation experiments. Together with related experimental techniques such as helium tagging photodissociation spectroscopy, these methods have provided unique insights into many interesting systems. Complemented by theoretical work, they were additionally able to greatly expand our general understanding of manifestations of superfluid behavior in finite sized clusters and their response to molecular impurities. However, most theoretical studies up to now have not included the reactivity and flexibility of molecular systems embedded in helium. In this perspective, the theoretical foundation of simulating fluxional molecules and reactive complexes in superfluid helium is presented in detail. Special emphasis is put on recent developments for the converged description of both the molecular interactions and the quantum nature of the nuclei at ultra-low temperatures. As a first step, our hybrid path integral molecular dynamics/bosonic path integral Monte Carlo method is reviewed. Subsequently, methods for efficient path integral sampling tailored for this hybrid coupling scheme are discussed while also introducing new developments to enhance the accurate incorporation of the solute⋯solvent coupling. Finally, highly accurate descriptions of the interactions in solute⋯helium systems using machine learning techniques are addressed. Our current automated and adaptive fitting procedures to parameterize high-dimensional neural network potentials for both the full-dimensional potential energy surface of solutes and the solute⋯solvent interaction potentials are concisely presented. They are demonstrated to faithfully represent many-body potential functions able to describe chemically complex and reactive solutes in helium environments seamlessly from one He atom up to bulk helium at the accuracy level of coupled cluster electronic structure calculations. Together, these advances allow for converged quantum simulations of fluxional and reactive solutes in superfluid helium under cryogenic conditions.},

  abstract = {The phase behavior of semi-flexible polymers is integral to various contexts, from materials science to biophysics, many of which utilize or require specific confinement geometries as well as the orientational behavior of the polymers. Inspired by collagen assembly, we study the orientational ordering of semi-flexible polymers, modeled as Maier–Saupe worm-like chains, using self-consistent field theory. We first examine the bulk behavior of these polymers, locating the isotropic–nematic transition and delineating the limit of stability of the isotropic and nematic phases. This effort explains how nematic ordering emerges from the isotropic phase and offers insight into how different (e.g., mono-domain vs multi-domain) nematic phases form. We then clarify the influence of planar confinement on the nematic ordering of the polymers. We find that while the presence of a single confining wall does not shift the location of nematic transition, it aligns the polymers in parallel to the wall; above the onset of nematic transition, this preference tends to propagate into the bulk phase. Introducing a second, perpendicular, wall leads to a nematic phase that is parallel to both walls, allowing the ordering direction to be uniquely set by the geometry of the experimental setup. The advantage of wall-confinement is that it can be used to propagate mono-domain nematic phases into the bulk phase.},

  abstract = {Configuration dynamics of flexible polymer chains is of ubiquitous importance in many biological processes. Here, we investigate a polymer chain immersed in a bath of size-changed active particles in two dimensional space using Langevin dynamics simulations. Particular attention is paid to how the radius of gyration R g of the polymer chain depends on the size σ c of active crowders. We find that R g shows nontrivial non-monotonic dependence on σ c : The chain first swells upon increasing σ c , reaching a fully expanded state with maximum R g , and then, R g decreases until the chain collapses to a compact coil state if the crowder is large enough. Interestingly, the chain may oscillate between a collapse state and a stretched state at moderate crowder size. Analysis shows that it is the competition between two effects of active particles, one stretching the chain from inside due to persistence motion and the other compressing the chain from outside, that leads to the non-monotonic dependence. Besides, the diffusion of the polymer chain also shows nontrivial non-monotonic dependence on σ c . Our results demonstrate the important interplay between particle activity and size associated with polymer configurations in active crowding environments.},

Although samples are arrested at the macroscopic scale, atomic degrees of freedom are equilibrated and can be probed in a reproducible way. A clear signature of the VPT is present as a sharp drop in the mean square displacement of PNIPAM hydrogen atoms obtained by neutron scattering. As a function of concentration, the VPT gets smoother as dry conditions are approached, whereas the VPT temperature shows a minimum at about 43 wt.\%. This behavior is qualitatively confirmed by calorimetry measurements. Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to complement experimental results and gain further insights into the nature of the VPT, confirming that it involves the formation of an attractive gel state between the microgels. Overall, these results provide evidence that the VPT in PNIPAM-based systems can be detected at different time- and length-scales as well as under overcrowded conditions.},

The field-induced torque on active spheroids (swimmers) is taken to be of magnetic form by assuming that they have a permanent magnetic dipole moment, pointing along their self-propulsion (swim) direction. Using a continuum approach, we show that a host of behaviors emerges over the parameter space spanned by the particle aspect ratio, self-propulsion and shear/field strengths, and the channel width. The cross-stream migration of the model swimmers is shown to involve a regime of linear response (quantified by a linear-response factor) in weak fields. For prolate swimmers, the weak-field behavior crosses over to a regime of full swimmer migration to the bottom half of the channel in strong fields. For oblate swimmers, a counterintuitive regime of reverse migration arises in intermediate fields, where a macroscopic fraction of swimmers reorient and swim to the top channel half at an acute “upward” angle relative to the field axis. The diverse behaviors reported here are analyzed based on the shear-induced population splitting (bimodality) of the swim orientation, giving two distinct, oppositely polarized, swimmer subpopulations (albeit very differently for prolate/oblate swimmers) in each channel half. In strong fields, swimmers of both types exhibit net upstream currents relative to the laboratory frame. The onsets of full migration and net upstream current depend on the aspect ratio, enabling efficient particle separation strategies in microfluidic setups.},

We show using multiscale simulations and theory that the internal mass gradient of the JPs can enhance and even reverse the relative orientation of the particle with the thermal field. This effect is due to a coupling of the internal anisotropy of the particle with the heat flux.

We map out the infinite-pressure phase diagram for these mixtures using Floppy Box Monte Carlo simulations to systematically sample candidate crystal structures with up to 12 disks in the unit cell. As a function of the size ratio and the number ratio of the two species of particles, we find a rich variety of periodic crystal structures. Additionally, we identify random tiling regions to predict random tiling quasicrystal stability ranges. Increasing non-additivity both gives rise to additional crystal phases and broadens the stability regime for crystal structures involving a large number of large-small contacts, including random tilings. Our results provide useful guidelines for controlling the self-assembly of colloidal particles at interfaces.},

  abstract = {Alloys are active in CO 2 electroreduction due to their unique electronic and geometric structures. Nevertheless, CO 2 reduction selectivity is still low due to the low concentration of CO 2 near the catalyst surface and the high energy barrier for CO 2 activation. This paper describes an AuCu nanochain aerogel (NC–AuCu) with abundant grain boundaries (GBs) that promote the accumulation and activation of CO 2 for further electrochemical reduction, employing in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. GBs can induce a strong local electric field to concentrate the electrolyte cations and thus accumulate CO 2 near the catalyst surface. NC–AuCu exhibits a superior Faradaic efficiency of close to 100\% for CO 2 electroreduction to CO at an extremely low overpotential of 110 mV with a high CO partial current density of 28.6 mA cm −2 in a flow cell. Coupling with a Si solar cell to convert solar energy to CO, a very high conversion efficiency of ∼13.0\% is achieved. It potentially provides broad interest for further academic research and industry applications.},

  abstract = {The differential capacitance of an electric double layer formed by an aqueous solution of KNO 3 on a glassy carbon electrode is measured by impedance analysis at constant frequency. Results are obtained at electrolyte concentrations of 0.1 mol/dm 3 , 0.5 mol/dm 3 , and 1.0 mol/dm 3 , and at a series of temperatures, viz., 288 K, 298 K, 308 K, 318 K, and 328 K. The differential capacitance envelopes reveal a rich, complex pattern of maxima, minima, and local minima, whose magnitude and position change with a change in solution concentration. At the two lower concentrations, the temperature dependence of the capacitance, for example, at zero electrode potential, shows an alternating positive–negative behavior, while at the highest concentration of 1.0 mol/dm 3 , the slope of the differential capacitance–electrode potential curve is always positive. The experimental results are supplemented by a numerical grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation study of a restricted primitive model double layer but with an off-center cationic charge achieved by displacing the charge center from the ion sphere center toward its surface. The simulations, performed at the electrolyte concentration of 1.0 mol/dm 3 and constant cation charge center displacement, and at varying electrode potentials and temperatures, show, in general, a negative temperature dependence of the differential capacitance. However, this temperature dependence can also be positive for a negative electrode charge and for a sufficiently large gradient of the cation charge center displacement with temperature. This feature is seen to be associated with an increase in the entropy of formation of the double layer.},

Here, we employ density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of 3 d TM on both BaO- (type-I) and TiO 2 -terminated (type-II) surfaces of cubic BaTiO 3 (001) at low levels of surface coverage, which is important to comprehend the initial stages of the formation and growth of TM overlayers on BTO. The most stable adsorption site is identified for each adatom on both surfaces. Our discussion is based on analyses of structural distortions, Bader charge, electron density difference, magnetic moments, work function, density of states, and adsorption energies. For the type-I surface, most of the adatoms bind covalently on top of the surface oxygens, except for Sc, Ti, and V atoms, which adsorb preferentially on the bridge site, between O ions, to form two polar TM–O bonds. On the type-II surface, the TM are located at the fourfold hollow site, which allows the formation of four TM–O interactions that are predominantly ionic. Upon the adsorption, we noticed the formation of in-gap states originated mostly from the adatom. When electrons are transferred to the substrates, their conduction bands become partially occupied and metallic. We observed a decrease in the work function of the type-II surface that is fairly proportional to the charge gained, which suggests that the BTO work function can be manipulated by the controlled deposition of TM.},

The coordination number of water molecules in the solvation shell of ions increases with an increase in the radius of ions. We find that the self-diffusion coefficient of metal ions increases with a decrease in density under supercritical conditions due to the formation of voids within the system. The hydrogen bond dynamics has been interpreted by the residence time distribution of various ions, which shows Li + having the highest water retaining capability. The void distribution within the system has been analyzed by using the Voronoi polyhedra algorithm providing an estimation of void formation within the system at high temperatures. We observe the formation of salt clusters of Na + and K + at low densities due to the loss of dielectric constants of ions. The diffusion of ions gets altered dramatically due to the formation of voids and nucleation of ions in the system.},

The accuracy of this approximation is tested by a comparison against the results obtained with the assistance of extensive molecular dynamics simulations at different regimes of concentration and temperature. Crucial aspects for the comparison of the results provided by the two methods are carefully discussed, concerning the different reference frames used in theory and simulations to describe rotations and orientations, and leading to important differences in the behavior of correlation functions with the same combination of spherical harmonic indices. We find a remarkable agreement between the two approaches in the fluid regime, thus providing a first stringent comparison of the irreducible coefficients of the spherical harmonic expansion of the dipolar fluid’s static structure factor, provided by the MSA theory and molecular dynamics simulations.},

Whereas, within the velocity form, this quantity vanishes if the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is applied, it differs from zero if the calculation employs the length form of the expectation value. Using the adiabatic expansion of the total wave function, it is analyzed which terms contribute to the mean electronic momentum. For an adiabatic motion, where the BO approximation holds, it is shown that in the length form, the BO wave function yields an excellent estimate of the momentum. On the other hand, in the velocity form, it is necessary to include non-BO terms to calculate its value. This illustrates the different convergence behavior of the matrix elements in the two formulations. In the diabatic limit where the electron density does only marginally change upon the nuclear motion, both approaches converge to a vanishing mean electronic momentum.},

  abstract = {The broadband photoelectron source realized by detaching O 2 − ·X (X = neutral unsaturated molecule) complexes offers a unique opportunity to probe temporary anion states of the unsaturated species. Detachment of the ion molecule complex typically accesses a dissociative portion of the neutral potential, creating a continuum electron source that can undergo scattering with X. We present the application of this new approach to electron-neutral scattering toward a study of the series of fluorinated benzenes via photoelectron spectroscopy of O 2 − ·C 6 H 6− x F x ( x = 0–6) measured with several photon energies. We compare these spectra to the reference O 2 − ·hexane spectrum and observe evidence of temporary anion states of C 6 H 6− x F x for species with x = 0–5 in the form of enhanced signal intensity at electron kinetic energies coinciding with the energies of the temporary anions. Furthermore, we observe autodetachment features in the x = 3, 5 spectra. Results of calculations on the isolated symmetric isomer of C 6 H 3 F 3 suggest that the molecule cannot support a weakly-bound non-valence state that could be associated with the observed autodetachment. However, C 6 HF 5 − is predicted to support a valence bound state, which, if produced by charge transfer from O 2 − with sufficient vibrational energy, may undergo autodetachment. Finally, the [O 2 ·C 6 F 6 ] − spectrum is unique insofar as the spectrum is substantially higher in binding energy and qualitatively different from the x = 0–5 spectra. This result suggests much stronger interactions and charge delocalization between O 2 − and C 6 F 6 .},

Here, we report an improved and efficient generation scheme of FIs based on the computational invariant theory and parallel program, which can be readily used as the input vector of NNs in fitting high-dimensional PESs with permutation symmetry. The newly developed method significantly reduces the evaluation time of FIs, thereby extending the FI-NN method for constructing highly accurate PESs to larger systems beyond five atoms. Because of the minimum size of invariants used in the inputs of the NN, the NN structure can be very flexible for FI-NN, which leads to small fitting errors. The resulting FI-NN PES is much faster on evaluating than the corresponding permutationally invariant polynomial-NN PES.},

  abstract = {Magnetization dynamics of transition metal complexes manifest in properties and phenomena of fundamental and applied interest [e.g., slow magnetic relaxation in single molecule magnets, quantum coherence in quantum bits (qubits), and intersystem crossing (ISC) rates in photophysics]. While spin–phonon coupling is recognized as an important determinant of these dynamics, additional fundamental studies are required to unravel the nature of the coupling and, thus, leverage it in molecular engineering approaches. To this end, we describe here a combined ligand field theory and multireference ab initio model to define spin–phonon coupling terms in S = 2 transition metal complexes and demonstrate how couplings originate from both the static and dynamic properties of ground and excited states. By extending concepts to spin conversion processes, ligand field dynamics manifest in the evolution of the excited state origins of zero-field splitting (ZFS) along specific normal mode potential energy surfaces. Dynamic ZFSs provide a powerful means to independently evaluate contributions from spin-allowed and/or spin-forbidden excited states to spin–phonon coupling terms. Furthermore, ratios between various intramolecular coupling terms for a given mode drive spin conversion processes in transition metal complexes and can be used to analyze the mechanisms of ISC. Variations in geometric structure strongly influence the relative intramolecular linear spin–phonon coupling terms and will define the overall spin state dynamics. While the findings of this study are of general importance for understanding magnetization dynamics, they also link the phenomenon of spin–phonon coupling across fields of single molecule magnetism, quantum materials/qubits, and transition metal photophysics.},

It is shown that the induced refractive index for the weak probe field is chirality-dependent. Thus, it will lead to chirality-dependent light deflection when the intensities of two of the three strong driving fields are spatially inhomogeneous. As a result, the deflection angle of the weak probe light can be utilized to detect the chirality of pure enantiomers and enantiomeric excess of the chiral mixture. Therefore, our method may act as a tool for enantio-discrimination.},

  abstract = {We examine the ordering of the Lower Consolute Solution Temperatures (LCSTs) for a set of dimethylpyridines. Density functional theory (DFT) is used. The equilibrium geometries and binding energies of dimers, each comprised of a pair of dimethylpyridines in a sandwich conformation and one H 2 O molecule at a pivotal site between the nitrogens (the 2:1 dimer), are calculated. It was shown previously that dimer formation in the water-rich zone of the phase diagram has a crucial role in dimethylpyridine demixing. In the resulting dimer diffusion, large hydrophobic clusters of mostly organic content, which expel water and promote phase separation, are assembled. In this description, phase separation requires the formation of 2:1 dimers, but it is the cleavage of hydrogen bonds of the neighboring H 2 O molecules, which stimulates the diffusion and the subsequent separation dynamics at the LCST. In the present study, we investigate this model and calculate the interaction strength of the external hydrogen bonds. This is obtained as the difference in electronic energy between the 2:1 dimer and the dimer augmented by one or two H 2 O molecules. The results are compared to the known LCST hierarchy in five dimethylpyridines (DMP): 2,6-DMP &gt; 2,4-DMP &gt; 2,5-DMP &gt; 3,4-DMP &gt; 3,5-DMP. The complexes are derived using high level Kohn–Sham DFT including dispersion terms. The hydrophobic–hydrophilic properties are accounted for by the solvation model, employed for the mixed medium of 60\%-water and 40\%-organic content. This is simulated by combination of model descriptors of water and DMP in the parameterization scheme of the polarizable continuum model. The calculation results agree with the experimental evidence.},

  abstract = {Ionization potentials (IPs) of the superheavy element (SHE) livermorium (Lv) and its ions Lv n + ( n = 1, …, 6) are obtained using the multiconfiguration Dirac–Hartree–Fock method. The effects of electron correlation in the subshells {6 s , 6 p , 6 d , 7 s , 7 p } are taken into account, together with the Breit interaction and quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects. In Lv, the strong relativistic effect causes a large splitting between the energies of the 7 p 1/2 and 7 p 3/2 orbitals, which results in a large difference between IP 3 and IP 2 . As a consequence, the behavior of the IPs of Lv differs from that of the lighter oxygen group elements: among the I P n Z ( Z = Se, Te, Po, Lv; n = 1, …, 6), I P 1,2 L v are the smallest, whereas I P 3,4,5,6 L v are the second largest among the I P 3,4,5,6 Z ⁠ . This jump in IP can be taken to be a natural characteristic of SHEs because the calculations of the difference between IP 3 and IP 2 are only weakly affected by electron correlation, the Breit interaction, and QED effects, with only the relativistic effect being significant. We also show that the energies and IPs of neutral Lv and Lv + are clearly influenced by the electron correlation effect in the subshells {6 s , 6 p , 6 d }. The Breit interaction and QED have an effect on the energies that has an exponential dependence on the atomic number, although they have only a weak influence on the IPs. The analysis of the stabilities of the 2+, 4+, and 6 + states of Lv shows good agreement with predictions from other studies.},

Our main idea originates from performing the optimal tuning in the presence of a contribution of the exact-like exchange at the short-range part, which, in turn, leads to the small values of the range-separation parameter, and computing the fluorescence lifetimes using the models including no or small portions of the short-range exact-like exchange. Particular attention is also paid to the influence of the geometries of emitters on fluorescence lifetime computations. It is shown that our developed OT-RSHs along with the polarizable continuum model can be considered as the promising candidates within the TD-DFT framework for the prediction of fluorescence lifetimes for various fluorophores. We find that the proposed models not only outperform their standard counterparts but also provide reliable data better than or comparable to the conventional hybrid functionals with both the fixed and interelectronic distance-dependent exact-like exchanges. Furthermore, it is also revealed that when the excited state geometries come into play, more accurate descriptions of the fluorescence lifetimes can be achieved. Hopefully, our findings can give impetus for future developments of OT-RSHs for computational modeling of other characteristics in fluorescence spectroscopy as well as for verification of the related experimental observations.},

  abstract = {TurboRVB is a computational package for ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of both molecular and bulk electronic systems. The code implements two types of well established QMC algorithms: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo in its robust and efficient lattice regularized variant. A key feature of the code is the possibility of using strongly correlated many-body wave functions (WFs), capable of describing several materials with very high accuracy, even when standard mean-field approaches [e.g., density functional theory (DFT)] fail. The electronic WF is obtained by applying a Jastrow factor, which takes into account dynamical correlations, to the most general mean-field ground state, written either as an antisymmetrized geminal power with spin-singlet pairing or as a Pfaffian, including both singlet and triplet correlations. This WF can be viewed as an efficient implementation of the so-called resonating valence bond (RVB) Ansatz , first proposed by Pauling and Anderson in quantum chemistry [L. Pauling, The Nature of the Chemical Bond (Cornell University Press, 1960)] and condensed matter physics [P.W. Anderson, Mat. Res. Bull 8 , 153 (1973)], respectively. The RVB Ansatz implemented in TurboRVB has a large variational freedom, including the Jastrow correlated Slater determinant as its simplest, but nontrivial case. Moreover, it has the remarkable advantage of remaining with an affordable computational cost, proportional to the one spent for the evaluation of a single Slater determinant. Therefore, its application to large systems is computationally feasible. The WF is expanded in a localized basis set. Several basis set functions are implemented, such as Gaussian, Slater, and mixed types, with no restriction on the choice of their contraction. The code implements the adjoint algorithmic differentiation that enables a very efficient evaluation of energy derivatives, comprising the ionic forces. Thus, one can perform structural optimizations and molecular dynamics in the canonical NVT ensemble at the VMC level. For the electronic part, a full WF optimization (Jastrow and antisymmetric parts together) is made possible, thanks to state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms for energy minimization. In the optimization procedure, the first guess can be obtained at the mean-field level by a built-in DFT driver. The code has been efficiently parallelized by using a hybrid MPI-OpenMP protocol, which is also an ideal environment for exploiting the computational power of modern Graphics Processing Unit accelerators.},

  abstract = {The first-principles parameterized Frenkel–Holstein Hamiltonian developed in Paper I [R. Binder et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 152 , 204119 (2020)] is employed to carry out full quantum-dynamical simulations of an elementary exciton migration event in an oligo-( para -phenylene vinylene) chain with 20 repeat units (OPV-20). We consider a dynamic scenario where an initial torsional defect, creating a conjugation break, relaxes on a time scale of about 500 fs toward a planarized structure and triggers the spatial displacement of the photogenerated exciton. Accurate quantum dynamical simulations are performed using the multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method as applied to an OPV-20 system comprising 20 electronic states of Frenkel type and 60 vibrational modes. These include site-local quinoid-distortion modes, site-correlated bond-length alternation (BLA) modes, and an active ring torsional mode at the central junction. The simulations fully account for correlations between the ring torsional mode and the anharmonically coupled BLA coordinate located at the same junction. In accordance with our earlier studies of a related oligothiophene (OT) system [R. Binder, D. Lauvergnat, and I. Burghardt, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 , 227401 (2018)], these simulation results highlight that exciton migration is a coherent process driven by the fluctuations of “soft” modes, exemplified by the ring torsions. Conversely, these results also show that trapping due to high-frequency modes, leading to energetic stabilization of the exciton-polaron species, is weaker in OPV than in the OT system. This underscores not only the generic features of exciton dynamics in conjugated polymer systems, but also the role of molecular specificities.},

  abstract = {A generalized Frenkel–Holstein Hamiltonian is constructed to describe exciton migration in oligo( para -phenylene vinylene) chains, based on excited state electronic structure data for an oligomer comprising 20 monomer units (OPV-20). Time-dependent density functional theory calculations using the ω B97XD hybrid functional are employed in conjunction with a transition density analysis to study the low-lying singlet excitations and demonstrate that these can be characterized to a good approximation as a Frenkel exciton manifold. Based on these findings, we employ the analytic mapping procedure of Binder et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 141 , 014101 (2014)] to translate one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) potential energy surface (PES) scans to a fully anharmonic, generalized Frenkel–Holstein (FH) Hamiltonian. A 1D PES scan is carried out for intra-ring quinoid distortion modes, while 2D PES scans are performed for the anharmonically coupled inter-monomer torsional and vinylene bridge bond length alternation modes. The kinetic energy is constructed in curvilinear coordinates by an exact numerical procedure, using the TNUM Fortran code. As a result, a fully molecular-based, generalized FH Hamiltonian is obtained, which is subsequently employed for quantum exciton dynamics simulations, as shown in Paper II [R. Binder and I.

Within CASΠ(M)DFT, a small complete active space (CAS) accounts for the long-range intrabond and middle-range interbond nondynamic correlation in the stretched bonds. The common short-range dynamic correlation is calculated with the Lee–Yang–Parr (LYP) correlation DFT functional corrected for the suppression of dynamic correlation with nondynamic correlation. The remaining middle-range interbond dynamic correlation is evaluated with the modified LYP functional of the bond densities. As a result, CASΠ(M)DFT potential energy curves (PECs) calculated in the relatively small triple-zeta basis closely reproduce the benchmark complete basis set PECs for the following prototype multibonded molecules: N 2 , CO, H 2 O, and C 2 .},

As in both of these earlier theories, the NAQI approach is based on making a saddle point approximation to the time integral of a reactive flux autocorrelation function, although with a generalized definition of the projection operator onto the product states. We illustrate the accuracy of the approach by comparison with exact rates for one dimensional scattering problems and discuss its applicability to more complex reactions.},

The order parameter was tailored to crystallize the hexagonal diamond structure of oxygen in ice Ih. We analyze the effect of the system size on the ice Ih-liquid free energy differences, and we obtain a melting temperature of 270 K in the thermodynamic limit. This result is in agreement with estimates from thermodynamic integration (272 K) and coexistence simulations (270 K).

Yet, the computed structures do not always agree with experimental observables, calling for further development of the MD strategies to bring the computations and experiments closer together. Here, we report a scalable, efficient MD simulation approach that incorporates an x-ray solution scattering signal as a driving force for the conformational search of stable structural configurations outside of the native basin. We further demonstrate the importance of inclusion of the hydration layer effect for a precise description of the processes involving large changes in the solvent exposed area, such as unfolding. Utilization of the graphics processing unit allows for an efficient all-atom calculation of scattering patterns on-the-fly, even for large biomolecules, resulting in a speed-up of the calculation of the associated driving force. The utility of the methodology is demonstrated on two model protein systems, the structural transition of lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein and the folding of deca-alanine.

  abstract = {A ring approximation within an internally contracted multireference (MR) Coupled Cluster (CC) framework is worked out and tested. Derivation of equations utilizes MR based, generalized normal ordering and the corresponding generalized Wick-theorem (MR-GWT). Contractions among cluster operators are avoided by adopting a normal ordered exponential ansatz. The original version of the MR ring CC doubles (MR-rCCD) equations [Á. Szabados and Á. Margócsy, Mol. Phys. 115 , 2731 (2017)] is rectified in two aspects. On the one hand, over-completeness of double excitations is treated by relying on the concept of frames. On the other hand, restriction on the maximal cumulant rank is lifted from two to four. This is found essential for obtaining reliable correlation corrections to the energy. The MR function underlying the approach is provided by the Generalized Valence Bond (GVB) model. The pair structure of the reference ensures a fragment structure of GVB cumulants. This represents a benefit when evaluating cumulant contractions appearing as a consequence of MR-GWT. In particular, cumulant involving terms remain less expensive than their traditional, pair-contracted counterpart, facilitating an O ( N 6 ) eventual scaling of the proposed MR-rCCD method. Pilot applications are presented for covalent bond breaking, deprotonation energies, and torsional potentials.},

The analysis is based on the Holstein–Tavis–Cummings Hamiltonian which accounts for the coupling between an electronic excitation on each chromophore and a single cavity mode, as well as the coupling between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom on each chromophore. A straightforward ensemble partitioning scheme is introduced, which, along with an intuitive ansatz, allows one to obtain accurate evaluations of the lowest-energy polaritons using a subset of collective states. The polaritons include all three degrees of freedom—electronic, vibronic, and photonic—and can therefore be described as exciton–phonon polaritons. Applications focus on the limiting regimes where the Rabi frequency is small or large compared to the nuclear relaxation energy subsequent to optical excitation, with relaxation occurring mainly along the vinyl stretching coordinate in conjugated organic chromophores. Comparisons are also made to the more conventional vibronic polariton approach, which does not take into account two-particle excitations and vibration–photon states.},

By avoiding the use of automatic differentiation and grouping Fock builds together, we find that the number of times we must access the memory-intensive two-electron integrals can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the new formulation allows the theory to exploit the existing strategies for efficient Fock matrix construction. We demonstrate this advantage explicitly via the shell-pair screening strategy with which we achieve a cubic overall cost scaling. Using this more efficient implementation, we also examine the theory’s ability to predict charge redistribution during charge transfer excitations. Using the coupled cluster as a benchmark, we find that by capturing orbital relaxation effects and avoiding self-interaction errors, excited state mean field theory out-performs other low-cost methods when predicting the charge density changes of charge transfer excitations.},

  abstract = {CRYSTAL is a periodic ab initio code that uses a Gaussian-type basis set to express crystalline orbitals (i.e., Bloch functions). The use of atom-centered basis functions allows treating 3D (crystals), 2D (slabs), 1D (polymers), and 0D (molecules) systems on the same grounds. In turn, all-electron calculations are inherently permitted along with pseudopotential strategies. A variety of density functionals are implemented, including global and range-separated hybrids of various natures and, as an extreme case, Hartree–Fock (HF). The cost for HF or hybrids is only about 3–5 times higher than when using the local density approximation or the generalized gradient approximation. Symmetry is fully exploited at all steps of the calculation. Many tools are available to modify the structure as given in input and simplify the construction of complicated objects, such as slabs, nanotubes, molecules, and clusters. Many tensorial properties can be evaluated by using a single input keyword: elastic, piezoelectric, photoelastic, dielectric, first and second hyperpolarizabilities, etc. The calculation of infrared and Raman spectra is available, and the intensities are computed analytically. Automated tools are available for the generation of the relevant configurations of solid solutions and/or disordered systems. Three versions of the code exist: serial, parallel, and massive-parallel. In the second one, the most relevant matrices are duplicated on each core, whereas in the third one, the Fock matrix is distributed for diagonalization. All the relevant vectors are dynamically allocated and deallocated after use, making the code very agile. CRYSTAL can be used efficiently on high performance computing machines up to thousands of cores.},

  abstract = {We present hierarchical machine learning (hML) of highly accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs). Our scheme is based on adding predictions of multiple Δ-machine learning models trained on energies and energy corrections calculated with a hierarchy of quantum chemical methods. Our (semi-)automatic procedure determines the optimal training set size and composition of each constituent machine learning model, simultaneously minimizing the computational effort necessary to achieve the required accuracy of the hML PES. Machine learning models are built using kernel ridge regression, and training points are selected with structure-based sampling. As an illustrative example, hML is applied to a high-level ab initio CH 3 Cl PES and is shown to significantly reduce the computational cost of generating the PES by a factor of 100 while retaining similar levels of accuracy (errors of ∼1 cm −1 ).},

  abstract = {The structure and dynamics of confined suspensions of particles of arbitrary shape are of interest in multiple disciplines from biology to engineering. Theoretical studies are often limited by the complexity of long-range particle–particle and particle–wall forces, including many-body fluctuating hydrodynamic interactions. Here, we report a computational study on the diffusion of spherical and cylindrical particles confined in a spherical cavity. We rely on an immersed-boundary general geometry Ewald-like method to capture lubrication and long-range hydrodynamics and include appropriate non-slip conditions at the confining walls. A Chebyshev polynomial approximation is used to satisfy the fluctuation–dissipation theorem for the Brownian suspension. We explore how lubrication, long-range hydrodynamics, particle volume fraction, and shape affect the equilibrium structure and the diffusion of the particles. It is found that once the particle volume fraction is greater than 10\%, the particles start to form layered aggregates that greatly influence particle dynamics. Hydrodynamic interactions strongly influence the particle diffusion by inducing spatially dependent short-time diffusion coefficients, stronger wall effects on the particle diffusion toward the walls, and a sub-diffusive regime—caused by crowding—in the long-time particle mobility. The level of asymmetry of the cylindrical particles considered here is enough to induce an orientational order in the layered structure, decreasing the diffusion rate and facilitating a transition to the crowded mobility regime at low particle concentrations. Our results offer fundamental insights into the diffusion and distribution of globular and fibrillar proteins inside cells.},

  abstract = {A review of the present status, recent enhancements, and applicability of the S iesta program is presented. Since its debut in the mid-1990s, S iesta ’s flexibility, efficiency, and free distribution have given advanced materials simulation capabilities to many groups worldwide. The core methodological scheme of S iesta combines finite-support pseudo-atomic orbitals as basis sets, norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and a real-space grid for the representation of charge density and potentials and the computation of their associated matrix elements. Here, we describe the more recent implementations on top of that core scheme, which include full spin–orbit interaction, non-repeated and multiple-contact ballistic electron transport, density functional theory (DFT)+ U and hybrid functionals, time-dependent DFT, novel reduced-scaling solvers, density-functional perturbation theory, efficient van der Waals non-local density functionals, and enhanced molecular-dynamics options. In addition, a substantial effort has been made in enhancing interoperability and interfacing with other codes and utilities, such as wannier90 and the second-principles modeling it can be used for, an AiiDA plugin for workflow automatization, interface to Lua for steering S iesta runs, and various post-processing utilities. S iesta has also been engaged in the Electronic Structure Library effort from its inception, which has allowed the sharing of various low-level libraries, as well as data standards and support for them, particularly the PSeudopotential Markup Language definition and library for transferable pseudopotentials, and the interface to the ELectronic Structure Infrastructure library of solvers. Code sharing is made easier by the new open-source licensing model of the program. This review also presents examples of application of the capabilities of the code, as well as a view of on-going and future developments.},

We consider a Hamiltonian that depends on external adjustable or adiabatic parameters, using adaptative projectors that follow the successive eigenspaces when the adjustable parameters are modified. The method can also handle non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. An iterative algorithm is derived and tested through comparisons with a standard wave operator algorithm using a fixed active space and with a standard block-Davidson method. The proposed approach is competitive; it converges within a few dozens of iterations at constant memory cost. We first illustrate the abilities of the method on a 4D-coupled oscillator model Hamiltonian. A more realistic application to molecular photodissociation under intense laser fields with varying intensity or frequency is also presented. Maps of photodissociation resonances of H 2 + in the vicinity of exceptional points are calculated as an illustrative example.},

We elaborate on the construction of the system operators and pseudo-operators involved in the MAS-SEOM, along with the analytic expression for the particle current. The MAS-SEOM is applied to study the relaxation and voltage-driven dynamics of quantum impurity systems described by the single-level Anderson impurity model, and the numerical results are benchmarked against those of the highly accurate hierarchical equations of motion method. The advantages and limitations of the present MAS-SEOM approach are discussed extensively.},

The construction of the SEOM is based on a stochastic decoupling of the dissipative interaction between the system and fermionic environment, and the influence of environmental fluctuations on the reduced system dynamics is characterized by stochastic Grassmann fields. Meanwhile, numerical realization of the time-dependent Grassmann fields has remained a long-standing challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a minimal auxiliary space (MAS) mapping scheme with which the stochastic Grassmann fields are represented by conventional c-number fields along with a set of pseudo-levels. This eventually leads to a numerically feasible MAS-SEOM method. The important properties of the MAS-SEOM are analyzed by making connection to the well-established time-dependent perturbation theory and the hierarchical equations of motion theory. The MAS-SEOM method provides a potentially promising approach for the accurate and efficient simulation of fermionic open systems at ultra-low temperatures.},

At the self-consistent-field level, a highly original scheme, based on quaternion algebra, is implemented for the treatment of both spatial and time reversal symmetry. DIRAC features a very general module for the calculation of molecular properties that to a large extent may be defined by the user and further analyzed through a powerful visualization module. It allows for the inclusion of environmental effects through three different classes of increasingly sophisticated embedding approaches: the implicit solvation polarizable continuum model, the explicit polarizable embedding model, and the frozen density embedding model.},

By iterative refining of the Gaussians’ positions and widths, we obtain a compact multi-reference expansion for the multicomponent wave function. We extend the DMRG algorithm to multicomponent wave functions to take into account inter- and intra-species correlation effects. The efficient parameterization of the total wave function as a matrix product state allows NEAP-DMRG to accurately approximate the full configuration interaction energies of molecular systems with more than three nuclei and 12 particles in total, which is currently a major challenge for other multicomponent approaches. We present the NEAP-DMRG results for two few-body systems, i.e., H 2 and H 3 + ⁠ , and one larger system, namely, BH 3 .},

All particles forming the systems, electrons and nuclei, are treated on equal footing. The wave functions of the bound states are expanded in terms of all-particle one-center complex explicitly correlated Gaussian functions multiplied by Cartesian angular factors. As these Gaussian functions are eigenfunctions of the operator representing the square of the total angular momentum of the system, the problem separates and calculations of states corresponding to different values of the total rotational quantum number can be solved independently from each other. Due to thorough variational optimization of the Gaussian exponential parameters, the method allows us to generate very accurate wave functions. The optimization is aided by analytically calculated energy gradient determined with respect to the parameters. Three examples of calculations performed for diatomic and triatomic molecules are shown as an illustration of calculations that can be performed with this program. Finally, we discuss the limitations, applicability range, and bottlenecks of the program.},

Recently, Epstein and Mandadapu [arXiv:1907.10041 (2019)] obtained Green–Kubo relations for the full set of viscous coefficients governing isotropic chiral active fluids, including the so-called odd viscosity, invoking Onsager’s regression hypothesis for the decay of fluctuations in active non-equilibrium steady states. In this Communication, we test these Green–Kubo relations using molecular dynamics simulations of a canonical model system consisting of actively torqued dumbbells. We find the resulting odd and shear viscosity values from the Green–Kubo relations to be in good agreement with values measured independently through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics flow simulations. This provides a test of the Green–Kubo relations and lends support to the application of the Onsager regression hypothesis in relation to viscous behaviors of active matter systems.},

They are characterized by strong parameter dependence, where small changes in operating conditions lead to large changes in the magnitude and even direction of the resulting current. This high sensitivity makes electron ratchets attractive research subjects, but leads to formidable challenges in their deeper study, and particularly to their useful application. This perspective reviews the progress that was made in the field starting from the first experimental electron ratchets in the late 1990s, and how the field spawned multiple designs with very different properties. We discuss the possible uses of electron ratchets in sensing and energy harvesting, and the specific issues encountered when idealized behavior meets complex reality. We promote an application-driven approach where complexity is not necessarily detrimental and argue that a system level perspective would be beneficial over reductionism. We highlight several promising research directions, which revolve around the intentional study of complex effects, and the modeling of realistic devices.},

The full pair-distribution function depends on three coordinates describing the relative positions and orientations of two particles, the Péclet number specifying the activity of the particles, and their mean packing density. This five-dimensional function is obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations. We discuss its structure taking into account all of its degrees of freedom. In addition, we present an approximate analytic expression for the product of the full pair-distribution function and the interparticle force. We find that the analytic expression, which is typically needed when deriving analytic models for the collective dynamics of active Brownian particles, is in good agreement with the simulation results. The results of this work can thus be expected to be helpful for the further theoretical investigation of active Brownian particles as well as nonequilibrium statistical physics in general.},

  abstract = {A simple mean-field microswimmer model is presented. The model is inspired by the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of multi-component fluids that undergo chemical reactions. These thermodynamics can be rigorously described in the context of the GENERIC (general equation for the nonequilibrium reversible–irreversible coupling) framework. More specifically, this approach was recently applied to non-ideal polymer solutions [T. Indei and J. D. Schieber, J. Chem. Phys. 146 , 184902 (2017)]. One of the species of the solution is an unreactive polymer chain represented by the bead-spring model. Using this detailed description as inspiration, we then make several simplifying assumptions to obtain a mean-field model for a Janus microswimmer. The swimmer model considered here consists of a polymer dumbbell in a sea of reactants. One of the beads of the dumbbell is allowed to act as a catalyst for a chemical reaction between the reactants. We show that the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of the center of mass of this Janus dumbbell exhibits ballistic behavior at time scales at which the concentration of the reactant is large. The time scales at which the ballistic behavior is observed in the MSD coincide with the time scales at which the cross-correlation between the swimmer’s orientation and the direction of its displacement exhibits a maximum. Since the swimmer model was inspired by the GENERIC framework, it is possible to ensure that the entropy generation is always positive, and therefore, the second law of thermodynamics is obeyed.},

It was shown that the photocatalytic activity of photosensitizers (PS), which is characterized by the effective constant of the tryptophan photo-oxidation rate ( k eff ), increases by 1.4 times for DMG, while for Ce6, it decreases by 1.2 times in a weak acidic medium (pH ∼ 4). The influence of acetic acid on the effective constant k eff of the tryptophan photo-oxidation rate in the presence of PS–amphiphilic polymer complexes is determined by the nature of the polymer. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of the PS–F127 system decreases at pH ∼ 4.0, and the photocatalytic activity of PS–PVP complexes is insensitive to the presence of acetic acid in the medium. It has been suggested that the observed effects in the PS–F127 system in a weak acidic medium (pH ∼ 4) are associated with the influence of acetic acid on the supramolecular structure of Pluronic F127.},

  abstract = {The contact angle of a liquid droplet on a surface under partial wetting conditions differs for a nanoscopically rough or periodically corrugated surface from its value for a perfectly flat surface. Wenzel’s relation attributes this difference simply to the geometric magnification of the surface area (by a factor r w ), but the validity of this idea is controversial. We elucidate this problem by model calculations for a sinusoidal corrugation of the form z wall ( y ) = Δ cos(2 πy / λ ), for a potential of short range σ w acting from the wall on the fluid particles. When the vapor phase is an ideal gas, the change in the wall-vapor surface tension can be computed exactly, and corrections to Wenzel’s equation are typically of the order σ w Δ/ λ 2 . For fixed r w and fixed σ w , the approach to Wenzel’s result with increasing λ may be nonmonotonic and this limit often is only reached for λ / σ w &gt; 30. For a non-additive binary mixture, density functional theory is used to work out the density profiles of both coexisting phases for planar and corrugated walls as well as the corresponding surface tensions. Again, deviations from Wenzel’s results of similar magnitude as in the above ideal gas case are predicted. Finally, a crudely simplified description based on the interface Hamiltonian concept is used to interpret the corresponding simulation results along similar lines. Wenzel’s approach is found to generally hold when λ / σ w ≫ 1 and Δ/ λ &lt; 1 and under conditions avoiding proximity of wetting or filling transitions.},

Here, we study the interaction of anatase (001) and (101) surfaces with water and the resulting energetic alignment by means of hybrid density functional theory. While the alignment of band positions favors charge-transfer processes between the two facets for the pristine surfaces, we find the magnitude of this underlying driving force to crucially depend on the water coverage and the degree of dissociation. It can be largely alleviated for intermediate water coverages. Surface states and their passivation by dissociatively adsorbed water play an important role here. Our results suggest that anatase band positions can be controlled over a range of almost 1 eV via its surface chemistry.},

In the low-doping regime, we find that the trion linewidth is relatively insensitive to doping levels, while the exciton linewidth increases monotonically with doping. On the other hand, we argue that the trion linewidth shows a somewhat stronger temperature dependence. The magnitudes of the linewidths are likely to be masked by phonon scattering for T ≥ 20 K in encapsulated samples in the low-doping regime. We discuss the breakdown of perturbation theory, which should occur at relatively low-doping levels and low temperatures. Our work also paves the way toward understanding a variety of related scattering processes, including impact ionization and Auger scattering in clean 2D samples.},

Here, we investigated the possible reasons of this capacity loss with a combination of in situ AFM and various ex situ TEM techniques (high resolution TEM and high angle annular dark field scanning TEM imaging, and STEM-EELS and STEM-EDX spectroscopic mapping) targeting the electrode/electrolyte interphase formation process in the carbonate-based electrolyte with and without vinylene carbonate (VC) as an additive. The studied HC consists of curved graphitic layers arranged into short packets and round cages, the latter acting as traps for K + ions causing low Coulombic efficiency between cycling. Our comparative study of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation in the carbonate-based electrolyte with and without the VC additive revealed that in the pristine electrolyte, the SEI consists mostly of inorganic components, whereas adding VC introduces a polymeric organic component to the SEI, increasing its elasticity and stability against fracturing upon HC expansion/contraction during electrochemical cycling. Additionally, significant K + loss occurs due to Na + for K + exchange in Na-carboxymethyl cellulose used as a binder. These findings reflect the cumulative impact of the internal HC structure, SEI properties, and binder nature into the electrochemical functional properties of the HC-based anodes for K-ion batteries.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the phenomenon of light driven diffusioosmotic long-range attraction and repulsion of porous particles under irradiation with UV light. The change in the inter-particle interaction potential is governed by flow patterns generated around single colloids and results in reversible aggregation or separation of the mesoporous silica particles that are trapped at a solid surface. The range of the interaction potential extends to several times the diameter of the particle and can be adjusted by varying the light intensity. The “fuel” of the process is a photosensitive surfactant undergoing photo-isomerization from a more hydrophobic trans- state to a rather hydrophilic cis -state. The surfactant has different adsorption affinities to the particles depending on the isomerization state. The trans -isomer, for example, tends to accumulate in the negatively charged pores of the particles, while the cis -isomer prefers to remain in the solution. This implies that when under UV irradiation cis -isomers are being formed within the pores, they tend to diffuse out readily and generate an excess concentration near the colloid’s outer surface, ultimately resulting in the initiation of diffusioosmotic flow. The direction of the flow depends strongly on the dynamic redistribution of the fraction of trans- and cis -isomers near the colloids due to different kinetics of photo-isomerization within the pores as compared to the bulk. The unique feature of the mechanism discussed in the paper is that the long-range mutual repulsion but also the attraction can be tuned by convenient external optical stimuli such as intensity so that a broad variety of experimental situations for manipulation of a particle ensemble can be realized.},

However, the role of interfacial defects, a ubiquitous phenomenon in the metal–semiconductor heterostructure, is not well understood, especially for the hot hole-involved water oxidation reaction. Herein, we studied the effect of interfacial defects, derived from oxygen vacancies, on plasmonic photocatalytic water oxidation. In addition, we found that the plasmon-induced water oxidation activity decreased with the increase in the oxygen vacancies present at the interface, and the activity of Au/TiO 2 can be restored after eliminating the defects via a post-oxidation treatment. It is elucidated that a defect state appeared below the conduction band of TiO 2 as a result of interfacial defects, which acts as the electron traps and backward transfer channel for electrons to combine with the holes left at the interface. The charge recombination at defect sites leads to the shorter lifetime of hot holes, which is harmful for the kinetics-sluggish water oxidation. This work emphasizes the significance of the interface structure for the plasmon-based photocatalytic process.},

State-of-the-art approaches represent the electrodes as perfect conductors, modeling their responses to the charge distribution of electrolytes via the so-called fluctuating charge model. These fluctuating charges are additional degrees of freedom that, in a Born–Oppenheimer spirit, adapt instantaneously to changes in the environment to keep each electrode at a constant potential. Here, we show that this model can be treated in the framework of constrained molecular dynamics, leading to a symplectic and time-reversible algorithm for the evolution of all the degrees of freedom of the system. The computational cost and the accuracy of the new method are similar to current alternative implementations of the model. The advantage lies in the accuracy and long term stability guaranteed by the formal properties of the algorithm and in the possibility to systematically introduce additional kinematic conditions of arbitrary number and form. We illustrate the performance of the constrained dynamics approach by enforcing the electroneutrality of the electrodes in a simple capacitor consisting of two graphite electrodes separated by a slab of liquid water.},

The PDFs of the four STs expressed in terms of their standard deviations (calculated separately for the positive and negative sides) are shown by MD to be statistically the same for the Lennard-Jones fluid. This PDF can be represented well by a sum of exponentials and is independent of system size and state point in the equilibrium fluid regime. The PDF is not well reproduced by a stochastic model. The PDF is statistically the same as that derived from the potential energy, u , and other thermodynamic quantities, indicating that the transport coefficients are determined quantitatively by and follow closely the time evolution of the underlying energy landscape.

  abstract = {Soft quasilocalized modes (QLMs) are universally featured by structural glasses quenched from a melt, and are involved in several glassy anomalies such as the low-temperature scaling of their thermal conductivity and specific heat, and sound attenuation at intermediate frequencies. In computer glasses, QLMs may assume the form of harmonic vibrational modes under a narrow set of circumstances; however, direct access to their full distribution over frequency is hindered by hybridizations of QLMs with other low-frequency modes (e.g., phonons). Previous studies to overcome this issue have demonstrated that the response of a glass to local force dipoles serves as a good proxy for its QLMs; we, therefore, study here the statistical-mechanical properties of these responses in computer glasses, over a large range of glass stabilities and in various spatial dimensions, with the goal of revealing properties of the yet-inaccessible full distribution of QLMs’ frequencies. We find that as opposed to the spatial-dimension-independent universal distribution of QLMs’ frequencies ω (and, consequently, also of their stiffness κ = ω 2 ), the distribution of stiffnesses associated with responses to local force dipoles features a (weak) dependence on spatial dimension. We rationalize this dependence by introducing a lattice model that incorporates both the real-space profiles of QLMs—associated with dimension-dependent long-range elastic fields—and the universal statistical properties of their frequencies. Based on our findings, we propose a conjecture about the form of the full distribution of QLMs’ frequencies and its protocol-dependence. Finally, we discuss possible connections of our findings to basic aspects of glass formation and deformation.},

  abstract = {A mixed radial, angular three-body distribution function g 3 ( r BC , θ ABC ) is introduced, which allows the local atomic order to be more easily characterized in a single graph than with conventional correlation functions. It can be defined to be proportional to the probability of finding an atom C at a distance r BC from atom B while making an angle θ ABC with atoms A and B, under the condition that atom A is the nearest neighbor of B. As such, our correlation function contains, for example, the likelihood of angles formed between the nearest and the next-nearest-neighbor bonds. To demonstrate its use and usefulness, a visual library for many one-component crystals is produced first and then employed to characterize the local order in a diverse body of elemental condensed-matter systems. Case studies include the analysis of a grain boundary, several liquids (argon, copper, and antimony), and polyamorphism in crystalline and amorphous silicon including that obtained in a tribological interface.},

  abstract = {High-pressure experiments were performed to understand the structural evolution of methane hydrate (MH) up to 134 GPa using x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy with diamond anvil cells. XRD revealed the distinct changes in the diffraction lines of MH owing to phase transition from a guest-ordered state phase [MH-III(GOS)] to a new high-pressure phase (MH-IV) at 33.8–57.7 GPa. MH-IV was found to be stable up to at least 134 GPa without decomposition into solid methane and high-pressure ices. Raman spectroscopy showed the splits in the C–H vibration modes ν 3 and ν 1 of guest methane molecules in filled-ice Ih (MH-III) at 12.7 GPa and 28.6 GPa, respectively. These splits are caused by orientational ordering of guest methane molecules contained in the hydrate structure, as observed in a previous study. These results suggest that the structural evolution of the filled-ice structure of MH is caused by successive orientational ordering of guest methane molecules, thereby inducing changes in the host framework formed by water molecules.},

  abstract = {The early transition metal diatomic sulfides, MS, M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta, have been investigated using resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy in the vicinity of their bond dissociation energies (BDEs). Due to the high density of vibronic states in this energy range, the molecular spectra appear quasicontinuous, and when the excitation energy exceeds the ground separated atom limit, excited state decay by dissociation becomes possible. The dissociation process typically occurs so rapidly that the molecule falls apart before a second photon can be absorbed to ionize the species, leading to a sharp drop in ion signal, which is identified as the 0 K BDE. The observed predissociation thresholds yield BDEs of 4.852(10) eV (ScS), 5.391(3) eV (YS), 4.690(4) eV (TiS), 5.660(4) eV (ZrS), 5.780(20) eV (HfS), 5.572(3) eV (NbS), and 5.542(3) eV (TaS).

Another thermochemical cycle has been used to combine the previously measured M + -S BDEs with the M-S BDEs and atomic ionization energies to obtain the MS ionization energies of 6.44(5) eV (ScS), 6.12(8) eV (YS), 6.78(7) eV (TiS), 6.60(10) eV (ZrS), and 6.88(9) eV (NbS).

All of the species exhibited unconventional band patterns in which many combination bands appeared with comparable intensities to those of allowed bands. Such a behavior is sometimes called a Franck–Condon-like pattern. In the case of the PhOH-BDMS, one intermolecular vibrational mode is involved in this behavior. The observed IR spectra were well reproduced based on the concept of the Franck–Condon-like behavior. As an alternative treatment, we analyzed the band patterns on the concept of intensity borrowing due to the vibrational anharmonic interaction. The analysis was based on an effective Hamiltonian involving an anharmonic interaction between the OH stretch and intermolecular vibrational modes. Two treatments provided the same results. Thus, it was confirmed that the Franck–Condon-like behavior originates from vibrational anharmonic interactions. In the cases of the PhOH-EDMS and PhOH-TES, we carried out a two-dimensional Franck–Condon and an effective Hamiltonian analysis to interpret the Franck–Condon-like patterns. We examined vibrational wave functions obtained by the latter analysis. Shapes of the wave functions suggest that a recombination of the intermolecular vibrational modes occurs during the excitation of OH stretch mode in these clusters, which is a similar behavior to the Duschinsky effect in the electronic transition.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present a computational investigation on the ionization potentials (IPs) of the formaldehyde dimer, (H 2 CO) 2 . Twelve lowest lying IPs (corresponding to the entire valence orbitals) for both C 2 h and C s symmetry conformers have been computed at the coupled cluster level of theory using large correlation consistent basis sets with extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and consideration of core electron correlation effects. Specifically, the equation-of-motion ionization potential coupled-cluster with single and double (EOMIP-CCSD) excitations method with the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pCVXZ (X = T, Q, and 5) basis sets combined with the Feller–Peterson–Dixon approach was employed, as well as CCSD with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. In general, excellent agreement was observed from the comparison between the results obtained through the use of these approaches. In addition, the IPs for the formaldehyde monomer were also obtained using such methodologies and the results compared with existing experimental data; excellent agreement was also observed in this case. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first of its kind to determine the IPs for all these systems using a high level theory approach and is presented to motivate experimental investigations, e.g., studies involving photoionization, particularly for the formaldehyde dimer. The equilibrium binding energy of the C 2 h dimer is calculated in this work at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory to be −4.71 kcal/mol. At this same level of theory, the equilibrium isomerization energy between C 2 h and C s conformers is 0.76 kcal/mol ( C s conformer being more stable).},

Based on the absolute CEP values at the laser–molecule interaction point, calibrated by the method using intense few-cycle circularly polarized laser pulses [Fukahori et al. , Phys. Rev. A 95 , 053410-1–053410-14 (2017)], we confirm that methanol cations are produced by tunnel ionization and methanol dications are produced by the recollisional double ionization. We obtain the phase offset for the double ionization accompanying no hydrogen migration to be 1.85π as the absolute CEP at which the extent of the asymmetry becomes maximum. We interpret the phase shift of 0.85π from the phase offset of 1.0π for the tunnel ionization, estimated by a tunnel ionization model incorporating the chemical bond asymmetry, as the corresponding time delay associated with the electron recollisional ionization. The positive phase shift of 0.13π for the single ionization in the non-hydrogen migration channel is interpreted as the additional time (165 as) with which a methanol cation can be excited electronically prior to the decomposition. The additional phase shift of 0.22π for the single ionization in the hydrogen migration channel is interpreted as the additional time (280 as) required for a methanol cation to be excited electronically leading to the hydrogen migration prior to the decomposition.},

  abstract = {We study the exciton localization and resulting optical response for disordered tubular aggregates of optically active molecules. It has previously been shown that such tubular structures allow for excitons delocalized over more than a thousand molecules, owing to the combined effects of long-range dipole–dipole interactions and the higher-dimensional (not truly one-dimensional) nature of the aggregate. Such large delocalization sizes prompt the question to what extent in experimental systems the delocalization may still be determined by the aggregate size (diameter and length) and how this affects the aggregate’s optical response and dynamics. We perform a systematic study of the size effects on the localization properties using numerical simulations of the exciton states in a cylindrical model structure inspired by the previously derived geometry of a cylindrical aggregate of cyanine dye molecules (C8S3). To characterize the exciton localization, we calculate the participation ratio and the autocorrelation function of the exciton wave function. We also calculate the density of states and absorption spectrum. We find strong effects of the tube’s radius on the localization and optical properties in the range of parameters relevant to the experiment. In addition, surprisingly, we find that even for tubes as long as 750 nm, the localization size is limited by the tube’s length for disorder values that are relevant to experimental circumstances, while observable effects of the tube’s length in the absorption spectrum still occur for tube lengths up to about 150 nm. The latter may explain the changes in the optical spectra observed during the aging process of bromine-substituted C8S3 aggregates. For weak disorder, the exciton wave functions exhibit a scattered, fractal-like nature, similar to the quasi-particles in two-dimensional disordered systems.},

HCl monomer predissociation products were detected state-selectively using 2 + 1 resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy. The IR action spectrum shows the free HCl stretch (2ν 1 ), the bound HCl stretch (2ν 2 ), and a combination band involving the intermolecular van der Waals stretching mode (2ν 2 + ν 4 ). Fragment speed distributions extracted from ion images obtained for a range of HCl( v = 0, 1; J ) levels following vibrational excitation on the 2ν 1 and 2ν 2 bands yield the correlated product pair distributions. All product pairs comprise HCl( v = 1) + HCl( v = 0) and show a strong propensity to minimize the recoil kinetic energy. Highly non-statistical and mode-dependent HCl product rotational distributions are observed, in contrast to that observed following stretch fundamental excitation. Predissociation lifetimes are also mode-dependent: excitation of the free HCl leads to τ VP = 13 ± 1 ns, while the bound stretch has a shorter lifetime τ VP ≤ 6 ns. The dimer dissociation energy determined from energy conservation ( D 0 = 397 ± 7 cm –1 ) is slightly smaller than the previously reported values. The results are discussed in the context of previous observations for (HF) 2 and (HCl) 2 after excitation of HX stretch fundamentals and models for vibrational predissociation.},

  abstract = {Transition metal oxides are of high interest in both energy storage (batteries) and production of non-fossil fuels by (photo)electrocatalysis. Their functionally crucial charge (oxidation state) changes and electrocatalytic properties are best investigated under electrochemical operation conditions. We established operando Raman spectroscopy for investigation of the atomic structure and oxidation state of a non-crystalline, hydrated, and phosphate-containing Co oxide material (CoCat), which is an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at neutral pH and is structurally similar to LiCoO 2 of batteries. Raman spectra were collected at various sub-catalytic and catalytic electric potentials. 2 H labeling suggests Co oxidation coupled to Co—OH deprotonation at catalytic potentials. 18 O labeling supports O—O bond formation starting from terminally coordinated oxygen species. Two broad bands around 877 cm −1 and 1077 cm −1 are assigned to CoCat-internal H 2 PO 4 - . Raman peaks corresponding to terminal oxide (Co=O) or reactive oxygen species were not detectable; 1000–1200 cm −1 bands were instead assigned to two-phonon Raman scattering. At an increasingly positive potential, the intensity of the Raman bands decreased, which is unexpected and explained by self-absorption relating to CoCat electrochromism. A red-shift of the Co—O Raman bands with increasing potentials was described by four Gaussian bands of potential-dependent amplitudes. By linear combination of Raman band amplitudes, we can follow individually the Co(2+/3+) and Co(3+/4+) redox transitions, whereas previously published x-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis could determine only the averaged Co oxidation state. Our results show how electrochemical operando Raman spectroscopy can be employed as a potent analytical tool in mechanistic investigations on OER catalysis.},

  abstract = {Photocatalysis is a promising sustainable method to generate solar fuels for the future, as well as having other applications such as water/air purification. However, the performance of photocatalysts is often limited by poor charge carrier dynamics. To improve charge carrier dynamics, it is necessary to characterize and understand charge carrier behavior in photocatalytic systems. This critical review will present Transient Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS) as a useful technique for understanding the behavior of photoexcited charges in semiconductor photocatalysts.

Basic principles behind TAS will be introduced, and interpretation of TAS spectra and kinetics will be discussed in the context of exemplar literature.

The method combines the well known quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) approach with the description of the system in an extended ring polymer phase space. Employing the prototypical Mu/H/D + H 2 ( ⁠ v = 0, 1) reactions as a benchmark, we show that the presented approach does not violate zero-point energy constraints and that it can also capture the contributions of tunneling through the v = 1 vibrationally adiabatic barrier present for the Mu + H 2 ( v = 1) reaction. This is a significant improvement over the QCT approach with only a small increase in numerical cost.},

  abstract = {The assignment of vibrational states is an integral part of quantum chemical calculations, which supports the analysis of experimental infrared spectra. In variational calculations, usually, it is the leading coefficient of the configuration interaction vector, which provides the state identity. However, this concept will possibly fail in case of special coordinate systems, such as, for example, localized normal coordinates, or within calculations for overtones of non-Abelian molecules, when a real valued configuration basis has been employed. A combination of both renders a proper assignment fairly tedious. We present a route to overcome this problem by using a highly efficient calculation of multidimensional overlap integrals based on the Smolyak quadrature. Beside this, a general protocol for the symmetry assignment of vibrational states will be discussed, which completes a general assignment. Extensive benchmark calculations are provided for the fundamental modes and overtones of chloromethane, CH 3 Cl, in canonical and localized normal coordinates based on accurate potential energy surfaces obtained from explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory. In addition, the linear CNNC molecule has been studied, for which hardly any reference data do exist.},

  abstract = {Many-electron wavepacket dynamics based on time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI) is a numerically rigorous approach to quantitatively model electron transfer across molecular junctions. TDCI simulations of cyanobenzene thiolates—para- and meta-linked to an acceptor gold atom—show donor states conjugating with the benzene π -network to allow better through-molecule electron migration in the para isomer compared to the meta counterpart. For dynamics involving non-conjugating states, we find electron injection to stem exclusively from distance-dependent non-resonant quantum mechanical tunneling, in which case the meta isomer exhibits better dynamics. The computed trend in donor-to-acceptor net-electron transfer through differently linked azulene bridges agrees with the trend seen in low-bias conductivity measurements. Disruption of π -conjugation has been shown to be the cause of diminished electron injection through 1,3-azulene, a pathological case for a graph-based diagnosis of the destructive quantum interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the quantum interference of many-electron wavefunctions to drive para-vs-meta selectivity in the coherent evolution of superposed π (CN)- and σ (NC–C)-type wavepackets. Analyses reveal that in the para-linked benzene, σ and π MOs localized at the donor terminal are in-phase , leading to the constructive interference of electron density distribution, while the phase-flip of one of the MOs in the meta isomer results in the destructive interference. These findings suggest that a priori detection of orbital phase-flip and quantum coherence conditions can aid in molecular device design strategies.},

In particular, the employed formalism has enabled the implementation of an algorithm able to tackle DFT calculations of large systems, up to many thousands of atoms, with a computational effort that scales linearly with the number of atoms. In this work, we recall some of the features that have been made possible by the peculiar properties of Daubechies wavelets. In particular, we focus our attention on the usage of DFT for large-scale systems. We show how the localized description of the KS problem, emerging from the features of the basis set, is helpful in providing a simplified description of large-scale electronic structure calculations. We provide some examples on how such a simplified description can be employed, and we consider, among the case-studies, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.},

To this end, we have calculated the equilibrium configuration and energetics of alkali atoms attached to a 4 He 1000 droplet hosting a vortex line using 4 He density functional theory. We use them to study how the dipole absorption spectrum of the alkali atom is modified when the impurity is attached to a vortex line. Spectra are found to be blue-shifted (higher frequencies) and broadened compared to vortex-free droplets because the dimple in which the alkali atom sits at the intersection of the vortex line and the droplet surface is deeper. This effect is smaller for lighter alkali atoms and all the more so when using a quantum description since, in this case, they sit further away from the droplet surface on average due to their zero-point motion. Spectral modifications due to the presence of a vortex line are minor for np ← ns excitation and therefore insufficient for vortex detection. In the case of higher n ′ p ← ns or n ′ s ← ns ( n ′ &gt; n ) excitations, the shifts are larger as the excited state orbital is more extended and therefore more sensitive to changes in the surrounding helium density.},

While one-dimensional replica exchange, which exchanges only temperature, cannot cross first-order phase transition points, GCREM can avoid this problem by making a detour in the two-dimensional parameter space. From only one simulation run, we can obtain probability distributions in the grand canonical ensemble for wide temperature and chemical potential values using the multiple-histogram reweighting techniques.

  abstract = {The multicomponent orbital-optimized second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (OOMP2) method is the first multicomponent MP2 method that is able to calculate qualitatively accurate protonic densities, protonic affinities, and geometrical changes due to nuclear quantum effects in multicomponent systems. In this study, two approximations of the multicomponent OOMP2 method are introduced in an effort to demonstrate that, in orbital-optimized multicomponent methods, performing the orbital-optimization process with only electron–proton correlation is sufficient to obtain accurate protonic properties. Additionally, these approximations should reduce the computational expense of the multicomponent OOMP2 method. In the first approximation, the first-order wave function is written as a linear combination of one-electron one-proton excitations rather than as a linear combination of one-electron one-proton and two-electron excitations as in the original multicomponent OOMP2 method. Electron–electron correlation is included perturbatively after the orbital-optimization procedure has converged. In the second approach, the first approximation is further modified to neglect all terms in the orbital-rotation gradients that depend on the two-electron molecular-orbital integrals, which, assuming a fixed-sized protonic basis set, reduces the computational scaling for the orbital-optimization iterations to N e 3 ⁠ , where N e is a measure of the electronic system size, compared to the N e 5 scaling of the original multicomponent OOMP2 method. The second approximation requires one N e 5 step after orbital convergence to compute the electron–electron correlation energy. The accuracy of the calculated protonic densities, protonic affinities, and optimized geometries of these approximations is similar or improved relative to the original multicomponent OOMP2 method.},

Here, we demonstrate its application to learn an effective coarse-grained (CG) model from all-atom simulation data in a sample efficient manner. The CG force field is learned by following the thermodynamic consistency principle, here by minimizing the error between the predicted CG force and the all-atom mean force in the CG coordinates. Solving this problem by GDML directly is impossible because coarse-graining requires averaging over many training data points, resulting in impractical memory requirements for storing the kernel matrices. In this work, we propose a data-efficient and memory-saving alternative. Using ensemble learning and stratified sampling, we propose a 2-layer training scheme that enables GDML to learn an effective CG model. We illustrate our method on a simple biomolecular system, alanine dipeptide, by reconstructing the free energy landscape of a CG variant of this molecule. Our novel GDML training scheme yields a smaller free energy error than neural networks when the training set is small, and a comparably high accuracy when the training set is sufficiently large.},

This unique methodology is based on the use of an incremental expansion for potential energy surfaces, known as n -mode expansion; an incremental many-body representation of the electronic energy; and an efficient vibrational density-guided approach to automated determination of grid dimensions and granularity. The reliability of the method is validated calculating potential energy surfaces and obtaining fundamental excitation energies for three moderate-size chain-like molecular systems. The use of our methodology leads to considerable computational savings for potential energy surface construction compared to standard approaches while maintaining a high level of accuracy in the resulting potential energy surfaces. Additional investigations indicate that our method can be applied to covalently bound and strongly interacting molecular systems, even though these cases are known to be very unfavorable for fragmentation schemes. We therefore conclude that the presented methodology is a robust and flexible approach to potential energy surface construction, which introduces considerable computational savings without compromising the accuracy of vibrational spectra calculations.},

An external potential, applied only in the interfacial region, balances the excess chemical potential of the system. To ensure that the size of the reservoir is infinite, we introduce a particle insertion/deletion algorithm to control the density in the ideal gas region. We show that it is possible to study non-equilibrium phenomena with this open-boundary molecular dynamics method. To this aim, we consider a prototypical confined liquid under the influence of an external constant density gradient. The resulting pressure-driven flow across the atomistic system exhibits a velocity profile consistent with the corresponding solution of the Navier–Stokes equation. This method conserves, on average, linear momentum and closely resembles experimental conditions. Moreover, it can be used to study various direct and indirect out-of-equilibrium conditions in complex molecular systems.},

In RISM-SCF-SEDD, the electrostatic interaction between the solute and the solvent is described by considering the spread of electron to obtain more realistic electronic structure in solutions. It is thus expected to allow us to predict more quantitative chemical shifts of a wide variety of chemical species in solutions. In this study, the method is applied to a water molecule in water and is validated by examining the dependence of the solvent temperature and density on chemical shifts. The dependence of solvent species is also investigated, and more accurate results are obtained for polar solvents compared to the previous RISM-SCF study. Another application example of this method is the 15 N chemical shifts of two azines in water, which is difficult to predict with the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Our results are in good agreement with the previous quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics study and experimental results. It is also shown that our method gives more realistic results for methanol and acetone than the PCM.},

Since, in the limit of a complete basis set calculation, the paramagnetic component J p also becomes divergenceless, we call this scheme CTOCD-DC (CTOCD for Divergenceless Components). CTOCD-DC allows for a topological characterization of both J d and J p in terms of their stagnation graphs. All stagnation graphs of J d from CTOCD-DC contain the zero points of the gradient of the unperturbed electron density ( ⁠ ∇ ρ ). In this way, an intimate topological relation between ρ and the diamagnetic current contribution is revealed.

  abstract = {Liquid state theories such as integral equations and classical density functional theory often overestimate the bulk pressure of fluids because they require closure relations or truncations of functionals. Consequently, the cost to create a molecular cavity in the fluid is no longer negligible, and those theories predict incorrect solvation free energies. We show how to correct them simply by computing an optimized Van der Walls volume of the solute and removing the undue free energy to create such volume in the fluid. Given this versatile correction, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art solvation theories can predict, within seconds, hydration free energies of a benchmark of small neutral drug-like molecules with the same accuracy as day-long molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a generic and simple definition of a line separating gas-like and liquid-like fluid behaviors from the standpoint of shear viscosity. This definition is valid even for fluids such as the hard sphere and the inverse power law that exhibit a unique fluid phase. We argue that this line is defined by the location of the minimum of the macroscopically scaled viscosity when plotted as a function of the excess entropy, which differs from the popular Widom lines. For hard sphere, Lennard-Jones, and inverse-power-law fluids, such a line is located at an excess entropy approximately equal to −2/3 times Boltzmann’s constant and corresponds to points in the thermodynamic phase diagram for which the kinetic contribution to viscosity is approximately half of the total viscosity. For flexible Lennard-Jones chains, the excess entropy at the minimum is a linear function of the chain length. This definition opens a straightforward route to classify the dynamical behavior of fluids from a single thermodynamic quantity obtainable from high-accuracy thermodynamic models.},

ACoSs are fully miscible at the macroscopic level but exhibit nanometer-scale spatial heterogeneity. ACoSs have recently received renewed attention within the chemical physics community as model systems to explore the relationship between intermolecular interactions and microscopic liquid–liquid phase separation. In this perspective, we provide an overview of ACoS spatial segregation, dynamic heterogeneity, and multiscale relaxation dynamics.

  abstract = {Hybrid particle-field methods are computationally efficient approaches for modeling soft matter systems. So far, applications of these methodologies have been limited to constant volume conditions. Here, we reformulate particle-field interactions to represent systems coupled to constant external pressure. First, we show that the commonly used particle-field energy functional can be modified to model and parameterize the isotropic contributions to the pressure tensor without interfering with the microscopic forces on the particles. Second, we employ a square gradient particle-field interaction term to model non-isotropic contributions to the pressure tensor, such as in surface tension phenomena. This formulation is implemented within the hybrid particle-field molecular dynamics approach and is tested on a series of model systems. Simulations of a homogeneous water box demonstrate that it is possible to parameterize the equation of state to reproduce any target density for a given external pressure. Moreover, the same parameterization is transferable to systems of similar coarse-grained mapping resolution. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach on coarse-grained models of phospholipids, finding that the term between water and the lipid hydrocarbon tails is alone sufficient to reproduce the experimental area per lipid in constant-pressure simulations and to produce a qualitatively correct lateral pressure profile.},

Here, we use 2D simulation of suspensions consisting of active Brownian particles and a passive disk-shaped tracer to investigate tracers’ diffusive behaviors in a wide range of volume fractions. Due to the competition between the thermal noise and collisions with active particles, tracers express a first transition from the normal diffusion to the superdiffusion at a short time scale and recur to normal diffusion at a long time scale. At a low volume fraction, infrequent active collisions retard the first transition of smaller tracers. At a high volume fraction, active particles with high activity aggregating around tracers induce a bimodal probability distribution function of tracer displacements during superdiffusion. Considering the enhancement of diffusion, the non-dimensional enhanced diffusivity increases asymptotically with the Peclet number. The asymptotic line gives an upper limit of non-dimensional enhanced diffusivity of tracers. Cases with lower enhanced diffusion have a high volume fraction and a low active velocity that indicates the inhibition of concentrated active baths. With the high negentropic work of these cases, the inhibition is explained as the change of the configuration of active baths for introducing tracers.},

The density functional theory of rod–coil diblock copolymers has been generalized to the case of the tilted lamellar phase and used to study the stability of the orthogonal lamellar phase with respect to tilt. The orthogonal phase indeed appears to be unstable in the broad region of the parameter space in the case of relatively strong segregation. It has also been shown that the transition into the tilted lamellar phase is determined by a strong coupling between two independent tilt order parameters.},

Experiments and simulations showed, however, that k loop showed the fractional viscosity dependence of k loop ∼ η − β with β &lt; 1 either in glasses or in low-viscosity solutions. The origin of the fractional viscosity dependence remains elusive and has been attributed to phenomenological aspects. In this paper, we illustrate that the well-known failure of classical kinetics of the loop formation results from the breakdown of the local thermal equilibrium (LTE) approximation and that the mutual information can quantify the breakdown of the LTE successfully.},

The dynamical heterogeneity of the polymer segments created by the end segments is taken into account. Within an accuracy of slow-changing logarithmic factors, FID can be qualitatively described by a transition from an initial pseudo-Gaussian to a stretched-exponential decay at long times. With an increase in observation time, the contribution from end effects to the FID increases. In the regime of incoherent reptation, contributions to the FID from central segments yield an exponent of 1/4 for the stretched decay and contributions from end segments yield an exponent of 3/16. In the regime of coherent reptation, the central segments generate a stretching exponent of 1/2, whereas the end segments contribute with an exponent of 1/4. These predictions are shown to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental FIDs of perdeuterated poly(ethylene oxide) with molecular masses of 132 kg/mol and 862 kg/mol.},

For active particles, there exists an optimal temperature difference at which the rectified efficiency is maximal. Passive particles are not propelled and move by collisions with active particles, so the response to temperature differences is more complicated. By changing the system parameters, active particles can change their directions, while passive particles always move in the same direction. The simulation results show that the separation of mixtures is sensitive to the system parameters, such as the angular velocity, the temperature difference, and the polar alignment.

  abstract = {When a gel swollen with a certain solvent is placed in the bath of another solvent, the gel swells or de-swells depending on the thermodynamic affinity to the gel. Toyotama et al. [Langmuir 22 , 1952 (2006)] reported an unusual volume change of chemical gels that cannot be explained by the affinity difference: when a chemical gel saturated with water is immersed in ethylene glycol (EG), although those solvents have almost the same affinity to the polymer, the gel first shrinks and then re-swells and finally takes the same equilibrium volume as the initial. The re-entrant swelling was attributed to different diffusion rates between water and EG (dynamical asymmetry), but the detailed mechanism was not clarified. In this paper, we experimentally show that the characteristic times for the temporal shrinking and subsequent volume relaxation are proportional to the squared system size. This indicates that the phenomenon is governed by diffusive dynamics. According to this observation, we propose a coupled diffusion model explaining the physical mechanism of the re-entrant volume change.},

Using the radio-frequency muon spin rotation (RF- μ SR) technique, we directly observe and characterize the resulting final state on the nanoparticle surface, showing conclusively its diamagnetic nature. The magnetic environment experienced by the reacted muons is only weakly perturbed compared to that of muons in a silica reference, consistent with the surface of the gold nanoparticles being metallic and non-magnetic. We demonstrate the potential of RF- μ SR for the investigation of the surface properties of nanoparticles and show the feasibility of Knight shift measurements of muons on metal surfaces.},

On the cathode, we attest that the surface of the pristine particles is composed of adventitious Li 2 CO 3 together with reduced Ni and Co in a +2 oxidation state, which is directly responsible for the overpotential observed during the first de-lithiation. This layer decomposes at 3.8 V vs Li + /Li, leaving behind a fresh surface with Ni and Co in a +3 oxidation state. The charge compensation upon Li + extraction takes place above 4.0 V and is assigned to the oxidation of both Ni and oxygen, while Co remains in a +3 oxidation state during the whole redox process. We also identified the formation of an inactive surface layer already at 4.3 V, rich in reduced Ni and depleted in oxygen. However, at 4.9 V, NiO-like species are detected accompanied with reduced Co. Despite the highly oxidative potential, the surface of the cathode after long cycling is free of oxidized solvent byproducts but contains traces of LiPF 6 byproducts (LiF and PO x F y ). On the LTO counter electrode, transition metals are detected only after long cycling vs NCA to 4.9 V as well as PVdF and LiPF 6 byproducts originating from the cathode. Finally, harvested cycled electrodes prove that the influence of the crosstalk on the electrochemical performance of LTO is limited.},

The work is motivated by several experiments that pointed to SrTiO 3 /TiO 2 as a good system for photocatalytic applications, due to the small lattice mismatch between these two oxides and their favorable band alignment, leading to a type-II heterojunction, favoring the charge-carrier separation. The present results provide insights into the nature of the contact region and an estimation of the band offsets in the composite system. Our results are also compared with the available experimental values and with previous theoretical reports. The calculated offsets quantitatively agree with experimental measurements. In addition, we found significant interfacial effects that make the band offsets slightly increase with respect to those of the separated components. Last, we also discuss the role of point defects such as oxygen vacancies, finding that they do not remarkably affect the band alignment.},

Altering the morphology on demand, however, is a very difficult task. Here, we show ways the morphology of interfaces can be tuned by driven electron transfer reactions. By using non-equilibrium thermodynamic stability theory, we uncover the operating conditions that alter the interfacial morphology. We apply the theory to ion intercalation and surface growth where electrochemical reactions are described using Butler–Volmer or coupled ion–electron transfer kinetics. The latter connects microscopic/quantum mechanical concepts with the morphology of electrochemical interfaces. Finally, we construct non-equilibrium phase diagrams in terms of the applied driving force (current/voltage) and discuss the importance of engineering the density of states of the electron donor in applications related to energy harvesting and storage, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis.},

It has also been established that there is a threshold size for microdroplets to behave differently than droplets near the 10 µ m diameter range. We present a three-dimensional electrostatic treatment in the spirit of the Gouy–Chapman model for double layers at interfaces. Our treatment predicts a strong concentration of charged molecules toward the surface of the droplet. As the droplet size deceases, the majority of the volume of the liquid experiences a large DC electric field. Such electric fields are highly unusual in a conducting fluid such as water. We believe that this unique environment helps to explain the reaction rate acceleration and new chemistry that have been observed in microdroplets compared to bulk phase.},

Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we study thermal transport across the liquid–vapor interface of a model n -dodecane (C 12 H 26 ) under various driving force conditions. In each MD simulation, we restrict the thermal energy to be transferred across the liquid–vapor interface by only one mechanism. In spite of the complex intramolecular interactions in n -dodecane molecules, our modeling results indicate that the Schrage relationships, which were shown to give accurate predictions of evaporation and condensation rates of monatomic fluids, are also valid in the prediction of evaporation and condensation rates of n -dodecane. In the case of heat conduction at the liquid–vapor interface of n -dodecane, the interfacial thermal conductance obtained from MD simulations is consistent with the prediction from the kinetic theory of gases. The fundamental understanding of thermal transport mechanisms at liquid–gas interfaces will allow us to formulate appropriate boundary conditions for continuum modeling of heating and evaporation of small fuel droplets.},

  abstract = {Controlling electronic decoherence in molecules is an outstanding challenge in chemistry. Recent advances in the theory of electronic decoherence [B. Gu and I. Franco, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 9 , 773 (2018)] have demonstrated that it is possible to manipulate the rate of electronic coherence loss via control of the relative phase in the initial electronic superposition state. This control emerges when there are both relaxation and pure-dephasing channels for decoherence and applies to initially separable electron–nuclear states. In this paper, we demonstrate that (1) such an initial superposition state and the subsequent quantum control of electronic decoherence can be created via weak-field one-photon photoexcitation with few-cycle laser pulses of definite carrier envelope phase (CEP), provided the system is initially prepared in a separable electron–nuclear state. However, we also demonstrate that (2) when stationary molecular states (which are generally not separable) are considered, such one-photon laser control disappears. Remarkably, this happens even in situations in which the initially factorizable state is an excellent approximation to the stationary state with fidelity above 98.5\%. The laser control that emerges for initially separable states is shown to arise because these states are superpositions of molecular eigenstates that open up CEP-controllable interference routes at the one-photon limit. Using these insights, we demonstrate that (3) the laser control of electronic decoherence from stationary states can be recovered by using a two-pulse control scheme, with the first pulse creating a vibronic superposition state and the second one inducing interference. This contribution advances a viable scheme for the laser control of electronic decoherence and exposes a surprising artifact that is introduced by widely used initially factorizable system-bath states in the field of open quantum systems.},

  abstract = {The properties of molecular oxygen including its condensed phases continue to be of great relevance for the scientific community. The richness and complexity of its associated properties stem from the fact that it is a very stable diradical. Its open-shell nature leads to low-lying multiplets with total electronic spin S = 0, 1, 2 in the case of the dimer, (O 2 ) 2 , and the accurate calculation of the intermolecular potentials represents a challenge to ab initio electronic structure methods. In this work, we present intermolecular potentials calculated at a very high level, thus competing with the most accurate restricted potentials obtained to date. This is accomplished by drawing on an analogy between the coupled and uncoupled representations of angular momentum and restricted vs unrestricted methodologies. The S = 2 state can be well represented by unrestricted calculations in which the spins of the unpaired electrons are aligned in parallel; however, for the state where they are aligned in antiparallel fashion, it would seem that the total spin is not well defined, i.e., the well-known spin contamination problem. We show that its energy corresponds to that of the S = 1 state and perform unrestricted coupled cluster calculations for these two states. Then, we obtain the S = 0 state through the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and show that this is very reliable in the well region of the potentials. We make extensive comparisons with the best restricted potentials [Bartolomei et al. , Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 10(35), 5374–5380 (2008)] and with reliable experimental determinations, and a very good agreement is globally found.},

  abstract = {LiHe is an intriguing open-shell dimer. It is an extremely weakly bound system, and its vibrational bound-state radius extends far into the classically forbidden regions. Exciting helium into 1 s 2 p leads to a 2 Σ and a 2 Π state, in which lithium is in its ground state. These states are located above the ionization threshold of the Li atom, which makes them metastable, i.e., resonance states. Under these conditions, energy transfer between the atoms over large distances is feasible within the framework of interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD). These states are investigated theoretically; herein, we present and analyze the complex potential energy curves of the 2 Σ and 2 Π states, where their imaginary parts describe the decay rate of these resonance states. We employ the resonance via Padé approach to calculate these potentials. Thereby, we use the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method to compute stabilization graphs as input data for the analytical dilation (via Padé) into the complex energy plane. The procedure is suitable for studying Feshbach resonances and ICD states such as the LiHe 2 Σ and 2 Π states. The resulting ab initio complex potential energy curves will be used in future work to describe the dynamics of the process HeLi + h ν → He * Li → HeLi + + e ICD , which is amenable to experiment.},

  abstract = {In the electrode/electrolyte interface of a typical lithium-ion battery, a solid electrolyte interphase layer is formed as a result of electrolyte decomposition during the initial charge/discharge cycles. Electron leakage from the anode to the electrolyte reduces the Li + -ion and makes it more reactive, resulting in decomposition of the organic electrolyte. To study the Li-electrolyte solvation, solvent exchange, and subsequent solvent decomposition reactions at the anode/electrolyte interface, we have extended the existing ReaxFF reactive force field parameter sets to organic electrolyte species, such as ethylene carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, vinylene carbonate, and LiPF 6 salt. Density Functional Theory (DFT) data describing Li-associated initiation reactions for the organic electrolytes and binding energies of Li-electrolyte solvation structures were generated and added to the existing ReaxFF training data, and subsequently, we trained the ReaxFF parameters with the aim of finding the optimal reproduction of the DFT data. In order to discern the characteristics of the Li neutral and cation, we have introduced a second Li parameter set to describe the Li + -ion. ReaxFF is trained for Li-neutral and Li + -cation to have similar solvation energies, but unlike the neutral Li, Li + will not induce reactivity in the organic electrolyte. Solvent decomposition reactions are presumed to happen once Li + -ions are reduced to Li-atoms, which can be simulated using a Monte Carlo type atom modification within ReaxFF. This newly developed force field is capable of distinguishing between a Li-atom and a Li + -ion properly. Moreover, it is found that the solvent decomposition reaction barrier is a function of the number of ethylene carbonate molecules solvating the Li-atom.},

  abstract = {High-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an indispensable technique for identification and characterization of chemicals and biomolecular structures. In the vast majority of NMR experiments, nuclear spin polarization arises from thermalization in multi-Tesla magnetic fields produced by superconducting magnets. In contrast, NMR instruments operating at low magnetic fields are emerging as a compact, inexpensive, and highly accessible alternative but suffer from low thermal polarization at a low field strength and consequently a low signal. However, certain hyperpolarization techniques create high polarization levels on target molecules independent of magnetic fields, giving low-field NMR a significant sensitivity boost. In this study, SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) was combined with high homogeneity electromagnets operating at mT fields, enabling high resolution 1 H, 13 C, 15 N, and 19 F spectra to be detected with a single scan at magnetic fields between 1 mT and 10 mT. Chemical specificity is attained at mT magnetic fields with complex, highly resolved spectra. Most spectra are in the strong coupling regime where J -couplings are on the order of chemical shift differences. The spectra and the hyperpolarization spin dynamics are simulated with SPINACH. The simulations start from the parahydrogen singlet in the bound complex and include both chemical exchange and spin evolution at these mT fields. The simulations qualitatively match the experimental spectra and are used to identify the spin order terms formed during mT SABRE. The combination of low field NMR instruments with SABRE polarization results in sensitive measurements, even for rare spins with low gyromagnetic ratios at low magnetic fields.},

The entropy is defined in relation to the purity of a subsystem in a bipartite quantum system, and to compute it, we compare two sampling ensembles based on the path integral ground state (PIGS) formalism. This scheme centers on the replica trick and is aided by the ratio trick, both developed in this context by Hastings et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 , 157201 (2010)]. We study a system composed of linear quantum rotors on a lattice in one dimension, interacting via an anisotropic dipole–dipole potential. The ground state second Rényi entropies estimated by PIGS are benchmarked against those from the density matrix renormalization group for various interaction strengths and system sizes. We find that the entropy grows with an increase in interaction strength, and for large enough systems, it appears to plateau near log(2). We posit that the limiting case of many strongly interacting rotors behaves akin to a lattice of two-level particles in a cat state, in which one naturally finds an entanglement entropy of log(2).},

  abstract = {Quantum furling and unfurling are inelastic transitions between localized and delocalized electronic states. We predict scenarios where these processes govern charge transport through donor-bridge-acceptor molecular junctions. Like in the case of ballistic transport, the resulting currents are nearly independent of the molecular bridge length. However, currents involving quantum furling and unfurling processes can be controlled by the coupling to vibrations in the intra-molecular and the extra-molecular environment, which can be experimentally tuned. Our study is based on rate equations for exchange of energy (bosons) and particles (fermions) between the molecular bridge and its environment. An efficient algorithm is introduced for a compact representation of the relevant rate equations, which utilizes the redundancies in the rate matrix and the sparsity of the creation and annihilation operators in the molecular Fock space.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent experiments, we study normal-phase rotating 3 He droplets within density functional theory in a semi-classical approach. The sequence of rotating droplet shapes as a function of angular momentum is found to agree with that of rotating classical droplets, evolving from axisymmetric oblate to triaxial prolate to two-lobed shapes as the angular momentum of the droplet increases. Our results, which are obtained for droplets of nanoscopic size, are rescaled to the mesoscopic size characterizing ongoing experimental measurements, allowing for a direct comparison of shapes. The stability curve in the angular velocity–angular momentum plane shows small deviations from the classical rotating drop model predictions, whose magnitude increases with angular momentum. We attribute these deviations to effects not included in the simplified classical model description of a rotating fluid held together by surface tension, i.e., to surface diffuseness, curvature, and finite compressibility, and to quantum effects associated with deformation of the 3 He Fermi surface. The influence of all these effects is expected to diminish as the droplet size increases, making the classical rotating droplet model a quite accurate representation of 3 He rotation.},

  abstract = {We present three schemes to go beyond the electric-dipole approximation in x-ray absorption spectroscopy calculations within a four-component relativistic framework. The first is based on the full semi-classical light–matter interaction operator and the two others on a truncated interaction within the Coulomb gauge (velocity representation) and multipolar gauge (length representation). We generalize the derivation of the multipolar gauge to an arbitrary expansion point and show that the potentials corresponding to different expansion points are related by a gauge transformation, provided that the expansion is not truncated. This suggests that the observed gauge-origin dependence in the multipolar gauge is more than just a finite-basis set effect. The simplicity of the relativistic formalism enables arbitrary-order implementations of the truncated interactions, with and without rotational averaging, allowing us to test their convergence behavior numerically by comparison to the full formulation. We confirm the observation that the oscillator strength of the electric-dipole allowed ligand K -edge transition of TiCl 4 , when calculated to the second order in the wave vector, becomes negative but also show that inclusion of higher-order contributions allows convergence to the result obtained using the full light–matter interaction. However, at higher energies, the slow convergence of such expansions becomes dramatic and renders such approaches at best impractical. When going beyond the electric-dipole approximation, we therefore recommend the use of the full light–matter interaction.},

The properties of systems governed by noncovalent interactions can be predicted only if potential energy surfaces (force fields) are available. SAPT is the preferred approach for generating such surfaces since it is seamlessly connected to the asymptotic expansion of interaction energy. SAPT2020 includes codes for automatic development of such surfaces, enabling generation of complete dimer surfaces with a rigid monomer approximation for dimers containing about one hundred atoms. These codes can also be used to obtain surfaces including internal degrees of freedom of monomers.},

Job specification may be passed using The Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) QCSCHEMA data format, facilitating interoperability. A rewrite of our top-level computation driver, and concomitant adoption of the MolSSI QCARCHIVE INFRASTRUCTURE project, makes the latest version of PSI4 well suited to distributed computation of large numbers of independent tasks.

The TURBOMOLE software suite is optimized for widely available, inexpensive, and resource-efficient hardware such as multi-core workstations and small computer clusters. TURBOMOLE specializes in electronic structure methods with outstanding accuracy–cost ratio, such as density functional theory including local hybrids and the random phase approximation (RPA), GW -Bethe–Salpeter methods, second-order Møller–Plesset theory, and explicitly correlated coupled-cluster methods. TURBOMOLE is based on Gaussian basis sets and has been pivotal for the development of many fast and low-scaling algorithms in the past three decades, such as integral-direct methods, fast multipole methods, the resolution-of-the-identity approximation, imaginary frequency integration, Laplace transform, and pair natural orbital methods. This review focuses on recent additions to TURBOMOLE’s functionality, including excited-state methods, RPA and Green’s function methods, relativistic approaches, high-order molecular properties, solvation effects, and periodic systems. A variety of illustrative applications along with accuracy and timing data are discussed. Moreover, available interfaces to users as well as other software are summarized.

The scheme, which we name Hybrid Diagonal Approximation (HDA), consists in employing in the response function a hybrid xc-functional (containing a fraction of the non-local Hartree–Fock exchange) only for the diagonal elements of the omega matrix, while the adiabatic local density approximation is employed for the off-diagonal terms. HDA is especially (but not exclusively) advantageous when using Slater type orbital basis sets and allows one to employ them in a uniquely efficient way, as we demonstrate here by implementing HDA in a local version of the Amsterdam Density Functional code. The new protocol is tested on NH 3 , C 6 H 6 , and the [Au 25 (SCH 3 ) 18 ] − cluster as prototypical cases ranging from small molecules to ligand-protected metal clusters, finding excellent agreement with respect to both full kernel TDDFT simulations and experimental data. Additionally, a specific comparison test between full kernel and HDA is considered at the Casida level on seven other molecular species, which further confirm the accuracy of the approach for all investigated systems. For the [Au 25 (SCH 3 ) 18 ] − cluster, a speedup by a factor of seven is obtained with respect to the full kernel. The HDA, therefore, promises to provide a quantitative description of the optical properties of medium-sized systems (nanoclusters) at an affordable cost, thanks to its computational efficiency, especially in combination with a complex polarization algorithm version of TDDFT.},

  abstract = {With the increasing interest in compounds containing heavier elements, the experimental and theoretical community requires computationally efficient approaches capable of simultaneous non-perturbative treatment of relativistic, spin-polarization, and electron correlation effects. The ReSpect program has been designed with this goal in mind and developed to perform relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations on molecules and solids at the quasirelativistic two-component (X2C Hamiltonian) and fully relativistic four-component (Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian) level of theory, including the effects of spin polarization in open-shell systems at the Kramers-unrestricted self-consistent field level. Through efficient algorithms exploiting time-reversal symmetry, biquaternion algebra, and the locality of atom-centered Gaussian-type orbitals, a significant reduction of the methodological complexity and computational cost has been achieved. This article summarizes the essential theoretical and technical advances made in the program, supplemented by example calculations. ReSpect allows molecules with &gt;100 atoms to be efficiently handled at the four-component level of theory on standard central processing unit-based commodity clusters, at computational costs that rarely exceed a factor of 10 when compared to the non-relativistic realm. In addition to the prediction of band structures in solids, ReSpect offers a growing list of molecular spectroscopic parameters that range from electron paramagnetic resonance parameters (g-tensor, A-tensor, and zero-field splitting), via (p)NMR chemical shifts and nuclear spin–spin couplings, to various linear response properties using either conventional or damped-response time-dependent DFT (TDDFT): excitation energies, frequency-dependent polarizabilities, and natural chiroptical properties (electronic circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion). In addition, relativistic real-time TDDFT electron dynamics is another unique feature of the program. Documentation, including user manuals and tutorials, is available at the program’s website http://www.respectprogram.org .},

  abstract = {Although electrolyte decomposition is a key issue for the stability of Li-ion batteries and has been intensively investigated in the past, a common understanding of the concepts and involved processes is still missing. In this article, we present an overview on our results obtained with a surface science approach and discuss the implications for the stability window of Li-ion electrolytes under consideration of calculated oxidation potentials from the literature. We find LiCoO 2 valence band–solvent highest occupied molecular orbital offsets that are in agreement with expectations based on ionization potentials, polarization effects, and solvent–salt interactions. In agreement with thermodynamic considerations, our data show that surface layer formation on pristine electrodes occurs inside the electrochemical window as defined by the measured oxidation and reduction potentials, which can be attributed to electrode surface interactions. The results demonstrate that the simple energy level approach commonly used to evaluate the stability window of Li-ion electrolytes has very limited applicability. The perspectives for further investigations of the electronic structure of Li-ion cathode–liquid electrolyte interfaces are discussed.},

The polymer is described by a generic bead-and-spring model, while the polymer chains and the nanoparticles (NPs) interact by Hamaker-style potentials. The potential describing NP–NP interactions is modified by a tuning parameter f , which can be changed continuously between f = 0 (for fully developed van der Waals attractions between the NPs) and f = 1 (for completely repulsive interparticle interactions). We explore systematically the effect of the f parameter on the blend morphologies, for two representative NP sizes. When the polymer–NP attractions are decreased, the systems undergo a transition from dispersed to aggregated morphologies. The sharpness of the transition gradually increases with the interparticle attractions (i.e., decreasing f ).},

The persistence probability is defined as the probability that a stochastic variable has not changed its sign in the given time interval. We explicitly consider two cases—diffusion of a free particle and that of a harmonically trapped particle. The latter is particularly relevant in experiments that use trapping and tracking techniques to measure the displacements. We provide analytical expressions of p ( t ) for both the scenarios and show that in the absence of the shape asymmetry, the results reduce to the case of an isotropic particle. The analytical expressions of p ( t ) are further validated against numerical simulation of the underlying overdamped dynamics. We also illustrate that p ( t ) can be a measure to determine the shape asymmetry of a colloid and the translational and rotational diffusivities can be estimated from the measured persistence probability. The advantage of this method is that it does not require the tracking of the orientation of the particle.},

In this work, we look toward the replacement of the oleic acid and amine with phosphorous-based ligands. We synthesize CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals using an oleylamine/alkylphosphonic acid combination with near perfect monodispersity with the ability to tune the bandgap by varying the alkyl chain length. We further investigate the replacement of the oleylamine giving a ligand combination of alkylphosphonic acid/trioctylphosphine oxide for perovskite nanocrystal nucleation and growth. This combination is typical for the widely studied metal chalcogenide synthesis and in our study with CsPbBr 3 yields a pure phase perovskite.},

This particularly holds for protection from parasitic reactions at the current collector, which reflects an internal interface for the electrode composite material and the electrolyte. In this work, electrolyte formulations based on aliphatic cyclic nitriles, cyclopentane-1-carbonitrile and cyclohexane-1-carbonitrile, are introduced that allow for successful suppression of aluminum dissolution and control of internal interfaces under application-relevant conditions. Such nitrile-based electrolytes show higher intrinsic oxidative and thermal stabilities as well as similar capacity retentions in lithium nickel–manganese–cobalt oxide LiNi 3/5 Mn 1/5 Co 1/5 O 2 (NMC622)||graphite based full cells compared to the state-of-the-art organic carbonate-based electrolytes, even when bis(trifluoro-methane)sulfonimide lithium salt is utilized. Moreover, the importance of relative permittivity, degree of ion dissociation, and viscosity of the applied electrolyte formulations for the protection of current collector interfaces is emphasized.},

  abstract = {The liquid spinodal has long been discussed alongside the elusive liquid–liquid critical point hidden behind the limit of homogeneous nucleation. This has inspired numerous scenarios that attempt to explain water anomalies. Despite recent breakthrough experiments doubting several of those scenarios, we lacked a tool to localize the spinodal and the liquid–liquid critical point. We constructed a unique equation of state combining Speedy’s well known expansion and the liquid–liquid critical point to remove that deficit and to review these explanations. For the first time, the proposed equation of state independently depicts the spinodal in the presence of the liquid–liquid critical point and demonstrates that the explanation for water anomalies based on the reentrance of the spinodal is not valid; this feature (reentrance of the spinodal) was predicted because the density surface is curved by the presence of the second critical point. However, the critical point alone is not sufficient to explain the shape of the density surface of water. In the new equation, hydrogen bond cooperativity is important to force the critical point to exist outside of zero temperature. Together with the recent discovery of a compressibility maximum behind the homogeneous nucleation limit at positive pressure, the findings argue in favor of excluding all explanations for water anomalies except for the existence of the liquid–liquid critical point at positive pressure. Finally, an extensive study of heat capacity demonstrated profound disagreement between the two major experimental heat capacity datasets and identified the more accurate dataset.},

To assign terahertz absorption peaks due to the D 2 O dimer, trimer, and tetramer, the dependence of the spectrum on the annealing temperature and D 2 O dilution was analyzed. The assignment was also examined by ab initio calculations with the use of the “our own N-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics” method, where the flexibility of surrounding Ar atoms was systematically incorporated. We identified all the intermolecular fundamentals of the dimer and those with significant intensities of the trimer and tetramer, whose structural symmetries were revealed to be broken down. After isolating the D 2 O clusters in solid Ar, we sublimated only Ar atoms to leave behind matrix-sublimation ice, which was found to be amorphous- or crystal-like depending on the formation conditions: the dilution and sublimation temperature. The crystallinity of matrix-sublimation ice was determined by decomposing its terahertz spectrum into the spectra of amorphous and crystalline ices. Since the crystallinity got higher by raising the dilution and sublimation temperature, the diffusion of the D 2 O monomer on the surface of sublimating solid Ar was found to be crucial to the crystallization of the sublimation ice.},

They are mass-selected, and infrared photodissociation spectra of these species are measured with the aid of argon-tagging. Although previous theoretical studies have modeled these systems as proton-bound dimers of molecular oxygen, infrared spectra have free OH stretching bands, suggesting other isomeric structures. As a consequence, we undertook extensive computational studies. Our conformer search used a composite method based on an economical combination of single- and multi-reference theories. Several conformers were located on the quintet, triplet, and singlet surfaces, spanning in energy of only a few thousand wavenumbers. Most of the singlet and triplet conformers have pronounced multiconfigurational character. Previously unidentified covalent-like structures (H—O—O—O—O) on the singlet and triplet surfaces likely represent the global minima. In our experiments, HO 4 + is formed in a relatively hot environment, and similar experiments have been shown capable of producing multiple conformers in low-lying electronic states. None of the predicted HO 4 + isomers can be ruled out a priori based on energetic arguments. We interpret our argon-tagged spectra with Second-Order Vibrational Perturbation Theory with Resonances (VPT2+K). The presence of one or more covalent-like isomers is the only reasonable explanation for the spectral features observed.},

At different resonance positions, different hyperfine components of the superposition state dominate over the FOPA process, and the quantum interference displays different behaviors.

  abstract = {Electron-molecule resonances of anthracene were probed by 2D photoelectron imaging of the corresponding radical anion up to 3.7 eV in the continuum. A number of resonances were observed in both the photoelectron spectra and angular distributions, and most resonances showed clear autodetachment dynamics. The resonances were assigned using density functional theory calculations and are consistent with the available literature. Competition between direct and autodetachment, as well as signatures of internal conversion between resonances, was observed for some resonances. For the 1 2 B 2g resonance, a small fraction of population recovers the ground electronic state as evidenced by thermionic emission. Recovery of the ground electronic state offers a route of producing anions in an electron–molecule reaction; however, the energy at which this occurs suggests that anthracene anions cannot be formed in the interstellar medium by electron capture through this resonance.},

Our calculations reveal ultrafast decay to the ground state, facilitated by conical intersections involving distortions around the double bonds. The main distortions are localized on one double bond, involving twisting and pyramidalization of one of the carbons of that double bond (similar to ethylene), while a limited number of trajectories decay via delocalized (non-local) twisting of both double bonds. The interplay between local and non-local distortions is important in our understanding of photoisomerization in conjugated systems. The calculations show that a broad range of the conical intersection seam space is accessed during the non-adiabatic events. Several products formed on the ground state have also been observed.},

  abstract = {Boron can form strong bonds with transition metals in diatomic metal borides (MB), but the nature of the chemical bonding has not been well understood. Recently, a quadruple bond was discovered in Rh ≣ B, consisting of two σ bonds formed between the Rh 4d z 2 and B 2s/2p orbitals and two π bonds between the Rh 4d xz /4d yz and the B 2p x /2p y orbitals. The bonding between the 5d transition metals and boron is expected to be even stronger. Here, we report an investigation on the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the 5d transition metal diatomic borides (IrB, PtB, and AuB) using high-resolution photoelectron imaging on the corresponding anions (MB − ) and theoretical calculations. Vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra are obtained for all three anions, and the electron affinities are measured for IrB, PtB, and AuB to be 1.995(1), 2.153(3), and 0.877(6) eV, respectively. It is found that the weakly anti-bonding 3σ molecular orbital (mainly of M 6s and B sp characters) is singly occupied in IrB ( 3 Δ) and PtB ( 2 Σ + ), resulting in a bond order of three and half for these two diatomic borides. The 3σ orbital is doubly occupied in AuB ( 1 Σ + ), giving rise to a weak triple bond. Despite the lower bond order, the bonding in IrB and PtB is only slightly weaker than that in RhB due to the more favorable interactions between the M 5d orbitals and the B sp orbitals.},

HR spectra with a high signal to noise ratio were obtained without the surface enhancement or the electronic resonance effect. Due to the improvement of the sensitivity, many vibrational bands were first observed in HR spectroscopy. The peak frequencies, relative intensities, band assignments, including symmetry species, and depolarization ratios are examined. All IR active vibrational modes well separated were, indeed, observed in HR spectra following the selection rule, whereas HR spectra show not only similarity but also difference in relative signal intensities compared with IR spectra. This work demonstrates the possibility of HR spectra in the liquid phase and suggests further research on molecular structures by HR spectroscopy.},

The structure and dynamics of intracellular water constitute the cornerstone for understanding all aspects of cellular function. Fundamentally, direct visualization of subcellular solvation heterogeneity is essential but remains challenging with commonly used nuclear magnetic resonance methods due to poor spatial resolution. To explore this question, we demonstrate a vibrational-shift imaging approach by combining the spectral-focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering technique with an environmentally sensitive nitrile probe. The sensing ability of a near-infrared nitrile-containing molecule is validated in the solution phase, microscopic droplets, and cellular environments. Finally, we quantitatively measure the subcellular solvation variance between the cytoplasm (29.5\%, S.E. 1.8\%) and the nucleus (57.3\%, S.E. 1.0\%), which is in good agreement with previous studies. This work sheds light on heterogeneous solvation in live systems using coherent Raman microscopy and opens up new avenues to explore environmental variance in complex systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.},

Using its stochastic Schrödinger equation formulation, we are able to provide a more comprehensive picture of the electronic energies and the coupling between solute and solvent electronic dynamics. In particular, the OQS-PCM proves to be a unifying theoretical framework naturally including polarization and dispersion interactions, the effect of solvent fluctuations, and the non-Markovian solvent response. As such, the OQS-PCM describes the interplay between the solute and the solvent typical electronic dynamical times and yields both the standard PCM and the so-called Born–Oppenheimer solvation regime, where the solvent electronic response is considered faster than any electronic dynamics taking place in the solute. In analyzing the OQS-PCM, we obtained an expression for the solute–solvent dispersion (van der Waals) interactions, which is very transparent in terms of a physical interpretation based on fluctuations and response functions. Finally, we present various numerical tests that support the theoretical findings},

  abstract = {The Perdew–Zunger (PZ) method provides a way to remove the self-interaction (SI) error from density functional approximations on an orbital by orbital basis. The PZ method provides significant improvements for the properties such as barrier heights or dissociation energies but results in over-correcting the properties well described by SI-uncorrected semi-local functional. One cure to rectify the over-correcting tendency is to scale down the magnitude of SI-correction of each orbital in the many-electron region. We have implemented the orbitalwise scaled down SI-correction (OSIC) scheme of Vydrov et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 124 , 094108 (2006)] using the Fermi–Löwdin SI-correction method. After validating the OSIC implementation with previously reported OSIC-LSDA results, we examine its performance with the most successful non-empirical SCAN meta-GGA functional. Using different forms of scaling factors to identify one-electron regions, we assess the performance of OSIC-SCAN for a wide range of properties: total energies, ionization potentials and electron affinities for atoms, atomization energies, dissociation and reaction energies, and reaction barrier heights of molecules. Our results show that OSIC-SCAN provides superior results than the previously reported OSIC-LSDA, -PBE, and -TPSS results. Furthermore, we propose selective scaling of OSIC (SOSIC) to remove its major shortcoming that destroys the −1/ r asymptotic behavior of the potentials. The SOSIC method gives the highest occupied orbital eigenvalues practically identical to those in PZSIC and unlike OSIC provides bound atomic anions even with larger powers of scaling factors. SOSIC compared to PZSIC or OSIC provides a more balanced description of total energies and barrier heights.},

  abstract = {We present an overview of the onetep program for linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) calculations with large basis set (plane-wave) accuracy on parallel computers. The DFT energy is computed from the density matrix, which is constructed from spatially localized orbitals we call Non-orthogonal Generalized Wannier Functions (NGWFs), expressed in terms of periodic sinc (psinc) functions. During the calculation, both the density matrix and the NGWFs are optimized with localization constraints. By taking advantage of localization, onetep is able to perform calculations including thousands of atoms with computational effort, which scales linearly with the number or atoms. The code has a large and diverse range of capabilities, explored in this paper, including different boundary conditions, various exchange–correlation functionals (with and without exact exchange), finite electronic temperature methods for metallic systems, methods for strongly correlated systems, molecular dynamics, vibrational calculations, time-dependent DFT, electronic transport, core loss spectroscopy, implicit solvation, quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical and QM-in-QM embedding, density of states calculations, distributed multipole analysis, and methods for partitioning charges and interactions between fragments. Calculations with onetep provide unique insights into large and complex systems that require an accurate atomic-level description, ranging from biomolecular to chemical, to materials, and to physical problems, as we show with a small selection of illustrative examples. onetep has always aimed to be at the cutting edge of method and software developments, and it serves as a platform for developing new methods of electronic structure simulation. We therefore conclude by describing some of the challenges and directions for its future developments and applications.},

  abstract = {While the steady-state behavior of stochastic gene expression with auto-regulation has been extensively studied, its time-dependent behavior has received much less attention. Here, under the assumption of fast promoter switching, we derive and solve a reduced chemical master equation for an auto-regulatory gene circuit with translational bursting and cooperative protein-gene interactions. The analytical expression for the time-dependent probability distribution of protein numbers enables a fast exploration of large swaths of the parameter space. For a unimodal initial distribution, we identify three distinct types of stochastic dynamics: (i) the protein distribution remains unimodal at all times; (ii) the protein distribution becomes bimodal at intermediate times and then reverts back to being unimodal at long times (transient bimodality); and (iii) the protein distribution switches to being bimodal at long times. For each of these, the deterministic model predicts either monostable or bistable behavior, and hence, there exist six dynamical phases in total. We investigate the relationship of the six phases to the transcription rates, the protein binding and unbinding rates, the mean protein burst size, the degree of cooperativity, the relaxation time to the steady state, the protein mean, and the type of feedback loop (positive or negative). We show that transient bimodality is a noise-induced phenomenon that occurs when the protein expression is sufficiently bursty, and we use a theory to estimate the observation time window when it is manifested.},

Vertical transitions have been implemented for CIS(D ∞ ), the second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction [ADC(2)] scheme, and the second-order approximate coupled-cluster singles and doubles method. For all methods, density fitting is applied to facilitate reduced memory and disk storage requirements. Analytical nuclear gradients have been derived and implemented for CIS(D ∞ ) and ADC(2) both with and without frozen-density embedding (FDE). The objective of the reported method is to study the properties of organic semiconductors in which charge is transported along molecular stacks in molecular crystals. The accuracy of the implemented methods is, therefore, assessed using stacked dimers of small model systems. Albeit second-order methods can yield noticeable errors with respect to reference methods in terms of absolute IP and EA values, they show a significantly improved accuracy for the shift of the IP and EA values at different intermolecular distances relative to the monomers. Besides reducing the computational costs, the FDE ansatz introduces furthermore a significant conceptual difference as it enables control over which subsystem is ionized, allowing for the calculation of transfer integrals for the interacting (embedded) systems. The new implementation is finally applied to tetraazaperopyrenes, used as organic semiconductors, to study charge-localization and long-range polarization in particular.},

Mori theory predicts this correlation under the Markovian approximation from the knowledge of the non-local shear viscosity matrix, which is given in terms of a Green–Kubo formula. However, the running Green–Kubo integral for the non-local shear viscosity does not have a plateau. By using a recently proposed correction for the Green–Kubo formula that eliminates the plateau problem [Español et al., Phys. Rev. E 99 , 022126 (2019)], we unambiguously obtain the actual non-local shear viscosity. The resulting Markovian equation, being local in time, is not valid for very short times. We observe that the Markovian equation with non-local viscosity gives excellent predictions for the correlation matrix from a time at which the correlation is around 80\% of its initial value. A local in space approximation for the viscosity gives accurate results only after the correlation has decayed to 40\% of its initial value.},

Currently available quantum-chemical methods are capable of solving systems with one or two of these issues. However, there is a significant class of molecules in which all the three effects are present. These are the heavier transition metal compounds, lanthanides, and actinides with open d or f shells. For such systems, sufficiently accurate numerical methods are not available, which hinders the application of theoretical chemistry in this field. In this paper, we combine two numerical methods in order to address this challenging class of molecules. These are the relativistic versions of coupled cluster methods and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first relativistic implementation of the coupled cluster method externally corrected by DMRG. The method brings a significant reduction of computational costs as we demonstrate on the system of TlH, AsH, and SbH.},

  abstract = {Kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations are frequently used to study (electro-)chemical processes within science and engineering. kMC methods provide insight into the interplay of stochastic processes and can link atomistic material properties with macroscopic characteristics. Significant problems concerning the computational demand arise if processes with large time disparities are competing. Acceleration algorithms are required to make slow processes accessible. Especially, the accelerated superbasin kMC (AS-kMC) scheme has been frequently applied within chemical reaction networks. For larger systems, the computational overhead of the AS-kMC is significant as the computation of the superbasins is done during runtime and comes with the need for large databases. Here, we propose a novel acceleration scheme for diffusion and transport processes within kMC simulations. Critical superbasins are detected during the system initialization. Scaling factors for the critical rates within the superbasins, as well as a lower bound for the number of sightings, are derived. Our algorithm exceeds the AS-kMC in the required simulation time, which we demonstrate with a 1D-chain example. In addition, we apply the acceleration scheme to study the time-of-flight (TOF) of charge carriers within organic semiconductors. In this material class, time disparities arise due to a significant spread of transition rates. The acceleration scheme allows a significant acceleration up to a factor of 65 while keeping the error of the TOF values negligible. The computational overhead is negligible, as all superbasins only need to be computed once.},

  abstract = {We review recent advances in the capabilities of the open source ab initio Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) package QMCPACK and the workflow tool Nexus used for greater efficiency and reproducibility. The auxiliary field QMC (AFQMC) implementation has been greatly expanded to include k-point symmetries, tensor-hypercontraction, and accelerated graphical processing unit (GPU) support. These scaling and memory reductions greatly increase the number of orbitals that can practically be included in AFQMC calculations, increasing the accuracy. Advances in real space methods include techniques for accurate computation of bandgaps and for systematically improving the nodal surface of ground state wavefunctions. Results of these calculations can be used to validate application of more approximate electronic structure methods, including GW and density functional based techniques. To provide an improved foundation for these calculations, we utilize a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (pseudopotentials) that are more accurate than previous sets; these can also be applied in quantum-chemical and other many-body applications, not only QMC. These advances increase the efficiency, accuracy, and range of properties that can be studied in both molecules and materials with QMC and QMCPACK.},

Phys. 149 , 194301 (2018)]. This basis-set correction relies on a mapping between wave-function calculations in a finite basis set and range-separated DFT (RSDFT) through the definition of an effective non-divergent interaction corresponding to the electron–electron Coulomb interaction projected in the finite basis set. This enables the use of RSDFT-type complementary density functionals to recover the dominant part of the short-range correlation effects missing in this finite basis set. To study both weak and strong correlation regimes, we consider the potential energy curves of the H 10 , N 2 , O 2 , and F 2 molecules up to the dissociation limit, and we explore various approximations of complementary functionals fulfilling two key properties: spin-multiplet degeneracy (i.e., independence of the energy with respect to the spin projection S z ) and size consistency. Specifically, we investigate the dependence of the functional on different types of on-top pair densities and spin polarizations. The key result of this study is that the explicit dependence on the on-top pair density allows one to completely remove the dependence on any form of spin polarization without any significant loss of accuracy. Quantitatively, we show that the basis-set correction reaches chemical accuracy on atomization energies with triple- ζ quality basis sets for most of the systems studied here. In addition, the present basis-set incompleteness correction provides smooth potential energy curves along the whole range of internuclear distances.},

We illustrate the application range of our implementation by computing static-field ionization rates of several polyacenes up to pentacene (C 22 H 18 ) at the RI-MP2 level of theory.

  abstract = {A new kinetic-theory-based calculation of the self-diffusion coefficient for dense supercritical Lennard-Jones fluids is presented. The mean force kinetic theory , which was recently developed for transport in dense plasmas, is applied for the calculation of diffusion in dense neutral fluids. The calculation only requires the pair distribution function, a quantity that is readily calculable from equilibrium statistical mechanics for many systems, including the Lennard-Jones fluid. The self-diffusion coefficients are compared with calculations from molecular dynamics simulations, and good agreement at high density is demonstrated, even in the vicinity of the solid–fluid coexistence line. A comparison of different kinetic models with molecular dynamics simulations demonstrates that the transport coefficients have important contributions due to particle interaction via a potential of mean force and local correlations, which increase the collision rate. The new calculations compare well to those from free-volume theory and overcome a limitation of this theory that prevents its use in systems that interact via long range monotonic potentials. It is expected that this approach will also apply to other systems, including neutral-plasma and neutral-electrolyte mixtures.},

  abstract = {We present a method for performing path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations for fermions and address its sign problem. PIMD simulations are widely used for studying many-body quantum systems at thermal equilibrium. However, they assume that the particles are distinguishable and neglect bosonic and fermionic exchange effects. Interacting fermions play a key role in many chemical and physical systems, such as electrons in quantum dots and ultracold trapped atoms. A direct sampling of the fermionic partition function is impossible using PIMD since its integrand is not positive definite. We show that PIMD simulations for fermions are feasible by employing our recently developed method for bosonic PIMD and reweighting the results to obtain fermionic expectation values. The approach is tested against path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations for up to seven electrons in a two-dimensional quantum dot for a range of interaction strengths. However, like PIMC, the method suffers from the sign problem at low temperatures. We propose a simple approach for alleviating it by simulating an auxiliary system with a larger average sign and obtaining an upper bound to the energy of the original system using the Bogoliubov inequality. This allows fermions to be studied at temperatures lower than would otherwise have been feasible using PIMD, as demonstrated in the case of a three-electron quantum dot. Our results extend the boundaries of PIMD simulations of fermions and will hopefully stimulate the development of new approaches for tackling the sign problem.},

  abstract = {Crystalline solids assembled from superatomic building blocks are attractive functional materials due to their hierarchical structure, multifunctionality, and tunability. An interesting example is Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 , in which the Re 6 Se 8 building blocks are covalently linked into two-dimensional (2D) sheets that are stacked into a layered van der Waals solid. It is an indirect gap semiconductor that, when heavily doped, becomes a superconductor at low temperatures. Given the finite electronic bandwidths (300–400 meV), carrier properties in this material are expected to be strongly influenced by coupling to phonons. Here, we apply angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe the valence band edge (VBE) of Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 . We find that dispersion of the VBE is a strong function of temperature. The bandwidth is W = 120 ± 30 meV at 70 K and decreases by one order of magnitude to W ∼ 10 ± 20 meV as temperature is increased to 300 K. This observation reveals the dominant polaronic effects in Re 6 Se 8 Cl 2 , consistent with the Holstein polaron model commonly used to describe molecular solids.},

GL and MG are two organic compounds present in the atmosphere as oxidation products of both biogenic and anthropogenic precursors. By adsorption and hydration on liquid droplets or wetted dust particles, they can enable aerosol growth in the atmosphere. Moreover, thanks to the different polar characters of their trans and cis conformers, GL and MG have been suggested as possible molecular switches capable of responding to changes in solvent polarity. Here, we show that the hydroxylated silica surface does not significantly catalyze the trans-to-cis isomerization, but it stabilizes the cis -isomers, indicating a higher interfacial cis / trans relative concentration compared to the gas phase. Moreover, adsorbed GL prefers to lie parallel on the silica surface, while adsorbed MG shows a tilted orientation. In particular, we report the aldehyde group pointing upward (downward) to the gas phase (to the silica surface) in trans -MG ( cis -MG). These results will help in the rationalization of upcoming experimental and modeling work on the adsorption of ketonic compounds on dust aerosols, while it clarifies the catalytic role of the solid substrate surface in promoting conformational changes.},

Desalination across such 2D nanoporous membranes is largely influenced by the bulk transport properties of water, which are, in turn, sensitive to the operating temperature. However, there have been no studies on the effect of temperature on desalination through 2D nanopores. We investigated water desalination through hydrogen functionalized graphene nanopores of varying pore areas at temperatures 275.0 K, 300.0 K, 325.0 K, and 350.0 K. The water flux showed a direct relation with the diffusion coefficient and an inverse relation with the hydrogen-bond lifetime. As a direct consequence, the water flux was found to be related to the temperature as per the Arrhenius equation, similar to an activated process. The results from the present study improve the understanding on water and ion permeation across nanoporous 2D materials at different temperatures. Furthermore, the present investigation suggests a kinetic model, which can predict the water and ion permeation based on the characteristics of the nanopore.},

  abstract = {Aqueous binary mixtures often exhibit dramatic departure from the predicted hydrodynamic behavior when transport properties are plotted against composition. We show by inherent structure (IS) analysis that this sharp composition dependent breakdown of the Stokes–Einstein relation can be attributed to the non-monotonic variation in the average inherent structure energy of these mixtures. Further IS analysis reveals the existence of a unique ground state, stabilized by both the formation of an optimum number of H-bonds and a favorable hydrophobic interaction at this composition. The surprisingly sharp turnaround behavior observed in the effective hydrodynamic radius also owes its origin to the same combination of these two factors. Interestingly, the temperature dependence of isothermal compressibility shows a minimum at the particular composition. Extensive studies on water–dimethyl sulfoxide and water–ethanol mixtures using two different force-fields of water reveal many features that are nearly universal. A justification of this quasi-universal behavior is provided in terms of a mode-coupling theory (MCT) of viscosity, which can serve as the starting point of a remarkable correlation observed with the nearest neighbor structure, as captured by the first peaks of the radial distribution function, and the slowdown in the intermediate scattering function at intermediate wavenumbers.

For soft sphere interactions, we obtain the numerical solution by an iterative algorithm and a straightforward discretization of time. We also discuss the case of hard spheres for which we first derive analytically the dynamical mean field theory as a non-trivial limit of that of soft spheres. We present numerical results for the memory function and the mean square displacement. Our results reproduce and extend kinetic theory in the dilute or short-time limit, while they also describe dynamical arrest toward the glass phase in the dense strongly interacting regime.},

Predictions using eight non-polarizable ion force fields combined with the TIP4P/ ε water model are compared to experimental data. The influence of the water model and the temperature on the results for the NaCl brine are also addressed. The TIP4P/ ε water model improves the accuracy of dielectric constant predictions compared to the SPC/E water model. The solution density is predicted well by most ion models. Almost all ion force fields qualitatively capture the decline of the dielectric constant with the increase of concentration for all solutions and with the increase of temperature for NaCl brine. However, the sampled dielectric constant is mostly in poor quantitative agreement with experimental data. These results are related to the microscopic solution structure, ion pairing, and ultimately the force field parameters. Ion force fields with excessive contact ion pairing and precipitation below the experimental solubility limit generally yield higher dielectric constant values. An adequate reproduction of the experimental solubility limit should therefore be a prerequisite for further investigations of the dielectric constant of aqueous electrolyte solutions by molecular simulation.},

  abstract = {A major impediment limiting the widespread application of ionic liquids (ILs) is their high shear viscosity. Incorporation of a tricyanomethanide (TCM − ) anion in ILs leads to low shear viscosity and improvement of several characteristics suitable for large scale applications. However, properties including interactions of TCM − with the local environment and dynamics of TCM − have not been thoroughly investigated. Herein, we have studied the ultrafast dynamics of TCM − in several imidazolium ILs using linear IR and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy techniques. The spectral diffusion dynamics of the CN stretching modes of TCM − in all ILs exhibit a nonexponential behavior with a short time component of ∼2 ps and a long time component spanning ∼9 ps to 14 ps. The TCM − vibrational probe reports a significantly faster relaxation of ILs compared to those observed previously using linear vibrational probes, such as thiocyanate and selenocyanate. Our results indicate a rapid relaxation of the local ion-cage structure embedding the vibrational probe in the ILs. The faster relaxation suggests that the lifetime of the local ion-cage structure decreases in the presence of TCM − in the ILs. Linear IR spectroscopic results show that the hydrogen-bonding interaction between TCM − and imidazolium cations in ILs is much weaker. Shorter ion-cage lifetimes together with weaker hydrogen-bonding interactions account for the low shear viscosity of TCM − based ILs compared to commonly used ILs. In addition, this study demonstrates that TCM − can be used as a potential vibrational reporter to study the structure and dynamics of ILs and other molecular systems.},

  abstract = {The site-specific first microsolvation step of furan and some of its derivatives with methanol is explored to benchmark the ability of quantum-chemical methods to describe the structure, energetics, and vibrational spectrum at low temperature. Infrared and microwave spectra in supersonic jet expansions are used to quantify the docking preference and some relevant quantum states of the model complexes. Microwave spectroscopy strictly rules out in-plane docking of methanol as opposed to the top coordination of the aromatic ring. Contrasting comparison strategies, which emphasize either the experimental or the theoretical input, are explored. Within the harmonic approximation, only a few composite computational approaches are able to achieve a satisfactory performance. Deuteration experiments suggest that the harmonic treatment itself is largely justified for the zero-point energy, likely and by design due to the systematic cancellation of important anharmonic contributions between the docking variants. Therefore, discrepancies between experiment and theory for the isomer abundance are tentatively assigned to electronic structure deficiencies, but uncertainties remain on the nuclear dynamics side. Attempts to include anharmonic contributions indicate that for systems of this size, a uniform treatment of anharmonicity with systematically improved performance is not yet in sight.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the possibility to experimentally manipulate and enhance chemical reactivity in helium nanodroplets, we investigate the effective interaction and the resulting correlations between two diatomic molecules immersed in a bath of bosons. By analogy with the bipolaron, we introduce the biangulon quasiparticle describing two rotating molecules that align with respect to each other due to the effective attractive interaction mediated by the excitations of the bath. We study this system in different parameter regimes and apply several theoretical approaches to describe its properties. Using a Born–Oppenheimer approximation, we investigate the dependence of the effective intermolecular interaction on the rotational state of the two molecules. In the strong-coupling regime, a product-state ansatz shows that the molecules tend to have a strong alignment in the ground state. To investigate the system in the weak-coupling regime, we apply a one-phonon excitation variational ansatz, which allows us to access the energy spectrum. In comparison to the angulon quasiparticle, the biangulon shows shifted angulon instabilities and an additional spectral instability, where resonant angular momentum transfer between the molecules and the bath takes place. These features are proposed as an experimentally observable signature for the formation of the biangulon quasiparticle. Finally, by using products of single angulon and bare impurity wave functions as basis states, we introduce a diagonalization scheme that allows us to describe the transition from two separated angulons to a biangulon as a function of the distance between the two molecules.},

Such a forward–backward asymmetry does not appear in single-photon ionization and requires non-dipole contributions. It is also shown that the {4 2 Σ + + 5 2 Σ + + 6 2 Σ + } ionization preferentially takes place in the vicinity of the molecular orientation parallel to K at small momentum transfer, while non-dipole contributions cause the decrease in the relative intensity of the parallel direction.},

We demonstrate how the use of a CW laser source allows for gains in spectral resolution, signal intensity, and data acquisition rate compared to traditional pulsed-based cavity ring-down polarimetry (CRDP). We discuss a particular CW-CRDP modality that is different from intensity-based cavity-enhanced polarimetric schemes as it relies on the determination of the polarization rotation frequency during a ring-down event generated by large intracavity polarization anisotropies. We present the principles of CW-CRDP and validate the applicability of this technique for the measurement of the non-resonant Faraday effect in solid SiO 2 and CeF 3 and gaseous butane. We give a general analysis of the fundamental sensitivity limits for CRDP techniques and show how the presented frequency-based methodology alleviates the requirement for high finesse cavities to achieve high polarimetric sensitivities and, thus, allows for the extension of cavity-based polarimetric schemes into different spectral regimes, but most importantly renders the CW-CRDP methodology particularly suitable for robust portable polarimetric instrumentations.},

  abstract = {Although very useful, the original multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method has two weaknesses: (1) its cost scales exponentially with the number of atoms in the system; (2) the standard MCTDH implementation requires that the potential energy surface (PES) be in the sum-of-product (SOP) form in order to reduce the cost of computing integrals in the MCTDH basis. One way to deal with (1) is to lump coordinates into groups. This is mode combination (MC). One way to deal with (2) is to reformulate MCTDH using collocation so that there are no integrals. In this paper, we combine MC and collocation to formulate a MC collocation multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MC-C-MCTDH) method. In practice, its cost does not scale exponentially with the number of atoms, and it can be used with any general PES; the PES need not be an SOP and need not have a special form. No integrals and, hence, no quadratures are necessary. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the new method by computing vibrational energy eigenstates of methyl radical, methane, and acetonitrile. To do this, we use MC-C-MCTDH with a variant of improved relaxation, derived by evaluating a residual at points. Because the MC basis functions are multivariate, collocation points in multi-dimensional spaces are required. We use two types of collocation points: (1) discrete variable representation-like points obtained from (approximate) simultaneous diagonalization of matrices and (2) Leja points, which are known to be good interpolation points, determined from a generalized recipe suitable for any basis.},

In both phases of single-layer CaX 2 structures, significant phonon softening occurs as the atomic radius increases. In addition, each structural phase exhibits distinctive Raman active modes that enable one to characterize either the phase or the structure via Raman spectroscopy. The electronic band dispersions of single-layer CaX 2 structures reveal that all structures are indirect bandgap insulators with a decrease in bandgaps from fluorite to iodide crystals. Furthermore, the calculated linear elastic constants, in-plane stiffness, and Poisson ratio indicate the ultra-soft nature of CaX 2 single-layers, which is quite important for their nanoelastic applications.

However, its current formulation for multicomponent systems has not been fully linearized and requires nonlinear optimization techniques for parameter estimation. We propose an alternative relaxed formulation of the original potential energy function where parameter optimization is expressed as a linear sparse approximation problem. The main difficulty arising in sparse approximation is finding a suitable subset of predictors in highly multi-collinear variable space where the number of variables largely exceeds the size of the training set. To efficiently reduce the number of descriptors to an optimal size and prevent overfitting, we present a simple heuristic that is based on importance ranking of variables and Bayesian information criterion. For the empirical assessment of our approach, we employed published data on short-range components of water two-body and three-body interaction energies that have previously been used for the comparison of various potential energy representations. Numerical experiments suggest that our proposed methodology allows achieving accuracy that is comparable to other popular interpolation and machine learning techniques and requires significantly less time for model training than nonlinearly parameterized formulation.},

We demonstrate the applicability of our method by inverting both local and non-local (Hartree–Fock and coupled cluster) densities; we also show how the method can be used to mitigate the effects of self-interactions in common DFT potentials with appropriate constraints on the screening density.},

We report that the spin current and the effective DM interaction are enhanced in the Kondo regime. We demonstrate that this enhancement occurs because the Kondo resonance, which is supposed to be suppressed by the local ferromagnetic exchange, is enhanced by the inter-dot coupling. This additional Kondo resonance channel increases the spin current. In addition, the impact of the spin–spin interaction and the Kondo effect on tunnel magnetoresistance is discussed. Our results offer a new approach for controlling the non-collinear spin interaction in double quantum dot devices.},

Due to this drastic reduction in the complexity, we demonstrate how to increase the length and time scales in order to enable the simulation of inhomogeneities of CsH 2 PO 4 systems at the nanometer scale. We incorporate explicit correlation of protonation dynamics with the protonation state of the neighboring proton sites and illustrate that this modification conserves the Markov character of the MDM method. We show that atomistic features such as the mean square displacement and the diffusion coefficient of the protons can be computed quantitatively from the matrix representation.

  abstract = {The comparison of benchmark error sets is an essential tool for the evaluation of theories in computational chemistry. The standard ranking of methods by their mean unsigned error is unsatisfactory for several reasons linked to the non-normality of the error distributions and the presence of underlying trends. Complementary statistics have recently been proposed to palliate such deficiencies, such as quantiles of the absolute error distribution or the mean prediction uncertainty. We introduce here a new score, the systematic improvement probability, based on the direct system-wise comparison of absolute errors. Independent of the chosen scoring rule, the uncertainty of the statistics due to the incompleteness of the benchmark datasets is also generally overlooked. However, this uncertainty is essential to appreciate the robustness of rankings. In the present article, we develop two indicators based on robust statistics to address this problem: P inv , the inversion probability between two values of a statistic, and P r , the ranking probability matrix.

Maeda et al. , Nature 453 , 387 (2008)]. Previous simulations of this radical pair have employed semiclassical approximations, which are routinely applicable to its 47 coupled electronic and nuclear spins. However, calculating the exact quantum mechanical spin dynamics presents a significant challenge and has not been possible until now. Here, we use a recently developed method to perform numerically converged simulations of the C •+ PF •− quantum mechanical spin dynamics, including all coupled spins. A comparison of these quantum mechanical simulations with various semiclassical approximations reveals that, while it is not perfect, the best semiclassical approximation does capture essentially all of the relevant physics in this problem.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool to investigate the thermodynamic properties of atomic systems. In practice, however, sampling of the complete configuration space is often hindered by high energy barriers between different regions of configuration space, which can make ergodic sampling completely infeasible within accessible simulation times. Although several extensions to the conventional Monte Carlo scheme have been developed, which enable the treatment of such systems, these extensions often entail substantial computational cost or rely on the harmonic approximation. In this work, we propose an exact method called Funnel Hopping Monte Carlo (FHMC) that is inspired by the ideas of smart darting but is more efficient. Gaussian mixtures are used to approximate the Boltzmann distribution around local energy minima, which are then used to propose high quality Monte Carlo moves that enable the Monte Carlo simulation to directly jump between different funnels. We demonstrate the method’s performance on the example of the 38 as well as the 75 atom Lennard-Jones clusters, which are well known for their double funnel energy landscapes that prevent ergodic sampling with conventional Monte Carlo simulations. By integrating FHMC into the parallel tempering scheme, we were able to reduce the number of steps required significantly until convergence of the simulation.},

The mixtures considered were octane + dodecane, decane + carbon dioxide, and 1,3-dimethylbenzene ( m -xylene) + carbon dioxide. The reduced viscosity was calculated according to the definition of Bell, while the residual entropy was calculated from accurate multi-parameter Helmholtz-energy equations of state and, for mixtures, the multi-fluid Helmholtz energy approximation. The mono-variant dependence of reduced viscosity upon residual molar entropy was observed for the pure fluids investigated, and by incorporating two scaling factors (one for reduced viscosity and the other for residual molar entropy), the data were represented by a single universal curve. To apply this method to mixtures, the scaling factors were determined from a mole-fraction weighted sum of the pure-component values. This simple model was found to work well for the systems investigated. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD) was observed to be between 1\% and 2\% for pure components and a mixture of similar hydrocarbons. Larger deviations, with AARDs of up to 15\%, were observed for the asymmetric mixtures, but this compares favorably with other methods for predicting the viscosity of such systems. We conclude that the residual-entropy concept can be used to estimate the viscosity of mixtures of similar molecules with high reliability and that it offers a useful engineering approximation even for asymmetric mixtures.},

  abstract = {Surface enhanced spectroscopy, which enhances the signal intensity of molecules on a surface, facilitates the study of molecular properties, even down to a single-molecule level if a scanning probe is used. To realize the full potential of surface enhanced spectroscopy, a clear theoretical understanding is indispensable. However, quantum chemical calculations for surface enhanced spectroscopy are not simple because of the violation of the widely used dipole approximation. The spatial structure of electric near-field in the close proximity of a surface strongly depends on the geometry of the metal nanostructure as well as on the incident wavelength. Therefore, in principle, a universal model for electric near-field cannot exist. To address this issue, we have developed a generalized light–matter interaction model from first-principles quantum chemical calculations by using the multipolar Hamiltonian, in which the spatial structure of the electric field is fully considered. Here, we incorporate computational electrodynamics for surface enhanced infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy in the model, where electric near-field around a Ag ellipsoid is obtained and used for IR calculations. Furthermore, we have devised a method to successfully reproduce the peak selectivity observed experimentally.},

  abstract = {The application of predictive and reliable modeling techniques for the simulation of charge transport in functional materials is an essential step for the development of advanced platforms for electronics, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics. In this context, kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods have emerged as a valuable tool, especially for the simulation of systems where charge transport can be described by the hopping of charge carriers across localized quantum states, as, for example, in organic semiconductor materials. The accuracy, computational efficiency, and reliability of KMC simulations of charge transport, however, crucially depend on the methods and approximations used to evaluate electrostatic interactions arising from the distribution of charges in the system. The long-range nature of Coulomb interactions and the need to simulate large model systems to capture the details of charge transport phenomena in complex devices lead, typically, to a computational bottleneck, which hampers the application of KMC methods. Here, we propose and assess computational schemes for the evaluation of electrostatic interactions in KMC simulations of charge transport based on the locality of the charge redistribution in the hopping regime. The methods outlined in this work provide an overall accuracy that outperforms typical approaches for the evaluation of electrostatic interactions in KMC simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. In addition, the computational schemes proposed allow a spatial decomposition of the evaluation of Coulomb interactions, leading to an essentially linear scaling of the computational load with the size of the system.},

  abstract = {In this work, we develop a method for simulating polar species in the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. The main idea behind the method is to treat each bead as a dumb-bell, i.e., two sub-beads kept at a fixed distance, instead of a point-like particle. The relation between the bead dipole moment and the bulk dielectric permittivity was obtained. The interaction force of single charges in polar liquid showed that the effective dielectric permittivity is somewhat smaller than that obtained for the bulk case at large separation between the charges. In order to understand the reasons behind the observed drop in the dielectric permittivity, we calculate the electric field of an isolated charge in a polar liquid; no permittivity drop is observed for this case. We can assume that the behavior observed for the force is due to the fact that the probing point is always associated with the charged bead, which is a force center, which essentially leads to a non-homogeneous density distribution around it on average; this is not the case when the field is measured. The interaction of a single charge with an interface between two liquids with different permittivities was studied after that; the model is found to correctly reproduce the “mirror image” effects. Finally, we show why it is necessary to treat the polar species in DPD explicitly by investigating the behavior of a charged colloidal particle at a liquid–liquid interface.},

Despite sharing similar optical properties in the spectral domain, these two QD systems have differing amounts of indium incorporation in the shell as determined by high-resolution energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy scanning transmission electron microscopy. Ultrafast fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy was used to probe the charge carrier dynamics of these two systems and shows substantial charge carrier trapping in both systems that prevents radiative recombination and reduces the photoluminescence quantum yield. The alloy and core/shell QDs show slight differences in the extent of charge carrier localization with more extensive trapping observed in the alloy nanocrystals. Despite the ability to grow a thick shell, structural defects caused by III–V/II–VI charge carrier imbalances still need to be mitigated to further improve InP QDs.},

  abstract = {Efficient Boltzmann-sampling using first-principles methods is challenging for extended systems due to the steep scaling of electronic structure methods with the system size. Stochastic approaches provide a gentler system-size dependency at the cost of introducing “noisy” forces, which could limit the efficiency of the sampling. When the forces are deterministic, the first-order Langevin dynamics (FOLD) offers efficient sampling by combining a well-chosen preconditioning matrix S with a time-step-bias-mitigating propagator [G. Mazzola and S. Sorella, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118 , 015703 (2017)]. However, when forces are noisy, S is set equal to the force-covariance matrix, a procedure that severely limits the efficiency and the stability of the sampling. Here, we develop a new, general, optimal, and stable sampling approach for FOLD under noisy forces. We apply it for silicon nanocrystals treated with stochastic density functional theory and show efficiency improvements by an order-of-magnitude.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs), unlike folded proteins, lack a unique folded structure and rapidly interconvert among ensembles of disordered states. However, they have specific conformational properties when averaged over their ensembles of disordered states. It is critical to develop a theoretical formalism to predict these ensemble average conformational properties that are encoded in the IDP sequence (the specific order in which amino acids/residues are linked). We present a general heteropolymer theory that analytically computes the ensemble average distance profiles ( ⁠ ⟨ R i j 2 ⟩ ⁠ ) between any two ( i , j ) monomers (amino acids for IDPs) as a function of the sequence. Information rich distance profiles provide a detailed description of the IDP in contrast to typical metrics such as scaling exponents, radius of gyration, or end-to-end distance. This generalized formalism supersedes homopolymer-like models or models that are built only on the composition of amino acids but ignore sequence details. The prediction of these distance profiles for highly charged polyampholytes and naturally occurring IDPs unmasks salient features that are hidden in the sequence. Moreover, the model reveals strategies to modulate the entire distance map to achieve local or global swelling/compaction by subtle changes/modifications—such as phosphorylation, a biologically relevant process—in specific hotspots in the sequence. Sequence-specific distance profiles and their modulation have been benchmarked against all-atom simulations. Our new formalism also predicts residue-pair specific coil-globule transitions. The analytical nature of the theory will facilitate design of new sequences to achieve specific target distance profiles with broad applications in synthetic biology and polymer science.},

  abstract = {A series of experiments demonstrates that strong light–matter coupling between vibrational excitations in isotropic solutions of molecules and resonant infrared optical microcavity modes leads to modified thermally activated kinetics. However, Galego et al. [Phys. Rev. X 9 , 021057 (2019)] recently demonstrated that, within transition state theory, effects of strong light–matter coupling with reactive modes are mostly electrostatic and essentially independent of light–matter resonance or even of the formation of vibrational polaritons. To analyze this puzzling theoretical result in further detail, we revisit it under a new light, invoking a normal mode analysis of the transition state and reactant configurations for an ensemble of an arbitrary number of molecules in a cavity, obtaining simple analytical expressions that produce similar conclusions as Feist. While these effects become relevant in optical microcavities if the molecular dipoles are anisotropically aligned, or in cavities with extreme confinement of the photon modes, they become negligible for isotropic solutions in microcavities. It is concluded that further studies are necessary to track the origin of the experimentally observed kinetics.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that the interfaces between the metal and oxide of laterally patterned MIS electrodes may strongly enhance the catalytic activity of the electrode compared to bulk metal surfaces. The employed electrodes consist of well-defined, large-area arrays of gold structures of various mesoscopic sizes embedded in a silicon oxide support on silicon. We demonstrate that the activity of these electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) increases with an increase in gold/silicon oxide boundary length in both acidic and alkaline media, although the enhancement of the HER rate in alkaline electrolytes is considerably larger than in acidic electrolytes. Electrodes with the largest interfacial length of gold/silicon oxide exhibited a 10-times larger HER rate in alkaline electrolytes than those with the smallest interfacial length. The data suggest that at the metal/silicon oxide boundaries, alkaline HER is enhanced through a bifunctional mechanism, which we tentatively relate to the laterally structured electrode geometry and to positive charges present in silicon oxide: Both properties change locally the interfacial electric field at the gold/silicon oxide boundary, which, in turn, facilitates a faster transport of hydroxide ions away from the electrode/electrolyte interface in alkaline solution. This mechanism boosts the alkaline HER activity of p -type silicon based photoelectrodes close to their HER activity in acidic electrolytes.},

  abstract = {Water confined in mesoporous silica plays a central role in its many uses ranging from gas sorption to nanoconfined chemical reactions. Here, the influence of pore diameter (2.5–5.4 nm) on water hydrogen bond (H-bond) dynamics in MCM41 and SBA15 mesoporous silicas is investigated using femtosecond infrared vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations on selenocyanate (SeCN − ) anions dissolved in the pores. As shown recently, SeCN − spectral diffusion is a reliable probe of surrounding water H-bond structural motions. Additionally, the long CN stretch vibrational lifetime facilitates measurement of the full range of confined dynamics, which are much slower than in bulk water. The simulations shed light on quantitative details that are inaccessible from the spatially averaged observables. The dependence of SeCN − orientational relaxation and that of spectral diffusion on the distance from the silica interface are quantitatively described with an exponential decay and a smoothed step-function, respectively. The distance-dependence of both quantities is found to be independent of the diameter of the pores, and the spatial distribution of SeCN − is markedly non-uniform, reaching a maximum between the interface and the pore center. The results indicate that the commonly invoked two-state, or core–shell, model is a more appropriate description of spectral diffusion. Using these insights, we model the full time-dependence of the measured dynamics for all pore sizes and extract the “core” and “shell” dynamical correlation functions and SeCN − spatial probability distributions. The results are critically compared to those for water confined in reverse micelles.},

In this study, we explore the hydrogenation of acetylene over single Pt, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ir atoms supported on the Fe 3 O 4 (001) surface using density functional theory calculations. The thermodynamic profile of H diffusion is significantly modified by the type of single metal atoms used, suggesting that H spillover from the single atom dopant to the Fe 3 O 4 (001) surface is favored and will likely lead to high H coverages of the functioning catalyst. Correspondingly, as the surface H coverage increases, the important desorption step of ethylene becomes energetically competitive against the detrimental hydrogenation steps of ethylene to ethane. A kinetic model is employed to explore how the activity and selectivity of SACs toward ethylene production change as a function of mass of the catalyst loaded into a flow reactor. Overall, we show that the selectivity of SACs toward ethylene production can be tuned by considering the proper type of metal and controlling the redox state of the support.},

In this study, we developed a facile in situ precipitation method for preparing a non-peripheral octamethyl-substituted cobalt(II)phthalocyanine (N–CoMe 2 Pc)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite as an efficient photocatalyst. The physical and chemical properties of the nanocomposite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and ultraviolet-visible, ultraviolet photoelectron, Fourier-transform infrared, Raman, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The results showed that the N–CoMe 2 Pc nanoparticles were immobilized on rGO nanosheets via π–π stacking interactions. The photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite in the reduction of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI), 10 mg/l] under visible-light irradiation was investigated. The Cr(VI) removal ratio reached 99.5\% with a high photocatalytic rate of 0.0359 min −1 , which is ten times faster than that achieved with pristine N–CoMe 2 Pc. The high removal efficiency is attributed to the following: (1) the number of active sites provided by nanodot-like N–CoMe 2 Pc is larger than that provided by bulk Pc, which can increase the production of photogenerated carriers, and (2) enhanced charge carrier separation resulting from intimate contact between N–CoMe 2 Pc nanodots and GO nanosheets. The N–CoMe 2 Pc/rGO also showed excellent stability and reusability. The Cr(VI) removal efficiency was 93.2\% after eight photocatalytic test cycles.},

Instead, we show that a DP approach using a large database with ∼300k configurations can render results generally on par with DFT. The training set includes configurations of pristine and bulk elementary metals and intermetallic structures in the liquid and solid phases in addition to slab and amorphous configurations. The DP model was validated by comparing bulk properties such as lattice constants, elastic constants, bulk moduli, phonon spectra, and surface energies to DFT values for identical structures. Furthermore, we contrast the DP results with values obtained using well-established two embedded atom method potentials. Overall, our DP potential provides near DFT accuracy for the different Cu–Zr phases but with a fraction of its computational cost, thus enabling accurate computations of realistic atomistic models, especially for the amorphous phase.},

The OH stretching vibrations have extremely broad absorption at around 2350 (B band) and 3050 cm −1 (A band), which originate from the 0–1 and 0–2 transitions in the asymmetric double minimum potential, respectively. The anharmonic-coupling calculation makes clear that the A band couples not only to the libration but also to the OH bending band. The vibrational state (nano-second order) is observed as the response of the proton basically localized in either of the two equivalent sites. The intrabond transfer between those sites (pico-second order) yields the protonic fluctuation reflected in T 1 − 1 ⁠ . Together with the anomalous absorption [ ν p2 phonon, libration, tetrahedral deformation ( δ 440 ), and 610-cm −1 band], we have demonstrated that the intrabond transfer above 70 K is dominated by the thermal hopping that is collectively excited at 610 cm −1 and the phonon-assisted proton tunneling (PAPT) relevant to the tetrahedral deformation [PAPT(def)]. Below 70 K, T 1 − 1 is largely enhanced toward the antiferroelectric ordering and the distinct splitting emerges in the libration, which dynamically modulates the O(2)–O′(2) distance of the dimer. The PAPT(lib) associated with the libration is confirmed to be a driving force of the AF ordering.},

  abstract = {Relativistic effects of gold make its behavior different from other metals. Unlike silver and copper, gold does not require symmetrical structures as the stable entities. We present the evolution of gold from a cluster to a nanoparticle by considering a majority of stable structural possibilities. Here, an interatomic potential (artificial neural network), trained on quantum mechanical data comprising small to medium sized clusters, gives exceptional results for larger size clusters. We have explored the potential energy surface for “magic” number clusters 309, 561, and 923. This study reveals that these clusters are not completely symmetric, but they require a distorted symmetric core with amorphous layers of atoms over it. The amorphous geometries tend to be more stable in comparison to completely symmetric structures. The first ever gold cluster to hold an icosahedron-Au 13 was identified at Au 60 [S. Pande et al. , J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 10 , 1820 (2019)]. Through our study, we have found a plausible evolution of a symmetric core as the size of the nanoparticle increases. The stable cores were found at Au 160 , Au 327 , and Au 571 , which can be recognized as new magic numbers. Au 923 is found to have a stable symmetric core of 147 atoms covered with layers of atoms that are not completely amorphous. This shows the preference of symmetric structures as the size of the nanoparticle increases (&lt;3.3 nm).},

  abstract = {The conformational properties of ring compounds such as cycloalkanes determine to a large extent their stability and reactivity. Therefore, the investigation of conformational processes such as ring inversion and/or ring pseudorotation has attracted a lot of attention over the past decades. An in-depth conformational analysis of ring compounds requires mapping the relevant parts of the conformational energy surface at stationary and also at non-stationary points. However, the latter is not feasible by a description of the ring with Cartesian or internal coordinates. We provide in this work, a solution to this problem by introducing a new coordinate system based on the Cremer–Pople puckering and deformation coordinates. Furthermore, analytic first- and second-order derivatives of puckering and deformation coordinates, i.e., B-matrices and D-tensors, were developed simplifying geometry optimization and frequency calculations. The new coordinate system is applied to map the potential energy surfaces and reaction paths of cycloheptane (C 7 H 14 ), cyclooctane (C 8 H 16 ), and cyclo[18]carbon (C 18 ) at the quantum chemical level and to determine for the first time all stationary points of these ring compounds in a systematic way.},

Although NNs do not provide the predictive variance as the Gaussian process regression does, we can alternatively minimize the negative of the squared difference surface (NSDS) given by two different NN models to actively locate the point where the PES is least confident. A batch of points in the minima of this NSDS can be iteratively added into the training set to improve the PES. The configuration space is gradually and globally covered without the need to run classical trajectory (or equivalently molecular dynamics) simulations. Through refitting the available analytical PESs of H 3 and OH 3 reactive systems, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of this new strategy, which enables fast convergence of the reactive PESs with respect to the number of points in terms of quantum scattering probabilities.},

Related to the lack of derivative discontinuity in approximate exchange-correlation potentials, the information about the curvature has been successfully used to restore the physical meaning of Kohn–Sham orbital eigenvalues and to develop non-empirical tuning and correction schemes for density functional approximations. In this work, we propose the construction of a machine-learning framework targeting the average energy curvature between the neutral and the radical cation state of thousands of small organic molecules (QM7 database). The applicability of the model is demonstrated in the context of system-specific gamma-tuning of the LC- ω PBE functional and validated against the molecular first ionization potentials at equation-of-motion coupled-cluster references. In addition, we propose a local version of the non-linear regression model and demonstrate its transferability and predictive power by determining the optimal range-separation parameter for two large molecules relevant to the field of hole-transporting materials. Finally, we explore the underlying structure of the QM7 database with the t-SNE dimensionality-reduction algorithm and identify structural and compositional patterns that promote the deviation from the piecewise linearity condition.},

The influence of the radiation and protein environments and the full photocycle of the complexes, including the charge separation and RC recovery processes, are taken into account. Particular emphasis is placed on the steady state excitation energy transfer rate between the LH1 and the RC and the steady state dependence on the light intensity. The transfer rate is shown to scale linearly with light intensity near the value in the natural habitat and at higher light intensities is found to be bounded by the rate-determining step of the photocycle, the RC recovery rate. Transient (e.g., pulsed laser induced) dynamics, however, shows rates higher than the steady state value and continues to scale linearly with the intensity. The results show a correlation between the transfer rate and the manner in which the donor state is prepared. In addition, the transition from the transient to the steady state results can be understood as a cascade of ever slower rate-determining steps and quasi-stationary states inherent in multi-scale sequential processes. This type of transition of rates is relevant in most light-induced biological machinery.},

I propose that this remarkable changeability of polymer properties can be related to the immense variability of non-equilibrium conformational states, providing polymers with capacities for responding and adapting to changes in environmental conditions and to external stimuli. By decoding the relations between properties and meta-stable conformational states, we may be able to accomplish polymer products with selectable unique properties. In support of this claim, I first present a few typical examples focusing on changes induced by varying drying, freezing, or crystallization procedures, relevant in many industrial processing strategies for polymeric systems. In these examples, deviations from equilibrium conformations are controlled by a preparation parameter and the annealing/aging time and temperature. Subsequently, I briefly discuss the possibilities for a quantitative description of chain conformations deviating from equilibrium, which allow establishing a link between changes on a molecular level and their macroscopic behavior. A comprehensive and systematic investigation of out-of-equilibrium polymer properties will widen the scope of polymer science and enlarge the range of applications of polymers based on their responsiveness and adaptability derived from their memorizing capacities.},

  abstract = {An important question in the field of active matter is whether or not it is possible to predict the phase behavior of these systems. Here, we study the phase coexistence of binary mixtures of torque-free active Brownian particles for both systems with purely repulsive interactions and systems with attractions. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that phase coexistences can be predicted quantitatively for these systems by measuring the pressure and “reservoir densities.” Specifically, in agreement with the previous literature, we find that the coexisting phases are in mechanical equilibrium, i.e., the two phases have the same pressure. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the coexisting phases are in chemical equilibrium by bringing each phase into contact with particle reservoirs and show that for each species, these reservoirs are characterized by the same density for both phases. Using this requirement of mechanical and chemical equilibrium, we accurately construct the phase boundaries from properties that can be measured purely from the individual coexisting phases. This result highlights that torque-free active Brownian systems follow simple coexistence rules, thus shedding new light on their thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {Interfacial charge transfer from silicon to heterogeneous catalysts plays a key role in silicon-based photoelectrochemical systems. In general, prior to interfacial charge transfer, carriers that are generated by photons with energies above the bandgap dissipate the excess kinetic energy via hot-carrier cooling, and such energy loss limits the maximum power conversion efficiency. The excess energy of hot-carriers, however, could be utilized through hot-carrier transfer from silicon to the catalysts, but such hot-carrier extraction has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we exploit transient reflection spectroscopy to interrogate charge transfer at the interface between silicon and platinum. Quantitative modeling of the surface carrier kinetics indicates that the velocity of charge transfer from silicon to platinum exceeds 2.6 × 10 7 cm s −1 , corresponding to an average carrier temperature of extracted carriers of ∼600 K, two times higher than the lattice temperature. The charge transfer velocity can be controllably reduced by inserting silica spacing layers between silicon and platinum.},

  abstract = {We show, using density functional theory calculations, that the charge, magnetic moment, and morphology of deposited Au nanoclusters can be tuned widely by doping the oxide support with aliovalent cations and anions. As model systems, we have considered Au n ( n = 1, 2, or 20) deposited on doped MgO and MgO/Mo supports. The supports have been substitutionally doped with varying concentrations θ of F, Al, N, Na, or Li. At θ = 2.78\%, by varying the dopant species, we are able to tune the charge of the Au monomer between −0.84 e and +0.21 e , the Au dimer between −0.87 e and −0.16 e , and, most interestingly, Au 20 between −3.97 e and +0.49 e . These ranges can be further extended by varying θ . These changes in charge are correlated with changes in adsorption and/or cluster geometry and magnetic moment. We find that the work function Φ of the bare support is a good predictor and descriptor of both the geometry and charge of the deposited Au cluster; it can, therefore, be used to quickly estimate which dopant species and concentration can result in a desired cluster morphology and charge state. This is of interest as these parameters are known to significantly impact cluster reactivity, with positively or negatively charged clusters being preferred as catalysts for different chemical reactions. It is particularly noteworthy that the Na-doped and Li-doped supports succeed in making Au 20 positively charged, given the high electronegativity of Au.},

  abstract = {Determining the influence of the solvent on electrochemical reaction energetics is a central challenge in our understanding of electrochemical interfaces. To date, it is unclear how well existing methods predict solvation energies at solid/liquid interfaces, since they cannot be assessed experimentally. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations present a physically highly accurate, but also a very costly approach. In this work, we employ extensive AIMD simulations to benchmark solvation at charge-neutral metal/water interfaces against commonly applied continuum solvent models. We consider a variety of adsorbates including * CO, * CHO, * COH, * OCCHO, * OH, and * OOH on Cu, Au, and Pt facets solvated by water. The surfaces and adsorbates considered are relevant, among other reactions, to electrochemical CO 2 reduction and the oxygen redox reactions. We determine directional hydrogen bonds and steric water competition to be critical for a correct description of solvation at the metal/water interfaces. As a consequence, we find that the most frequently applied continuum solvation methods, which do not yet capture these properties, do not presently provide more accurate energetics over simulations in vacuum. We find most of the computed benchmark solvation energies to linearly scale with hydrogen bonding or competitive water adsorption, which strongly differ across surfaces. Thus, we determine solvation energies of adsorbates to be non-transferable between metal surfaces, in contrast to standard practice.},

  abstract = {For the prototypical two-dimensional hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites (2D HOIPs) (AE4T)PbX 4 (X = Cl, Br, and I), we demonstrate that the Frenkel–Holstein Hamiltonian (FHH) can be applied to describe the absorption spectrum arising from the organic component. We first model the spectra using only the four nearest neighbor couplings between translationally inequivalent molecules in the organic herringbone lattice as fitting parameters in the FHH. We next use linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) to calculate molecular transition densities, from which extended excitonic couplings are evaluated based on the atomic positions within the 2D HOIPs. We find that both approaches reproduce the experimentally observed spectra, including changes in their shape and peak positions. The spectral changes are correlated with a decrease in excitonic coupling from X = Cl to X = I. Importantly, the LR-TDDFT-based approach with extended excitonic couplings not only gives better agreement with the experimental absorption line shape than the approach using a restricted set of fitted parameters but also allows us to relate the changes in excitonic coupling to the underlying geometry. We accordingly find that the decrease in excitonic coupling from X = Cl to Br to I is due to an increase in molecular separation, which in turn can be related to the increasing Pb–X bond length from Cl to I. Our research opens up a potential pathway to predicting optoelectronic properties of new 2D HOIPs from ab initio calculations and to gain insight into structural relations from 2D HOIP absorption spectra.},

  abstract = {Size reduction of the barrier and liner stack for copper interconnects is a major bottleneck in further down-scaling of transistor devices. The role of the barrier is to prevent diffusion of Cu atoms into the surrounding dielectric, while the liner (also referred to as a seed layer) ensures that a smooth Cu film can be electroplated. Therefore, a combined barrier + liner material that restricts the diffusion of Cu into the dielectric and allows for copper electro-deposition is needed. In this paper, we have explored barrier + liner materials composed of 1 and 2 monolayers (MLs) of Ru-passivated ϵ -TaN and Ru doped ϵ -TaN and focused on their interactions with Cu through the adsorption of small Cu clusters with 1–4 atoms. Moreover, different doping patterns for Ru doping in TaN are investigated to understand how selective doping of the ϵ -TaN surface influences surface stability. We found that an increased concentration of Ru atoms in the outermost Ta layer improves the adhesion of Cu. The strongest binding of the Cu atoms was found on the 100\% Ru doped surface followed by the 1 ML Ru passivated surface. These two surfaces are recommended for the combined barrier + liner for Cu interconnects. The closely packed arrangements of Cu were found to exhibit weak Cu–slab and strong Cu–Cu interactions, whereas the sparse arrangements of Cu exhibit strong Cu–slab and weak Cu–Cu interactions. The Cu atoms seem to bind more favorably when they are buried in the doped or passivated surface layer due to the increase in their coordination number. This is facilitated by the surface distortion arising from the ionic radius mismatch between Ta and Ru. We also show that the strong Cu–Cu interaction alone cannot predict the association of Cu atoms as a few 2D Cu clusters showed stronger Cu–Cu interaction than the 3D clusters, highlighting the importance of Cu–surface interactions.},

  abstract = {Photoelectron spectroscopy of a liquid microjet requires careful energy calibration against electrokinetic charging of the microjet. For minimizing the error from this calibration procedure, Kurahashi et al. previously suggested optimization of an electrolyte concentration in aqueous solutions [Kurahashi et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 140 , 174506 (2014)]. More recently, Olivieri et al. proposed an alternative method of applying a variable external voltage on the liquid microjet [Olivieri et al ., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 18 , 29506 (2016)]. In this study, we examined these two methods of calibration using extreme ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy with a magnetic bottle time-of-flight photoelectron spectrometer. We confirmed that the latter method flattens the vacuum level potential around the microjet, similar to the former method, while we found that the applied voltage energy-shifts the entire spectrum. Thus, careful energy recalibration is indispensable after the application of an external voltage for accurate measurements. It is also pointed out that electric conductivity of liquid on the order of 1 mS/cm is required for stable application of an external voltage. Therefore, both methods need a similar concentration of an electrolyte. Using the calibration method proposed by Olivieri et al. , Perry et al. have recently revised the vertical ionization energy of liquid water to be 11.67(15) eV [Perry et al ., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11 , 1789 (2020)], which is 0.4 eV higher than the previously estimated value. While the source of this discrepancy is still unclear, we estimate that their calibration method possibly leaves uncertainty on the order of 0.1 eV.},

Our method identifies communities of particles that share a similar local structure by harvesting the information hidden in the spatial variation of two- or three-body static correlations. This corresponds to an unsupervised machine learning approach that infers communities solely from the particle positions and their species. We apply this method to three models of supercooled liquids and find that it detects subtle forms of local order, as demonstrated by a comparison with the statistics of Voronoi cells. Finally, we analyze the time-dependent correlation between structural communities and particle mobility and show that our method captures relevant information about glassy dynamics.},

A similar segregation is observed at the crystallization of homogeneous glassy aqueous solutions by heating. The influence of solutes on the nucleation of solvent water and the solute discharge process from the crystalline ice are not clear. In this study, I made a homogeneous dilute glassy glycerol aqueous solution (0.07 mol fraction) using pressure liquid cooling vitrification (PLCV), measured the specific volume and the sample temperature during the compression and decompression processes, and examined the polyamorphic and crystallization behaviors. It is found that the sample crystallized slightly above the crystallization temperature is amorphized homogeneously under pressure, and that the amorphized sample is equivalent to the homogeneous glassy sample made by PLCV. This indicates that glycerol solutes in the crystalline sample are dispersed homogeneously and the crystalline sample does not segregate. These experimental results suggest that nucleation does not involve segregation and that crystal growth induces segregation. The discovery of the non-segregated crystalline state has an implication in not only the understanding of crystallization of glassy ice in meteorology and planetary physics but also the application to cell thawing techniques in cryobiology and food engineering.},

The in-plane orientation of the acid group defines the two lowest energy rotamers of I4CA. The S 1 ← S 0 origin bands of the two rotamers and four isotopologues have been fit to asymmetric rotor Hamiltonians in both electronic states. From the best-fit parameters, the positions of the H-atoms in the principal axis frames of each conformer have been determined and serve to unambiguously identify the syn forms (i.e., COH⋯O) of the cis and trans rotamers. The experimental S 0 and S 1 inertial parameters, hydrogen atom positions, and transition dipole moment (TDM) orientations are compared with the results of theoretical calculations. The TDM orientation indicates that the S 1 state is the 1 L a state in contrast to most substituted indoles. The molecular orbital properties and natural charges are investigated to better understand the 1 L a / 1 L b state reversal and the extent of photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer that impacts the rotamer-dependent fluorescence lifetimes.},

The molecules were prepared by laser desorption in a disk source, then cooled in a helium supersonic expansion, and finally excited in the Q band system (S 1 ← S 0 ). This type of experiment allows the spectroscopic characterization of large non-luminescent molecules in the absence of solvent perturbations. The two copper porphyrins exhibit a broad electronic origin Q 00 absorption spectrum, partly caused by the short lifetime of the excited (S 1 ) state. The two porphyrins differ strongly with a strong Q 00 band for CuOEP and a weak one for CuTPP, in agreement with the Gouterman four-orbital model. The two molecules exhibit different solvent shifts: CuOEP is blue shifted in non-polar solvents owing to its alkyl substituents, while CuTPP is red shifted as for regular transitions to ππ * orbitals. The decay dynamics of the triplet state exhibit a collision-free lifetime of 70 ± 7 ns for CuTPP atop a microsecond decay. This non-exponential decay can be viewed as evidence of time evolution of two states combining the state with spin 1 borne by the porphyrin ring and that by the Cu atom 1 2 ⁠ . Therefore, this method allows solvent-free spectrodynamics of large molecules in a short microsecond time range.},

It is shown that, despite its overall hydrophobicity, hydrogenated ND can become locally hydrophilic due to the introduced defects; therefore, water molecules may be attracted to the particular sites at its surface. To assess the direct influence of water on the magnetic behavior of NDs, the solvent-induced shift of the g -tensor was employed, indicating that for the same types of impurities, the impact the water has strongly depends on their positions in ND. In addition, water molecules at the locally hydrophilic sites of hydrogenated ND may influence the magnetic behavior of defects to the same extent as it may be influenced in the case of hydroxylated ND. Moreover, the overall hydrophilic nature of the latter does not necessarily guarantee that water, although being strongly attracted to the vicinity of impurity, will form a hydrogen bond network with a substantial impact on the local environment of the unpaired electron. The obtained data imply that in the context of the Overhauser effect, for which the solvent-induced shift of the g -tensor is proposed as a tool to reveal whether some NDs are more favorable for it to occur compared to the others, hydrogenated NDs should perform no worse than hydroxylated ones, despite only the local hydrophilicity of the former.},

  abstract = {The strong inter-relationship between cyclohepta-1,3,5-triene (CHT) and norcaradiene (NCD) systems observed in some reactions has been extended to include the energy surfaces for some low-lying ionic states. Equilibrium structures for ionic states of CHT with 2 A′ symmetry were routinely found; the structures emerging with 2 A′′ symmetry were NCD ionic states. A detailed analysis of these surfaces as a function of the C 1 to C 6 distance showed that while minima occurred for both state symmetries, curve crossing occurs in C S symmetry, which is avoided by distortion to C 1 symmetry. The CHT → NCD structural change is attributed to initial conrotatory closure of the singly occupied molecular orbital. A new synchrotron-based photoelectron spectrum (PES) for CHT up to 25 eV shows little vibrational structure. We have assigned the PES up to 17 eV using a variety of theoretical methods. The calculated lowest ionic state, X 2 A′, is predicted to have a very low vibrational frequency of 87 cm −1 , leading to a high density of vibrational states. The Franck–Condon envelopes calculated for the two lowest states are almost completely contained within the envelope of the lowest PES band. A comparison of the predicted PES of CHT and NCD showed much closer agreement of the PES with that of CHT. An analysis of the 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of CHT showed no evidence of NCD. The increased chemical shifts arising from the higher frequencies used here lead to significant changes in appearance when compared with earlier NMR spectra.},

The NaCl–KCl system forms a solid solution at all compositions between 657 °C and 505 °C. Below a critical temperature of 505 °C, the system exhibits a miscibility gap with coexisting Na-rich and K-rich rocksalt phases. We calculate the phase diagram in this region using the semi-grand canonical Widom method, which averages over virtual particle transmutations. We verify our results by comparison with free energies calculated from thermodynamic integration and extrapolate the location of the critical point. Our calculations reproduce the experimental phase diagram remarkably well and illustrate how solid–solid equilibria and chemical potentials, including those at metastable conditions, can be computed for materials that form solid solutions.},

A 122 , 8905 (2018)], frozen orbital analysis at the MECI geometries between the ground and first electronic excited states (S 0 /S 1 MECI), which considers the main configurations contributing to the excitation, inductively clarified two controlling factors. First, the exchange integral between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) approximately becomes zero. Second, the HOMO–LUMO gap becomes close to the HOMO–LUMO Coulomb integral. This study applies the controlling factors to the penalty function method, which is the standard MECI optimization technique, and minimizes the energy average of the two states with the constraint that the energy gap between the states vanishes. Numerical assessments clarified that the present method could obtain the S 0 /S 1 MECI geometries more efficiently than the conventional one.},

  abstract = {Stochastic models are key to understanding the intricate dynamics of gene expression. However, the simplest models that only account for active and inactive states of a gene fail to capture common observations in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Here, we consider multistate models of gene expression that generalize the canonical Telegraph process and are capable of capturing the joint effects of transcription factors, heterochromatin state, and DNA accessibility (or, in prokaryotes, sigma-factor activity) on transcript abundance. We propose two approaches for solving classes of these generalized systems. The first approach offers a fresh perspective on a general class of multistate models and allows us to “decompose” more complicated systems into simpler processes, each of which can be solved analytically. This enables us to obtain a solution of any model from this class. Next, we develop an approximation method based on a power series expansion of the stationary distribution for an even broader class of multistate models of gene transcription. We further show that models from both classes cannot have a heavy-tailed distribution in the absence of extrinsic noise. The combination of analytical and computational solutions for these realistic gene expression models also holds the potential to design synthetic systems and control the behavior of naturally evolved gene expression systems in guiding cell-fate decisions.},

Here, we study the differences between effective potentials from fully numerical density functional and optimized effective potential calculations for fixed configurations. We find that the differences are small, overall, and choose exchange-only potentials at the local density approximation level of theory computed on top of Hartree–Fock densities as a good compromise. The differences between potentials arising from different atomic configurations are also found to be small at this level of theory. Furthermore, we discuss the efficient Gaussian-basis implementation of SAP via error function fits to fully numerical atomic radial potentials. The guess obtained from the fitted potentials can be easily implemented in any Gaussian-basis quantum chemistry code in terms of two-electron integrals. Fits covering the whole periodic table from H to Og are reported for non-relativistic as well as fully relativistic four-component calculations that have been carried out with fully numerical approaches.},

  abstract = {A theoretical framework and a computer code (SpectrumSDT) are developed for accurate calculations of coupled rotational–vibrational states in triatomic molecules using hyper-spherical coordinates and taking into account the Coriolis coupling effect. Concise final formulas are derived for the construction of the Hamiltonian matrix using an efficient combination of the variational basis representation and discrete variable representation methods with locally optimized basis sets and grids. First, the new code is tested by comparing its results with those of the APH3D program of Kendrick et al . [Kendrick, Pack, Walker, and Hayes, J. Chem. Phys. 110 , 6673 (1999)]. Then, accurate calculations of the rovibrational spectra are carried out for doubly substituted symmetric ( 18 O 16 O 18 O) and asymmetric ( 18 O 18 O 16 O) ozone isotopomers for the total angular momentum up to J = 5. Together with similar data recently reported for the singly substituted symmetric ( 16 O 18 O 16 O) and asymmetric ( 16 O 16 O 18 O) ozone isotopomers, these calculations quantify the role of the Coriolis coupling effect in the large mass-independent isotopic enrichment of ozone, observed in both laboratory experiments and the atmosphere of the Earth. It is found that the Coriolis effect in ozone is relatively small, as evidenced by deviations of its rotational constants from the symmetric-top-rotor behavior, magnitudes of parity splittings (Λ-doubling), and ratios of rovibrational partition functions for asymmetric vs symmetric ozone molecules. It is concluded that all of these characteristics are influenced by the isotopic masses as much as they are influenced by the overall symmetry of the molecule. It is therefore unlikely that the Coriolis coupling effect could be responsible for symmetry-driven mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in ozone.},

Here, we introduce an active learning (AL) framework for generating training sets corresponding to individual many-body contributions to the energy of an N-body system, which are required for the development of MB-nrg potential energy functions (PEFs). Our AL framework is based on uncertainty and error estimation and uses Gaussian process regression to identify the most relevant configurations that are needed for an accurate representation of the energy landscape of the molecular system under examination. Taking the Cs + –water system as a case study, we demonstrate that the application of our AL framework results in significantly smaller training sets than previously used in the development of the original MB-nrg PEF, without loss of accuracy. Considering the computational cost associated with high-level electronic structure calculations, our AL framework is particularly well-suited to the development of many-body PEFs, with chemical and spectroscopic accuracy, for molecular-level computer simulations from the gas to the condensed phase.},

We demonstrate through a master equation framework as to why the exact choice of time-delay is irrelevant as long as a small non-zero value is adopted. We also derive a correction to reweight the biased propagator, and somewhat to our dissatisfaction but also to our reassurance, we find that it barely makes a difference to the intuitive picture we had previously derived and used.},

Inverse methods provide a systematic means for navigating their inherently high-dimensional design spaces to create materials with targeted properties. While multiple physically motivated inverse strategies have been successfully implemented in silico , their translation to guiding experimental materials discovery has thus far been limited to a handful of proof-of-concept studies. In this perspective, we discuss recent advances in inverse methods for design of soft materials that address two challenges: (1) methodological limitations that prevent such approaches from satisfying design constraints and (2) computational challenges that limit the size and complexity of systems that can be addressed. Strategies that leverage machine learning have proven particularly effective, including methods to discover order parameters that characterize complex structural motifs and schemes to efficiently compute macroscopic properties from the underlying structure. We also highlight promising opportunities to improve the experimental realizability of materials designed computationally, including discovery of materials with functionality at multiple thermodynamic states, design of externally directed assembly protocols that are simple to implement in experiments, and strategies to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of experimentally relevant models.},

Soft x-ray spectroscopy features shallow penetration depth and demonstrates inherent surface sensitivity to characterize the interfacial behavior with elemental and chemical sensitivities. In this review, we present a brief survey of modern synchrotron-based soft x-ray spectroscopy of the interface in electrochemical energy storage systems. The technical focus includes core-level spectroscopy of conventional x-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We show that while conventional techniques remain powerful for probing the chemical species on the surface, today’s material research studies have triggered much more demanding chemical sensitivity that could only be offered by advanced techniques such as RIXS. Another direction in the field is the rapid development of various in situ/operando characterizations of complex electrochemical systems. Notably, the solid-state battery systems provide unique advantages for future studies of both the surface/interface and the bulk properties under operando conditions. We conclude with perspectives on the bright future of studying electrochemical systems through these advanced soft x-ray spectroscopic techniques.},

Phys. Chem. B 123 , 2040–2049 (2019)]. The polarized protein-specific charge model is employed both in the MD simulation and in the QM/MM calculations to account for the environmental fluctuation of the protein scaffold. The energy transfer pathways are, thus, derived, which agree well with the phenomenological models based on the spatial organization of the chromophores and the experimental observations. Moreover, the simulated linear absorption spectra using the dissipaton equation of motion approach agree well with the experimental ones, and the resulting population dynamics indicates that an optimal energy transfer efficiency is reproduced.},

  abstract = {Controlling the assembly of colloidal particles into specific structures has been a long-term goal of the soft materials community. Much can be learned about the process of self-assembly by examining the early stage assembly into clusters. For the simple case of hard spheres with short-range attractions, the rigid clusters of N particles (where N is small) have been enumerated theoretically and tested experimentally. Less is known, however, about how the free energy landscapes are altered when the inter-particle potential is long-ranged. In this work, we demonstrate how adaptive biasing in molecular simulations may be used to pinpoint shifts in the stability of colloidal clusters as the inter-particle potential is varied. We also discuss the generality of our techniques and strategies for application to related molecular systems.},

  abstract = {The oxidation of glycerol under alkaline conditions in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst can be tailored to the formation of lactic acid, an important commodity chemical. Despite recent advances in this area, the mechanism for its formation is still a subject of contention. In this study, we use a model 1 wt.\% AuPt/TiO 2 catalyst to probe this mechanism by conducting a series of isotopic labeling experiments with 1,3- 13 C glycerol. Optimization of the reaction conditions was first conducted to ensure high selectivity to lactic acid in the isotopic labeling experiments. Selectivity to lactic acid increased with temperature and concentration of NaOH, but increasing the O 2 pressure appeared to influence only the rate of reaction. Using 1,3- 13 C glycerol, we demonstrate that conversion of pyruvaldehyde to lactic acid proceeds via a base-promoted 1,2-hydride shift. There was no evidence to suggest that this occurs via a 2,1-methide shift under the conditions used in this study.},

The O–MoS 2 QDs were prepared with a one-pot microwave method by hydrazine-mediated oxygen-doping. The synthetic method is straightforward, time-saving, and can be applied in large scale preparation. Ultra-small O–MoS 2 QDs with the average size of 5.83 nm and 1–4 layers can be uniformly distributed on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Benefited from the unique structure and the doping effect of oxygen in the MoS 2 QDs and the great number of active sites, the O–MoS 2 QD hybrid displayed outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward HER. A low overpotential of 76 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec were obtained in an acidic solution toward HER. Additionally, the resultant O–MoS 2 QD hybrid also exhibited excellent stability and durability toward HER, displaying negligible current density loss after 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. The design and synthesis of the electrocatalyst in this work open up a prospective route to prepare active and stable electrocatalysts toward substituting precious metals for hydrogen generation.},

Results were analyzed in light of simulations of kinetic currents as a function of θ Te , calculated by employing a simple mean field model including both site blocking and electronic effects. Inside this framework, experimental data are best explained by considering that oxygenated Te species inhibit the ORR by either negatively modifying adsorption energies of reaction intermediates or combined site-blocking and electronic effects. A redox ORR catalysis due to redox properties of Te adatoms is discarded. Contrarily, in 0.05M H 2 SO 4 , a positive catalytic effect has been found, interpreted in terms of a competitive adsorption–desorption mechanism involving the replacement of adsorbed sulfate by Te adatoms. On the other hand, despite the strong site-blocking effect on H ads and OH ads adsorption by Te adatoms, it appears that the reduced Te–Pt(111) adlayer does not inhibit the reaction, suggesting different active sites for H ads and OH ads adsorption and for the rate-determining step of the ORR mechanism.},

Here, the formation and evolution of surface nanoparticles were investigated for wet-chemistry deposition of platinum from trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum (IV) precursor onto flat silica supports to interrogate the factors influencing the initial stages of nanoparticle formation. The deposition was performed on silicon-based substrates, including hydroxylated silica (SiO 2 ) and boron-impregnated hydroxylated silica (B/SiO 2 ) surfaces. The deposition resulted in the immediate formation of Pt-containing nanoparticles, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The prepared substrates were later reduced at 550 °C under H 2 gas environment. This reduction procedure resulted in the formation of metallic Pt particles. The reactivity of the precursor and dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on the OH-terminated silica surface were compared to those on the B-impregnated surface. The size distribution of the resulting nanoparticles as a function of surface preparation was evaluated, and density functional theory calculations were used to explain the differences between the two types of surfaces investigated.},

The reference term of the EOS is derived based on first- and second-order TPT of Wertheim for the chains interacting with each other through the Weeks–Chandler–Anderson potential model. In order to derive the perturbation term, we have used the radial distribution function of the hard-chain system with a chain range of m = 2–10 and packing fraction range of η = 0.10–0.72, which cover the entire density range from vapor to solid phases. The performance of the EOS is tested against simulation data of the compressibility factor, residual internal energy, and phase equilibrium. A close agreement was observed across all cases. The EOS has three pure component parameters and is able to describe the global vapor–liquid–solid phase diagram of the LJ chain.},

Moreover, the convergence of the GPR PES is inspected, leading to discussions on the advantages of the GPR fitting approach. By the segmented strategy [Meng et al. , J. Chem.

The rate coefficients are then computed through the ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method. An agreement between the present RPMD calculations and the previous observations is found, implying the accuracy of the present calculations.

One feature shows alignment of the H–OH axis with the laser polarization, while the other indicates polarization alignment normal to the H–OH axis. By analyzing kinematic differences between the OH + /D + and OD + /H + channels of HOD, these two alignment features are shown to result from dissociation from different states in the dication. Only dissociation from one of these states has an alignment dependence consistent with predictions of sequential strong-field tunneling ionization models. The alignment dependence of dissociation from the other state can only be explained by dynamic alignment launched by the unbending of the molecule during ionization.},

  abstract = {Direct laser absorption of a slit supersonic discharge expansion provides the first high-resolution spectroscopic results on the symmetric CH stretch excitation (ν 1 ) of the bromomethyl (CH 2 Br) radical in the ground electronic state. Narrowband (&lt;1 MHz) mid-infrared radiation is produced by difference-frequency generation of two visible laser beams, with the open shell halohydrocarbon radical generated by electron dissociative attachment of CH 2 Br 2 in a discharge and rapidly cooled to T rot = 18 ± 1 K in the subsequent slit-jet supersonic expansion. A rovibrational structure in the radical spectrum is fully resolved, as well as additional splittings due to spin-rotation effects and 79 Br/ 81 Br isotopologues in natural abundance. Spectroscopic constants and band origins are determined by fitting the transition frequencies to a non-rigid Watson Hamiltonian, yielding results consistent with a vibrationally averaged planar radical and an unpaired electron in the out-of-plane p π orbital. Additionally, extensive satellite band structure from a vibrational hot band is observed and analyzed. The hot band data is compared to CFOUR/VPT2 (CCSD(T)cc-pVQZ) ab initio anharmonic predictions of the vibration rotation alpha matrix, which permits unambiguous assignment to CH 2 symmetric-stretch excitation built on the singly excited CH 2 out-of-plane bending mode (ν 1 + ν 4 ← ν 4 ). Longitudinal cooling of the Doppler width in the slit-jet expansion geometry also reveals partially resolved hyperfine structure on transitions out of the lowest angular momentum states in excellent agreement with predictions based on microwave studies. High level ab initio MOLPRO calculations [CCSD(T)-f12b/VnZ-f12 (n = 3, 4, CBS)] are also performed with explicitly correlated f12 electron methods for the out-of-plane CH 2 bending mode over the halogen series CH 2 X (X = F, Cl, Br, I), which clearly reveals a non-planar geometry for X = F (with a ΔE ≈ 0.3 kcal/mol barrier) and yet planar equilibrium geometries for X = Cl, Br, and I. Finally, a detailed Boltzmann analysis of the transition intensities provides support for negligible collisional equilibration of the entangled H atom nuclear spin states on the few hundred microsecond time scale and high collision densities of a slit supersonic expansion.},

High resolution TER spectra allow us to identify and assign three dissociation channels of C O 2 + ( ⁠ C 2 Σ g + ⁠ ) in the studied energy region: (1) production of CO + (X 2 Σ + ) + O( 3 P) by predissociation via spin–orbit coupling with the repulsive 1 4 Π u state; (2) production of CO + (X 2 Σ + ) + O( 1 D) by predissociation via bending and/or anti-symmetric stretching mediated conical intersection crossing with A 2 Π u or B 2 Σ u + ⁠ , where the C 2 Σ g + /A 2 Π u crossing is considered to be more likely; (3) direct dissociation to CO + (A 2 Π) + O( 3 P) on the C 2 Σ g + state surface, which exhibits a competitive intensity above its dissociation limit (8.20 eV). For the first dissociation channel, the fragmented CO + (X 2 Σ + ) ions are found to have widely spread populations of both rotational and vibrational levels, indicating that bending of the parent C O 2 + over a broad range is involved upon dissociation, while for the latter two channels, the produced CO + (X 2 Σ + ) and CO + (A 2 Π) ions have relatively narrow rotational populations. The anisotropy parameters β are also measured for all three channels and are found to be nearly independent of the vibronically selected intermediate states, likely due to complicated intramolecular interactions in the studied energy region.},

  abstract = {Predicting accurate nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shieldings relies upon cancellation of different types of errors between the theoretically calculated shielding constant of the analyte of interest and the reference. Often, the intrinsic error in computed shieldings due to basis sets, approximations in the Hamiltonian, description of the wave function, and dynamic effects is nearly identical between the analyte and reference, yet if the electronic structure or sensitivity to local environment differs dramatically, this cannot be taken for granted. Detailed prior work has examined the octahedral trivalent cation Al ( H 2 O ) 6 3 + ⁠ , accounting for ab initio intrinsic errors. However, the use of this species as a reference for the chemically distinct tetrahedral anion Al ( OH ) 4 − requires an understanding of how these errors cancel in order to define the limits of accurately predicting Al 27 chemical shielding in Al ( OH ) 4 − ⁠ . In this work, we estimate the absolute shielding of the Al 27 nucleus in Al ( OH ) 4 − at the coupled cluster level (515.1 ± 5.3 ppm). Shielding sensitivity to the choice of method approximation and atomic basis sets used has been evaluated. Solvent and thermal effects are assessed through ensemble averaging techniques using ab initio molecular dynamics. The contribution of each type of intrinsic error is assessed for the Al ( H 2 O ) 6 3 + and Al ( OH ) 4 − ions, revealing significant differences that fundamentally hamper the ability to accurately calculate the Al 27 chemical shift of Al ( OH ) 4 − from first principles.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments reported that spin state transitions were realized by applying bias voltages. However, these bias-induced transitions are not fully understood, especially the mechanism. It is well established in experiments that the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation activated by light radiation can lead to the transition from low spin (LS) to high spin (HS), and the transition from HS to LS can be achieved by light due to the metal-centered (MC) excitation. Moreover, electronic excitations are accessible by inelastic cotunneling in molecular junctions under bias voltages. Based on these two facts, we propose that the MLCT excitation is responsible for the bias-induced transition from LS to HS, and the bias-induced transition from HS to LS is attributed to the MC excitation. The rationality of our proposed mechanism is demonstrated by comparing first-principles results and experimental observations. Threshold voltages of MLCT and MC excitations predicted in theory are consistent with bias voltages used to reach the transition from LS to HS and that from HS to LS in the experiment [Miyamachi et al. , Nat. Commun. 3 , 938 (2012)]. Activation of MLCT or MC excitation depends on the bias polarity, which can explain the bias-polarity dependence of the transition in the experiment. Our study is important for further design of molecular spintronic devices working on the bias-controlled transition.},

  abstract = {A small dimension Laval nozzle connected to a compact high enthalpy source equipped with cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS) is used to produce vibrationally hot and rotationally cold high-resolution infrared spectra of polyatomic molecules in the 1.67 µ m region. The Laval nozzle was machined in isostatic graphite, which is capable of withstanding high stagnation temperatures. It is characterized by a throat diameter of 2 mm and an exit diameter of 24 mm. It was designed to operate with argon heated up to 2000 K and to produce a quasi-unidirectional flow to reduce the Doppler effect responsible for line broadening. The hypersonic flow was characterized using computational fluid dynamics simulations, Pitot measurements, and CRDS. A Mach number evolving from 10 at the nozzle exit up to 18.3 before the occurrence of a first oblique shock wave was measured. Two different gases, carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH 4 ), were used as test molecules. Vibrational (T vib ) and rotational (T rot ) temperatures were extracted from the recorded infrared spectrum, leading to T vib = 1346 ± 52 K and T rot = 12 ± 1 K for CO. A rotational temperature of 30 ± 3 K was measured for CH 4 , while two vibrational temperatures were necessary to reproduce the observed intensities. The population distribution between vibrational polyads was correctly described with T vib I = 894 ± 47 K ⁠ , while the population distribution within a given polyad (namely, the dyad or the pentad) was modeled correctly by T vib II = 54 ± 4 K ⁠ , testifying to a more rapid vibrational relaxation between the vibrational energy levels constituting a polyad.},

  abstract = {A theoretical framework for understanding molecular structures is crucial for the development of new technologies such as catalysts or solar cells. Apart from electronic excitation energies, however, only spectroscopic properties of molecules consisting of lighter elements can be computationally described at a high level of theory today since heavy elements require a relativistic framework, and thus far, most methods have only been derived in a non-relativistic framework. Important new technologies such as those mentioned above require molecules that contain heavier elements, and hence, there is a great need for the development of relativistic computational methods at a higher level of accuracy. Here, the Second-Order-Polarization-Propagator-Approximation (SOPPA), which has proven to be very successful in the non-relativistic case, is adapted to a relativistic framework. The equations for SOPPA are presented in their most general form, i.e., in a non-canonical spin–orbital basis, which can be reduced to the canonical case, and the expressions needed for a relativistic four-component SOPPA are obtained. The equations are one-index transformed, giving more compact expressions that correspond to those already available for the four-component RPA. The equations are ready for implementation in a four-component quantum chemistry program, which will allow both linear response properties and excitation energies to be calculated relativistically at the SOPPA level.},

Being TS, the new CSs remain within their own classes during dynamics by evolving exclusively through their CS parameters. The new TS CSs are now appropriate to reconstruct quantum rotational properties from classical-mechanics simulations of chemical reactions. Following literature precedents, we enforce temporal stability by incorporating action-angle-related phase factors into the parameters of the original CS. In addition, to elucidate CS quantum reconstruction procedures, we derive one more rotational CS from a quantum electron nuclear dynamics description of a diatomic rotor (DR). The DR CS and the TSLR CS are not identical but display similar structures and properties. We rigorously demonstrate and examine the key properties of the three CSs: continuity, resolution of unity, temporal stability, action identity, minimum uncertainty relationships, and quasi-classical behavior. Finally, we present computer simulations of the CSs dynamics and an application of them to predict CO rotational excitation probabilities in the Li + + CO reaction. CS results agree satisfactorily with experimental ones and encourage future applications in chemical dynamics, statistical mechanics, spectroscopy, nuclear physics, quantum coherence, and quantum computing.},

The availability of analytic MR-CISD and MR-AQCC energy gradients and analytic nonadiabatic couplings for MR-CISD enables exciting applications including, e.g., investigations of π-conjugated biradicaloid compounds, calculations of multitudes of excited states, development of diabatization procedures, and furnishing the electronic structure information for on-the-fly surface nonadiabatic dynamics. With fully variational uncontracted spin-orbit MRCI, COLUMBUS provides a unique possibility of performing high-level calculations on compounds containing heavy atoms up to lanthanides and actinides. Crucial for carrying out all of these calculations effectively is the availability of an efficient parallel code for the CI step. Configuration spaces of several billion in size now can be treated quite routinely on standard parallel computer clusters. Emerging developments in COLUMBUS, including the all configuration mean energy multiconfiguration self-consistent field method and the graphically contracted function method, promise to allow practically unlimited configuration space dimensions. Spin density based on the GUGA approach, analytic spin-orbit energy gradients, possibilities for local electron correlation MR calculations, development of general interfaces for nonadiabatic dynamics, and MRCI linear vibronic coupling models conclude this overview.},

The algorithm combines the image-charge method for near field with the harmonic surface mapping, which converts the contribution of infinite far-field charges into a finite number of charges on an auxiliary spherical surface. We approximate the electrostatic potential of far-field charges via spherical harmonic expansion and determine the coefficients by fitting the Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition, which only requires the potential within the simulation cell. Instead of performing the direct evaluation of spherical harmonic series expansion, we use Green’s second identity to transform the series expansion into a spherical integral, which can be accurately represented by discrete charges on the sphere. Therefore, the fast multipole method can be readily employed to sum over all charges within and on the sphere, achieving truly linear O ( N ) complexity. Our algorithm can be applied to a broad range of charged complex fluids under dielectric confinement.},

Phys. 108 , 5225 (1998)] reproduce non-relativistic spin-restricted spherical Hartree–Fock total energies from fully numerical calculations to better accuracy than UGBS, which is shown to exhibit huge errors for some elements, e.g., 0.19 E h for Th + and 0.13 E h for Lu, as it has been parameterized for a single atomic configuration. Having shown the feasibility of the one-electron approach, partially energy-optimized basis sets are formed for all atoms in the Periodic Table, 1 ≤ Z ≤ 118, by optimizing the even-tempered parameters for Z ( Z −1)+ . As the hydrogenic Gaussian basis sets suggested in this work are built strictly from first principles, polarization shells can also be obtained in the same fashion in contrast to previous approaches. The accuracy of the polarized basis sets is demonstrated by calculations on a small set of molecules by comparison to fully numerical reference values, which show that chemical accuracy can be reached even for challenging cases such as SF 6 . This approach is straightforward to extend to relativistic calculations and could facilitate studies beyond the established Periodic Table.},

We present a Legendre-spectral algorithm for solving the Dyson equation that addresses both of these issues. By formulating the algorithm in Legendre coefficient space, our method inherits the known faster-than-exponential convergence of the Green’s function’s Legendre series expansion. In this basis, the fast recursive method for Legendre polynomial convolution enables us to develop a Dyson equation solver with quadratic scaling. We present benchmarks of the algorithm by computing the dissociation energy of the helium dimer He 2 within dressed second-order perturbation theory. For this system, the application of the Legendre spectral algorithm allows us to achieve an energy accuracy of 10 −9 E h with only a few hundred expansion coefficients.},

  abstract = {This work revisits the fundamentals of thermodynamic perturbation theory for fluid mixtures. The choice of reference and governing assumptions can profoundly influence the accuracy of the perturbation theory. The statistical associating fluid theory for variable range interactions of the generic Mie form equation of state is used as a basis to evaluate three choices of hard-sphere reference fluids: single component, additive mixture, and non-additive mixture. Binary mixtures of Lennard-Jones fluids are investigated, where the ratios of σ (the distance where the potential is zero) and the ratios of ϵ (the well depth) are varied. By comparing with Monte Carlo simulations and results from the literature, we gauge the accuracy of different theories. A perturbation theory with a single-component reference gives inaccurate predictions when the σ -ratio differs significantly from unity but is otherwise applicable. Non-additivity becomes relevant in phase-equilibrium calculations for fluids with high ϵ -ratios or when the mixing rule of σ incorporates non-additivity through an adjustable parameter. This can be handled in three ways: by using a non-additive hard-sphere reference, by incorporating an extra term in the additive hard-sphere reference, or with a single-component reference when the σ -ratio is close to unity. For σ - and ϵ -ratios that differ significantly from unity, the perturbation theories overpredict the phase-equilibrium pressures regardless of reference. This is particularly pronounced in the vicinity of the critical region for mixtures with high ϵ -ratios. By comparing with Monte Carlo simulations where we compute the terms in the perturbation theory directly, we find that the shortcomings of the perturbation theory stem from an inaccurate representation of the second- and third-order perturbation terms, a 2 and a 3 . As mixtures with molecules that differ significantly in size and depths of their interaction potentials are often encountered in industrial and natural applications, further development of the perturbation theory based on these results is an important future work.},

  abstract = {Multireference methods are usually required for transition metal systems due to the partially filled d electrons. In this work, the single-reference equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method at the singles and doubles level for double ionization potentials (EOM-DIP-CCSD) is employed to calculate energies of states from the d 8 configuration of late-transition metal atoms starting from a closed-shell reference. Its results are compared with those from the multireference Fock-space coupled-cluster method at the CCSD level (FSCCSD) for DIP from the same closed-shell reference. Both scalar-relativistic effects and spin–orbit coupling are considered in these calculations. Compared with all-electron FSCCSD results with four-component Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian, FSCCSD with relativistic effective core potentials can provide reasonable results, except for atoms with unstable reference. Excitation energies for states in the (n − 1)d 8 ns 2 configuration are overestimated pronouncedly with these two methods, and this overestimation is more severe than those in the (n − 1)d 9 ns 1 configuration. Error of EOM-CCSD on these excitation energies is generally larger than that of FSCCSD. On the other hand, relative energies of most of the states in the d 8 configuration with respect to the lowest state in the same configuration are predicted reliably with EOM-DIP-CCSD, except for the 3 P 0 state of Hg 2+ and states in Ir + . FSCCSD can provide reasonable relative energies for the several lowest states, while its error tends to be larger for higher states.},

  abstract = {We study here the extreme statistics of Brownian particles escaping from a cusp funnel: the fastest Brownian particles among n follow an ensemble of optimal trajectories located near the shortest path from the source to the target. For the time of such first arrivers, we derive an asymptotic formula that differs from the mean first passage times obtained for classical narrow escape and dire strait. When particles are initially distributed at a given distance from a cusp, the time of the fastest particles depends on the cusp geometry. Therefore, when many particles diffuse around impermeable obstacles, the geometry plays a role in the time it takes to reach a target. In the context of cellular transduction with signaling molecules, having to escape from such cusp-like domains slows down signaling pathways. Consequently, generating multiple copies of the same molecule enables molecular signals to be delivered through crowded environments in sufficient time.},

We find that the system exhibits a strong nonlinear response to small driving frequencies both for the mean time-averaged current and for the fluctuations. For the first, we obtain an analytic formula by coarse-graining the original model to a solvable one. The result is nonperturbative in the modulation amplitude and frequency. We then refine the picture by studying the stochastic dynamics of the full system using a large deviation approach that allows us to show the resonant effect at the level of the time-averaged variance and signal-to-noise ratio.

Apart from fully explicit solvation treatments that can be difficult to parameterize or computationally expensive, there is currently no well-established first-principles regimen for reliably modeling atomic-scale chemistry in mixed solvent environments. We offer our perspective on how this process could be achieved in the near future as mixed solvent systems become more explored using theoretical and computational chemistry. We first outline what makes mixed solvent systems far more complex compared to single-component solvents. An overview of current and promising techniques for modeling mixed solvent environments is provided. We focus on so-called hybrid solvation treatments such as the conductor-like screening model for real solvents and the reference interaction site model, which are far less computationally demanding than explicit simulations. We also propose that cluster-continuum approaches rooted in physically rigorous quasi-chemical theory provide a robust, yet practical, route for studying chemical processes in mixed solvents.},

Such versatility stems from perovskites’ favorable optoelectronic properties that are highly exceptional for a facile solution-processed system. Halide perovskite emitters have made significant inroads, in particular, perovskite light emitting device (PeLED) efficiencies have risen from 20\% within 5 years, and perovskite continuous wave amplified spontaneous emission has also been demonstrated recently. This perspective distills the photophysical mechanisms underpinning the various approaches in enhancing their radiative efficiencies. Selected works are highlighted to detail the milestones and to chart the direction the field is heading. Challenges and opportunities for solid-state PeLEDs are discussed. A clear understanding of their basic photophysics and structure-function relations holds the key to rationalizing strategies and streamlining efforts to realize high efficiency PeLEDs and perovskite lasers.},

In this study, we introduce the distribution of nearest-neighbors as an additional order parameter in the concept of local density potentials. We describe how the inverse-Monte Carlo method provides a framework for forcefield development that is capable of overcoming challenges associated with the parameterization of interaction terms in polymer systems. The technique is applied on polyisoprene melts as a prototype system. We demonstrate that while different forcefields can be developed that perform equally in terms of matching target distributions, the inclusion of nearest-neighbors provides a straightforward route to match both thermodynamic and conformational properties. We find that several temperature state points can also be addressed, provided that the forcefield is refined accordingly. Finally, we examine both the single-particle and the collective dynamics of the coarse-grain models, demonstrating that all forcefields present a similar acceleration relative to the atomistic systems.},

The phase diagrams as a function of χ AB and f A at different counterion sizes and different affinities to neutral blocks are constructed, respectively. Stability limits calculated using the RPA are in good agreement with the disorder-body-centered cubic phase boundaries from SCFT calculations. It was found that increasing the size of counterions causes the phase diagram to shift upward and leftward, which is attributed to electrostatic interactions and the intrinsic volume of counterions. The domain size of the ordered phase shows an unexpected tendency that it decreases with increasing counterions’ size. The counterions’ distributions in H and G phases demonstrate that it is electrostatic interaction, instead of packing frustration, that plays a leading role in such systems. For finite size counterions, with the increase in affinity between counterions and neutral blocks, the phase diagram shifts upward, indicating the improved compatibility between different blocks. Furthermore, the affinity effect between counterions and neutral blocks can be mapped into an effective Flory parameter χ A B ′ = χ AB + 0.27 χ BC .},

  abstract = {The use of the varied chemical reactivity of precursors to drive the production of a desired nanocrystal architecture has become a common method to grow thick-shell graded alloy quantum dots (QDs) with robust optical properties. Conclusions on their behavior assume the ideal chemical gradation and uniform particle composition. Here, advanced analytical electron microscopy (high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy) is used to confirm the nature and extent of compositional gradation and these data are compared with performance behavior obtained from single-nanocrystal spectroscopy to elucidate structure, chemical-composition, and optical-property correlations. Specifically, the evolution of the chemical structure and single-nanocrystal luminescence was determined for a time-series of graded-alloy “CdZnSSe/ZnS” core/shell QDs prepared in a single-pot reaction. In a separate step, thick (∼6 monolayers) to giant (&gt;14 monolayers) shells of ZnS were added to the alloyed QDs via a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process, and the impact of this shell on the optical performance was also assessed. By determining the degree of alloying for each component element on a per-particle basis, we observe that the actual product from the single-pot reaction is less “graded” in Cd and more so in Se than anticipated, with Se extending throughout the structure. The latter suggests much slower Se reaction kinetics than expected or an ability of Se to diffuse away from the initially nucleated core. It was also found that the subsequent growth of thick phase-pure ZnS shells by the SILAR method was required to significantly reduce blinking and photobleaching. However, correlated single-nanocrystal optical characterization and electron microscopy further revealed that these beneficial properties are only achieved if the thick ZnS shell is complete and without large lattice discontinuities. In this way, we identify the necessary structural design features that are required for ideal light emission properties in these green-visible emitting QDs.},

Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the thermal, optical, and electron induced reaction pathways is required. Here, the electrophilic DNA nucleobase analog 5-Bromouracil (BrU) has been used as a model compound to study its decomposition in the vicinity of AuNPs illuminated with intense ns laser pulses under various conditions. The plasmonic response of the AuNPs and the concentration of BrU and resulting photoproducts have been tracked by ultraviolet and visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy as a function of the irradiation time. A kinetic model has been developed to determine the reaction rates of two parallel fragmentation pathways of BrU, and their dependency on laser fluence and adsorption on the AuNP have been evaluated. In addition, the size and the electric field enhancement of the decomposed AuNPs have been determined by atomic force microscopy and finite domain time difference calculations, respectively. A minor influence of the direct photoreaction and a strong effect of the heating of the AuNPs have been revealed. However, due to the size reduction of the irradiated AuNPs, a trade-off between laser fluence and plasmonic response of the AuNPs has been observed. Hence, the decomposition of the AuNPs might be limiting the achievable temperatures under irradiation with several laser pulses. These findings need to be considered for an efficient design of catalytic plasmonic systems.},

Second, we build two possible configurations of a second and a third overlayer and perform molecular dynamics simulations with DFTB, monitoring the water orientation, the H-bond network, and the ordered water structure formation. To make our models more realistic, we then build a 12 nm-thick water multilayer on top of the Fe 3 O 4 (001) surface slab model, which we investigate through MM-molecular dynamics (MD). The water layer structuring, revealed by the analysis of the atomic positions from a long MM-MD run for this large MM model, extends up to about 6–7 Å and nicely compares with that observed for a water trilayer model. However, MM and DFTB MD simulations show some discrepancy due to the poor description of the Fe⋯OH 2 distance in MM that calls for further work in the parameterization of the model.},

Systematic screening of 3 d , 4 d , and 5 d transition metal dopants indicates general trends with dopant band filling and allows us to identify the most efficient dopants with respect to the overpotential and relate those to the solution energy and electronic properties. Different conditions (electrochemical vs photoelectrochemical) are accounted for by considering hydroxylated, hydrated, and oxygenated terminations. Based on the DFT+ U results, we identify Rh as the most promising dopant that can reduce the overpotential both under dark and illumination conditions: from 0.56 V to 0.48 V for the hydroxylated surface and quite substantially from 1.12 V to 0.31 V for the hydrated termination and from 0.81 V to 0.56 V for the oxygenated surface. The origin of this improvement is attributed to the modification of the binding energy of chemisorbed species to the Fe 2 O 3 (0001) surface. Investigation of the spin density of intermediate steps during the OER shows that surface iron ions adopt a wide range of oxidation states (+2, +3, and +4) in pure hematite, depending on the termination and chemisorbed species on the surface, but a Fe +3 state is stabilized predominantly upon doping. While Rh is in the +3 state in the bulk, it transforms to +4 at the surface and acquires a finite magnetic moment in several intermediate steps.},

We observed a change in the electronic structure at the interface between the Pt nanoparticles and the carbon support after vacancy introduction, which is in good agreement with theoretical results. The results indicated that vacancy introduction resulted in a drastic change in the Pt–C interactions, which likely affected the d -band center of the Pt nanoparticles and led to the enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction in catalysts.},

  abstract = {Antagonistic salts are salts that consist of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ions. In a binary mixture of water and an organic solvent, these ions preferentially dissolve into different phases. We investigate the effect of an antagonistic salt, tetraphenylphosphonium chloride PPh 4 + Cl − ⁠ , in a mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine by means of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. For increasing concentrations of the salt, the two-phase region is shrunk and the interfacial tension in reduced, in contrast to what happens when a normal salt is added to such a mixture. The MD simulations allow us to investigate in detail the mechanism behind the reduction of the surface tension. We obtain the ion and composition distributions around the interface and determine the hydrogen bonds in the system and conclude that the addition of salt alters the hydrogen bonding.},

  abstract = {Aqueous electrolytes have the potential to overcome some of the safety issues associated with current Li-ion batteries intended for large-scale applications such as stationary use. We recently discovered a lithium-salt dihydrate melt, viz., Li(TFSI) 0.7 (BETI) 0.3 ·2H 2 O, which can provide a wide potential window of over 3 V; however, its reductive stability strongly depends on the electrode material. To understand the underlying mechanism, the interfacial structures on several electrodes (C, Al, and Pt) were investigated by conducting molecular dynamics simulation under the constraint of the electrode potential. The results showed that the high adsorption force on the surface of the metal electrodes is responsible for the increased water density, thus degrading the reductive stability of the electrolyte. Notably, the anion orientation on Pt at a low potential is unfavorable for the formation of a stable anion-derived solid electrolyte interphase, thus promoting hydrogen evolution. Hence, the interfacial structures that depend on the material and potential of the electrode mainly determine the reductive stability of hydrate-melt electrolytes.},

The computational modeling of photocatalysis is a rapidly expanding field that requires to adapt and to further develop the available theoretical tools. The coupled transfer of protons and electrons is an important reaction during photocatalysis. In this work, we present the first step of our methodology development in which we apply the existing kinetic theory of such coupled transfer to a model system, namely, methanol photodissociation on the rutile TiO 2 (110) surface, with the help of high-level first-principles calculations. Moreover, we adapt the Stuchebrukhov–Hammes-Schiffer kinetic theory, where we use the Georgievskii–Stuchebrukhova vibronic coupling to calculate the rate constant of the proton coupled electron transfer reaction for a particular pathway. In particular, we propose a modified expression to calculate the rate constant, which enforces the near-resonance condition for the vibrational wave function during proton tunneling.},

We also found that lattice heating via the electron–phonon coupling process lagged behind the coherent lattice motion, which we attributed to the prolonged thermalization process of the laser-excited non-thermal electrons under high pumping conditions. By taking such a process into account, the improved model fit our experimental data much better, and the extracted γ e of gold was still around 1.6.},

  abstract = {Many measurements have indicated that thin polymer films in their glass state exhibit a mobile interfacial layer that grows in thickness upon heating, while some measurements indicate the opposite trend. Moreover, simulations and limited measurements on glass-forming liquids at temperatures above the glass transition temperature T g exhibit a growing interfacial mobility scale ξ upon cooling. To better understand these seemingly contradictory trends, we perform molecular dynamics simulations over a temperature regime for which our simulated polymer film enters a non-equilibrium glassy state and find that the relaxation time τ α within the film interior, relative to the polymer–air interfacial layer, exhibits a maximum near the computational T g . Correspondingly, we also observe that the interfacial mobility length scale exhibits a maximum near T g , explaining the apparent reversal in the temperature dependence of this scale between the glass and liquid states. We show that the non-monotonic variation of ξ and the relative interfacial mobility to the film interior arise qualitatively from a non-monotonic variation of the gradient of the effective activation free energy of the film; we then obtain a quantitative description of this phenomenon by introducing a phenomenological model that describes the relaxation time layer-by-layer in the film for a temperature range both above and below T g of the film as a whole. This analysis reveals that the non-monotonic trend in the relative interfacial mobility and ξ both arise primarily from the distinctive temperature dependence of relaxation in the interfacial layer, which apparently remains in local equilibrium over the whole temperature range investigated.},

  abstract = {As part of an extensive effort to explore the function of Au/ZnO catalysts in the synthesis of methanol from CO 2 and H 2 , we have systematically investigated the temperature dependent growth, structure formation, and surface intermixing of Zn on the herringbone reconstructed Au(111) surface and the thermal stability of the resulting surfaces by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After Zn deposition at low temperatures, at about 105 K (STM) or below (XPS), we observed nucleation and two-dimensional growth of Zn islands mainly at the elbow sites of the Au(111) herringbone reconstruction. This results in local perturbations of the reconstruction pattern of the Au(111) substrate, which can create additional nucleation sites. XPS data indicate that Zn dissolution into deeper layers is kinetically hindered under these conditions, while local exchange with the Au surface layer, in particular at the elbow sites during nucleation, cannot be excluded. Zn deposition at room temperature, in contrast, results in near-surface alloy formation with a strongly distorted pattern of the herringbone reconstruction and condensation of the Zn and exchanged Au adatoms at ascending steps, together with some loss of Zn into deeper layers. Upon annealing, Zn atoms diffuse to lower layers and eventually to the Au bulk, and the surface successively regains its original Au(111) herringbone structure, which is almost reached after 500 K annealing. Compared with previous reports on the growth of other metals on Au(111), Zn shows a rather high tendency for intermixing and near-surface alloy formation.},

  abstract = {Perturbations to water, both by ions and confining media, have been the focus of numerous experimental and theoretical studies. Yet, several open questions remain, including the extent to which such perturbations modify the structural and dielectric properties of the liquid. Here, we present a first-principles molecular dynamics study of alkali cations in water (Li + , Na + , and K + ) as well as of water and LiCl and KCl solutions under confinement within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of small diameter (1.1–1.5 nm). Our simulations support the view that the water structure is only modified locally in the presence of cations. We found that molecular polarizabilities are fingerprints of hydrogen bonding modifications, which occur at most up to the second solvation shell for all cations in bulk water. Under confinement, we found that the overall value of the molecular polarizability of water molecules near the surface is determined by the balance of two effects, which are quantitatively different in CNTs of different radii: the presence of broken hydrogen bonds at the surface leads to a decrease in the polarizabilities of water molecules, while the interaction with the CNT enhances polarizabilities. Interestingly, the reduction in dipole moments of interfacial water molecules under confinement is instead driven only by changes in the water structure and not by interfacial interactions. As expected, confinement effects on water molecular polarizabilities and dipole moments are more pronounced in the case of the 1.1 nm CNT.},

  abstract = {The diatomic transition metal selenides, MSe (M = Sc, Y, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, and Pt), were studied by resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy near their respective bond dissociation energies. As these molecules exhibit high densities of vibronic states near their dissociation limits, the spectra typically appear quasicontinuously at these energies. Spin–orbit and nonadiabatic couplings among the multitudes of potential curves allow predissociation to occur on a rapid timescale when the molecule is excited to states lying above the ground separated atom limit. This dissociation process occurs so rapidly that the molecules are dissociated before they can be ionized by the absorption of a second photon. This results in an abrupt drop in the ion signal that is assigned as the 0 K bond dissociation energy for the molecule, giving bond dissociation energies of 4.152(3) eV (ScSe), 4.723(3) eV (YSe), 3.482(3) eV (RuSe), 3.613(3) eV (OsSe), 2.971(6) eV (CoSe), 3.039(9) eV (RhSe), 3.591(3) eV (IrSe), and 3.790(31) eV (PtSe). The enthalpies of formation, Δ f H 0K ° (g), for each diatomic metal selenide were calculated using thermochemical cycles, yielding Δ f H 0K ° (g) values of 210.9(4.5) kJ mol −1 (ScSe), 203.5(4.5) kJ mol −1 (YSe), 549.2(4.5) kJ mol −1 (RuSe), 675.9(6.5) kJ mol −1 (OsSe), 373.9(2.6) kJ mol −1 (CoSe), 497.4(2.7) kJ mol −1 (RhSe), 557.4(6.5) kJ mol −1 (IrSe), and 433.7(3.6) kJ mol −1 (PtSe).

For ionization of biomolecules, experimentalists are unable to determine the orientation of the molecule at the time of ionization, which means that the calculated cross sections need to be averaged over all molecular orientations. At the time the calculations were performed, it was not numerically feasible for us to perform proper averaging over orientations, so we introduced the orientation averaged molecular orbital approximation to make the calculations possible. We now have the computational capability to properly perform this average, so, here, we present new results with a proper average over orientations and compare with the previous calculations and experiment. Since the original calculations, results from two different distorted-wave models have also been published and the new results will also be compared with those calculations.

The first principles real-space-based Octopus project was born with that idea in mind, i.e., to provide a unique framework that allows us to describe non-equilibrium phenomena in molecular complexes, low dimensional materials, and extended systems by accounting for electronic, ionic, and photon quantum mechanical effects within a generalized time-dependent density functional theory. This article aims to present the new features that have been implemented over the last few years, including technical developments related to performance and massive parallelism. We also describe the major theoretical developments to address ultrafast light-driven processes, such as the new theoretical framework of quantum electrodynamics density-functional formalism for the description of novel light–matter hybrid states. Those advances, and others being released soon as part of the Octopus package, will allow the scientific community to simulate and characterize spatial and time-resolved spectroscopies, ultrafast phenomena in molecules and materials, and new emergent states of matter (quantum electrodynamical-materials).},

  abstract = {Developing a computational method that is both affordable and accurate for transition-metal chemistry is a major challenge. The bond dissociation energies and the potential energy curves are two important targets for theoretical prediction. Here, we investigate the performance of multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) based on wave functions calculated by the complete-active-space (CAS) and generalized active space (GAS) self-consistent-field (SCF) methods for three transition-metal diatomics (TiC, TiSi, and WCl) for which accurate bond energies are available from recent experiments. We compare the results to those obtained by CAS second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) and Kohn–Sham DFT (KS-DFT). We use six systematic methods to choose the active spaces: (1) we put the bonding orbitals, antibonding orbitals, and singly occupied nonbonding orbitals into the active space in the first method; (2) we also put s and p valence orbitals into the active space; we tried two levels of correlated participating orbitals (CPO) active spaces: (3) nominal CPO (nom-CPO) and (4) extended CPO (ext-CPO); and we used (5) the separated-pair (SP) approximation and (6) a new method presented here called extended separate pairs (ESP) approximation to divide the nom-CPO active space into subspaces. Schemes 1–4 are carried out within the CAS framework, and schemes 5 and 6 are carried out in the GAS framework to eliminate deadwood configurations. For TiC and TiSi, we used all six kinds of active spaces. For WCl, we used three active spaces (nom-CPO, SP, and ESP). We found that MC-PDFT performs better than both CASPT2 and KS-DFT. We also found that the SP (for TiSi) and ESP (for TiC and WCl) approximations are particularly appealing because they make the potential curves smoother and significantly decrease the computational cost of CASSCF calculations. Furthermore, ESP-PDFT can be as accurate as CAS-PDFT.},

  abstract = {We address the calculation of microcanonical reaction rates for processes involving significant nuclear quantum effects using ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), both with and without electronically non-adiabatic transitions. After illustrating the shortcomings of the naive free-particle direct-shooting method, in which the temperature of the internal ring-polymer modes is set to the translational energy scale, we investigate alternative strategies based on the expression for the microcanonical rate in terms of the inverse Laplace transform of the thermal reaction rate. It is shown that simple application of the stationary-phase approximation (SPA) dramatically improves the performance of the microcanonical rates using RPMD, particularly in the low-energy region where tunneling dominates. Using the SPA as a Bayesian prior, numerically exact RPMD microcanonical rates are then obtained using maximum entropy inversion of the thermal reaction rates for both electronically adiabatic and non-adiabatic model systems. Finally, the direct-shooting method is revisited using the SPA-determined temperature for the internal ring-polymer modes, leading to a simple, direct-simulation method with improved accuracy in the tunneling regime. This work suggests a general strategy for the extraction of microcanonical dynamical quantities from RPMD (or other approximate thermal) simulations.},

The method, designated as TD-OCEPA0, is a time-dependent extension of the simplest version of the coupled-electron pair approximation with optimized orbitals [U. Bozkaya and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys. 139 , 054104 (2013)]. It is size extensive, gauge invariant, and computationally much more efficient than the TD-OCC method with double excitations. We employed this method to simulate the electron dynamics in Ne and Ar atoms exposed to intense near infrared laser pulses with various intensities. The computed results, including high-harmonic generation spectra and ionization yields, are compared with those of various other methods ranging from uncorrelated time-dependent Hartree–Fock to fully correlated (within the active orbital space) time-dependent complete-active-space self-consistent field (TD-CASSCF). The TD-OCEPA0 results show good agreement with TD-CASSCF ones for moderate laser intensities. For higher intensities, however, TD-OCEPA0 tends to overestimate the correlation effect, as occasionally observed for CEPA0 in the ground-state correlation energy calculations.},

  abstract = {Solving the electronic structure problem using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique involves the measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation value. The current hardware can perform only projective single-qubit measurements, and thus, the Hamiltonian expectation value is obtained by measuring parts of the Hamiltonian rather than the full Hamiltonian. This restriction makes the measurement process inefficient because the number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows as O ( N 4 ) with the size of the system, N . To optimize the VQE measurement, one can try to group as many Hamiltonian terms as possible for their simultaneous measurement. Single-qubit measurements allow one to group only the terms commuting within the corresponding single-qubit subspaces or qubit-wise commuting. We found that the qubit-wise commutativity between the Hamiltonian terms can be expressed as a graph and the problem of the optimal grouping is equivalent to finding a minimum clique cover (MCC) for the Hamiltonian graph. The MCC problem is NP-hard, but there exist several polynomial heuristic algorithms to solve it approximately. Several of these heuristics were tested in this work for a set of molecular electronic Hamiltonians. On average, grouping qubit-wise commuting terms reduced the number of operators to measure three times less compared to the total number of terms in the considered Hamiltonians.},

Our results confirm that P-EOM-MBPT2 can provide reasonable EAs when molecules with significant multireference character are not considered and its mean absolute error on EAs of these molecules is around or less than 0.2 eV. Its accuracy is comparable to that of the more expensive EOM-CCSD(2) method. Results of EOM-CCSD(2), P-EOM-MBPT2, and CIS(D ∞ ) indicate that the [[ H , a c + ], T 2 ] term in the 1h2p–1h block is more important on EAs than the term neglected in the 1h2p–1h2p block in P-EOM-MBPT2. We proposed an economical method where EAs from CIS(D ∞ ) are corrected by treating this [[ H , a c + ], T 2 ] term in the 1h2p–1h block perturbatively [corr-CIS(D ∞ )]. EAs with corr-CIS(D ∞ ) agree very well with those of P-EOM-MBPT2 with a difference of less than 0.02 eV. Computational scaling of this method is N 4 for the iterative part and N 5 for some non-iterative steps. Its storage requirement is only of OV 3 .

  abstract = {The focal-point approach, combining several quantum chemistry computations to estimate a more accurate computation at a lower expense, is effective and commonly used for energies. However, it has not yet been widely adopted for properties such as geometries. Here, we examine several focal-point methods combining Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2 and MP2.5) with coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] for their effectiveness in geometry optimizations using a new driver for the P si 4 electronic structure program that efficiently automates the computation of composite-energy gradients. The test set consists of 94 closed-shell molecules containing first- and/or second-row elements. The focal-point methods utilized combinations of correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pV(X+d)Z and heavy-aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z (X = D, T, Q, 5, 6). Focal-point geometries were compared to those from conventional CCSD(T) using basis sets up to heavy-aug-cc-pV5Z and to geometries from explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 using the cc-pVXZ-F12 (X = D, T) basis sets. All results were compared to reference geometries reported by Karton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 145 , 104101 (2016)] at the CCSD(T)/heavy-aug-cc-pV6Z level of theory. In general, focal-point methods based on an estimate of the MP2 complete-basis-set limit, with a coupled-cluster correction evaluated in a (heavy-aug-)cc-pVXZ basis, are of superior quality to conventional CCSD(T)/(heavy-aug-)cc-pV(X+1)Z and sometimes approach the errors of CCSD(T)/(heavy-aug-)cc-pV(X+2)Z. However, the focal-point methods are much faster computationally. For the benzene molecule, the gradient of such a focal-point approach requires only 4.5\% of the computation time of a conventional CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ gradient and only 0.4\% of the time of a CCSD(T)/cc-pVQZ gradient.},

  abstract = {Multisite phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating switch-like protein activity and has been used widely in mathematical models. With the development of new experimental techniques and more molecular data, molecular phosphorylation processes emerge in many systems with increasing complexity and sizes. These developments call for simple yet valid stochastic models to describe various multisite phosphorylation processes, especially in large and complex biochemical networks. To reduce model complexity, this work aims at simplifying the multisite phosphorylation mechanism by a stochastic Hill function model. Furthermore, this work optimizes regions of parameter space to match simulation results from the stochastic Hill function with the distributive multisite phosphorylation process. While traditional parameter optimization methods have been focusing on finding the best parameter vector, in most circumstances, modelers would like to find a set of parameter vectors that generate similar system dynamics and results. This paper proposes a general α – β – γ rule to return an acceptable parameter region of the stochastic Hill function based on a quasi-Newton stochastic optimization algorithm. Different objective functions are investigated characterizing different features of the simulation-based empirical data, among which the approximate maximum log-likelihood method is recommended for general applications. Numerical results demonstrate that with an appropriate parameter vector value, the stochastic Hill function model depicts the multisite phosphorylation process well except the initial (transient) period.},

  abstract = {The Coupled Cluster (CC) method is used to compute the electronic correlation energy in atoms and molecules and often leads to highly accurate results. However, due to its single-reference nature, standard CC in its projected form fails to describe quantum states characterized by strong electronic correlations and multi-reference projective methods become necessary. On the other hand, quantum algorithms for the solution of many-electron problems have also emerged recently. The quantum unitary variant of CC (UCC) with singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) is a popular wavefunction Ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. The variational nature of this approach can lead to significant advantages compared to its classical equivalent in the projected form, in particular, for the description of strong electronic correlation. However, due to the large number of gate operations required in q-UCCSD, approximations need to be introduced in order to make this approach implementable in a state-of-the-art quantum computer. In this work, we evaluate several variants of the standard q-UCCSD Ansatz in which only a subset of excitations is included. In particular, we investigate the singlet and pair q-UCCD approaches combined with orbital optimization. We show that these approaches can capture the dissociation/distortion profiles of challenging systems, such as H 4 , H 2 O, and N 2 molecules, as well as the one-dimensional periodic Fermi–Hubbard chain. These results promote the future use of q-UCC methods for the solution of challenging electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {Effective forces derived from experimental or in silico molecular dynamics time traces are critical in developing reduced and computationally efficient descriptions of otherwise complex dynamical problems. This helps motivate why it is important to develop methods to efficiently learn effective forces from time series data. A number of methods already exist to do this when data are plentiful but otherwise fail for sparse datasets or datasets where some regions of phase space are undersampled. In addition, any method developed to learn effective forces from time series data should be minimally a priori committal as to the shape of the effective force profile, exploit every data point without reducing data quality through any form of binning or pre-processing, and provide full credible intervals (error bars) about the prediction for the entirety of the effective force curve. Here, we propose a generalization of the Gaussian process, a key tool in Bayesian nonparametric inference and machine learning, which meets all of the above criteria in learning effective forces for the first time.},

  abstract = {Accurate calculation of electric field gradients (EFGs) in molecular crystals, despite big advances in ab initio techniques, is still a challenge. Here, we present a new approach to calculate the EFGs in molecular crystals by employing the many-body expansion (MBE) technique with electrostatic embedding. This allows for (i) a reduction in the computational cost or an alternative increase in the level of theory (we use the MP2/6-311++G) and (ii) the ability to monitor EFG convergence by progressively adding more surrounding molecules and/or adding higher many-body interactions. We focus on the 14 N EFG and study four (model) compounds in more detail: solid nitrogen, ethylamine, methylamine, and ammonia. Solid nitrogen is rather insensitive to neighbors; for ethylamine and methylamine, the 3-body interactions are found sufficient for a converged EFG, whereas for ammonia, even the inclusion of 5-body interactions is insufficient although convergence is anticipated. We then validate our technique by comparing the experimental and ab initio 14 N EFGs for 116 organic compounds utilizing their known crystal structures and published EFG. Overall, we find a very good agreement, with a small EFG rms error, which is probably due to other sources, rather than the MBE approximation.},

  abstract = {The properties of molecules and materials containing light nuclei are affected by their quantum mechanical nature. Accurate modeling of these quantum nuclear effects requires computationally demanding path integral techniques. Considerable success has been achieved in reducing the cost of such simulations by using generalized Langevin dynamics to induce frequency-dependent fluctuations. Path integral generalized Langevin equation methods, however, have this far been limited to the study of static, thermodynamic properties due to the large perturbation to the system’s dynamics induced by the aggressive thermostatting. Here, we introduce a post-processing scheme, based on analytical estimates of the dynamical perturbation induced by the generalized Langevin dynamics, which makes it possible to recover meaningful time correlation properties from a thermostatted trajectory. We show that this approach yields spectroscopic observables for model and realistic systems that have an accuracy comparable to much more demanding approximate quantum dynamics techniques based on full path integral simulations.},

Apart from taking benzene to be rigid, the methodology for the nine-dimensional (9D) vibrational quantum calculations introduced in this study is fully coupled. The approach yields the intramolecular vibrational fundamentals and the bend ( ν 2 ) overtone of H 2 O and HDO in the complex, together with the low-lying intermolecular vibrational states in each of the intramolecular vibrational manifolds considered. Following the recently introduced general procedure [P. M. Felker and Z. Bačić, J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 024305 (2019)], the full 9D vibrational Hamiltonian of the dimer is divided into a 6D intermolecular Hamiltonian, a 3D intramolecular Hamiltonian, and a 9D remainder term. A 9D contracted product basis is constructed from the low-energy eigenstates of the two reduced-dimension Hamiltonians, and the full vibrational dimer Hamiltonian is diagonalized in it. The symmetry present in the dimers is exploited to reduce the Hamiltonian matrix to a block diagonal form. Guided by the findings of our earlier study referenced above, the 6D intermolecular contracted bases for each symmetry block include only 40 eigenstates with energies up to about 225 cm −1 , far below the stretch and bend fundamentals of H 2 O and HDO, which range between 1400 cm −1 and 3800 cm −1 . As a result, the matrices representing the symmetry blocks of the 9D Hamiltonian are small for the high-dimensional quantum problem, 1360 and 1680 for the H 2 O and HDO complexes, respectively, allowing for direct diagonalization. These calculations characterize in detail the H 2 O/HDO intramolecular vibrations, their frequency shifts, and couplings to the large-amplitude-motion intermolecular vibrational sates. The computed IR spectra of the two complexes in the OH-stretch region, as well as the intermolecular Raman spectra, are compared to the experimental spectra in the literature.},

  abstract = {abinit is probably the first electronic-structure package to have been released under an open-source license about 20 years ago. It implements density functional theory, density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), many-body perturbation theory ( GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter equation), and more specific or advanced formalisms, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and the “temperature-dependent effective potential” approach for anharmonic effects. Relying on planewaves for the representation of wavefunctions, density, and other space-dependent quantities, with pseudopotentials or projector-augmented waves (PAWs), it is well suited for the study of periodic materials, although nanostructures and molecules can be treated with the supercell technique. The present article starts with a brief description of the project, a summary of the theories upon which abinit relies, and a list of the associated capabilities. It then focuses on selected capabilities that might not be present in the majority of electronic structure packages either among planewave codes or, in general, treatment of strongly correlated materials using DMFT; materials under finite electric fields; properties at nuclei (electric field gradient, Mössbauer shifts, and orbital magnetization); positron annihilation; Raman intensities and electro-optic effect; and DFPT calculations of response to strain perturbation (elastic constants and piezoelectricity), spatial dispersion (flexoelectricity), electronic mobility, temperature dependence of the gap, and spin-magnetic-field perturbation. The abinit DFPT implementation is very general, including systems with van der Waals interaction or with noncollinear magnetism. Community projects are also described: generation of pseudopotential and PAW datasets, high-throughput calculations (databases of phonon band structure, second-harmonic generation, and GW computations of bandgaps), and the library libpaw . abinit has strong links with many other software projects that are briefly mentioned.},

These quantities are nonzero only for noncentrosymmetric systems, but different length scales of the noncentrosymmetry give rise to second harmonic or sum frequency radiation with different spatial and coherence characteristics. This perspective discusses the possible contributions to the second-order signal from films of small semiconductor quantum dots and addresses whether such experiments are expected to selectively enhance transitions to surface defects or trap states in such systems. It points out how “surface” and “bulk” contributions to the sum frequency or the second harmonic signal should be distinguishable through their angular dependence in a scattering geometry. It also explores possible mechanisms whereby second order spectroscopies might provide access to surface states that are very weak or absent in other forms of optical spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {The degradation of fibrils under the influence of thermal fluctuations was studied experimentally by various groups around the world. In the first set of experiments, it was shown that the decay of fibril content, which can be measured by the ThT fluorescence assay, obeys a bi-exponential function. In the second series of experiments, it was demonstrated that when the monomers separated from the aggregate are not recyclable, the time dependence of the number of monomers belonging to the dominant cluster is described by a single-exponential function if the fraction of bound chains becomes less than a certain threshold. Note that the time dependence of the fraction of bound chains can be measured by tryptophan fluorescence. To understand these interesting experimental results, we developed a phenomenological theory and performed molecular simulation. According to our theory and simulations using the lattice and all-atom models, the time dependence of bound chains is described by a logistic function, which slowly decreases at short time scales but becomes a single exponential function at large time scales. The results, obtained by using lattice and all-atom simulations, ascertained that the time dependence of the fibril content can be described by a bi-exponential function that decays faster than the logistic function on short time scales. We have uncovered the molecular mechanism for the distinction between the logistic and bi-exponential behavior. Since the dissociation of the chain from the fibrils requires the breaking of a greater number of inter-chain contacts as compared to the breaking of the beta sheet structure, the decrease in the number of connected chains is slower than the fibril content. Therefore, the time dependence of the aggregate size is logistic, while the two-exponential behavior is preserved for the content of fibrils. Our results are in agreement with the results obtained in both sets of experiments.},

The first part of the work focuses on polymer average properties, such as the average polymer spatial size as a function of the total tree mass and the typical length of the average path length on the polymer backbone. In the second part, we move beyond average chain behavior and we discuss the complete distribution functions for tree paths and tree spatial distances, which are shown to obey the classical Redner–des Cloizeaux functional form. Our results were rationalized first by the systematic comparison to a Flory theory for branching polymers and next by generalized Fisher–Pincus relationships between scaling exponents of distribution functions. For completeness, the properties of θ-polymers were compared to their ideal (i.e., no volume interactions) as well as good-solvent (i.e., above the θ-point) counterparts.

The CG results on the density of PET in melt and glassy states, chain dimension, local packing, and structure factor are in good agreement with experiment. We have established a link between the glass transition temperature and the local movements including conformational transitions and mean-square displacements of chain segments. Temperature transferabilities of the three proposed models were studied by comparing CG results on the static and thermodynamic properties of a polymer with atomistic and experimental findings. One of the three CG models has a good degree of transferability, following all inter- and intra-structural rearrangements of the atomistic model, over a broad range of temperature. Furthermore, as a distinct point of strength of CG, over atomistic, simulations, we have examined the dynamics of PET long chains, consisting of 100 repeat units, over a regime where entanglements dominate the dynamics. Performing long-time (550 ns) CG simulations, we have noticed the signature of a crossover from Rouse to reptation dynamics. However, a clear separation between the Rouse and the reptation dynamics needs much longer time simulations, confirming the experimental findings that the crossover to full reptation dynamics is very protracted.},

  abstract = {Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy have been employed to probe the molecular structure of N , N -dimethylformamide (DMF) and water mixture by varying the concentration of DMF. From the bulk studies, we observed a gradual decrease in the intensity with a continuous blue shift in the OH-stretch region with the increase in the DMF concentration. In contrast, no significant blue shift in the OH-stretch region is noticed from the SFG spectra collected from the air–aqueous binary mixture interface as a function of DMF concentration. However, the impact of DMF is found to be disruptive in nature toward the existing hydrogen bonding network of the pristine water at the interfacial region. Interestingly, in the CH-stretch region, the vibrational signatures of the DMF molecule show blue shifts, as proposed in earlier studies. We have calculated the molecular tilt angle of the methyl group of the DMF molecule as a function of DMF concentration. For the case of neat DMF, the observed tilt angle is ∼17.7° with respect to the surface normal. The value of tilt angle decreases with the decrease in DMF concentration and reaches a value of ∼1.7° for a mole fraction of 0.5, and it further increases with the decrease in DMF concentration. It achieves a value of ∼20° for the dilute DMF mole fraction of 0.05 in the binary mixture. This indicates that DMF molecules at the air–binary mixture interface are placing their methyl groups more toward the normal for the intermediate DMF concentrations.},

We combine simulation and theory to quantify these fluctuations and how they vary with distance from the electrode surface. We observe that the potential distribution narrows significantly for species within a few electrolyte screening lengths of the electrode. We attribute this narrowing to the effects of image charge fluctuations originating from the polarization response of the electrode. We show that the physical consequences of these image charge effects can be captured in the context of a simple analytical field theory with anti-symmetric boundary conditions. We contextualize these results by discussing their implications for rates of Marcus-like outer-sphere interfacial electron transfer.},

The film exhibits a novel structure composed of one close-packed layer of octahedrally coordinated Fe 2+ sandwiched between two close-packed layers of tetrahedrally coordinated Fe 3+ and an overall stoichiometry of Fe 3 O 4 . As the structure is distinct from bulk iron oxide phases and the coupling with the silver substrate is weak, we propose that the phase should be classified as a metastable two-dimensional oxide. The chemical and physical properties are potentially interesting, thanks to the predicted charge ordering between atomic layers, and analogy with bulk ferrite spinels suggests the possibility of synthesis of a whole class of two-dimensional ternary oxides with varying electronic, optical, and chemical properties.},

The two atomic oxygen pre-covered Cu(100) surfaces include an O-(2 2 × 2 ⁠ )R45° Cu(100) surface and an oxygen modified Cu(100) surface with a local O-c(2 × 2) structure. The results show that the O-(2 2 × 2 ⁠ )R45° Cu(100) surface is inert to the formic acid adsorption at 300 K. After exposing to formic acid at 300 K, bidentate formate formed on the clean Cu(100) and local O-c(2 × 2) area of the oxygen modified Cu(100) surface. However, their adsorption geometries are different, being vertical to the surface plane on the former surface and inclined with respect to the surface normal with an ordered structure on the latter surface. The temperature programmed desorption spectra indicate that the formate species adsorbed on the clean Cu(100) surface decomposes into H 2 and CO 2 when the sample temperature is higher than 390 K. Differently, the proton from scission of the C–H bond of formate reacts with the surface oxygen, forming H 2 O on the oxygen modified Cu(100) surface. The CO 2 signal starts increasing at about 370 K, which is lower than that on clean Cu(100), indicating that the surface oxygen affiliates formate decomposition. Combining all these results, we conclude that the surface oxygen plays a crucial role in formic acid adsorption and formate decomposition.},

  abstract = {Computations, which would have been intractable just a few years ago, are now possible on desktop workstations. Such is the case for the application of the Self-Consistent-Phonon (SCP) approximation to large monolayer clusters on structured surfaces, combining a SCP approach to the system dynamics with a random walk approach to finding the optimum positions of the adsorbed atoms. This combination of techniques enables the investigation of the stability, structure, and dynamics of incommensurate adsorbed monolayers at low temperatures. We refer to this approach as the Direct-Space–Self-Consistent-Phonon framework. We present the application of this framework to the study of rare-gas and molecular hydrogen adsorbates on the graphite basal-plane surface and (for xenon) the Pt(111) surface. The largest cluster size consists of 4096 particles, a system that is large enough to examine incommensurate phases without significant adverse boundary effects. The existence of “pseudo-gaps” in the phonon spectrum of nearly commensurate monolayers is demonstrated, and the implication of such “pseudo-gaps” for the determination of the location of any commensurate ↔ incommensurate phase transition is explored. The stability of striped incommensurate structures vs hexagonal incommensurate structures is examined. The inherent difficulties of using this approach for the highly quantum monolayer solids is shown to generate some particular problems. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that this approach to the stability, structure, and dynamics of quantum monolayer solids is a very useful tool in the theorist’s arsenal. By implication, this approach should also be useful in the study of adsorption on graphene and carbon nanotubes at low temperatures.},

Charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed for dyads showing strong electronic coupling between the donor and the acceptor (coupling matrix elements V DA , 0.06 eV–0.18 eV). Depending on the coupling magnitude, the CT state of the dyads can be either dark or emissive. Equilibrium between the 1 LE (locally excited) state and the 1 CT state was confirmed by temperature-dependent fluorescence studies. Efficient ISC was observed for the dyads with Cz connected at the meso -position of the BDP. Interestingly, the dyad with non-orthogonal geometry shows the highest ISC efficiency ( Φ Δ = 58\%), which is different from the previous conclusion. The photo-induced charge separation (CS, time constant: 0.7 ps) and charge recombination (CR, ∼3.9 ns) were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy indicated that the BDP-localized triplet state was exceptionally long-lived (602 µ s). Using pulsed laser excited time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the SOCT-ISC mechanism was confirmed, and we show that the electron spin polarization of the triplet state is highly dependent on the mutual orientation of the donor and acceptor. The dyads were used as triplet photosensitizers for triplet–triplet-annihilation (TTA) upconversion, and the quantum yield is up to 6.7\%. TTA-based delayed fluorescence was observed for the dyads ( τ DF = 41.5 µ s). The dyads were also used as potent photodynamic therapy reagents (light toxicity of IC 50 = 0.1 µ M and dark toxicity of IC 50 = 70.8 µ M).},

  abstract = {The acetonyl radical ( • CH 2 COCH 3 ) is relevant to atmospheric and combustion chemistry due to its prevalence in many important reaction mechanisms. One such reaction mechanism is the decomposition of Criegee intermediates in the atmosphere that can produce acetonyl radical and OH. In order to understand the fate of the acetonyl radical in these environments and to create more accurate kinetics models, we have examined the reaction system of the acetonyl radical with O 2 using highly reliable theoretical methods. Structures were optimized using coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] with an atomic natural orbital (ANO0) basis set. Energetics were computed to chemical accuracy using the focal point approach involving perturbative treatment of quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)] and basis sets as large as cc-pV5Z. The addition of O 2 to the acetonyl radical produces the acetonylperoxy radical, and multireference computations on this reaction suggest it to be barrierless. No submerged pathways were found for the unimolecular isomerization of the acetonylperoxy radical. Besides dissociation to reactants, the lowest energy pathway available for the acetonylperoxy radical is a 1-5 H shift from the methyl group to the peroxy group through a transition state that is 3.3 kcal mol −1 higher in energy than acetonyl radical + O 2 . The ultimate products from this pathway are the enol tautomer of the acetonyl radical along with O 2 . Multiple pathways that lead to OH formation are considered; however, all of these pathways are predicted to be energetically inaccessible, except at high temperatures.},

The Fe NWs are about 100 nm in width and a few micrometers in length with a preferential growth direction of [100], while the Co NWs have a higher aspect-ratio with preferential crystal growth along the [110] direction. It is noted that compact passivation surface layers of oxides protect these NWs from further oxidation, even after nearly two years of exposure to ambient conditions; furthermore, these NWs display homogeneous ferromagnetism along their axial direction revealing the domination of shape anisotropy on magnetic behavior. Importantly, the average value of magnetic induction strengths of Fe NWs (2.07 {±} 0.10 T) and Co NWs (1.83 {±} 0.15 T) is measured to be very close to the respective theoretical value, and it shows that the surface oxide layers do not affect the magnetic moments in NWs. Our results provide a useful synthesis approach for the fabrication of single-crystalline, defect-free metal NWs and give insight into the micromagnetic properties in ferromagnetic NWs based on the transmission electron microscopy measurements.},

Here, we report on an all optical measurement technique for the detection of triplet exciton quenching at semiconductor interfaces, a necessary requirement for triplet exciton or charge transfer. The method relies on the growth of individual, single-crystal islands of the singlet fission material on the silicon surface. The islands have different heights, and we correlate these heights to the quenching efficiency of triplet excitons. The quenching efficiency is measured by spatially resolved delayed fluorescence and compared to a diffusion–quenching model. Using silicon capped with a blocking thermal oxide and aromatic monolayers, we demonstrate that this technique can quickly screen different silicon surface treatments for triplet exciton quenching.},

A few basis sets are tested with the PP and DKH, and for each one, the analytical potential energy surface (PES) is constructed. It is shown that the difference between PESs determined with PP and DKH methods is small, if the orbitals of the 4 d subshell in Xe are correlated. We select the most appropriate approach for the calculation of the potential energy surface of BXe, with respect to accuracy and computational cost. The optimal level of theory includes a small Dunning’s basis set for the benzene monomer and a larger PP basis set for Xe supplemented by midbond functions. The PES obtained using such an approach provides a reasonable accuracy when compared to the empirical one derived from the microwave spectra of BXe. The empirical and the theoretical values of intermolecular vibrational energies agree within 0.5 cm −1 up to second overtones. The vibrational energy level pattern of BXe is characterized by a distinct polyad structure.},

  abstract = {All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bio-macromolecules can yield relatively accurate results while suffering from the limitation of insufficient conformational sampling. On the other hand, the coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations efficiently accelerate conformational changes in biomolecules but lose atomistic details and accuracy. Here, we propose a novel multiscale simulation method called the adaptively driving multiscale simulation (ADMS)—it efficiently accelerates biomolecular dynamics by adaptively driving virtual CG atoms on the fly while maintaining the atomistic details and focusing on important conformations of the original system with irrelevant conformations rarely sampled. Herein, the “adaptive driving” is based on the short-time-averaging response of the system (i.e., an approximate free energy surface of the original system), without requiring the construction of the CG force field. We apply the ADMS to two peptides (deca-alanine and Ace-GGPGGG-Nme) and one small protein (HP35) as illustrations. The simulations show that the ADMS not only efficiently captures important conformational states of biomolecules and drives fast interstate transitions but also yields, although it might be in part, reliable protein folding pathways. Remarkably, a ∼100-ns explicit-solvent ADMS trajectory of HP35 with three CG atoms realizes folding and unfolding repeatedly and captures the important states comparable to those from a 398- µ s standard all-atom MD simulation.},

We compute both RPIs for a series of model two-state systems coupled to a single nuclear mode with electronic coupling values chosen to describe dynamics in both adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes. We show that the MF-RPIs for symmetric systems are in good agreement with the previous literature, and we show that our numerical techniques are robust for systems with non-zero driving force. The nuclear MF-RPI and the nuclear MV-RPI are similar, but the MV-RPI uniquely reports on the changes in the electronic state populations along the instanton path. In both cases, we analytically demonstrate the existence of a zero-mode, and we numerically find that these solutions are true instantons with a single unstable mode as expected for a first order saddle point. Finally, we use the MF-RPI to accurately calculate rate constants for adiabatic and nonadiabatic model systems with the coupling strength varying over three orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The Complete-Active Space Second-order Perturbation Theory (CASPT2) has been one of the most widely-used methods for reliably calculating electronic structures of multireference systems. Because of its lowest level treatment of dynamic correlation, it has a high computational feasibility; however, its accuracy in some cases falls short of needs. Here, as a simple yet higher-order alternative, we introduce a hybrid theory of the CASPT2 and a multireference variant of the Coupled-Electron Pair Approximation (CEPA), which is a class of high level correlation theory. A central feature of our theory (CEPT2) is to use the two underlying theories for describing different divisions of correlation components based on the full internal contraction framework. The external components, which usually give a major contribution to the dynamic correlation, are intensively described using the CEPA Ansatz , while the rests are treated at the CASPT2 level. Furthermore, to drastically reduce the computational demands, we have incorporated the pair-natural orbital (PNO) method into our multireference implementations. This development, thus, requires highly complex derivations and coding, while it has been largely facilitated with an automatic expression and code generation technique. To highlight the accuracy of the CEPT2 approach and to assess the errors caused by the PNO truncation, benchmark calculations are shown on small- to medium-size molecules, illustrating the high accuracy of the present CEPT2 model. By tightening the truncation thresholds, the PNO-CEPT2 energy converges toward the canonical counterpart and is more accurate than that of PNO-CASPT2 as long as the same truncation thresholds are used.},

We demonstrate, however, that diabatic wavefunctions and potentials can be reliably calculated at the DFT/MRCI level of theory using a propagative variant of the block diagonalization diabatization method (P-BDD). The proposed procedure is validated via the calculation of diabatic potentials for LiH and the simulation of the vibronic spectrum of pyrazine.

The charge-response kernel is used to describe solvent polarizability, and four different coupling schemes are assessed. The most feasible behavior scheme among them is the one that incorporates responses not only to solute polarization but also to solute-induced solvent polarization. The numerical results indicated that solvent molecules near the polar solute show significant polarization, and therefore, the model proposed here is useful for considering the solvation process and thermodynamics of polar solute molecules.},

The recorded V L 2,3 -edge XAS and XMCD spectra are richly featured in both V L 3 and L 2 spectral regions. In an effort to predict and interpret the nature of the experimentally observed spectral features, a first-principles approach for the simultaneous prediction of XAS and XMCD spectra in the framework of wavefunction based ab initio methods is presented. The theory used here has previously been formulated for predicting optical absorption and MCD spectra. In the present context, it is applied to the prediction of the V L 2,3 -edge XAS and XMCD spectra of the V IV O(acac) 2 and V III (acac) 3 complexes. In this approach, the spin-free Hamiltonian is computed on the basis of the complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) in conjunction with second order N -electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT2) as well as the density functional theory (DFT)/restricted open configuration interaction with singles configuration state functions based on a ground state Kohn-Sham determinant (ROCIS/DFT). Quasi-degenerate perturbation theory is then used to treat the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) operator variationally at the many particle level. The XAS and XMCD transitions are computed between the relativistic many particle states, considering their respective Boltzmann populations. These states are obtained from the diagonalization of the SOC operator along with the spin and orbital Zeeman operators. Upon averaging over all possible magnetic field orientations, the XAS and XMCD spectra of randomly oriented samples are obtained. This approach does not rely on the validity of low-order perturbation theory and provides simultaneous access to the calculation of XMCD A, B, and C terms. The ability of the method to predict the XMCD C-term signs and provide access to the XMCD intensity mechanism is demonstrated on the basis of a generalized state coupling mechanism based on the type of the excitations dominating the relativistically corrected states. In the second step, the performance of CASCI, CASCI/NEVPT2, and ROCIS/DFT is evaluated. The very good agreement between theory and experiment has allowed us to unravel the complicated XMCD C-term mechanism on the basis of the SOC interaction between the various multiplets with spin S ′ = S , S ± 1. In the last step, it is shown that the commonly used spin and orbital sum rules are inadequate in interpreting the intensity mechanism of the XAS and XMCD spectra of the V IV O(acac) 2 and V III (acac) 3 complexes as they breakdown when they are employed to predict their magneto-optical properties. This conclusion is expected to hold more generally.},

Theory Comput. 14 , 3547 (2018)], we introduced a preliminary version of our GOCAT (globally optimal catalyst) concept in which electrostatic catalysts are designed for arbitrary reactions by global optimization of distributed point charges that surround the reaction. In this first version, a pre-defined reaction path was kept fixed. This unrealistic assumption allowed for only small catalytic effects. In the present work, we extend our GOCAT framework by a sophisticated and robust on-the-fly reaction path optimization, plus further concomitant algorithm adaptions. This allows smaller and larger excursions from a pre-defined reaction path under the influence of the GOCAT point-charge surrounding, all the way to drastic mechanistic changes. In contrast to the restricted first GOCAT version, this new version is able to address real-life catalysis. We demonstrate this by applying it to the electrostatic catalysis of a prototypical Diels–Alder reaction. Without using any prior information, this procedure re-discovers theoretically and experimentally established features of electrostatic catalysis of this very reaction, including a field-dependent transition from the synchronous, concerted textbook mechanism to a zwitterionic two-step mechanism, and diastereomeric discrimination by suitable electric field components.},

In this work, we construct, analyze, and evaluate different computational protocols to determine the impact of the multi-reference character of transition metal compounds on their bond dissociation energies using a set of reference data for 60 diatomic molecules. We find that the fractional orbital density approach allows to determine two global indicators on a physically sound basis. These can subsequently be used to classify the assessed set of molecules with high accuracy into categories of systems for which their multi-reference character matters substantially for their bond dissociation energies and for which it does not. A comparison with earlier suggested thresholds for classification of molecular systems due to their multi-reference character suggests that our approaches yield substantially better performance.},

This work provides a summary of the underlying theory and discusses the details of its implementation based on Gaussian orbitals, including resolution-of-identity techniques and different approaches to the frequency integration of the self-energy or acceleration by offloading compute-intensive matrix operations using graphics processing units in a hybrid OpenMP/Cuda scheme. A distinctive feature of VOTCA–XTP is the capability to couple the calculation of electronic excitations to a classical polarizable environment on an atomistic level in a coupled quantum- and molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) scheme, where a complex morphology can be imported from Molecular Dynamics simulations. The capabilities and limitations of the GW –BSE implementation are illustrated with two examples. First, we study the dependence of optically active electron–hole excitations in a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based oligomers on molecular-architecture modifications and the number of repeat units. Second, we use the GW –BSE/MM setup to investigate the effect of polarization on localized and intermolecular charge-transfer excited states in morphologies of low-donor content rubrene–fullerene mixtures. These showcases demonstrate that our implementation currently allows us to treat systems with up to 2500 basis functions on regular shared-memory workstations, providing accurate descriptions of quasiparticle and coupled electron–hole excited states of various characters on an equal footing.},

  abstract = {Light-to-heat conversion in plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) inside polymeric membranes is beneficial for improving the efficiency of membrane distillation for seawater desalination. However, the physical mechanisms ruling photothermal membrane distillation are unclear yet. Here, we model the plasmonic photothermal light-to-heat conversion from Ag, Au, and Cu nanofillers in polymeric membranes for membrane distillation. Photothermal effects in the cases of isolated metallic NPs and their assembly are investigated considering size effects and excitation sources. The increasing content of metallic NPs improves the efficiency of the light-to-heat conversion. For a polymeric membrane, filled with 25\% Ag NPs, our model well reproduces the experimental temperature increase of 10 K. Specifically, we find that Ag NPs with a radius of around 30–40 nm are favorite candidates for membrane heating with excitation energy in the visible/near-UV range. The incorporation of a term associated with heat losses into the heat transfer equation well reproduces the cooling effect associated with vaporization at the membrane surface. Compared to Ag NPs, Au and Cu NPs show a broadened absorption cross section and their resonance has a nonlinear behavior with varying the excitation energy, better matching with sunlight radiation spectrum.},

  abstract = {A fractional Fokker–Planck equation based on the continuous time random walk Ansatz is written via the Langevin equations for the dynamics of a dipole interacting with its surroundings, as represented by a cage of dipolar molecules. This equation is solved in the frequency domain using matrix continued fractions, thus yielding the linear dielectric response for extensive ranges of damping, dipole moment ratio, and cage–dipole inertia ratio, and hence the complex susceptibility. The latter comprises a low frequency band with width depending on the anomalous parameter and a far infrared (THz) band with a comb-like structure of peaks. Several physical consequences of the model relevant to anomalous diffusion in the presence of interactions are discussed. The entire calculation may be regarded as an extension of the cage model interpretation of the dynamics of polar molecules to anomalous diffusion, taking into account inertial effects.},

  abstract = {Major biological polymerization processes achieve remarkable accuracy while operating out of thermodynamic equilibrium by utilizing the mechanism known as kinetic proofreading. Here, we study the interplay of the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of proofreading by exploring the dissipation and catalytic rate, respectively, under the realistic constraint of fixed chemical potential difference. Theoretical analyses reveal no-monotonic variations of the catalytic rate and total entropy production rate (EPR), the latter quantifying the dissipation, at steady state. Applying this finding to a tRNA selection network in protein synthesis, we observe that the network tends to maximize both the EPR and catalytic rate, but not the accuracy. Simultaneously, the system tries to minimize the ratio of the EPRs due to the proofreading steps and the catalytic steps. Therefore, dissipation plays a guiding role in the optimization of the catalytic rate in the tRNA selection network of protein synthesis.},

For M &gt; 2, it is known that phase separation occurs with a true critical point.

  abstract = {Nanoshell quantum dots (QDs) represent a novel class of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), which supports tunable optoelectronic properties over the extended range of particle sizes. Traditionally, the ability to control the bandgap of colloidal semiconductor NCs is limited to small-size nanostructures, where photoinduced charges are confined by Coulomb interactions. A notorious drawback of such a restricted size range concerns the fact that assemblies of smaller nanoparticles tend to exhibit a greater density of interfacial and surface defects. This presents a potential problem for device applications of semiconductor NCs where the charge transport across nanoparticle films is important, as in the case of solar cells, field-effect transistors, and photoelectrochemical devices. The morphology of nanoshell QDs addresses this issue by enabling the quantum-confinement in the shell layer, where two-dimensional excitons can exist, regardless of the total particle size. Such a geometry exhibits one of the lowest surface-to-volume ratios among existing QD architectures and, therefore, could potentially lead to improved charge-transport and multi-exciton characteristics. The expected benefits of the nanoshell architecture were recently demonstrated by a number of reports on the CdS bulk /CdSe nanoshell model system, showing an improved photoconductivity of solids and increased lifetime of multi-exciton populations. Along these lines, this perspective will summarize the recent work on CdS bulk /CdSe nanoshell colloids and discuss the possibility of employing other nanoshell semiconductor combinations in light-harvesting and lasing applications.},

  abstract = {This perspective addresses the development of polymer field theory for predicting the equilibrium phase behavior of block polymer melts. The approach is tailored to the high-molecular-weight limit, where universality reduces all systems to the standard Gaussian chain model, an incompressible melt of elastic threads interacting by contact forces. Using mathematical identities, this particle-based version of the model is converted to an equivalent field-based version that depends on fields rather than particle coordinates. The statistical mechanics of the field-based model is typically solved using the saddle-point approximation of self-consistent field theory (SCFT), which equates to mean field theory, but it can also be evaluated using field theoretic simulations (FTS). While SCFT has matured into one of the most successful theories in soft condensed matter, FTS are still in its infancy. The two main obstacles of FTS are the high computational cost and the occurrence of an ultraviolet divergence, but fortunately there has been recent groundbreaking progress on both fronts. As such, FTS are now well poised to become the method of choice for predicting fluctuation corrections to mean field theory.},

  abstract = {We study the spinodal decomposition in a symmetric, binary homopolymer blend using our recently developed dynamical self-consistent field theory. By taking the extremal solution of a dynamical functional integral, the theory reduces the interacting, multi-chain dynamics to a Smoluchowski equation describing the statistical dynamics of a single, unentangled chain in a self-consistent, time-dependent, mean force-field. We numerically solve this equation by evaluating averages over a large ensemble of replica chains, each one of which obeys single-chain Langevin dynamics, subject to the mean field. Following a quench from the disordered state, an early time spinodal instability in the blend composition develops, before even one Rouse time elapses. The dominant, unstable, growing wavelength is on the order of the coil size. The blend then enters a late-time, t , scaling regime with a growing domain size that follows the expected Lifshitz–Slyozov–Wagner t 1/3 power law, a characteristic of a diffusion-driven coarsening process. These results provide a satisfying test of this new method, which correctly captures both the early and late time physics in the blend. Our simulation spans five orders-of-magnitude in time as the domains coarsen to 20 times the coil size, while remaining faithful to the dynamics of the microscopic chain model.},

In contrast, the increase in the degree of wrapping becomes discontinuous for larger nanoparticles and exhibits a clear hysteresis when upward and downward annealing scans with respect to adhesion strength are performed. The gap in the degree of wrapping increases with the increase in the diameter of nanoparticles. These results are in qualitative agreement with the mean field prediction that large nanoparticles are either unbound or completely wrapped by tensionless lipid membranes.},

In the present work, a theoretical study is performed to show the nonlinear responsive behavior, which includes the stretching induced structural transitions. It demonstrates that the structural transition of the bilayer membrane takes place during the stretching process of the mechanical probe. A vertical cylindrical micelle can be obtained by stretching the membrane under deep compression conditions, and the cylindrical micelle can grow continuously along the axial direction. Moreover, under shallow compression conditions, the probe pulls a spherical micelle from the membrane, and then, the membrane returns to flatness. A comprehensive study is performed to show the mechanism of the responsive behaviors of the structural transition during the compression and stretching processes. When the probe acts on the B-rich layer, it is more likely to pull out a regular micelle. However, when the probe acts on the bottom A-rich layer, complex vesicles are more likely to be pulled out from the bilayer membrane. This study provides a comprehensive diagram of the mechanical responsive behavior of the membrane, which would be a guide for an experiment of biomembranes and the design of new self-assembled structures.},

Examples include nucleic acids and colloidal particles in the bulk solution and under confinement, and biological liquid–liquid phase separation. This observation is at odds with the intuitive expectation of an interparticle repulsion that decays monotonically with distance. Although attraction between like-charged particles can be rationalized theoretically in the strong-coupling regime, e.g., in the presence of multivalent counterions, recurring accounts of long-range attraction in aqueous solution containing monovalent ions at low ionic strength have posed an open conundrum. Here, we show that the behavior of molecular water at an interface—traditionally disregarded in the continuum electrostatics picture—provides a mechanism to explain the attraction between like-charged objects in a broad spectrum of experiments. This basic principle will have important ramifications in the ongoing quest to better understand intermolecular interactions in solution.},

The free energies of the reaction steps indicate that for specific combinations of catalysts, the limitations due to the linear scaling relationship can be overcome, leading to smaller overpotentials for the overall OER. At the same time, a detailed analysis of the results reveals a strong dependence on the adopted functional. For both functionals, it is shown that the energy level of the highest occupied electronic state can serve as a descriptor to guide the search for the optimal catalyst acting as a hydrogen acceptor.

In this work, the harvested signal is maximized by composing a hybrid system consisting of a nonlinear crystal with a dense coverage of plasmonic nanostructures separated by narrow gaps. The method of self-assembled diblock-copolymer-based micellar lithography with subsequent electroless deposition is employed to cover the whole surface of a lithium niobate (LiNbO 3 ) crystal. The interaction of plasmonic nanostructures with light leads to a strong electric near-field in the adjacent crystal. This near-field is harnessed to enhance the near-surface SHG signal from the nonlinear crystal. At the plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticles, a pronounced enhancement of about 60-fold SHG is observed compared to the bare crystal within the confocal volume of a laser spot.},

Here, we report on the investigation of the electronic structure of MX in colloidal CdSe QDs using time-resolved photoluminescence, state-resolved pump–probe, and two-dimensional spectroscopies. The use of varying excitation energy and intensities enables the observation of many signals from biexcitons and triexcitons.

  abstract = {Shearing of a solidified polycrystalline lubricant film confined between two solid surfaces has been studied by molecular dynamics simulations. In the case of a perfect commensurate contact, we observe interlayer slips within the film and shear-induced order-to-disorder transition of lubricant molecules around grain boundaries. This process is accompanied by the nucleation, propagation, and annihilation of dislocations in the solidified film, resulting in repeated dilation and collapse of the lubricant film during the stick–slip motion. In the case of an incommensurate contact, only slips at the lubricant–solid interface happen and no dilation of the lubricant film is observed during the stick–slip friction. These observations are consistent with recent surface force balance experimental measurements. In combination with our recent work [R. G. Xu and Y. S. Leng, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 115 , 6560 (2018)], this study provides a renewed picture on the physical property of nanoconfined lubricant films in boundary lubrication.},

  abstract = {Metallic nanogap dimers are extremely useful for enhancing surface-enhanced Raman scattering and various nonlinear optical effects employing near-field enhancement effects induced by the localized surface plasmon resonance. However, the metallic nanogap dimers exhibit an intense light scattering due to the strong dipole–dipole interaction between two metallic nanostructures and, therefore, are not necessarily a structural design that exhibits the highest near-field enhancement due to the radiation loss. Here, we propose further enhancement of the near-field on metallic nanogap dimers using quasi-dark plasmon modes. By coupling with gold (Au) nanorods having the same plasmon resonant wavelength, but completely different sizes, a quasi-dark plasmon mode, which reduces the radiation loss slightly, is induced, resulting in the elongation of the plasmon dephasing time. As a result, the signal of surface-enhanced Raman scattering of crystal violet molecules adsorbed on the Au nanogap dimer is enhanced up to about three times as compared to that measured using the Au nanogap dimer without the Au nanorods. Scattering spectrum measurements as well as electromagnetic simulations were performed to clarify the mechanism for further enhancement of the near-field. The proposed coupled plasmonic system is expected to be advantageous, especially in enhancing nonlinear optical effects using plasmonic enhancement effects.},

  abstract = {Ionic polarization and dielectric function play a fundamental role in the optoelectronic properties of hybrid perovskites, currently one of the most studied materials for next generation photovoltaics. The hybrid nature of the crystal, with molecular dipoles that can reorient within the inorganic lattice, gives rise to a complex dielectric response in the bulk material that has been largely studied and debated. Here, we investigate the nature and the relaxation properties of the dielectric polarization of hybrid perovskites at finite temperature by means of classical molecular dynamics. We provide evidence that a simple ionic model of classical interatomic forces is able to explain qualitatively the temperature and frequency dependence of the dielectric constant providing a picture that is fully consistent with experimental data. The constant dielectric function in the low-temperature phase is controlled by ionic displacements, while the temperature-dependent paraelectric behavior of the tetragonal phase is due to reorientation of dipoles that are responsible for the discontinuity at the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition. In the frequency domain, the molecular reorientations give rise to a broad band that is located in the 0.1 THz timescale at room temperature and that shifts down to the GHz timescale when cooling the system toward the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition. The relation between relaxation time and maximum absorption frequency is also clarified.},

The combination of these methods allows probing the dynamics of vacancy generation and its relation to chemical interactions at the CeO 2 /SiO 2 /Si interface. The results suggest that irradiation causes amorphization of some portion of CeO 2 at the CeO 2 /SiO 2 /Si interface and creates oxygen vacancies due to the formation of Ce 2 O 3 at room temperature. The subsequent ultra-high-vacuum annealing of irradiated films increases the concentration of Ce 2 O 3 with the simultaneous growth of the SiO 2 layer. Interactions with CO molecules result in an additional reduction of cerium and promote the transition of Ce 2 O 3 to a silicate compound. Thermal annealing of thin films exposed to oxygen or carbon monoxide shows that the silicate phase is highly stabile even at 450 °C.},

  abstract = {Organic–inorganic perovskites are one of the most promising photovoltaic materials for the design of next generation solar cells. The lead-based perovskite prepared with methylammonium and iodide was the first in demonstrating high power conversion efficiency, and it remains one of the most used materials today. However, perovskites prepared by mixing several halides and several cations systematically yield higher efficiencies than “pure” methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI 3 ) devices. In this work, we unravel the excited-state properties of a mixed-halide (iodide and bromide) and mixed-cation (methylammonium and formamidinium) perovskite. Combining time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and optical-pump–terahertz-probe experiments with density functional theory calculations, we show that the population of higher-lying excited states in the mixed material increases the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers upon well above-bandgap excitation. We suggest that alloying different halides and different cations reduces the structural symmetry of the perovskite, which partly releases the selection rules to populate the higher-energy states upon light absorption. Our investigation thus shows that mixed halide perovskites should be considered as an electronically different material than MAPbI 3 , paving the way toward further materials optimization and improved power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.},

We present adsorption energies and vibrational wavenumbers and conclude in assigning the observed infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy bands. CO 2 prefers to adsorb molecularly on the Fe tet1 terminated Fe 3 O 4 (111) surface, a finding consistent with observation. Calculations compared with the experiment lead to interpreting results in favor of the Fe tet1 (single metal) terminated Fe 3 O 4 (111) surface as the regular surface termination. Formation of carbonate and bicarbonate requires metal impurities on that surface. Such impurities exist, for instance, on the Fe oct2 (double metal) termination, which can thus be used as a model for “metal-rich terminations” of more complex surfaces.},

  abstract = {Liquid-phase exfoliation, the use of a sheared liquid to delaminate graphite into few-layer graphene, is a promising technique for the large-scale production of graphene. However, the microscale and nanoscale fluid-structure processes controlling the exfoliation are not fully understood. Here, we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a defect-free graphite nanoplatelet suspended in a shear flow and measure the critical shear rate γ ̇ c needed for the exfoliation to occur. We compare γ ̇ c for different solvents, including water and N-methyl-pyrrolidone, and nanoplatelets of different lengths. Using a theoretical model based on a balance between the work done by viscous shearing forces and the change in interfacial energies upon layer sliding, we are able to predict the critical shear rates γ ̇ c measured in simulations. We find that an accurate prediction of the exfoliation of short graphite nanoplatelets is possible only if both hydrodynamic slip and the fluid forces on the graphene edges are considered and if an accurate value of the solid–liquid surface energy is used. The commonly used “geometric-mean” approximation for the solid–liquid energy leads to grossly incorrect predictions.},

In contrast, the LiTFSA/GN mixtures of a wide range of compositions were found to be glass-forming liquids at room temperature. Raman spectroscopy of LiTFSA/GN liquid mixtures revealed that increasing the LiTFSA concentration results in the formation of the solvent-bridged network structure Li + –GN–Li + . In addition, the considerable formation of contact ion pairs and ionic aggregates was observed in highly concentrated electrolytes. In the liquids, the Li + ion dynamically exchanged ligands (GN and TFSA) and higher LiTFSA concentrations led to an increase in the ratio of the self-diffusion coefficients of Li + and TFSA − , D Li / D TFSA , as determined by pulsed field gradient NMR spectroscopy. The Li + transference number ( ⁠ t L i + ⁠ ) of the [LiTFSA]/[GN] = 1/1.5 electrolyte in an electrochemical cell under anion-blocking conditions was estimated to be as high as 0.74. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements revealed that the reductive stability of the LiTFSA/GN electrolyte increases with increasing LiTFSA concentration. A [LiTFSA]/[GN] = 1/1.5 electrolyte is stable against the Li metal electrode, provided that the polarization is relatively small. Owing to high t L i + ⁠ , a Li–S battery with the [LiTFSA]/[GN] = 1/1.5 electrolyte showed a high rate discharge capability despite its low ionic conductivity (0.21 mS cm −1 ) at room temperature.},

This implies that the hydrocarbons are dispersively adsorbed to a naphthalene “face.” Calculations using the dispersion-corrected density functional theory methods B97-D3 and B3LYP-D3 indeed predict that the stable structures have face geometries. The B97-D3 calculated D 0 ( S 0 ) values are within 1 kJ/mol of the experiment, while B3LYP-D3 predicts D 0 values that are 1.4–3.3 kJ/mol larger. Although adamantane has been recommended as a “dispersion-energy donor,” the binding energies of the trans - and cis -decalin adducts to 1NpOH are 30\% larger than that of adamantane.

  abstract = {The pure rotational spectrum of pyrimidine ( m -C 4 H 4 N 2 ), the meta -substituted dinitrogen analog of benzene, has been studied in the millimeter-wave region from 235 GHz to 360 GHz. The rotational spectrum of the ground vibrational state has been assigned and fit to yield accurate rotational and distortion constants. Over 1700 distinct transitions were identified for the normal isotopologue in its ground vibrational state and least-squares fit to a partial sextic S-reduced Hamiltonian. Transitions for all four singly substituted 13 C and 15 N isotopologues were observed at natural abundance and were likewise fit. Deuterium-enriched samples of pyrimidine were synthesized, giving access to all eleven possible deuterium-substituted isotopologues, ten of which were previously unreported. Experimental values of rotational constants and computed values of vibration–rotation interaction constants and electron-mass corrections were used to determine semi-experimental equilibrium structures ( r e SE ) of pyrimidine. The r e SE structure obtained using coupled-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] corrections shows exceptional agreement with the r e structure computed at the CCSD(T)/cc-pCV5Z level (≤0.0002 Å in bond distance and ≤0.03° in bond angle). Of the various computational methods examined, CCSD(T)/cc-pCV5Z is the only method for which the computed value of each geometric parameter lies within the statistical experimental uncertainty (2σ) of the corresponding semi-experimental coordinate. The exceptionally high accuracy and precision of the structure determination is a consequence of the large number of isotopologues measured, the precision and extent of the experimental frequency measurements, and the sophisticated theoretical treatment of the effects of vibration–rotation coupling and electron mass. Taken together, these demanding experimental and computational studies establish the capabilities of modern structural analysis for a prototypical monocyclic aromatic compound.},

  abstract = {The vacuum ultraviolet photoionization of the methyl peroxy radical, CH 3 O 2 , and unimolecular dissociation of internal energy selected CH 3 O 2 + cations were investigated in the 9.7–12.0 eV energy range by synchrotron-based double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence. A microwave discharge flow tube was employed to produce CH 3 O 2 via the reaction of methyl radicals (CH 3 ) with oxygen gas. After identifying and separating the different sources of CH 3 + from photoionization of CH 3 or dissociative photoionization of CH 3 O 2 , the high resolution slow photoelectron spectrum (SPES) of CH 3 O 2 was obtained, exhibiting two broad bands superimposed with a complex vibrational structure. The first band of the SPES is attributed to the X 3 A″ and a 1 A′ overlapped electronic states of CH 3 O 2 + and the second is assigned to the b 1 A′ electronic state with the help of theoretical calculations. The adiabatic ionization energy of CH 3 O 2 is derived as 10.215 ± 0.015 eV, in good agreement with high-accuracy theoretical data from the literature. The vertical ionization energy of the b 1 A′ electronic state is measured to be 11.5 eV and this state fully dissociates into CH 3 + and O 2 fragments. The 0 K adiabatic appearance energy (AE 0K ) of the CH 3 + fragment ion is determined to be 11.15 ± 0.02 eV.},

We generalize the widely used spherical well model for the nanoparticle wavefunctions to flat d-bands using the envelope function technique. Using Fermi’s golden rule, we calculate the generation rates of hot carriers after the decay of the plasmon due to transitions either from a d-band state to an sp-band state or from an sp-band state to another sp-band state. We apply this formalism to spherical silver nanoparticles with radii up to 20 nm and also study the dependence of hot carrier rates on the energy of the d-bands. We find that for nanoparticles with a radius less than 2.5 nm, sp-band state to sp-band state transitions dominate hot carrier production, while d-band state to sp-band state transitions give the largest contribution for larger nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {For a quantum system in a time-dependent perturbation, we prove that the variance in the energy depends entirely on the nonadiabatic transition probability amplitudes b k (t). Landau and Lifshitz introduced the nonadiabatic coefficients for the excited states of a perturbed quantum system by integrating by parts in Dirac’s expressions for the coefficients c k (1) (t) of the excited states to first order in the perturbation. This separates c k (1) (t) for each state into an adiabatic term a k (1) (t) and a nonadiabatic term b k (1) (t). The adiabatic term follows the adiabatic theorem of Born and Fock; it reflects the adjustment of the initial state to the perturbation without transitions. If the response to a time-dependent perturbation is entirely adiabatic, the variance in the energy is zero. The nonadiabatic term b k (1) (t) represents actual excitations away from the initial state. As a key result of the current work, we derive the variance in the energy of the quantum system and all of the higher moments of the energy distribution using the values of |b k (t)| 2 for each of the excited states along with the energy differences between the excited states and the ground state. We prove that the same variance (through second order) is obtained in terms of Dirac’s excited-state coefficients c k (t). We show that the results from a standard statistical analysis of the variance are consistent with the quantum results if the probability of excitation P k is set equal to |b k (t)| 2 , but not if the probability of excitation is set equal to |c k (t)| 2 . We illustrate the differences between the variances calculated with the two different forms of P k for vibration–rotation transitions of HCl in the gas phase.},

Non-adiabaticity is modeled by using geometry-dependent effective nuclear masses together with only one single potential energy surface. In conclusion, for rovibrational states below 20 000 cm −1 , QED and relativistic effects do nearly compensate, and a potential energy surface based on Born–Oppenheimer energies and diagonal adiabatic corrections has nearly the same quality as the one including relativity with QED; the deviations between the two approaches for individual rovibrational states are mostly below 0.02 cm −1 . The inclusion of non-adiabatic effects is important, and it reduces deviations from experiments mostly below 0.1 cm −1 .},

Here, we collate and present a variety of results pertaining to kinetic network models in a unified framework. The aim is to lay out explicit links between several important quantities commonly studied in the field, including mean first passage times (MFPTs), correlation functions, and the Kemeny constant. We provide new insights into (i) a simple physical interpretation of the Kemeny constant, (ii) a relationship to infer equilibrium distributions and rate matrices from measurements of MFPTs, and (iii) a protocol to reduce the dimensionality of kinetic networks based on specific requirements that the MFPTs in the coarse-grained system should satisfy. We prove that this protocol coincides with the one proposed by Hummer and Szabo [J. Phys. Chem. B 119 , 9029 (2014)], and it leads to a variational principle for the Kemeny constant. Finally, we introduce a modification of this protocol, which preserves the Kemeny constant. Our work underpinning the theoretical aspects of kinetic networks will be useful in applications including milestoning and path sampling algorithms in molecular simulations.},

Auxiliary dynamics via GDFs mitigates the exponential growth of variance as a function of bias in Monte Carlo estimators of large deviation functions. The variance minimization technique exploits the exact properties of eigenstates of the tilted operator that defines the biased dynamics in the nonequilibrium system. We demonstrate our techniques in two classes of problems. In the continuum, we show that GDFs can be optimized to study the interacting driven diffusive systems where the efficiency is systematically improved by incorporating higher correlations into the GDF. On the lattice, we use a correlator product state ansatz to study the 1D weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process. We show that with modest resources, we can capture the features of the susceptibility in large systems that mark the phase transition from uniform transport to a traveling wave state.

Experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra of carbazole in the gas phase were first well reproduced by performing an un-damped Franck–Condon simulation, but a one-set scaling damped Franck–Condon simulation severely underestimated the intensities of the peaks of experimental absorption and fluorescence spectra of carbazole in n -hexane. Then, a multi-set scaling damped Franck–Condon simulation was proposed and carried out for simulating the extremely solvent-enhanced absorbance and fluorescence, and here, the simulated spectra agreed well with the experimental ones. Five (four) representative solvent-enhanced normal modes corresponding to the combination of ring stretching and ring breathing vibrational motions were determined to be responsible for enhanced absorbance (fluorescence) in n -hexane solution. Furthermore, different scalings were applied to the ground and first-excited states, resulting in different enhancement of absorbance and fluorescence, and this analysis revealed atoms in the carbazole interacting with n -hexane solvent molecules and, hence, leading to different normal-mode vibrational vector patterns in the ground and first-excited states, respectively. Basically, the same conclusion was drawn from a simulation with HF-CIS and the three functionals (TD)B3LYP, (TD)B3LYP-35, and (TD)BHandHLYP. The present multi-set scaling damped Franck–Condon simulation scheme was demonstrated to successfully interpret extremely solvent-enhanced absorbance and fluorescence of carbazole in n -hexane-solvent.},

Solid state properties such as the partial density of states were calculated in order to elucidate the detailed adsorption mechanisms and back-bonding peculiar to the CO/Cu(111) system. In addition, our benchmark analysis of the correlations among the orbitals of CO and Cu metal using LC-DFT reasonably was in line with the experimentally observed adsorption site. The computation time was reasonable, and other numerical results were found to agree well with the experimental results and also with the theoretical results of other researchers.

This paper presents a semiclassical molecular dynamics method able to reproduce the vibrational energy levels of systems composed by molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces. Specifically, we extend our divide-and-conquer semiclassical method for power spectra calculations to gas-surface systems and interface it with plane-wave electronic structure codes. The Born–Oppenheimer classical dynamics underlying the semiclassical calculation is full dimensional, and our method includes not only the motion of the adsorbate but also those of the surface and the bulk. The vibrational spectroscopic peaks related to the adsorbate are accounted together with the most coupled phonon modes to obtain spectra amenable to physical interpretations. We apply the method to the adsorption of CO, NO, and H 2 O on the anatase-TiO 2 (101) surface. We compare our semiclassical results with the single-point harmonic estimates and the classical power spectra obtained from the same trajectory employed in the semiclassical calculation. We find that CO and NO anharmonic effects of fundamental vibrations are similarly reproduced by the classical and semiclassical dynamics and that H 2 O adsorption is fully and properly described in its overtone and combination band relevant components only by the semiclassical approach.},

Chem. Phys. 147 , 054103 (2017)] can be integrated using low-rank approximations of the inverse Jacobian kernel. This kernel determines the metric tensor in the harmonic oscillator extension of the Lagrangian that drives the evolution of the electronic degrees of freedom. The proposed kernel approximation is derived from a pseudoinverse of a low-rank estimate of the Jacobian, which is expressed in terms of a generalized set of directional derivatives with directions that are given from a Krylov subspace approximation. The approach allows a tunable and adaptive approximation that can take advantage of efficient preconditioning techniques. The proposed kernel approximation for the integration of the electronic equations of motion makes it possible to apply extended Lagrangian first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to a broader range of problems, including reactive chemical systems with numerically sensitive and unsteady charge solutions. This can be achieved without requiring exact full calculations of the inverse Jacobian kernel in each time step or relying on iterative non-linear self-consistent field optimization of the electronic ground state prior to the force evaluations as in regular direct Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics. The low-rank approximation of the Jacobian is directly related to Broyden’s class of quasi-Newton algorithms and Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov methods and provides a complementary formulation for the solution of nonlinear systems of equations.},

  abstract = {Convergence with respect to imaginary-time discretization (i.e., the number of ring-polymer beads) is an essential part of any path-integral-based molecular dynamics (MD) calculation. However, an unfortunate property of existing non-preconditioned numerical integration schemes for path-integral molecular dynamics—including essentially all existing ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and thermostatted RPMD (T-RPMD) methods—is that for a given MD time step, the overlap between the exact ring-polymer Boltzmann–Gibbs distribution and that sampled using MD becomes zero in the infinite-bead limit. This has clear implications for hybrid Metropolis Monte Carlo/MD sampling schemes, and it also causes the divergence with bead number of the primitive path-integral kinetic-energy expectation value when using standard RPMD or T-RPMD. We show that these and other problems can be avoided through the introduction of “dimension-free” numerical integration schemes for which the sampled ring-polymer position distribution has non-zero overlap with the exact distribution in the infinite-bead limit for the case of a harmonic potential. Most notably, we introduce the BCOCB integration scheme, which achieves dimension freedom via a particular symmetric splitting of the integration time step and a novel implementation of the Cayley modification [R. Korol et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 124103 (2019)] for the free ring-polymer half-steps. More generally, we show that dimension freedom can be achieved via mollification of the forces from the external physical potential. The dimension-free path-integral numerical integration schemes introduced here yield finite error bounds for a given MD time step, even as the number of beads is taken to infinity; these conclusions are proven for the case of a harmonic potential and borne out numerically for anharmonic systems that include liquid water. The numerical results for BCOCB are particularly striking, allowing for nearly three-fold increases in the stable time step for liquid water with respect to the Bussi–Parrinello (OBABO) and Leimkuhler (BAOAB) integrators, while introducing negligible errors in the calculated statistical properties and absorption spectrum. Importantly, the dimension-free, non-preconditioned integration schemes introduced here preserve ergodicity and global second-order accuracy, and they remain simple, black-box methods that avoid additional computational costs, tunable parameters, or system-specific implementations.},

Previously, we found that, in the simplest possible description, it is not sufficient to just renormalize the rate constants of chemical kinetics, but one must introduce direct transitions between the bound states in the kinetic scheme. The physical reason for this is that a molecule that just dissociated from one site can directly rebind to the other rather than diffuse away into the bulk. Such a simple description is not valid in two dimensions because reactants can never diffuse away into the bulk. In this work, we consider a variety of more sophisticated implementations of our recent general theory that are valid in both two and three dimensions. We compare the predicted time dependence of the concentrations for a wide range of parameters and establish the range of validity of various levels of the general theory.},

  abstract = {The photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (PEC-CO2RR) is a promising artificial photosynthetic system for storing solar energy as the energy of chemical bonds and stabilizing the atmospheric CO 2 level. An applicable PEC-CO2RR is expected to have broad light absorption, high selectivity to a single product, and high solar to fuel efficiency. However, the PEC-CO2RR still faces challenges from complex reaction pathways, obstructed mass transfer, and large photovoltage requirements. The goal of this perspective is to point out some of the limitations of PEC-CO2RR to a practical application. In brief, we discuss the basic concepts of PEC-CO2RR and summarize state-of-the-art progress. Moreover, we highlight the remaining challenges to both science and engineering and propose the key steps in developing a fully functional PEC-CO2RR system. Finally, an ideal PEC-CO2RR system is proposed for future studies, which is essentially wireless and combines the advantages of minimized polarization loss and broad light absorption.},

Here, we report molecular dynamics simulations of aggregation of A β (16–22) peptides at air–water interfaces. First, 100 randomly distributed A β (16–22) peptides moved to the interface. The high concentration of peptides then accelerated their aggregation and formation of antiparallel β -sheets. Two layers of oligomers were observed near the interface. In the first layer from the interface, the oligomer with less β -bridges exposed the hydrophobic residues to the air. The second layer consisted of oligomers with more β -bridges that protruded into water. They are more soluble in water because the hydrophobic residues are covered by N- and C-terminal hydrophilic residues that are aligned well along the oligomer edge. These results indicate that amyloid protofibril formation mainly occurs in the second layer.},

  abstract = {The inclusion of nanoparticles (NPs) into solvated polymer brushes (PBs) provides a path for designing novel nanocomposites and a multifunctional surface for wide applications. Despite intensive study over the years, the correlation between the structural properties of NPs (or PBs) and the NP–PB interactions is still to be well unveiled. Here, we present molecular dynamics simulations with the umbrella sampling method to systematically investigate the interaction between NPs and PBs, via calculating the free energy cost ( U ins , associated with the inclusion of NPs into PBs) as a function of a series of factors, such as brush grafting density ( ρ g ), grafted polymer chain architecture, NPs’ size, NPs’ surface properties, and NPs’ shape and surface structure, as well as the solvent quality. Our results show that at a fixed NP size, the inclusion free energy approximately scales with the osmotic pressure (Π) of PBs under good solvent conditions [ U i n s ∼ Π ( ρ g ) ∼ ρ g 3 / 2 ], regardless of the NPs’ shape and surface properties. Once the radius of the NP ( R NP ) is varied, a scaling law, U i n s ∼ R N P 3 ⁠ , can be obtained for NPs deeply inserted in swollen PBs with a high grafting density. While for shallow inclusions, a surface tension correction of the form ∼ R N P 2 plays a role. Further studies reveal that Θ and poor solvents will weaken the osmotic pressure effects of PBs and reversely enhance the surface tension effects due to the increased NP–brush repulsion. Our simulation results verify previous theoretical perspectives that the U ins can be approximated by the sum of the volume and surface contributions from the osmotic pressure Π and surface tension γ ( ⁠ U i n s ∼ Π R N P 3 + γ R N P 2 ⁠ ). Our work not only helps us to understand the applicability of previous theories on the NP–PB system but also reveals the key factors that impact the NP–PB interaction in a series of probable conditions, which may provide valuable guidelines for designing and engineering novel nanomaterials based on functional NPs and PBs.},

  abstract = {Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) can be cheaper alternatives than proton exchange membranes, but a key challenge for AEMs is to archive good ionic conductivity while maintaining mechanical strength. Diblock copolymers containing a mechanically strong hydrophobic block and an ion-conducting hydrophilic block have been shown to be viable solutions to this challenge. Using our recently developed reactive hydroxide model, we investigate the effects of block size on the hydroxide solvation and transport in a diblock copolymer (PPO-b-PVBTMA) in its highly hydrated state. Typically, both hydroxide and water diffusion constants decrease as the hydrophobic PPO block size increases. However, phase separation takes place above a certain mole ratio of hydrophobic PPO to hydrophilic PVBTMA blocks and we found it to effectively recover the diffusion constants. Extensive analyses reveal that morphological changes modulate the local environment for hydroxide and water transport and contribute to that recovery. The activation energy barriers for hydroxide and water diffusion show abrupt jumps at the same block ratios when such recovery effects begin to appear, suggesting transformation of the structure of water channels. Taking the advantages of partial phase separation can help optimize both ionic conductivity and mechanical strength of fuel cell membranes.},

  abstract = {Microemulsions are explored using the self-consistent field approach. We consider a balanced model that features two solvents of similar size and a symmetric surfactant. Interaction parameter χ and surfactant concentration φ s b complement the model definition. The phase diagram in χ – φ s b coordinates is known to feature two lines of critical points, the Scott and Leibler lines. Only upon imposing a finite distance between the interfaces, we observe that the Scott line meets the Leibler line. We refer to this as a Lifshitz point (LP) for real systems. We add regions that are relevant for microemulsions to this phase diagram by considering the saturation line, which connects ( χ , φ s b ⁠ )-points for which the interface becomes tensionless. Crossing this line implies a first-order phase transition as internal interfaces develop, characteristic for one-phase microemulsions. The saturation line ends at the so-called microemulsion point (MP). The MP is shown to connect with the LP by a line of MP-like critical points, found by searching for a “MP” while the distance between interfaces is fixed. A pair of binodal lines that envelop the three-phase (Winsor III) microemulsion region is shown to connect to the MP. The cohesiveness of the middle phase in Winsor III is related to non-monotonic, inverse DLVO-type interaction curves between the surfactant-loaded tensionless interfaces. The mean and Gaussian bending modulus, relevant for the shape fluctuations and the topology of interfaces, respectively, are evaluated along the saturation line. Near the MP, both rigidities are positive and vanish in a power-law fashion with coefficient unity at the MP. Overseeing these results proves that the MP has a pivoting role in the physics of microemulsions.},

  abstract = {Geometric confinement of a polymer chain results in a loss of conformational entropy. For a chain that can fold into a compact native state via a first-order-like transition, as is the case for many small proteins, confinement typically provides an entropic stabilization of the folded state, thereby shifting the location of the transition. This allows for the possibility of confinement (entropy) driven folding. Here, we investigate such confinement effects for a flexible square-well-sphere N -mer chain (monomer diameter σ ) confined within a long cylindrical pore (diameter D ) or a closed cylindrical box (height H = D ). We carry out Wang–Landau simulations to construct the density of states, which provides access to the complete thermodynamics of the system. For a wide pore, an entropic stabilization of the folded state is observed. However, as the pore diameter approaches the size of the folded chain ( D ∼ N 1/3 σ ), we find a destabilization effect. For pore diameters smaller than the native ground-state, the chain folds into a different, higher energy, ground state ensemble and the T vs D phase diagram displays non-monotonic behavior as the system is forced into different ground states for different ranges of D . In this regime, isothermal reduction of the confinement dimension can induce folding, unfolding, or crystallite restructuring. For the cylindrical box, we find a monotonic stabilization effect with decreasing D . Scaling laws for the confinement free energy in the athermal limit are also investigated.},

Surface analysis results on the cycled LiCoO 2 cathodes and cycled graphite anodes extracted from the cells provide evidence that a LiFSI-induced improvement of high-voltage cycling stability at low temperature originates from the formation of a less resistive solid electrolyte interphase layer, which contains plenty of LiFSI-derived organic compounds mixed with inorganics that passivate and protect the surface of the cathode and anode from further electrolyte decomposition and promotes Li + ion-transport kinetics despite the low temperature, inhibiting Li metal-plating at the anode.

The line tension for Lennard–Jones fluids is found to follow a generic behavior with temperature and chemical potential effects that are all included in a simple contact angle parameterization. Former discrepancies between theoretical modeling and molecular simulation are resolved, and the line tension concept is shown to be robust down to molecular confinements. The same qualitative behavior is observed for water, but the line tension at the wetting transition diverges or converges toward a finite value depending on the range of solid/fluid interactions at play.},

Rigorous numerical calculations demonstrating second and third harmonic generation by the triangular hole arrays are performed. It is shown that both the Coulomb interaction of conduction electrons and the convective term contribute on equal footing to the nonlinear response of metal. It is demonstrated that the energy conversion efficiency in the second harmonic process is the highest when the system is pumped at the localized surface plasmon resonance. When molecular emitters are placed on a surface of the hole array line shapes, the second harmonic signal exhibits three peaks corresponding to second harmonics of the localized surface plasmon mode and upper and lower polaritonic states.},

Here, i = 1–3 is the layer number, and Z and φ are the dipole coordinate and orientation angle, respectively. It was found that the long-range asymptotics W i ( Z → ∞ , φ ) in both covers ( i = 1, 3) are reached unexpectedly far from the interlayer ( i = 2). Another specific feature of the solution consists in that the interference of the fields created by polarization charges emerging at both interfaces leads to the appearance of a constant contribution inside the interlayer with a non-standard dependence on the dipole orientation angle φ . It was shown that by changing the dielectric constants of the structure components, one can realize two peculiar regimes of the W i ( Z , φ ) behavior in the covers; namely, there arises either a potential barrier preventing adsorption or a well far from the interface, both being of a totally electrostatic origin, i.e., without involving the Pauli exchange repulsion, which is taken into account in the conventional theories of physical adsorption. The results obtained provide a fresh insight into the physics of adsorption in physical electronics, chemical physics, and electrochemistry.},

  abstract = {Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is an important material with wide industrial applications particularly for its good conductivity in oxygen anion transportation. The conductivity is known to be sensitive to Y concentration: 8 mol.\% YSZ (8YSZ) achieves the best performance, which, however, degrades remarkably under ∼1000 °C working conditions. Here, using the recently developed SSW-NN method, stochastic surface walking global optimization based on global neural network potential (G-NN), we establish the first ternary Y–Zr–O G-NN potential by fitting 28 803 first principles dataset screened from more than 10 7 global potential energy surface (PES) data and explore exhaustively the global PES of YSZ at different Y concentrations. Rich information on the thermodynamics and the anion diffusion kinetics of YSZ is, thus, gleaned, which helps resolve the long-standing puzzles on the stability and conductivity of the 8YSZ. We demonstrate that (i) 8YSZ is the cubic phase YSZ with the lowest possible Y concentrations. It is thermodynamically unstable, tending to segregate into the monoclinic phase of 6.7YSZ and the cubic phase of 20YSZ. (ii) The O anion diffusion in YSZ is mediated by O vacancy sites and moves along the ⟨100⟩ direction. In 8YSZ and 10YSZ, despite different Y concentrations, their anion diffusion barriers are similar, ∼ 1 eV, but in 8YSZ, the O diffusion distance is much longer due to the lack of O vacancy aggregation along the ⟨112⟩ direction. Our results illustrate the power of G-NN potential in solving challenging problems in material science, especially those requiring a deep knowledge on the complex PES.},

These catalyst stability descriptors can be efficiently predicted by density functional theory (DFT)-based models. The alloy stability model, for example, predicts the stability of metal atoms in nanoparticles with site-by-site resolution. Herein, we use physical insights to present accelerated approaches of parameterizing this recently introduced alloy-stability model. These accelerated approaches meld quadratic functions for the energy of metal atoms in terms of the coordination number with linear correlations between model parameters and the cohesive energies of bulk metals. By interpolating across both the coordination number and chemical space, these accelerated approaches shrink the training set size for 12 fcc p- and d-block metals from 204 to as few as 24 DFT calculated total energies without sacrificing the accuracy of our model. We validate the accelerated approaches by predicting adsorption energies of metal atoms on extended surfaces and 147 atom cuboctahedral nanoparticles with mean absolute errors of 0.10 eV and 0.24 eV, respectively. This efficiency boost will enable a rapid and exhaustive exploration of the vast material space of transition metal alloys for catalytic applications.},

  abstract = {Strain-engineering of bimetallic nanomaterials is an important design strategy for developing new catalysts. Herein, we introduce an approach for including strain effects into a recently introduced, density functional theory (DFT)-based alloy stability model. The model predicts adsorption site stabilities in nanoparticles and connects these site stabilities with catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Strain-based dependencies will increase the model’s accuracy for nanoparticles affected by finite-size effects. In addition to the stability of small nanoparticles, strain also influences the heat of adsorption of epitaxially grown metal-on-metal adlayers. In this respect, we successfully benchmark the strain-including alloy stability model with previous experimentally determined trends in the heats of adsorption of Au and Cu adlayers on Pt (111). For these systems, our model predicts stronger bimetallic interactions in the first monolayer than monometallic interactions in the second monolayer. We explicitly quantify the interplay between destabilizing strain effects and the energy gained by forming new metal–metal bonds. While tensile strain in the first Cu monolayer significantly destabilizes the adsorption strength, compressive strain in the first Au monolayer has a minimal impact on the heat of adsorption. Hence, this study introduces and, by comparison with previous experiments, validates an efficient DFT-based approach for strain-engineering the stability, and, in turn, the catalytic performance, of active sites in bimetallic alloys with atomic level resolution.},

Structure is studied via the pair-distribution function and dynamics via the velocity autocorrelation function and the phonon density of states. These quantities are evaluated along isotherms, isochores, and three isomorphs in both crystal phases. Isomorphs are traced out by integrating the density-temperature relation characterizing configurational adiabats, starting from state points in the middle of the fcc-bcc coexistence region. Good isomorph invariance of structure and dynamics is seen in both crystal phases, which is notable in view of the large density variations studied. This is consistent with the fact that the virial potential-energy correlation coefficient is close to unity in the entire fcc phase and in most of the bcc phase (basically below the re-entrant density). Our findings confirm that the isomorph theory, developed and primarily studied for liquids, applies equally well for solids.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ortho-terphenyl using an all-atom model with the optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS) force field were performed both in the high temperature Arrhenian region and at lower temperatures that include the onset of the super-Arrhenian region. From the MD simulations, the internal energy of both the equilibrium liquid and crystal was determined from 300 K to 600 K and at pressures from 0.1 MPa to 1 GPa. The translational and rotational diffusivities were also determined at these temperatures and pressures for the equilibrium liquid. It is shown that within a small offset, the excess internal energy Ū x from the MD simulations is consistent with the experimentally determined excess internal energy reported earlier [Caruthers and Medvedev, Phys. Rev. Mater. 2 , 055604, (2018)]. The MD mobility data {including extremely long-time 1 atm simulations from the study by Eastwood et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 117 , 12898, (2013)]} were combined with experimental data to form a unified dataset, where it was shown that in both the high temperature Arrhenian region and the lower temperature super-Arrhenian region, the mobility is a linear function of 1 / Ū x ( T , p ) ⁠ , albeit with different proportionality constants. The transition between the Arrhenian and super-Arrhenian regions is relatively sharp at a critical internal energy Ū x α ⁠ . The 1 / Ū x ( T , p ) model is able to describe the mobility data over nearly 16 orders-of-magnitude. Other excess thermodynamic properties such as excess enthalpy and excess entropy (i.e., the Adam–Gibbs model) are unable to unify the pressure dependence of the mobility.},

It is found that the 72Fe–Cr–Ni alloys exhibit a positive sign of excess volume and the amount increases with increasing Cr concentration. Analysis of the structure factor and pair distribution function of the alloy family reveals that the short-range order in the melt becomes more pronounced with decreasing Cr concentration; this demonstrates a direct correlation between the excess volume and local liquid structure. A characteristic signature of the icosahedral structure is observed in the structure factor of the melts, and the potential origin of the positive excess volume of the 72Fe–Cr–Ni alloys is qualitatively discussed in relation to the icosahedral structure.},

  abstract = {Accurate calculation of the ion–ion recombination rate coefficient has been of long-standing interest as it controls the ion concentration in gas phase systems and in aerosols. We describe the development of a hybrid continuum-molecular dynamics (MD) approach to determine the ion–ion recombination rate coefficient. This approach is based on the limiting sphere method classically used for transition regime collision phenomena in aerosols. When ions are sufficiently far from one another, the ion–ion relative motion is described by diffusion equations, while within a critical distance, MD simulations are used to model ion–ion motion. MD simulations are parameterized using the Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement force-field as well as by considering partial charges on atoms. Ion–neutral gas collisions are modeled in two mutually exclusive cubic domains composed of 10 3 gas atoms each, which remain centered on the recombining ions throughout calculations. Example calculations are reported for NH 4 + recombination with NO 2 − in He, across a pressure range from 10 kPa to 10 000 kPa. Excellent agreement is found in comparison with calculations to literature values for the 100 kPa recombination rate coefficient (1.0 × 10 −12 m 3 s −1 ) in He. We also recover the experimentally observed increase in the recombination rate coefficient with pressure at sub-atmospheric pressures, and the observed decrease in the recombination rate coefficient in the high pressure continuum limit. We additionally find that non-dimensionalized forms of rate coefficients are consistent with recently developed equations for the dimensionless charged particle–ion collision rate coefficient based on Langevin dynamics simulations.},

Hence, valence and core excitations into the two antibonding molecular orbitals of the H 2 S molecule have been calculated within a multi-configurational wave function framework. Scanning along the S–H stretching coordinates, we derive potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moments involving the ground state and core and valence excited states. Both valence excitations and the S1 s −1 and S2 p −1 core excitations show pairs of dissociative and bound electronic states. These pairs of states are nearly degenerate in H 2 S at the ground state geometry. The close degeneracy together with conical intersections makes H 2 S an interesting target for x-ray spectroscopy involving ultra-fast dissociation influenced by non-adiabatic transitions and interference. For future investigations with x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), it is valuable to compare H 2 S with the water molecule, which exhibits state-selective gating to different vibrational modes [R. C. Couto et al. , Nat. Commun. 8 , 14165 (2017)] in its well-separated O1 s −1 core excited states. The dense manifolds of the S2 p −1 core excited states will complicate the analysis of K α edge RIXS, but dynamical effects could be evaluated through detuning and by comparing with L edge XAS. In L edge RIXS, the dynamical effects will be more pronounced due to the longer lifetime of the S2 p −1 core excited states compared to the S1 s −1 core excited states.},

  abstract = {Transition metal tetrahalides are a class of highly symmetric molecules for which very few spectroscopic data exist. Exploratory ab initio calculations of electronic potential energy functions indicate that the equilibrium molecular geometries of the vanadium, niobium, and tantalum tetrafluorides (i.e., VF 4 , NbF 4 , and TaF 4 ) exhibit strong distortions from the tetrahedral configuration in their electronic ground state ( 2 E ) and first excited state ( 2 T 2 ) along the nuclear displacement coordinates of e symmetry. The distortions result from the E × e and T 2 × e Jahn–Teller (JT) effects, respectively. In addition, there are weaker distortions in the 2 T 2 state along the coordinates of t 2 symmetry due to the T 2 × t 2 JT effect. The description of the large-amplitude dynamics induced by these JT effects requires the construction of JT Hamiltonians beyond the standard model of JT theory, which is based on Taylor expansions up to second order in normal-mode displacements. These higher-order JT Hamiltonians were constructed in this work by expansions of the electronic potentials of the title molecule in terms of symmetry invariant polynomials in symmetry-adapted nuclear displacement coordinates for the bending modes of VF 4 . A multi-configuration electronic structure method was employed to determine the coefficients of these high-order polynomial expansions from first principles. Using these large-amplitude Jahn–Teller Hamiltonians, the vibronic spectra of VF 4 were computed. The spectra illustrate the effects of large-amplitude fluxional nonadiabatic dynamics due to exceptionally strong E × e and T 2 × e JT couplings. In addition, the vibronic spectrum of the T 2 × ( e + t 2 ) JT effect, including the bending mode of t 2 symmetry, was computed. The spectrum displays strong inter-mode coupling effects exhibiting a vibronic structure, which is substantially different from that predicted by independent-mode approximation. These results represent the first ab initio study of dynamical Jahn–Teller effects in VF 4 .},

The atomic I( 2 P 3/2 ) or Br( 2 P 3/2 ) EP fragments were probed using ion time-of-flight velocity-map imaging. Definitive evidence for EP was observed only for the Ar⋯I 2 complex, and it occurs for all of the T-shaped intermolecular levels investigated, those with ν′ = 12–22, 24, and 25. The relative yields for EP in these levels measured as a function of ν′ are consistent with previously reported yields for the competing mechanism of vibrational predissociation. The anisotropies of the I + images collected for Ar⋯I 2 indicate that EP is occurring on timescales shorter than the rotational periods of the complex. The kinetic energy distributions of the departing I-atom fragments suggest that EP occurs from an asymmetric geometry rather than the rigid T-shaped geometry for many of the Ar⋯I 2 levels prepared. These findings indicate that intramolecular vibrational redistribution of these initially prepared T-shaped levels to excited levels bound within a lower-energy intermolecular potential occurs prior to EP.},

The experimental measurements provided an accurate ionization energy for UN (IE = 50 802 ± 5 cm −1 ). Spectra for UN + yielded ro-vibrational constants and established that the ground state has the electronic angular momentum projection Ω = 4. Ab initio calculations were carried out using the spin–orbit state interacting approach with the complete active space second-order perturbation theory method. A series of correlation consistent basis sets were used in conjunction with small-core relativistic pseudopotentials on U to extrapolate to the complete basis set limits. The results for UN correctly obtained an Ω = 3.5 ground state and demonstrated a high density of configurationally related excited states with closely similar ro-vibrational constants. Similar results were obtained for UN + , with reduced complexity owing to the smaller number of outer-shell electrons. The calculated IE for UN was in excellent agreement with the measured value. Improved values for the dissociation energies of UN and UN + , as well as their heats of formation, were obtained using the Feller–Peterson–Dixon composite thermochemistry method, including corrections up through coupled cluster singles, doubles, triples and quadruples. An analysis of the ab initio results from the perspective of the ligand field theory shows that the patterns of electronic states for both UN and UN + can be understood in terms of the underlying energy level structure of the atomic metal ion.},

  abstract = {The infrared (IR) action spectrum of the doubly substituted methyl-ethyl Criegee intermediate (MECI) is observed in the CH stretch overtone region with detection of OH products. The MECI exhibits four conformers, all of which undergo unimolecular decay via a 1,4 H-atom transfer mechanism, followed by the rapid release of OH products. Conformers with different orientations of the carbonyl oxide group with respect to the methyl and ethyl substituents (i.e., anti and syn ) decay via distinct transition state barriers (16.1 kcal mol −1 and 15.4 kcal mol −1 , respectively). The observed IR action spectrum is in good agreement with the predicted anharmonic IR absorption spectrum, but exhibits significant congestion, which is attributed to couplings between spectroscopic bright states and nearby dark states. Energy-dependent OH appearance rates are measured upon IR excitation of the strongest features in the IR action spectrum and are found to be on the order of 10 6 –10 7 s −1 . The experimental rates are in good agreement with computed Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus rates for the unimolecular decay of MECI at these energies, which incorporate quantum mechanical tunneling and sophisticated hindered rotor treatments, as well as high-level theoretical calculations of the TS barrier heights, rovibrational properties, and torsional barriers associated with the MECI conformers. Master equation modeling is used to predict thermal rates for the unimolecular decay of anti - and syn -MECI of 473 s −1 and 660 s −1 , respectively. Comparison with other previously studied Criegee intermediate systems provides insights into substituent effects on unimolecular decay under both energy-dependent and thermal conditions.},

  abstract = {Referencing schemes are commonly used in heterodyned spectroscopies to mitigate correlated baseline noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations of the local oscillator. Although successful, these methods rely on careful pixel-to-pixel matching between the two spectrographs. A recent scheme introduced by Feng et al . [Opt. Express 27 (15), 20323–20346 (2019)] employed a correlation matrix to allow free mapping between dissimilar spectrographs, leading to the first demonstration of floor noise limited detection on a multichannel array used in heterodyned spectroscopy. In addition to their primary results using a second reference spectrometer, Feng et al. briefly demonstrated the flexibility of their method by referencing to same-array pixels at the two spectral edges (i.e., edge-pixel referencing). We present a comprehensive study of this approach, which we term edge-pixel referencing, including optimization of the approach, assessment of the performance, and determination of the effects of background responses. We show that, within some limitations, the distortions due to background signals will not affect the 2D IR line shape or amplitude and can be mitigated by band narrowing of the pump beams. We also show that the performance of edge-pixel referencing is comparable to that of referencing to a second spectrometer in terms of noise suppression and that the line shapes and amplitudes of the spectral features are, within the measurement error, identical. Altogether, these results demonstrate that edge-pixel referencing is a powerful approach for noise suppression in heterodyned spectroscopies, which requires no new hardware and, so, can be implemented as a software solution for anyone performing heterodyned spectroscopy with multichannel array detectors already.},

Here, a new method is presented for sampling the initial quantum mechanical distribution that is required in the classical Wigner model. The new method is tested for the position, position-squared, momentum, and momentum-squared autocorrelation functions for a one-dimensional quartic oscillator and double well potential as well as a quartic oscillator coupled to harmonic baths of different sizes. Two versions of the new method are tested and shown to possibly be useful. Both versions always converge toward the classical Wigner limit. For the one-dimensional cases, some results that are essentially converged to the classical Wigner limit are acquired and others are not far off. For the multi-dimensional systems, the convergence is slower, but approximating the sampling of the harmonic bath with classical mechanics was found to greatly improve the numerical performance. For the double well, the new method is noticeably better than the Feynman–Kleinert linearized path integral method at reproducing the exact classical Wigner results, but they are equally good at reproducing exact quantum mechanics. The new method is suggested as being interesting for future tests on other correlation functions and systems.},

The method is applicable to electronically non-resonant light–matter interaction systems that involve atomic motions in spectroscopy and photonics. Since the scheme simultaneously traces the light propagation in a medium on a macroscopic scale and the microscopic molecular motion under the light electric field, this enables us to treat the experimental setup and mimic its measurement process. As the first applications, we demonstrate three numerical examples of basic spectroscopies of an ice crystalline solid: simulations of reflection and transmission of visible light, infrared absorption measurement, and stimulated Raman scattering measurement. These examples show the detailed behaviors of the interacting light fields and molecules in the spectroscopic processes.},

  abstract = {Global optimization is an active area of research in atomistic simulations, and many algorithms have been proposed to date. A prominent example is basin hopping Monte Carlo, which performs a modified Metropolis Monte Carlo search to explore the potential energy surface of the system of interest. These simulations can be very demanding due to the high-dimensional configurational search space. The effective search space can be reduced by utilizing grids for the atomic positions, but at the cost of possibly biasing the results if fixed grids are employed. In this paper, we present a flexible grid algorithm for global optimization that allows us to exploit the efficiency of grids without biasing the simulation outcome. The method is general and applicable to very heterogeneous systems, such as interfaces between two materials of different crystal structures or large clusters supported at surfaces. As a benchmark case, we demonstrate its performance for the well-known global optimization problem of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 100 particles. Despite the simplicity of this model potential, Lennard-Jones clusters represent a challenging test case since the global minima for some “magic” numbers of particles exhibit geometries that are very different from those of clusters with only a slightly different size.},

In this contribution, we apply Bloch’s formalism to equation-of-motion coupled-cluster wave functions to rigorously derive effective Hamiltonians in Bloch’s and des Cloizeaux’s forms. We report the key equations and illustrate the theory by application to systems with two or three unpaired electrons, which give rise to electronic states of covalent and ionic characters. We show that Hubbard’s and Heisenberg’s Hamiltonians can be extracted directly from the so-obtained effective Hamiltonians. By establishing a quantitative connection between many-body states and simple models, the approach facilitates the analysis of the correlated wave functions. We propose a simple diagnostic for assessing the validity of the model space choice based on the overlaps between the target- and model-space states. Artifacts affecting the quality of electronic structure calculations such as spin contamination are also discussed.},

The inclusion of polarizability, here via the Drude oscillator model, requires amendments to the employed thermostat, where we consider a dual Nosé–Hoover thermostat, as well as a dual Langevin thermostat. We investigate the effects of the choice of a thermostat and the underlying parameters such as the masses and force constants of the Drude particles on static and dynamic properties of ionic liquids. Here, we show that Langevin thermostats are not suitable for investigating the dynamics of ionic liquids. Since polarizable MD simulations are associated with high computational costs, we employed a self-developed graphics processing unit enhanced code within the MD program CHARMM to keep the overall computational effort reasonable.},

This is especially true for systems with complicated, extended bond network topologies and other interactions that make the use and design of specialized relaxation protocols infeasible. We introduce a method based on Brownian dynamics simulations that can reduce the computational time it takes to reach equilibrium and draw decorrelated samples. Importantly, the method is completely agnostic to the particle configuration and the specifics of interparticle forces. In particular, we develop a mobility matrix that excites non-local, collective motion of N particles and can be computed efficiently in O ( N ) time. Particle motion in this scheme is computed by integrating the overdamped Langevin equation with an Euler–Maruyama scheme, in which Brownian displacements are drawn efficiently using a low-rank representation of the mobility matrix in position and wave space. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with various examples from the realm of soft condensed matter and release a massively parallel implementation of the code as a plugin for the open-source package HOOMD-blue [J.

In this study, the mechanistic details of hot carrier decay in hybrid perovskites are investigated using a newly developed non-adiabatic molecular dynamics method. In this approach, the nuclear trajectory is based on Born–Oppenheimer ground state molecular dynamics, which is then followed by the evolution of carrier wave function including the detailed balance and decoherence effects. We found the longer decay time for hot electrons due to the incorporation of interstitial iodine in the hybrid lead-halide perovskites (MAPbI 3 ), while the hot hole decay time is not affected significantly by the interstitial iodine. The underlying mechanism for such modulation of hot carrier dynamics is attributed to the changes of carrier density of states and the electron–phonon coupling strength. Hence, iodine interstitial is the necessary condition to create long-lived hot electrons in perovskites, which is further demonstrated by the comparative analysis with the pure MAPbI 3 .},

  abstract = {In this communication, the Adam–Gibbs model connecting molecular dynamics with configurational entropy is tested for the first time for ionic liquids. For this purpose, we investigate simultaneously the shear viscosity η and configurational entropy S c of an aprotic ionic liquid: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIm TFSI). Comparing the S c data obtained by the combination of Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann and Adam–Gibbs equations to the S c points determined directly from the calorimetric experiment, good agreement is found in the entire supercooled liquid region. These results indicate the validity of the Adam–Gibbs model in materials with electrostatic interactions being dominated. These important findings not only generalize the applications of the Adam–Gibbs theory but also provide an opportunity to gain insight into the relationship between thermodynamics and molecular dynamics in ionic liquids.},

We briefly describe experimental advances in molecular electronics and then discuss different theoretical approaches. We then focus on Green’s function methods. Two characteristic energy scales governing the physics are many-body interactions within the junctions and molecule–contact coupling. We, therefore, discuss weak interactions and weak coupling as two limits that can be conveniently treated within, respectively, the standard nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) method and its many-body flavors (pseudoparticle and Hubbard NEGF). We argue that the intermediate regime, where the two energy scales are comparable, can in many cases be efficiently treated within the recently introduced superperturbation dual fermion approach. Finally, we review approaches for going beyond these analytically accessible limits, as embodied by recent developments in numerically exact methods based on Green’s functions.},

  abstract = {Fundamental understanding of the subcritical/supercritical behavior of key hydrocarbon species inside nano-porous matrices at elevated pressure and temperature is less developed compared to bulk fluids, but this knowledge is of great importance for chemical and energy engineering industries. This study explores in detail the structure and dynamics of ethane (C 2 H 6 ) fluid confined in silica nanopores, with a focus on the effects of pressure and different ratios of C 2 H 6 and CO 2 at non-ambient temperature. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments were carried out for the pure C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 6 :CO 2 = 3:1, and 1:3 mixed fluids confined in 4-nm cylindrical silica pores at three different pressures (30 bars, 65 bars, and 100 bars) at 323 K. Two Lorentzian functions were required to fit the spectra, corresponding to fast and slow translational motions. No localized motions (rotations and vibrations) were detected. Higher pressures resulted in hindrances of the diffusivity of C 2 H 6 molecules in all systems investigated. Pore size was found to be an important factor, i.e., the dynamics of confined C 2 H 6 is more restricted in smaller pores compared to the larger pores used in previous studies. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to complement the QENS experiment at 65 bars, providing supportive structure information and comparable dynamic information. The simulations indicate that CO 2 molecules are more strongly attracted to the pore surface compared to C 2 H 6 . The C 2 H 6 molecules interacting with or near the pore surface form a dense first layer (L1) close to the pore surface and a second less dense layer (L2) extending into the pore center. Both the experiments and simulations revealed the role that CO 2 molecules play in enhancing C 2 H 6 diffusion (“molecular lubrication”) at high CO 2 :C 2 H 6 ratios. The energy scales of the two dynamic components, fast and slow, quantified by both techniques, are in very good agreement. Herein, the simulations identified the fast component as the main contributor to the dynamics. Molecule motions in the L2 region are mostly responsible for the dynamics (fast and slow) that can be detected by the instrument.},

In this work, the dependence of photon-to-chemical conversion efficiency on the size of plasmonic silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) has been comprehensively studied with the use of the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a probe reaction. Comparison of Ag NPs with two different sizes (6 nm and 13 nm in diameter) highlights that the smaller sized Ag NPs favor the photocatalytic activity by positively translating the high efficiency of hot electron generation to the hot-electron-driven chemical reaction on the surface of the Ag NPs. Loading the small Ag NPs to the dielectric silica nanospheres (SiO X NSs, average diameter of 400 nm) with high surface coverage increases the light absorption power in the Ag NPs due to the surface light scattering resonances of the SiO X NSs and interparticle plasmon coupling of the adjacent Ag NPs. The enhanced light absorption can also be rendered to the improved photocatalytic activity. This design principle of plasmonic photocatalysts provides a promise of utilizing solar energy to drive desirable chemical reactions with high photon-to-chemical conversion efficiency.},

  abstract = {Ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations was used to characterize the interaction of water with two-dimensional (2D) silica and aluminosilicate bilayers on Pd(111). Starting with oxygen adsorbed at the SiO 2 /Pd interface, exposure to water caused the SiO 2 -derived XPS peaks to shift to higher binding energy and the removal of an O 1s feature associated with interfacial adsorbed oxygen. These observations were attributed to the formation of a mixed water–hydroxyl interface, which eliminates the interfacial dipolar layer, and its associated electrostatic potential, created by adsorbed oxygen. Interfacial oxygen also reacted with H 2 to produce adsorbed water which also caused an upward binding energy shift of the SiO 2 peaks. Spectra recorded under 0.5 Torr water revealed additional water adsorption and a further shift of the overlayer peaks to higher binding energy. Incorporating Al into the 2D material caused the bilayer peaks to shift to lower binding energy which could be explained by electron donation from the metal to the bilayer. Although the stronger interaction between the bilayer and Pd substrate should restrict interfacial adsorption and reaction, similar trends were observed for water and hydrogen exposure to interfacial adsorbed oxygen. Less water adsorption was observed at the aluminosilicate interface which is a consequence of Al strengthening the bond to the metal substrate. The results reveal how the sensitivity of XPS to interfacial dipoles can be exploited to distinguish reactions taking place in confined spaces under 2D layers and how tuning the composition of the 2D layer can impact such reactions.},

  abstract = {Lead halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic applications because of their exceptional performances in carrier lifetime and diffusion length; however, the microscopic origins of their unique characteristics remain elusive. The organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites show unique dielectric functions, i.e., ferroelectric-like phonon responses in the 0.1–10 THz region and liquid-like rotational relaxation in the 1–100 GHz range. To reveal the role of the dielectric responses is of primal importance because the dielectric screening is a key to understanding the optoelectronic properties governed by polarons in the perovskites. Here, we conducted comparative studies of broadband dielectric spectroscopy on both all-inorganic CsPbBr 3 and organic–inorganic hybrid (CH 3 NH 3 )PbBr 3 single crystals to uncover the origin of the liquid-like dielectric relaxation in the 1–100 GHz range. We confirmed the absence of the dielectric response in the range of 10 6 –10 10 Hz in CsPbBr 3 , which was clearly present in the hybrid (CH 3 NH 3 )PbBr 3 . This suggests that the response is almost purely due to the rotational motions of the organic dipoles in the hybrid perovskites. We evaluated the lifetimes of the polarons using surface-free transient photoluminescence. The lifetime in CsPbBr 3 was up to 1.6 µ s, while the lifetime in (CH 3 NH 3 )PbBr 3 was 18 µ s. The lifetime in the hybrid (CH 3 NH 3 )PbBr 3 was significantly longer than in CsPbBr 3 , also confirmed by transient infrared spectroscopy. We concluded that the liquid-like dielectric response inhibits polaron recombination due to the efficient separation of opposite charges by the additional dynamic disorder.},

  abstract = {The metal–organic framework (MOF), NU-1000, and its metalated counterparts have found proof-of-concept application in heterogeneous catalysis and hydrogen storage among others. A vapor-phase technique, akin to atomic layer deposition (ALD), is used to selectively deposit divalent Cu ions on oxo, hydroxo-bridged hexa-zirconium(IV) nodes capped with terminal –OH and –OH 2 ligands. The subsequent reaction with steam yields node-anchored, Cu II -oxo, hydroxo clusters. We find that cluster installation via AIM (ALD in MOFs) is accompanied by an expansion of the MOF mesopore (channel) diameter. We investigated the behavior of the cluster-modified material, termed Cu-AIM-NU-1000, to heat treatment up to 325 °C at atmospheric pressure with a low flow of H 2 into the reaction cell. The response under these conditions revealed two important results: (1) Above 200 °C, the initially installed few-metal-ion clusters reduce to neutral Cu atoms. The neutral atoms migrate from the nodes and aggregate into Cu nanoparticles. While the size of particles formed in the MOF interior is constrained by the width of mesopores (∼3 nm), the size of those formed on the exterior surface of the MOF can grow as large as ∼8 nm. (2) Reduction and release of Cu atoms from the MOFs nodes is accompanied by the dynamic structural transformation of NU-1000 as it reverts back to its original dimension following the release. These results show that while the MOF framework itself remains intact at 325 °C in an H 2 atmosphere, the small, AIM-installed Cu II -oxo, hydroxo clusters are stable with respect to reduction and conversion to metallic nanoparticles only up to ∼200 °C.},

  abstract = {To understand the origins of failure and limited cycle life in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), it is imperative to quantitatively link capacity-fading mechanisms to electrochemical and chemical processes. This is extremely challenging in real systems where capacity is lost during each cycle to both active material loss and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) evolution, two indistinguishable contributions in traditional electrochemical measurements. Here, we have used a model system in combination with (1) precision measurements of the overall Coulombic efficiency via electrochemical experiments and (2) x-ray reflectivity measurements of the active material losses. The model system consisted of a 515 Å thick amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin film on silicon carbide in half-cell geometry using a carbonate electrolyte with LiPF 6 salt. This approach allowed us to quantify the capacity lost during each cycle due to SEI evolution. Combined with electrochemical analysis, we identify SEI growth as the major contribution to capacity fading. Specifically, the continued SEI growth results in increasing overpotentials due to increased SEI resistance, and this leads to lower extent of lithiation when the cutoff voltage is reached during lithiation. Our results suggest that SEI grows more with increased time spent at low voltages where electrolyte decomposition is favored. Finally, we extracted a proportionality constant for SEI growth following a parabolic growth law. Our methodology allows for the quantitative determination of lithium-ion loss mechanisms in LIBs by separately tracking lithium ions within the active materials and the SEI and offers a powerful method of quantitatively understanding LIB loss mechanisms.},

We find a weakly bonded (Au ad Cl 2 )-chain as the most stable structure in the case of Cl chemical potentials such that Cl vacancies are suppressed. In the range of Cl chemical potential, where Cl vacancies occur in equilibrium and bind to an (modified) Au ad induced ad-structure, the formation of a dimer from two monomers is accompanied by an energy gain between 0.06 and 0.23 eV. For Au ad trimer and tetramer formation, the calculations suggest a similar tendency. This suggests that on c (2 × 2)-Cl covered Au(001) surfaces, the Au ad-island nucleation is supported by the presence of vacancies in the Cl adlayer.},

Specifically, we compare the results for a set of nine exchange-correlation functionals, including standard generalized-gradient approximations (GGAs), the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) metaGGA functional, and a number of dispersion-corrected versions based on the van der Waals (vdW) and VV10 schemes. Compared to the experimental data, all functionals predict an excessively stiff response to tensile and compressive distortions, as well as shear deformations along the basal plane, with the SCAN metaGGA functional displaying the largest deviations as compared to the experimental values. These discrepancies are found to correlate with underestimates of inter-molecular distances, on the one hand, and overestimates of intra-molecular separations, on the other. The inclusion of non-local vdW corrections according to the vdW approach generally improves these structural parameters and softens the elastic response functions compared to their parent GGA functionals. The dispersion-corrected SCAN-rVV10 functional, however, acts in the opposite direction, further worsening the comparison to experiment. In this view, it appears useful that the database employed to gauge the quality of exchange-correlation functionals for water includes an assessment of their elastic response of ice I h and possibly other crystalline phases.},

  abstract = {We explore the effect of directionality on rotational and translational relaxation in glassy systems of patchy particles. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze the impact of two distinct patch geometries, one that enhances the local icosahedral structure and the other one that does not strongly affect the local order. We find that in nearly all investigated cases, rotational relaxation takes place on a much faster time scale than translational relaxation. By comparing to a simplified dynamical Monte Carlo model, we illustrate that rotational diffusion can be qualitatively explained as purely local motion within a fixed environment, which is not coupled strongly to the cage-breaking dynamics required for translational relaxation. Nonetheless, icosahedral patch placement has a profound effect on the local structure of the system, resulting in a dramatic slowdown at low temperatures, which is strongest at an intermediate “optimal” patch size.},

  abstract = {The photochemical dynamics of double-bond-containing hydrocarbons is exemplified by the smallest alkenes, ethylene and butadiene. Chemical substituents can alter both decay timescales and photoproducts through a combination of inertial effects due to substituent mass, steric effects due to substituent size, and electronic (or potential) effects due to perturbative changes to the electronic potential energy surface. Here, we demonstrate the interplay of different substituent effects on 1,3-butadiene and its methylated derivatives using a combination of ab initio simulation of nonadiabatic dynamics and time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The purely inertial effects of methyl substitution are simulated through the use of mass 15 “heavy-hydrogen” atoms. As expected from both inertial and electronic influences, the excited-state dynamics is dominated by pyramidalization at the unsubstituted carbon sites. Although the electronic effects of methyl group substitution are weak, they alter both decay timescales and branching ratios by influencing the initial path taken by the excited wavepacket following photoexcitation.},

The molecule has two valence ePES with binding energies of 0.39 hartree and 1.1 hartree. The HHG spectrum from an electron dynamics on the weaker bound valence ePES, virtually assigned to Li 2s, exhibits a dominant peak at the first harmonic without plateau and cutoff. This compares with the free electron spectrum under an oscillating laser field and is comprehensive with the shape and depth of the ePES. The other valence ePES, assigned to H 1s, is deeper bound such that the overall profile of the wave function is well approximated by a Gaussian of the width comparable to the Li–H bond length. However, a small fraction, less than 10 −3 , of the probability density amplitude tunnels out from the bound potential with high wave number and spreads over tens of nm with parts recombining to the molecule due to the laser field oscillation. This minor portion of the electronic wave function is the major origin of the HHG extending up to 50 harmonic orders. Nonlinear dynamics within the potential well induced by the laser field oscillation also contributes to the HHG up to 30 harmonic orders.},

The calculations were performed by employing the explicitly correlated coupled cluster [CCSD (T)-F12a] method with the augmented correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVTZ basis set plus bond functions. The basis set superposition error was corrected by the full counterpoise procedure. About 55 000 ab initio points were calculated and then fitted by the permutation invariant polynomial neural network approach with a root-mean-square error of 0.433 cm −1 . The potential energy surface features two equivalent linear minima with a well depth of 811.012 cm −1 separated by a barrier of 635.836 cm −1 . The ro-vibrational energy levels for N 2 –HF and N 2 –DF were calculated based on the vibrationally averaged 4D IPESs with the radial discrete variable representation/angular finite basis representation method and Lanczos propagation algorithm. The calculated frequencies and the relative line intensities in the HF (DF) stretching band agree well with the available observed spectra. The theoretical band origins are all red shifted relative to the isolated HF (DF) molecule and reproduce the experimental values well. The results of ro-vibrational state calculations demonstrate the high accuracy of our new PES.},

Our study considered uracil–water aggregates with six solvent molecules obtained from Monte Carlo simulations in the liquid phase. To explore the ensemble statistics, we combined scattering calculations, performed in the static exchange and static exchange plus polarization approximations, with linear regressions of virtual orbital energies to the scattering results. In general, the solvent molecules stabilize the anion states, and the lower lying π 1 * resonance becomes a bound state in most of the solute–water clusters. We also discuss how the strength of the H bonds can affect the energies of the anion states, in addition to the number and donor/acceptor characters of those bonds. The thermal distributions for the vertical attachment energies, obtained from 133 statistically uncorrelated solute–solvent clusters, are significantly broad in the energy scale of the autoionization widths. The distributions for the π 1 * and π 2 * anion states slightly overlap, thus giving rise to a quasi-continuum of attachment energies below ≲2.5 eV, in contrast to the gas phase picture of electron attachment to well separated resonances below the electronic excitation threshold. Both the stabilization of the anion states and the spread of attachment energies could be expected to favor the dissociative electron attachment processes believed to underlie the electron-induced damage to biomolecules.},

Controlling the spin in such states requires unfeasible strong magnetic fields to overcome typical decoherence rates. However, the advent of terahertz technology and its application in magnetic pulses opens up a new scenario. In this article, we focus on an electron–hole pair model to demonstrate that it is possible to control the precession of the spins and to modify the transition rates to different spin states. Enhancing transitions from a bright state to a dark state with different spins means that the latter can be revealed by ordinary spectroscopy. We propose a modification of the standard two-dimensional spectroscopic scheme in which a three pulse sequence is encased in a magnetic pulse. Its role is to drive transitions between a bright and a dark spin state, making the latter susceptible to spectroscopic investigation.},

We derive exact expressions for these free energy changes for the case of discrete copy numbers and show how these expressions reduce to traditional expressions under a series of successive approximations leveraging the relative sizes of the stoichiometric coefficients and the copy numbers of the solutes and solvent. Numerical results are presented to corroborate the claim that if the copy numbers are treated as discrete quantities, then only these more accurate expressions lead to correct behavior.

Here, we derive an alternative model that takes into account these fluctuations and, hence, can be used to study low protein number effects. The exact steady-state protein number distribution is derived as a sum of Gaussian hypergeometric functions. We use the theory to study how promoter switching rates and the type of feedback influence the size of protein noise and noise-induced bistability. Furthermore, we show that our model predictions for the protein number distribution are significantly different from those of Kumar et al. when the protein mean is small, gene switching is fast, and protein binding to the gene is faster than the reverse unbinding reaction.},

As commonly used chromophores, the C=O and C=C stretch modes in the nucleobases exhibit distinct spectral features for different base pairing and stacking configurations. To elucidate the origin of their structural sensitivity, in this work, we develop transition charge coupling (TCC) models that allow one to efficiently calculate the interactions or couplings between the C=O and C=C chromophores based on the geometric arrangements of the nucleobases. To evaluate their performances, we apply the TCC models to DNA and RNA oligonucleotides with a variety of secondary and tertiary structures and demonstrate that the predicted couplings are in quantitative agreement with the reference values. We further elucidate how the interactions between the paired and stacked bases give rise to characteristic IR absorption peaks and show that the TCC models provide more reliable predictions of the coupling constants as compared to the transition dipole coupling scheme. The TCC models, together with our recently developed through-bond coupling constants and vibrational frequency maps, provide an effective theoretical strategy to model the vibrational Hamiltonian, and hence the vibrational spectra of nucleic acids in the base carbonyl stretch region directly from atomistic molecular simulations.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of electrostatic energy for a set of point charges in a periodic lattice is a computationally expensive part of molecular dynamics simulations (and other applications) because of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. A standard approach is to decompose the Coulomb potential into a near part, typically evaluated by direct summation up to a cutoff radius, and a far part, typically evaluated in Fourier space. In practice, all decomposition approaches involve approximations—such as cutting off the near-part direct sum—but it may be possible to find new decompositions with improved trade-offs between accuracy and performance. Here, we present the u - series , a new decomposition of the Coulomb potential that is more accurate than the standard (Ewald) decomposition for a given amount of computational effort and achieves the same accuracy as the Ewald decomposition with approximately half the computational effort. These improvements, which we demonstrate numerically using a lipid membrane system, arise because the u -series is smooth on the entire real axis and exact up to the cutoff radius. Additional performance improvements over the Ewald decomposition may be possible in certain situations because the far part of the u -series is a sum of Gaussians and can thus be evaluated using algorithms that require a separable convolution kernel; we describe one such algorithm that reduces communication latency at the expense of communication bandwidth and computation, a trade-off that may be advantageous on modern massively parallel supercomputers.},

  abstract = {Locating the minimum energy structure of molecules, typically referred to as geometry optimization, is one of the first steps of any computational chemistry calculation. Earlier research was mostly dedicated to finding convenient sets of molecule-specific coordinates for a suitable representation of the potential energy surface, where a faster convergence toward the minimum structure can be achieved. More recent approaches, on the other hand, are based on various machine learning techniques and seem to revert to Cartesian coordinates instead for practical reasons. We show that the combination of Gaussian process regression with those coordinate systems employed by state-of-the-art geometry optimizers can significantly improve the performance of this powerful machine learning technique. This is demonstrated on a benchmark set of 30 small covalently bonded molecules.},

  abstract = {We derive a multidimensional instanton theory for calculating ground-state tunneling splittings in Cartesian coordinates for general paths. It is an extension of the method by Mil’nikov and Nakamura [J. Chem. Phys. 115 , 6881 (2001)] to include asymmetric paths that are necessary for calculating tunneling splitting patterns in multi-well systems, such as water clusters. The approach avoids multiple expensive matrix diagonalizations to converge the fluctuation prefactor in the ring-polymer instanton (RPI) method, and instead replaces them by an integration of a Riccati differential equation. When combined with the string method for locating instantons, we avoid the need to converge the calculation with respect to the imaginary time period of the semiclassical orbit, thereby reducing the number of convergence parameters of the optimized object to just one: the number of equally spaced system replicas used to represent the instanton path. The entirety of the numerical effort is thus concentrated in optimizing the shape of the path and evaluating hessians along the path, which is a dramatic improvement over RPI. In addition to the standard instanton approximations, we neglect the coupling of vibrational modes to external rotations. The method is tested on the model potential of malonaldehyde and on the water dimer and trimer, giving close agreement with RPI at a much-reduced cost.},

Phys. 151 , 044119 (2019)] based on the well-known quantum equivalence between a two-level system and a spin-1/2 particle. In the present paper, we generalize this method to describe the dynamics of N -level systems. This is done via a mapping to a classical phase space that preserves the SU ( N )-symmetry of the original quantum problem. The theory reproduces the standard Meyer–Miller–Stock–Thoss Hamiltonian without invoking an extended phase space, and we thus avoid leakage from the physical subspace. In contrast to the standard derivation of this Hamiltonian, the generalized spin mapping leads to an N -dependent value of the zero-point energy parameter that is uniquely determined by the Casimir invariant of the N -level system. Based on this mapping, we derive a simple way to approximate correlation functions in complex nonadiabatic molecular systems via classical trajectories and present benchmark calculations on the seven-state Fenna–Matthews–Olson light-harvesting complex. The results are significantly more accurate than conventional Ehrenfest dynamics, at a comparable computational cost, and can compete in accuracy with other state-of-the-art mapping approaches.},

  abstract = {Perturbations of fluid media can give rise to non-equilibrium dynamics, which may, in turn, cause motion of immersed inclusions or tracer particles. We consider perturbations (“activations”) that are local in space and time, of a fluid density which is conserved, and study the resulting diffusiophoretic phenomena that emerge at a large distance. Specifically, we consider cases where the perturbations propagate diffusively, providing examples from passive and active matter for which this is expected to be the case. Activations can, for instance, be realized by sudden and local changes in interaction potentials of the medium or by local changes in its activity. Various analytical results are provided for the case of confinement by two parallel walls. We investigate the possibility of extracting work from inclusions, which are moving through the activated fluid. Furthermore, we show that a time-dependent density profile, created via suitable activation protocols, allows for the conveyance of inclusions along controlled and stable trajectories. In contrast, in states with a steady density, inclusions cannot be held at stable positions, reminiscent of Earnshaw’s theorem of electrostatics. We expect these findings to be applicable in a range of experimental systems. The phenomena described here are argued to be distinct from other forms of phoresis such as thermophoresis.},

TheoDORE tackles this problem through providing tools for post-processing excited-state computations, which automate repetitive tasks and provide rigorous and reproducible descriptors. Interfaces are available for ten different quantum chemistry codes and a range of excited-state methods implemented therein. This article provides an overview of three popular functionalities within TheoDORE, a fragment-based analysis for assigning state character, the computation of exciton sizes for measuring charge transfer, and the natural transition orbitals used not only for visualization but also for quantifying multiconfigurational character. Using the examples of an organic push–pull chromophore and a transition metal complex, it is shown how these tools can be used for a rigorous and automated assignment of excited-state character. In the case of a conjugated polymer, we venture beyond the limits of the traditional molecular orbital picture to uncover spatial correlation effects using electron–hole correlation plots and conditional densities.},

In this paper, based on the fact that quantum nuclei are relatively localized, we develop the constrained nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory (cNEO-DFT) by imposing a constraint on the expectation value of the quantum nuclear position. In this way, an extended NEO energy surface is obtained, which also depends on the quantum nuclear position. Compared to the potential energy surface obtained from conventional DFT, the extended NEO energy surface incorporates the nuclear quantum effects, which have notable impacts on the energy profile. Furthermore, cNEO-DFT can facilitate the location of NEO stationary states. It potentially can be used in geometry optimization, transition states search, and the calculation of reaction dynamics.},

The model can be used as an alternative to the more complete Lindblad density matrix approach and is computationally and conceptually simpler. We find that optical spectra in the linear regime can be adequately described by this approach. The model can fail, however, under continuous optical driving in some circumstances. In the case of two quantum dots or excitons interacting with a plasmon, the model can also describe coherences and entanglement qualitatively when both dissipation and dephasing are present and quantitatively in the limit with no dephasing. The approach, within a single excitation manifold, is also applied to assess the role of disorder for 50 quantum dots interacting with a plasmon, where we find that, on average, large enough disorder can help stabilize the ensemble average of the open quantum system toward a dark quasi-steady-state much faster than without disorder. While such single excitation manifold calculations in this size limit can readily be done with either the non-Hermitian or Lindblad forms, as one goes to larger Hilbert space sizes, the computational and storage advantages of the non-Hermitian approach can become more useful.},

  abstract = {We propose a scheme for coarse-graining the dynamics of the 2-D kinetic Ising model onto the microcanonical ensemble. At subcritical temperatures, 2-D and higher-dimensional Ising lattices possess two basins of attraction separated by a free energy barrier. Projecting onto the microcanonical ensemble has the advantage that the dependence of the crossing rate constant on environmental conditions can be obtained from a single Monte Carlo trajectory. Using various numerical methods, we computed the forward rate constants of coarse-grained representations of the Ising model and compared them with the true value obtained from brute force simulation. While coarse-graining preserves detailed balance, the computed rate constants for barrier heights between 5 kT and 9 kT were consistently 50\% larger than the true value. Markovianity testing revealed loss of dynamical memory, which we propose accounts for coarse-graining error. Committor analysis did not support the alternative hypothesis that microcanonical projection is incompatible with an optimal reaction coordinate. The correct crossing rate constant was obtained by spectrally decomposing the diffusion coefficient near the free energy barrier and selecting the slowest (reactive) component. The spectral method also yielded the correct rate constant in the 3-D Ising lattice, where coarse-graining error was 6\% and memory effects were diminished. We conclude that microcanonical coarse-graining supplemented by spectral analysis of short-term barrier fluctuations provides a comprehensive kinetic description of barrier crossing in a non-inertial continuous-time jump process.},

Modified Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations were used to account for finite ion sizes, subject to an electroneutrality condition. The time evolution of the formation and relaxation of the double layers was explored. Moreover, equilibrium ion distributions and differential capacitance curves were investigated as functions of the pore surface charge density, electrolyte concentration, ion sizes, and pore size. Asymmetric properties of the differential capacitance curves reveal that the structure of the double layer near each electrode is controlled by the charge concentration along the pore surface and by charge asymmetry in the electrolyte. These results carry implications for accurately simulating cylindrical capacitors and electroactuators.},

This complementarity offers unique opportunities, provided that the two methods are compared at a suitable level. Recently, several groups have used MD simulations to compute the spectral density of backbone and side chain molecular motions and to predict NMR relaxation rates from these. Unfortunately, in the case of methyl groups in protein side chains, inaccurate energy barriers to methyl rotation were responsible for a systematic discrepancy in the computed relaxation rates, as demonstrated for the AMBER ff99SB * -ILDN force field (and related parameter sets), impairing quantitative agreement between simulations and experiments. However, correspondence could be regained by emending the MD force field with accurate coupled cluster quantum chemical calculations. Spurred by this positive result, we tested whether this approach could be generally applicable, in spite of the fact that different MD force fields employ different water models. Improved methyl group rotation barriers for the CHARMM36 and AMBER ff15ipq protein force fields were derived, such that the NMR relaxation data obtained from the MD simulations even now display very good agreement with the experiment. Results herein showcase the performance of present-day MD force fields and manifest their refined ability to accurately describe internal protein dynamics.},

  abstract = {The multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method is a powerful method for solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in quantum molecular dynamics. It is, however, hampered by the so-called curse of dimensionality which results in exponential scaling with respect to the number of degrees of freedom in the system and, thus, limits its applicability to small- and medium-sized molecules. To avoid this scaling, we derive equations of motion for a series of truncated MCTDH methods using a many-mode second-quantization formulation where the configuration space is restricted based on mode-combination levels as also done in the vibrational configuration interaction and vibrational coupled cluster methods for solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation. The full MCTDH wave function is invariant with respect to the choice of constraint (or gauge) operators, but restricting the configuration space removes this invariance. We, thus, analyze the remaining redundancies and derive equations for variationally optimizing the non-redundant matrix elements of the constraint operators. As an alternative, we also present a constraint that keeps the density matrices block diagonal during the propagation and the two choices are compared. Example calculations are performed on formyl fluoride and a series of high-dimensional Henon–Heiles potentials. The results show that the MCTDH[ n ] methods can be applied to large systems and that an optimal choice of constraint operators is key to obtaining the correct physical behavior of the wave function.},

Two-way memory functions (“erase–read–write–read” and “write–read–erase–read”) worked simultaneously on the same system and could be accessed by simple optical switching between two excitation and emission wavelengths. Our optically switchable device might outperform traditional multifunctional logic gates and memory devices that generally employ chemical triggers to switch functionality and memory states. These optically switchable multifunctional molecular logic gates and memory systems might drive smart devices in the near future with high energy efficiency, extended life span, structural and functional simplicity, exclusive reversibility and enhanced data storage density.},

  abstract = {Phase separation of intrinsically disordered proteins is important for the formation of membraneless organelles or biomolecular condensates, which play key roles in the regulation of biochemical processes within cells. In this work, we investigated the phase separation of different sequences of a coarse-grained model for intrinsically disordered proteins and discovered a surprisingly rich phase behavior. We studied both the fraction of total hydrophobic parts and the distribution of hydrophobic parts. Not surprisingly, sequences with larger hydrophobic fractions showed conventional liquid–liquid phase separation. The location of the critical point was systematically influenced by the terminal beads of the sequence due to changes in interfacial composition and tension. For sequences with lower hydrophobicity, we observed not only conventional liquid–liquid phase separation but also re-entrant phase behavior in which the liquid phase density decreases at lower temperatures. For some sequences, we observed the formation of open phases consisting of aggregates, rather than a normal liquid. These aggregates had overall lower densities than the conventional liquid phases and exhibited complex geometries with large interconnected string-like or membrane-like clusters. Our findings suggest that minor alterations in the ordering of residues may lead to large changes in the phase behavior of the protein, a fact of significant potential relevance for biology.},

  abstract = {The interplay between Brownian colloidal particles and their suspending fluid is well understood since Einstein’s seminal work of 1905: the fluid consists of atoms whose thermal motion gives rise to the Brownian motion of the colloids, while the colloids increase the viscosity of the suspension under shear. An alternative route to the viscosity, by exploring the thermal stress fluctuations in a quiescent fluid in the Green–Kubo formalism, however, reveals a marked inconsistency with the viscosity under shear. We show that an additional stress term, accounting for Brownian fluctuating stresslets and coupled to the Brownian forces by a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is required for the description of the stress and viscosity of a colloidal suspension. Whereas previous applications of the Green–Kubo method to colloidal systems were limited to the deterministic “thermodynamic” part of the stress, using other means to determine the remainder of the viscosity, the whole viscosity is now within the reach of equilibrium studies.},

We find that, after initial ultrafast relaxation on femtosecond and picosecond time scales, an optically dark state is populated, likely the SP6 triplet (T) state, that undergoes Dexter-type energy transfer ( r Dex = 1.3 nm) and exhibits a long decay time of 0.1 s. Because of this long lifetime, a photostationary state with average T–T distances below 2 nm is established at excitation densities in the 10 20 cm −2 s −1 range. This large density enables decay by T–T annihilation (TTA) mediating autoionization despite an extremely low TTA rate of k TTA = 4.5 ⋅ 10 −26 m 3 s −1 . The large external quantum efficiency of the autoionization process (up to 15\%) and photocurrent densities in the mA cm −2 range offer great potential for light-harvesting applications.},

  abstract = {The catalytic properties of metal oxides are often enabled by surface defects, and their characterization is thus vital to the understanding and application of metal oxide catalysts. Typically, surface defects for metal oxides show fingerprints in spectroscopic characterization. However, we found that synchrotron-radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES) is difficult to probe surface defects of ZnO. Meanwhile, CO as a probe molecule cannot be used properly to identify surface defect sites on ZnO in infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Instead, we found that formaldehyde could serve as a probe molecule, which is sensitive to surface defect sites and could titrate surface oxygen vacancies on ZnO, as evidenced in both SRPES and IR characterization. Density functional theory calculations revealed that formaldehyde dissociates to form formate species on the stoichiometric ZnO ( 10 1 ¯ 0 ) surface, while it dissociates to formyl species on Vo sites of the reduced ZnO ( 10 1 ¯ 0 ) surface instead. Furthermore, the mechanism of formaldehyde dehydrogenation on ZnO surfaces was also elucidated, while the generated hydrogen atoms are found to be stored in ZnO bulk from 423 K to 773 K, making ZnO an interesting (de)hydrogenation catalyst.},

  abstract = {Microstructure, structure, and compositional homogeneity of metal oxide nanoparticles can change dramatically during catalysis. Considering the different stabilities of cobalt and iron ions in the MgO host lattice [M. Niedermaier et al. , J. Phys. Chem. C 123 , 25991 (2019)], we employed MgO nanocube powders with or without transition metal admixtures for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction to analyze characteristic differences in catalytic activity and sintering behavior. Undoped MgO nanocrystals exhibit the highest C 2 selectivity and retain the nanocrystallinity of the starting material after 24 h time on stream. For the Co–Mg–O nanoparticle powder, which exhibits the highest activity and CO x selectivity and where OCM-induced coarsening is strongest, we found that the Co 2+ ions remain homogeneously distributed over the MgO lattice. Trivalent Fe ions migrate to the surface of Fe–Mg–O nanoparticles where they form a magnesioferrite phase (MgFe 2 O 4 ) with a characteristic impact on catalytic performance: Fe–Mg–O is initially less selective than MgO despite its lower activity. An increase in C 2 selectivity and a decrease in the CO 2 /CO ratio with time on stream are attributed to the increasing fraction of coarsened particles that become depleted in redox active Fe. Surface water is a by-product of the OCM reaction, favors mass transport across the particle surfaces, and serves as a sintering aid during catalysis. The characteristic changes in size and morphology of MgO, Co-doped, and Fe-doped MgO particles can be consistently explained by activity and C 2 selectivity trends. The original morphology of the nanocubes as a starting material for the OCM reaction does not impact the catalytic activity.},

  abstract = {We investigated adsorption of N 2 on stoichiometric and O-rich IrO 2 (110) surfaces using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. TPD shows that N 2 desorbs predominantly from the stoichiometric-IrO 2 (110) surface in a well-defined peak at 270 K for N 2 coverages below about 0.5 ML and that a shoulder centered near 235 K develops in the N 2 TPD traces as the coverage approaches saturation, indicating that adsorbed N 2 molecules destabilize at high N 2 coverages. Experiments of N 2 adsorption onto O-rich IrO 2 (110) surfaces provide evidence that N 2 adsorbs exclusively on the coordinatively unsaturated Ir atoms (Ir cus ) of the surface and that pre-adsorbed O-atoms (“on-top” oxygen) stabilize adsorbed N 2 molecules, causing the main N 2 TPD peak to shift toward higher temperature with increasing oxygen coverages. Consistent with prior results, our DFT calculations predict that an N 2 molecule preferentially adsorbs into an upright configuration on an Ir cus atom of the IrO 2 (110) surface and achieves a binding energy of about 100 kJ/mol. The computed binding energy agrees well with our experimental estimate of ∼90 kJ/mol for low N 2 coverages on stoichiometric IrO 2 (110). The DFT calculations also quantitatively reproduce the observed stabilization of N 2 by co-adsorption on-top O-atoms and predict the destabilization of N 2 on IrO 2 (110) as the N 2 adlayer becomes crowded at high coverages.},

  abstract = {Metal–air batteries have higher theoretical specific energies than existing rechargeable batteries including Li-ion batteries. Among metal–air batteries, the Na–O 2 battery has gained much attention due to its low discharge/charge overpotentials (∼100 mV) at relatively high current densities (0.2 mA/cm 2 ), high electrical energy efficiency (90\%), high theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, there is no information reported regarding the effect of CO 2 contamination in non-aqueous Na–air batteries. Density functional theory has, here, been applied to study the effect of low concentrations of CO 2 contamination on NaO 2 and Na 2 O 2 growth/depletion reaction pathways and overpotentials. This was done on step surfaces of discharge products in non-aqueous Na–air batteries. Adsorption energies of CO 2 at various nucleation sites for both step surfaces were determined, and results revealed that CO 2 preferentially binds at the step valley sites of (001) NaO 2 and 1 1 ¯ 00 Na 2 O 2 surfaces with binding energies of −0.65 eV and −2.67 eV, respectively. CO 2 blocks the step nucleation site and influences the reaction pathways and overpotentials due to carbonate formation. The discharge electrochemical overpotential increases remarkably from 0.14 V to 0.30 V and from 0.69 V to 1.26 V for NaO 2 and Na 2 O 2 surfaces, respectively. CO 2 contamination is thus drastically impeding the growth/depletion mechanism pathways and increases the overpotentials of the surface reaction mechanism, hampering the performance of the battery. Avoiding CO 2 contamination from intake of gas and electrolyte decomposition is thus critical in development of Na–air batteries.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements distinctly reveal the reversible oxidation and reduction of FeO islands after sequential exposure to O 2 and CO.

  abstract = {Ionic liquids are widely used as electrolytes in electronic devices in which they are subject to nanoconfinement within nanopores or nanofilms. Because the intrinsic width of an electrical double layer is on the order of several nanometers, nanoconfinement is expected to fundamentally alter the double layer properties. Furthermore, in confined systems, a large portion of the ions are interfacial, e.g., at the electrode interface, leading to significant deviations of electrostatic screening and ion dynamics as compared to bulk properties. In this work, we systematically investigate the interference between electrical double layers for nanoconfined ionic liquids and the resulting influence on the structure, dynamics, and screening behavior. We perform molecular dynamics simulations for the ionic liquids [ B M I m + ] [ B F 4 − ] and [ B M I m + ] [ P F 6 − ] confined between two flat electrodes at systematic separation distances between 1.5 nm and 4.5 nm for both conducting and insulating boundary conditions. We find that while ion dynamics is expectedly slower than in the bulk (by ∼2 orders of magnitude), there is an unexpected non-linear trend with the confinement length that leads to a local maximum in dynamic rates at ∼3.5–4.5 nm confinement. We show that this nonlinear trend is due to the ion correlation that arises from the interference between opposite double layers. We further evaluate confinement effects on the ion structure and capacitance and investigate the influence of electronic polarization of the ionic liquid on the resulting properties. This systematic evaluation of the connection between electrostatic screening and structure and dynamics of ionic liquids in confined systems is important for the fundamental understanding of electrochemical supercapacitors.},

Hydrogen irradiation induces an in-gap state 1–1.6 eV below the Fermi level and a downward band bending of 0.27 eV.

In nanohole arrays, the optical resonances are typically determined by the inter-hole distance or periodicity with respect to the surface plasmon wavelength. However, for short-range ordered (SRO) arrays, the inter-hole distance varies locally, so the plasmon resonance changes. In this study, we investigate the local resonance of SRO nanoholes using a cathodoluminescence technique and compare it with hexagonally ordered nanoholes. The cathodoluminescence photon maps and resonance peak analysis reveal that the electric fields are confined at the edges of holes and that their resonances are determined by inter-hole distances as well as by their distributions. This demonstrates the Anderson localization of the electromagnetic waves showing locally enhanced electromagnetic local density of states in SRO nanoholes.},

  abstract = {Rational design of novel catalytic materials used to synthesize storable fuels via the CO hydrogenation reaction has recently received considerable attention. In this work, defect poor and defect rich 2D-MoS 2 as well as 2D-MoS 2 decorated with Mo clusters are employed as catalysts for the generation of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) via the CO hydrogenation reaction. Temperature programmed desorption is used to study the interaction of CO and H 2 molecules with the MoS 2 surface as well as the formation of reaction products. The experiments indicate the presence of four CO adsorption sites below room temperature and a competitive adsorption between the CO and H 2 molecules. The investigations show that CO hydrogenation is not possible on defect poor MoS 2 at low temperatures. However, on defect rich 2D-MoS 2 , small amounts of C 2 H 2 are produced, which desorb from the surface at temperatures between 170 K and 250 K. A similar C 2 H 2 signal is detected from defect poor 2D-MoS 2 decorated with Mo clusters, which indicates that low coordinated Mo atoms on 2D-MoS 2 are responsible for the formation of C 2 H 2 . Density functional theory investigations are performed to explore possible adsorption sites of CO and understand the formation mechanism of C 2 H 2 on MoS 2 and Mo 7 /MoS 2 . The theoretical investigation indicates a strong binding of C 2 H 2 on the Mo sites of MoS 2 preventing the direct desorption of C 2 H 2 at low temperatures as observed experimentally. Instead, the theoretical results suggest that the experimental data are consistent with a mechanism in which CHO radical dimers lead to the formation of C 2 H 2 that presents an exothermic desorption.},

Here, using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of Tl 2 O/WTe 2 vdWH. Our results indicate that it is a direct bandgap semiconductor harboring a straddling type-I band alignment, with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) both from two-dimensional WTe 2 . Interestingly, upon introducing feasible external strain or electric field, its band alignment can be easily transformed into staggered type-II, with CBM and VBM separated in different layers, achieving the long-sought tunable multiple band alignments. Along with this, the intriguing direct-to-indirect bandgap transition is also achieved in Tl 2 O/WTe 2 vdWH. Our work thus provides a promising candidate in the field of two-dimensional multifunctional and controllable electronics.},

We report simulated values of the current at constant applied voltage for a series of model electrolytes with varying cation and anion mobilities. Unlike the predictions of macroscopic device models, our simulation results reveal that under conditions of fixed cation mobility, the performance of a nanoscale battery is not improved by increasing the transference number of the electrolyte. We attribute this model discrepancy to the ability of the electrolyte to support deviations from charge neutrality over nanometer length scales and conclude that models for nanoscale electrochemical systems need to include the possibility of deviations from electroneutrality.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear mechanics of soft materials such as polymer melts or polymer solutions are frequently investigated by Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) spectroscopy tests. Less work has been reported on the characterization of the nonlinear viscoelastic properties of glassy polymers within a similar framework. In the present work, we use an extension of LAOS, i.e., mechanical spectral hole burning (MSHB), to investigate the nonlinear dynamics of an amorphous polymer in the deep glassy state. MSHB was developed as an analog to non-resonant spectral hole burning developed by Schiener et al. [Science 274 (5288), 752–754 (1996)], who attributed the presence of holes to dynamic heterogeneity. On the other hand, Qin et al. [J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym. Phys. 47 (20), 2047–2062 (2009)] in work on polymer solutions of tailored heterogeneity have attributed the presence of holes to the type of dynamics (Rouse, rubbery, etc.) rather than to a specific spatial heterogeneity. Here, we have performed MSHB experiments on poly(methyl methacrylate) in the deep glassy state (at ambient temperature, which is near to the β -relaxation) to investigate the presence and origin of holes, if any. The effects of pump frequency and pump amplitude were investigated, and we find that vertical holes could be burned successfully for frequencies from 0.0098 Hz to 0.0728 Hz and for pump amplitudes from 2\% to 9\% strain. On the other hand, horizontal holes were incomplete at high pump amplitude and low frequency, where higher spectral modification is observed. The results are interpreted as being related to the dynamic heterogeneity corresponding to the β -relaxation rather than to the hysteresis energy absorbed in the large deformation pump.},

Phys. 151 , 064508 (2019)], to fluid mixtures. In this model, particles interact via Mie potentials with Feynman–Hibbs quantum corrections of first order (Mie-FH1) or second order (Mie-FH2). This is done using a third-order Barker–Henderson expansion of the Helmholtz energy from a non-additive hard-sphere reference system. We survey existing experimental measurements and ab initio calculations of thermodynamic properties of mixtures of neon, helium, deuterium, and hydrogen and use them to optimize the Mie-FH1 and Mie-FH2 force fields for binary interactions. Simulations employing the optimized force fields are shown to follow the experimental results closely over the entire phase envelopes. SAFT-VRQ Mie reproduces results from simulations employing these force fields, with the exception of near-critical states for mixtures containing helium. This breakdown is explained in terms of the extremely low dispersive energy of helium and the challenges inherent in current implementations of the Barker–Henderson expansion for mixtures. The interaction parameters of two cubic equations of state (Soave–Redlich–Kwong and Peng–Robinson) are also fitted to experiments and used as performance benchmarks. There are large gaps in the ranges and properties that have been experimentally measured for these systems, making the force fields presented especially useful.},

We show that the decay time of the first peak of the Van Hove function is directly related to the Maxwell relaxation time of the liquid, which is proportional to the shear viscosity. This result demonstrates that the local dynamics for increasing or decreasing the coordination number of local clusters by one determines the viscosity at high temperature, supporting earlier predictions from molecular dynamics simulations.},

While many of the qualitative trends of water dynamical properties in the supercooled regime are well understood, the connections between the structure and dynamics of room temperature and supercooled water have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that the reorientational time scales and diffusion coefficients of supercooled water can be predicted from simulations of room temperature liquid water. Specifically, the derivatives of these dynamical time scales with respect to inverse temperature are directly calculated using the fluctuation theory applied to dynamics. These derivatives are used to predict the time scales and activation energies in the supercooled regime based on the temperature dependence in one of two forms: that based on the stability limit conjecture or assuming an equilibrium associated with a liquid–liquid phase transition. The results indicate that the retarded dynamics of supercooled water originate from structures and mechanisms that are present in the liquid under ambient conditions.},

  abstract = {The equation of state, dynamical properties, and molecular-scale structure of squalane and mixtures of poly- α -olefins at room temperature are studied with a combination of state-of-the-art, high-pressure experiments and molecular-dynamics simulations. Diamond-anvil cell experiments indicate that both materials are non-hydrostatic media at pressures above ∼1 GPa. The equation of state does not exhibit any sign of a first-order phase transition. High-pressure x-ray diffraction experiments on squalane show that there are no Bragg peaks, and hence, the apparent solidification occurs without crystallization. These observations are complemented by a survey of the equation of state and dynamical properties using simulations. The results show that molecular diffusion is essentially arrested above about 1 GPa, which supports the hypothesis that the samples are kinetically trapped in metastable amorphous-solid states. The shear viscosity becomes extremely large at very high pressures, and the coefficient governing its increase from ambient pressure is in good agreement with the available literature data. Finally, simulated radial distribution functions are used to explore the evolution of the molecular-scale structure with increasing pressure. Subtle changes in the short-range real-space correlations are related to a collapse of the molecular conformations with increasing pressure, while the evolution of the static structure factor shows excellent correlation with the available x-ray diffraction data. These results are of indirect relevance to oil-based lubricants, as the pressures involved are comparable to those found in engines, and hence, the ability of lubricating thin films to act as load-bearing media can be linked to the solidification phenomena studied in this work.},

Here, we introduce a numerical model for interpreting measurements of the evaporation rate and phase change of drying free droplets made using a single particle approach. We explore the evaporation of aqueous sodium chloride and sodium nitrate solution droplets. Although the chloride salt is observed to reproducibly crystallize at all drying rates, the nitrate salt solution can lose virtually all of its water content without crystallizing. The latter phenomenon has implications for our understanding of the competition between the drying rate and nucleation kinetics in these two systems. The nucleation model is used in combination with the measurements of crystallization events to infer nucleation rates at varying equilibrium state points, showing that classical nucleation theory provides a good description of the crystallization of the chloride salt but not the nitrate salt solution droplets. The reasons for this difference are considered.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast spectroscopy of molecular systems involving hydrogen- (H−) bonding has been at the forefront of fundamental chemical and physical research for several decades. Among the spectroscopic observables of the ultrafast dynamics is the pure dephasing of vibrationally excited molecules. Using third-order nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy, including polarization-selective transient grating measurements of vibrational lifetime and orientational diffusion as well as two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we determined different individual line shape components of hydroxyl stretching ( ν OH) excitations in a homologous series of chlorophenols and obtained the corresponding pure dephasing rates. The pure dephasing rates are correlated with vibrational anharmonicity of the ν OH mode, which is tuned remotely from the hydroxyl site by changing the position of the chlorine substituents on the phenol ring. We found that in molecules where the hydroxyl group is in its free form, the pure dephasing rates scale linearly with the mode’s anharmonicity such that assuming it is dominated by the third-order diagonal term, the ultrafast dynamics follow the prediction of the Kubo–Oxtoby theory. However, in the intramolecularly H-bonded ortho- chlorophenols, this trend is reversed, and the pure dephasing slows down by ∼50\% for an increase in anharmonicity of only a few wavenumbers. Because the ν OH mode’s anharmonicity is known to reflect the H-bonding strength, our results suggest that intramolecular H-bonding can serve as a mechanism of protection from fluctuating forces exerted by the solvent. Such an effect can be relevant for ultrafast dynamics in biomolecules, where H-bonding plays a central role.},

  abstract = {We investigate the vibrational amplitudes and the degree of the phonon localization in 19 ice forms, both crystalline and amorphous, by a quasi-harmonic approximation with a reliable classical intermolecular interaction model for water. The amplitude in the low pressure ices increases with compression, while the opposite trend is observed in the medium and high pressure ices. The amplitude of the oxygen atom does not differ from that of hydrogen in low pressure ices apart from the contribution from the zero-point vibrations. This is accounted for by the coherent but opposite phase motions in the mixed translational and rotational vibrations. A decoupling of translation-dominant and rotation-dominant motions significantly reduces the vibrational amplitudes in any ice form. The amplitudes in ice III are found to be much larger than any other crystalline ice form. In order to investigate the vibrational mode characteristics, the moment ratio of the atomic displacements for individual phonon modes, called the inverse participation ratio, is calculated and the degree of the phonon localization in crystalline and amorphous ices is discussed. It is found that the phonon modes in the hydrogen-ordered ice forms are remarkably spread over the entire crystal having propagative or diffusive characteristic, while many localized modes appear at the edges of the vibrational bands, called dissipative modes, in the hydrogen-disordered counterparts. The degree of localization is little pronounced in low density amorphous and high density amorphous due to disordering of oxygen atoms.},

We first assess the performance of two DFTB parameter sets based on the computed TD-DFTB absorption spectra. The main focus is given to the analysis of the electronic relaxation from the brightest excited state following absorption of a UV photon. We determine the dynamical relaxation times and discuss the underlying mechanisms. Our results show that the electronic population of the brightest excited singlet state in armchair-edge chrysene decays an order-of-magnitude faster than the one in zigzag-edge tetracene. This is correlated with a qualitatively similar difference of energy gaps between the brightest state and the state lying just below in energy, which is also consistent with our previous study on polyacenes.},

  abstract = {Quantum coherence plays an important role in exciton dynamics such as singlet fission, which may be determined by molecular physical properties, including energy levels, electronic couplings, and electron–phonon couplings, and by geometric properties, including packing configuration and exciton delocalization. However, the global picture of quantum coherence in high-dimensional multistate systems is still blurred. Here, we perform nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulation for singlet fission in tetracene clusters and demonstrate that the topology of quantum coherence in terms of the global structure of the coupled multistate system may significantly modulate fission dynamics. In particular, quantum coherence in the spin-specified models could be protected by its topological structure from external perturbations. Our work suggests that the topology of quantum coherence is indispensable in the understanding and control of quantum dynamics, which may find potential implementations to singlet fission and quantum computation.},

  abstract = {Transport phenomena in organic, self-assembled molecular J-aggregates have long attracted a great deal of attention due to their potential role in designing novel organic photovoltaic devices. A large number of theoretical and experimental studies have been carried out describing excitonic energy transfer in J-aggregates under the assumption that excitons are induced by a coherent laser-light source or initialized by a localized excitation on a particular chromophore. However, these assumptions may not provide an accurate description to assess the efficiency of J-aggregates, particularly as building blocks of organic solar cells. Under natural conditions, J-aggregates would be subjected to an incoherent source of light (as is sunlight), which would illuminate the whole photosynthetic complex rather than a single molecule. In this work, we present the first study of the efficiency of photosynthetic energy transport in self-assembled molecular aggregates under incoherent sunlight illumination. By making use of a minimalistic model of a cyanine dye J-aggregate, we demonstrate that long-range transport efficiency is enhanced when exciting the aggregate with incoherent light. Our results thus support the conclusion that J-aggregates are, indeed, excellent candidates for devices where efficient long-range incoherently induced exciton transport is desired, such as in highly efficient organic solar cells.},

Its recent detection, in the interstellar medium, has increased the interest in the study of the physical and chemical properties of this ion. Here, we report exact quantum time-independent calculations of the collisional cross sections and rate coefficients for the rotational excitation of HeH + by H. Reactive and exchange channels are taken into account in the scattering calculations. Cross sections are computed for energies of up to 10 000 cm −1 , enabling the computation of rate coefficients for temperatures of up to 500 K. The strongest collision-induced rotational HeH + transitions are those with Δ j = 1. Previous results obtained using approximate treatment are compared to the new ones, and significant differences are found. The new rate coefficients are also compared to those for electron-impact rotational excitation, and we found that collisions with H dominate the excitation of HeH + in media where the electron fraction is less than 10 −4 . In the light of those results, we recommend the use of the new HeH + –H collisional data in order to accurately model HeH + excitation in both the interstellar media and early Universe.},

To this end, we calculate the minimum energy dissociation path of the core-excited molecule and the potential energy surfaces of the molecular ion. Our measurements highlight the role of ultra-fast nuclear motion in the 1 a 1 − 1 4 a 1 core-excited molecule in the production of fragment ions. OH + fragments dominate for spectator Auger decay. Complete atomization after sequential fragmentation is also evident through detection of slow H + fragments. Additional measurements of the non-resonant Auger decay of the core-ionized molecule ( ⁠ 1 a 1 − 1 ⁠ ) to the lower-energy dication states show that the formation of the OH + + H + ion pair dominates, whereas sequential fragmentation OH + + H + → O + H + + H + is observed for transitions to higher dication states, supporting previous theoretical investigations.},

The large splittings are especially challenging to model, while the small splittings are difficult to analyze due to the resolution limit of 120 kHz. The combination of two methyl groups undergoing internal rotations caused each rotational transition to split into five torsional species, which were resolved and fitted using a modified version of the XIAM code and the newly developed ntop code to a root-mean-square deviation close to measurement accuracy, providing an estimate of the V 3 potential barriers of about 22 cm −1 and 584–588 cm −1 for the ring and the acetyl methyl groups, respectively. The assignment was aided by separately fitting the five torsional species using odd-power order operators. Only one conformer in which all heavy atoms are located on a symmetry plane could be identified in the spectrum, in agreement with results from conformation analysis using quantum chemical calculations.},

The reaction was carried out in water and in acetonitrile–water solutions. We find by carefully analyzing the geminate recombination dynamics of the photobase–proton pair that follows the ESPT reaction that there are two targets for the proton back-recombination reaction: the original O − dissociation site and the SO 3 − side group at the 8 position which is closest to the proton OH dissociation site. This observation is corroborated in acetonitrile-water mixtures of χ water 0.23 the band resembles the free anion band observed in pure water. Concomitantly, the ESPT rate increases when χ water increases because the intermolecular ESPT to the solvent (bulk water) gradually prevails over the much slower intramolecular via the water-bridges ESPT process.},

  abstract = {Identification of defective DNA structures is a difficult task, since small differences in base-pair bonding are hidden in the local structural variability of a generally random base-pair sequence. Defects, such as base mismatches, missing bases, crosslinks, and so on, occur in DNA with high frequency and must be efficiently identified and repaired to avoid dire consequences such as genetic mutations. Here, we focus on the detection of base mismatches, which is local deviations from the ideal Watson–Crick pairing rule, which may typically originate from DNA replication process, foreign chemical attack, or ionizing radiation. Experimental detection of a mismatch defect demands the ability to measure slight deviations in the free energy and molecular structure. We introduce different mismatches in short DNA hairpins (10 or 20 base pairs plus a 4-base loop) sandwiched between dsDNA handles to be used in single-molecule force spectroscopy with optical tweezers. We perform both hopping and force-pulling experiments to measure the excess free energies and deduce the characteristic kinetic signatures of the mismatch from the force–distance curves. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations lend support to the detailed interpretation of the experimental data. Such measurements, at the lowest sensitivity limits of this experimental technique, demonstrate the capability of identifying the presence of mismatches in a random complementary dsDNA sequence and provide lower bounds for the ability to distinguish different structural defects.},

  abstract = {The spectroscopic detection of molecules adsorbed onto ice surfaces at coverages similar to those encountered under typical environmental conditions requires high surface selectivity and sensitivity that few techniques can afford. An experimental methodology allowing a significant enhancement in the absorbance from adsorbed molecules is demonstrated herein. It exploits Electric Field Standing Wave (EFSW) effects intrinsic to grazing incidence Reflection–Absorption Infrared (RAIR) spectroscopy, where film thickness dependent optical interferences occur between the multiple reflections of the IR beam at the film–vacuum and the substrate–film interfaces. In this case study, CH 4 is used as a probe molecule and is deposited on a 20 ML coverage dense amorphous solid water film adsorbed onto solid Ar underlayers of various thicknesses. We observe that, at thicknesses where destructive interferences coincide with the absorption features from the CH stretching and HCH bending vibrational modes of methane, their intensity increases by a factor ranging from 10 to 25. Simulations of the RAIR spectra of the composite stratified films using a classical optics model reproduce the Ar underlayer coverage dependent enhancements of the absorbance features from CH 4 adsorbed onto the ice surface. They also reveal that the enhancements occur when the square modulus of the total electric field at the film’s surface reaches its minimum value. Exploiting the EFSW effect allows the limit of detection to be reduced to a coverage of (0.2 ± 0.2) ML CH 4 , which opens up interesting perspectives for spectroscopic studies of heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry at coverages that are more representative of those found in the natural environment.},

To access the efficacy of NCN as an IR probe to capture the changes in the local environment, several model systems were evaluated via 2D IR spectroscopy. Previous work by Cho [G. Lee, D. Kossowska, J. Lim, S. Kim, H. Han, K. Kwak, and M. Cho, J. Phys. Chem. B 122 (14), 4035–4044 (2018)] showed that phenylalanine analogues containing NCN show strong anharmonic coupling that can complicate the interpretation of structural dynamics. However, when NCN is embedded in 5-membered ring scaffolds, as in N -cyanomaleimide and N -cyanosuccinimide, a unique band structure is observed in the 2D IR spectrum that is not predicted by simple anharmonic frequency calculations. Further investigation indicated that electron delocalization plays a role in the origins of the band structure. In particular, the origin of the lower frequency transitions is likely a result of direct interaction with the solvent.},

The approach is demonstrated by computing the second-order Moller–Plesset energies of small- and medium-sized molecules. The resulting MRA-PNO-MP2-F12 method allows for the first time to compute correlated wave functions in a real-space representation for systems with dozens of atoms (as demonstrated here by computations on alkanes as large as C 10 H 22 ), with precision exceeding what is achievable with the conventional explicitly correlated MP2 approaches based on the atomic orbital representations.},

  abstract = {A solvent often manifests itself as the key determinant of the kinetic aspect of the molecular recognition process. While the solvent is often depicted as a source of barrier in the ligand recognition process by the polar cavity, the nature of solvent’s role in the recognition process involving hydrophobic cavity and hydrophobic ligand remains to be addressed. In this work, we quantitatively assess the role of solvent in dictating the kinetic process of recognition in a popular system involving the hydrophobic cavity and ligand. In this prototypical system, the hydrophobic cavity undergoes dewetting transition as the ligand approaches the cavity, which influences the cavity–ligand recognition kinetics. Here, we build a Markov state model (MSM) using adaptively sampled unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation trajectories to map the kinetic recognition process. The MSM-reconstructed free energy surface recovers a broad water distribution at an intermediate cavity–ligand separation, consistent with a previous report of dewetting transition in this system. Time-structured independent component analysis of the simulated trajectories quantitatively shows that cavity–solvent density contributes considerably in an optimized reaction coordinate involving cavity–ligand separation and water occupancy. Our approach quantifies two solvent-mediated macrostates at an intermediate separation of the cavity–ligand recognition pathways, apart from the fully ligand-bound and fully ligand-unbound macrostates. Interestingly, we find that these water-mediated intermediates, while transient in populations, can undergo slow mutual interconversion and create possibilities of multiple pathways of cavity recognition by the ligand. Overall, the work provides a quantitative assessment of the role that the solvent plays in facilitating the recognition process involving the hydrophobic cavity.},

This method combines a second-order (SO) algorithm for the optimization of the active orbitals with the first-order super configuration interaction (SCI) optimization of the remaining closed-virtual rotations and is denoted as the SO–SCI method. The SO–SCI method significantly improves the convergence as compared to the conventional SCI method. In combination with density fitting, the intermediates from the gradient calculation can be reused to evaluate the two-electron integrals required for the active Hessian without introducing a large computational overhead. The orbitals and CI coefficients are optimized alternately, but the CI-orbital coupling is accounted for by the limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno quasi-Newton method. This further improves the speed of convergence. The method is applicable to large molecules. The efficiency and robustness of the presented method is demonstrated in benchmark calculations for 21 aromatic molecules as well as for various transition metal complexes with up to 826 electrons and 5154 basis functions.},

The improved stability stems from greatly reduced oscillations in the doubles amplitudes, which, in turn, can be traced to the dynamic biorthonormal reference determinants of OATDCCD theory. As long as these are good approximations to the Brueckner determinant, OATDCCD theory is numerically stable.

Discovering the general principles that make radical pairs particularly sensitive to the direction of weak magnetic fields will be essential for designing bioinspired compass sensors and for advancing our understanding of the spin physics behind directional effects. The reference-probe model is a conceptual model introduced as a guide to identify radical-pair parameters for optimal directional effects. Radical pairs with probe character have been extensively shown to enhance directional sensitivity to weak magnetic fields, but investigations on the role of the reference radical are lacking. Here, we evaluate whether a radical has reference character and then study its relevance for optimal directional effects. We investigate a simple radical-pair model with one axially anisotropic hyperfine interaction using both analytical and numerical calculations. Analytical calculations result in a general expression of the radical-pair reaction yield, which in turn provides useful insights into directional effects. We further investigate the relevance of the reference character to robustness against variations of earth-strength magnetic fields and find that the reference character captures robust features as well. Extending this study to radical pairs with more hyperfine interactions, we discuss the interplay between reference character and optimal and robust directional effects in such more complex radical pairs.},

  abstract = {Using experimentally determined structures of ubiquitin at 1 and 3000 bar, we generate sufficiently large ensembles of model structures in the native and pressure-induced (denatured) states by means of molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water. We calculate the values of a free-energy function (FEF), which comprises the hydration free energy (HFE) and the intramolecular (conformational) energy and entropy, for the two states at 1 and 3000 bar. The HFE and the conformational entropy, respectively, are calculated using our statistical-mechanical method, which has recently been shown to be accurate, and the Boltzmann-quasi-harmonic method. The HFE is decomposed into a variety of physically insightful components. We show that the FEF of the native state is lower than that of the denatured state at 1 bar, whereas the opposite is true at 3000 bar, thus being successful in reproducing the pressure denaturation. We argue that the following two quantities of hydration play essential roles in the denaturation: the WASA-dependent term in the water-entropy loss upon cavity creation for accommodating the protein (WASA is the water-accessible surface area of the cavity) and the protein–water Lennard-Jones interaction energy. At a high pressure, the mitigation of the serious water crowding in the system is the most important, and the WASA needs to be sufficiently enlarged with the increase in the excluded-volume being kept as small as possible. The denatured structure thus induced is characterized by the water penetration into the protein interior. The pressure denaturation is accompanied by a significantly large gain of water entropy.},

  abstract = {The biological functions of photoenzymes are often triggered by photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions. An ultrafast backward ET (BET) reaction follows the initial photoinduced forward ET (FET), which dissipates the energy of absorbed photons and terminates the biological function in vain. Based upon our previous works, we reasoned that the dynamics of the BET is coupled with that of the FET and other local motions. In this work, the dynamics of the FET and BET is modeled as the master equation of the reduced density operator of a three-state system coupled with a classical harmonic reservoir. The coupling of the FET and BET is reflected in the time-evolution of the charge-transfer state’s population, which is generated by a source, the reaction flux for the FET, and annihilated by a sink, the reaction flux for the BET. Surprisingly, numerical simulations show that when the BET is in the Marcus normal region, the BET can be accelerated by nonequilibrium local motions and becomes faster than what is predicted by the Marcus theory. The experimental confirmation of this novel dynamics would provide qualitative evidence for nonequilibrium effects on ultrafast ET dynamics. Additionally, the effects of quantum vibrational modes on the dynamics are discussed. This work can help understand the dynamical interactions between the chain of ultrafast reactions and the complex local environmental motions, revealing the physical nature underlying biological functions.},

Recently, an animal-like cryptochrome from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( Cr aCRY) was analyzed, demonstrating the role of a fourth aromatic residue, which serves as a terminal electron donor in the photoreduction pathway, resulting in the creation of a more distal radical-pair and exhibiting fast electron transfer. In this work, we investigated the electron transfer in Cr aCRY with a combination of free energy molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, frozen density functional theory, and QM/MM MD simulations, supporting the suggestion of a proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. Spin dynamics simulations discerned details on the dependence of the singlet yield on the direction of the external magnetic field for the [FAD •− TYRH •+ ] and [FAD •− TYR • ] radical-pairs in Cr aCRY, in comparison with the previously modeled [FAD •− TRPH •+ ] radical-pair.},

As temperature was increased, the adhesion force, F ad , experienced by the AFM tip on pulling off the single chains after loading demonstrated a stepwise increase at an elevated temperature, which we identified to be T g based on previous works. Our result shows that T g of our grafted single chains increases with M n in a manner consistent with the Fox–Flory equation, but the coefficient quantifying the M n dependence of T g is only (36 ± 6)\% the value of bulk PS. In addition, the value of T g in the M n → ∞ limit is about 25 °C below the bulk T g but more than 15 °C above that of (untethered) PS nanoparticles with D 0 ≈ 100 nm suspended in a solution. Our findings are consistent with T g of our single chains being dominated by simultaneous effects of the interfaces, which depress T g , and end-grafting, which enhances T g . The latter is believed to exert its influence on the glass transition dynamics by a mechanism reliant on chain connectivity and does not vary with chain length.},

In order to access low supersaturation values, we use a seeding approach method and perform simulations with and without HIs. We compute the nucleation rates for the two cases and surprisingly find good agreement between them. The nucleation rate in both cases follows the trend of the previous numerical results, thereby corroborating the discrepancy between experiments and simulations. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of fivefold symmetric clusters (FSCs) in a supersaturated fluid under different physical conditions, following the idea that FSCs compete against nucleation. To this end, we explore the role of the softness of the pair interactions, different solvent viscosities, and different sedimentation rates in simulations that include HIs. We do not find significant variations in the amount of FSCs, which might reflect the irrelevance of these three features on the nucleation process.},

In the formulation and liquid-state processing of nanocomposite materials, particle alignment by external fields such as electric, magnetic, or flow fields is practically inevitable and often works against the emergence of large nanoparticle networks. Using continuum percolation theory in conjunction with Onsager theory, we investigate how the interplay between externally induced alignment and the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the uniaxial nematic phase affects cluster formation in nanoparticle dispersions. It is known that particle alignment by means of a density increase or by an external field may result in a breakdown of an already percolating network. As a result, percolation can be limited to a small region of the phase diagram only. Here, we demonstrate that the existence and shape of such a “percolation island” in the phase diagram crucially depends on the connectivity length—a critical distance defining direct connections between neighboring particles. For some values of the connectivity range, we observe unusual re-entrance effects, in which a system-spanning network forms and breaks down multiple times with increasing particle density.},

In the simulations, excluded volume interactions normally are included but can be “switched off,” and thus, the influence of excluded volume (leading to deviations from predictions of the wormlike chain model) can be identified. It is shown that the variation in the adsorption threshold ϵ w a l l c r with ℓ p is compatible with the predicted law ϵ w a l l c r ∝ ℓ p − 1 / 3 ⁠ . In the vicinity of the adsorption threshold, the coils are still three-dimensional, and for large ℓ p , the effect of the excluded volume is almost negligible, while for strongly adsorbed chains it is always felt. Near the transition, the decay length of orientational correlations along the chain contour increases gradually from ℓ p to 2 ℓ p . While the latter value is expected for strictly two-dimensional chains from the Kratky–Porod model, this model is inaccurate for the description of lateral chain dimensions of long, strongly adsorbed, semiflexible polymers due to its neglect of excluded volume. The significance of these findings for the interpretation of pertinent experiments is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The excitation of dark plasmons, i.e., coupled plasmon modes with a vanishing net dipole, is expected to favor Landau damping over radiative damping. Dark plasmon excitation might, therefore, lead to an increased absorption of energy within gold nanoparticles, resulting in a strong generation of hot electrons compared to the generation via bright plasmons. We performed transient-absorption spectroscopy on gold nanoparticle films to assess the initial electronic temperature before thermalization. We observe a significant increase in the electron–phonon coupling time when dark plasmon modes are excited in these films. The results indicate an efficient energy absorption due to the suppressed radiative decay of dark plasmon modes and a subsequent energy transformation into hot electrons.},

We use variable-charge molecular dynamics simulations based on the reactive force field ReaxFF. We show that non-covalent functionalization of nanotubes, driven by π − π interactions, is effective for all the polymers studied, thanks to their conjugated backbone and regardless of the presence of specific functional groups. The geometry at equilibrium of these polymer/CNT hybrids is analyzed in detail at the scale of each fluorene or carbazole unit. The role of both the functional groups and the alkyl chain length is analyzed in detail. Adsorption of the polymers on the nanotube sidewalls is shown to be either complete—with the whole chain physisorbed—or partial—due to intrachain coiling or interchain repulsion—depending on the initial geometry, number of polymers, and nanotube diameter. Energetic arguments supplement the described geometric features. Both energetic and geometric adsorption features are derived here for the first time for large diameter carbon nanotubes (up to 9 nm) and fluorene/carbazole copolymers having up to 30 monomers and bearing different functional groups. The force field ReaxFF and its available parameterization used for the simulations are validated, thanks to a benchmark and review on higher-level quantum calculations—for simple π − π interacting compounds made up of polycyclic aromatic molecules adsorbed on a graphene sheet or bilayer graphene. Although it is shown that the influence of the nanotube chirality on the adsorption pattern and binding strength cannot be discussed with our method, we highlight that an available force field such as ReaxFF and its parameterization can be transferable to simulate new systems without specific re-parameterization, provided that this model is validated against reference methods or data. This methodology proves to be a valuable tool for optimal polymer design for nanotube functionalization at no re-parameterization cost and could be adapted to simulate and assist the design of other types of molecular systems.},

  abstract = {Metal halide perovskites constitute a new type of semiconducting materials with long charge carrier lifetimes and efficient light-harvesting. The performance of perovskite solar cells and related devices is limited by nonradiative charge and energy losses, facilitated by defects. Combining nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and time-domain density functional theory, we demonstrate that charge losses depend strongly on the defect chemical state. By considering an extra Pb atom in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 , which is a common defect in lead halide perovskites, we investigate its influence on charge trapping and recombination. In a chemically inert form as a Pb interstitial, the extra Pb atom has only a mild influence on charge recombination. However, if the extra Pb atom binds to a native Pb atom to form a dimer, the charge trapping and recombination are greatly accelerated because the Pb-dimer creates a localized midgap trap state that couples strongly to the perovskite valence band edge. Holes disappear from the valence band two orders of magnitude faster than in the pristine perovskite and recombine with conduction band electrons one order of magnitude faster. The simulations identify the phonon modes involved in the nonradiative charge trapping and recombination and highlight the importance of rapid decoherence within the electronic subsystem for long carrier lifetimes. The detailed atomistic analysis of the charge trapping and recombination mechanisms enriches the understanding of defect properties and provides theoretical guidance for improving perovskite performance.},

Spinel NiCo 2 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4 @MWCNT composites were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The supercapacitive performance of as-synthesized NiCo 2 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4 @MWCNT fabricated on Ni-foam was studied in a 0.5M K 2 SO 4 electrolyte using electrochemical measurement techniques. The symmetric cell configuration of NiCo 2 O 4 @MWCNT delivers high specific capacitance (374 F/g at 2 A/g) with high energy density and power density (95 Wh/kg and 3 964 W/kg, respectively) compared to that of pristine NiCo 2 O 4 electrodes (137 F/g at 0.6 A/g). Furthermore, the energy storage performance of the asymmetric cells of NiCo 2 O 4 //MWCNT and NiCo 2 O 4 @MWCNT//MWCNT was studied to enhance cycling stability (retention of 74.85\% over 3000 cycles). We have also theoretically studied the supercapacitance performance of pristine NiCo 2 O 4 and NiCo 2 O 4 @SWCNT hybrid structures through its structural and electronic properties using density functional theory predictions. The higher specific capacitance of the NiCo 2 O 4 @SWCNT hybrid system with high power density and energy density is supported by the enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and increased quantum capacitance of the hybrid structure. We have theoretically computed the diffusion energy barrier of K + ions of the K 2 SO 4 electrolyte in the NiCo 2 O 4 layer and compared it with the diffusion barrier for Na + ions. The lesser diffusion energy barrier for K + ions in the NiCo 2 O 4 layer contributes toward higher energy storage capacity. Thus, owing to superior electrochemical performance of NiCo 2 O 4 composites with MWCNTs, it can serve as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications.},

The corresponding solar cells based on the x = 0.6 absorber show the highest device performance. Despite having a low Urbach energy, higher Sn-content solar cells show reduced device performances as the amount of degradation via oxidation is the most substantial.},

Selected CdSe quantum dots with absorption energies close to those of Ag and Au nanoparticles are chosen to construct model systems with ZnO to comprehend the role of ZnO’s intrinsic defects and plasmonic excitation in realizing the spectrally selective luminescence enhancement. Excitation wavelength dependent photoluminescence spectra along with theoretical models quantifying the related transitions and plasmonic absorption reveal that a complex mechanism of charge transfer between the ZnO nanorods and metal nanoparticles or quantum dots is essential along with an optimal energy band alignment for realizing emission enhancement. The theoretical model presented also provides a direct method of quantifying the relative transition rate constants associated with various electronic transitions in ZnO and their change upon the incorporation of plasmonic nanoparticles. The results indicate that, while the presence of deep level defect states may facilitate the essential charge transfer process between ZnO and the plasmonic nanoparticles, their presence alone does not guarantee UV emission enhancement and strong plasmonic coupling between the two systems. The results offer clues to designing novel multicomponent systems with coupled plasmonic and charge transfer effects for applications in charge localization, energy harvesting, and luminescence enhancement, especially in electrically triggered nanophotonic applications.},

We present here a study examining the adsorption and reaction of methanol on magnetite Fe 3 O 4 (001) at cryogenic temperatures using a combination of temperature programmed desorption, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy. The methanol desorption profile from Fe 3 O 4 (001) is complex, exhibiting peaks at 140 K, 173 K, 230 K, and 268 K, corresponding to the desorption of intact methanol, as well as peaks at 341 K and 495 K due to the reaction of methoxy intermediates. The saturation of a monolayer of methanol corresponds to ∼5 molecules/unit cell (u.c.), which is slightly higher than the number of surface octahedral iron atoms of 4/u.c. We probe the kinetics and thermodynamics of the desorption of molecular methanol using inversion analysis. The deconvolution of the complex desorption profile into individual peaks allows for calculations of both the desorption energy and the prefactor of each feature. The initial 0.7 methanol/u.c. reacts to form methoxy and hydroxy intermediates at 180 K, which remain on the surface above room temperature after intact methanol has desorbed. The methoxy species react via one of two channels, a recombination reaction with surface hydroxyls to form additional methanol at ∼350 K and a disproportionation reaction to form methanol and formaldehyde at ∼500 K. Only 20\% of the methoxy species undergo the disproportionation reaction, with most of them reacting via the 350 K pathway.},

Different NP shapes exhibit variations of emerging facets, and processes such as adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic activity are, in general, facet sensitive. Therefore, NP properties, e.g., the reactivity of NPs or the stability of assembled NPs, depend on their shape. We combine computational modeling based on density functional theory with experimental techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray powder diffraction to investigate the ability of various adsorbates, including hydrohalic and carboxylic acids, to influence NP shape. This approach allows us to identify mechanisms stabilizing specific surface facets and thus to predict NP shapes using computational model systems and to experimentally characterize the synthesized NPs in detail. Shape-controlled anatase TiO 2 NPs are synthesized here in agreement with the calculations in platelet and bi-pyramidal shapes by employing different precursors. The importance of the physical conditions and chemical environment during synthesis, e.g., via competitive adsorption or changes in the chemical potentials, is studied via ab initio thermodynamics, which allows us to set previous and new results in a broader context and to highlight potentials for additional synthesis routes and NP shapes.},

At low adsorption temperature (160 K), cysteine stays intact on all studied surfaces. However, the thermal stability differs dramatically. Decomposition via dehydrogenation, decarbonylation/decarboxylation, and deamination starts already below room temperature on Pt(111). By contrast, adsorbed cysteine is stable up to 500 K on Fe 3 O 4 (111) and then gets oxidized in a redox reaction involving the Fe 3 O 4 substrate. FeO(111)/Pt(111) is a special case, where decarbonylation of cysteine occurs below room temperature, which is most likely initiated by a structural modification and concomitant charge transfer at the Pt-FeO interface induced by the carboxyl group of the adsorbed cysteine. The experimental results suggest that cysteine binds to the surfaces with the carboxyl group on the iron oxides and with the carboxyl and amino groups on Pt(111).},

  abstract = {Motions of two distinct ions can get correlated because the polarization induced by the ions can propagate through intervening water and can interfere with each other. This important aspect, which is not included in the continuum model based theories, has not been studied adequately. We calculate the effective force between two oppositely charged and similarly charged ions fixed in water as a function of separation distance R. At short separations, R less than 1.5 nm, the effective force vastly differs from the 1/ε s R 2 dependence advocated by the screened Coulomb’s force law (SCFL), where ε s is the static dielectric constant of the medium. This breakdown of the SCFL is shown to be due to the persistent interference between the polarizations created by the two charges in a manner similar to the vortex–antivortex pair formation in the XY model Hamiltonian. The distance dependence of dielectric constants, ε s (R), extracted from our simulation exhibits interesting features and can be used in future modeling. In addition, we show that the force–force time autocorrelation between two neighboring ions decays differently at short separation and analyze the friction on the ion pair at different separation distances.},

Theoretical calculations predict that the first excited state (A 2 A) presents a real minimum on its PES and possesses a nonplanar structure. The adiabatic excitation energy at the MRCI+Q and MRCI-F12 levels shows that the A 2 A state lies in the near-infrared region.

The harmonic vibrational frequencies and rotational constants of the weakly bound complex OH–O 2 in the two electronic states were predicted to help in its detection.

The adiabatic ionization energy is determined to be 71 319 cm −1 ± 5 cm −1 (8.8424 ± 0.0006 eV). It is found that the activity in the ZEKE spectra varies greatly for different levels and is consistent with the assignments of the S 1 levels of m -fluorotoluene ( m FT) deduced in the recent fluorescence study of Stewart et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 174303 (2019)] and the ZEKE study from Kemp et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 084311 (2019)]. As with m FT, the intensities in the ZEKE spectra of m ClT are consistent with a phase change in the torsional potential upon ionization, allowing a large number of torsions and vibtor levels to be observed for the cation. Vibration-induced modifications of the torsional potential are discussed. Calculated vibrational wavenumbers for the S 0 , S 1 , and D 0 + states are also presented.},

Instead of the intuitively expected symmetry of C 2 v ⁠ , as in o -xylene, calculations with a variety of methods (B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, ω B97XD, MP2, and coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples) predict a C 2 symmetry structure in which the two CF 3 groups rotate in opposite directions by about 16°. While the experimental results in this study are not capable of proving this unusual symmetry, they can support future microwave, gas phase electron diffraction or nuclear magnetic resonance studies. From the presented data, a preliminary r 0 structure was determined, reproducing the experimental rotational constants with deviations of no more than 15 kHz. Analysis of the interactions between the two CF 3 groups using an effective fragment potential approach identifies two major contributions to their interaction, due to exchange-repulsion and electrostatic repulsion, with electrostatic repulsion responsible for the barrier at the C 2 v geometry.},

In γ -valerolactone, ring-puckering is not a viable relaxation channel and the only available reaction pathway is ring-opening, which occurs within one vibrational period along the C—O bond. In 5H-furan-2-one, the C=C double bond in the ring allows for ring-puckering which slows down the ring-opening process by about 150 fs while only marginally reducing its quantum yield. This demonstrates that ring-puckering is an ultrafast process, which is directly accessible upon excitation and which spreads the excited state wave packet quickly enough to influence even the outcome of an otherwise expectedly direct ring-opening reaction.},

One such method is dissipative particle dynamics with energy conservation (DPDE), which has been used for various fluid systems with non-uniform temperature distributions. We propose an easily parallelizable modification of the velocity-Verlet algorithm based on local energy redistribution for each DPDE particle such that the total energy in a simulated system is conserved up to machine precision. Furthermore, transport properties of a DPDE fluid are analyzed in detail. In particular, an analytical approximation for the thermal conductivity coefficient is derived, which allows its a priori estimation for a given parameter set. Finally, we provide approximate expressions for the dimensionless Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, which characterize fluid transport properties and can be adjusted independently by a proper selection of model parameters. In conclusion, our results strengthen the DPDE method as a very robust approach for the investigation of mesoscopic systems with temperature inhomogeneities.},

The successes and the caveats of the approach are carefully pinpointed. Compared to molecular simulations with the same force field and the same fixed solute geometries, the theory describes accurately the solvation of cations, less so that of anions or generally H-bond acceptors. Overall, the electrostatic contribution to solvation free-energies of neutral molecules is correctly reproduced. On the other hand, the cavity contribution is poorly described but can be corrected using scaled-particle theory ideas. Addition of a physically motivated, one-parameter cavity correction accounting for both pressure and surface effects in the nonpolar solvation contribution yields a precision of 0.8 kcal/mol for the overall hydration free energies of the whole Mobley’s dataset. Inclusion of another one-parameter cavity correction for the electrostatics brings it to 0.6 kcal/mol, that is, k B T . This is accomplished with a three-orders of magnitude numerical speed-up with respect to molecular simulations.},

The photoelectron spectrum is calculated by the construction of a Hamiltonian model, in which the two totally symmetric modes ν 19 (the Cr–C stretching mode) and ν 39 (the C–O stretching mode) together with the spin-orbit (SO) coupling up to the zeroth-order SO splitting are treated. The potential energy curves along these two vibrational modes are computed by using the DFT. The simulated photoelectron spectrum is found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental one, leading to the conclusion that the potential energy surfaces and the diabatic population analysis are accurately determined.

  abstract = {This work deals with the problem of strongly correlated electrons in two-dimensions. We give a reduced density matrix (RDM) based tool through which the ground-state energy is given as a functional of the natural orbitals and their occupation numbers. Specifically, the Piris Natural Orbital Functional 7 (PNOF7) is used for studying the 2D Hubbard model and hydrogen square lattices. The singlet ground-state is studied, as well as the doublet mixed quantum state obtained by extracting an electron from the system. Our method satisfies two-index necessary N-representability conditions of the two-particle RDM (2RDM) and guarantees the conservation of the total spin. We show the ability of PNOF7 to describe strong correlation effects in two-dimensional (2D) systems by comparing our results with the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. PNOF7 overcomes variational 2RDM methods with two- and three-index positivity N-representability conditions, reducing computational cost to mean-field scaling. Consistent results are obtained for small and large systems up to 144 electrons, weak and strong correlation regimes, and many filling situations. Unlike other methods, there is no dependence on dimensionality in the results obtained with PNOF7 and no particular difficulties have been observed to converge PNOF7 away from half-filling. Smooth double occupancy of sites is obtained, regardless of the filling. Symmetric dissociation of 2D hydrogen lattices shows that long-range nondynamic correlation dramatically affects electron detachment energies. PNOF7 compares well with DMRG along the dissociation curve.},

  abstract = {The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method has become one of the most popular methods for the studies of the open quantum system. However, its applicability to systems at ultra-low temperatures is largely restrained by the enormous computational cost, which is caused by the numerous exponential functions required to accurately characterize the non-Markovian memory of the reservoir environment. To overcome this problem, a Fano spectrum decomposition (FSD) scheme has been proposed recently [Cui et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 024110 (2019)], which expands the reservoir correlation functions using polynomial-exponential functions and hence greatly reduces the size of the memory basis set. In this work, we explicitly establish the FSD-based HEOM formalisms for both bosonic and fermionic environments. The accuracy and efficiency of the FSD-based HEOM are exemplified by the calculated low-temperature dissipative dynamics of a spin-boson model and the dynamic and static properties of a single-orbital Anderson impurity model in the Kondo regime. The encouraging numerical results highlight the practicality and usefulness of the FSD-based HEOM method for general open systems at ultra-low temperatures.},

However, the modeling beyond the single active electron approximation is still difficult. Time-dependent configuration interaction with singly excited configurations and a complex absorbing potential (TDCIS-CAP), can be used to simulate single and double ionization by intense laser fields. When the monocation does not have degenerate states, TDCIS-CAP starting from a Hartree–Fock calculation of the cation is suitable for simulating the second ionization step. When the monocation has two or more degenerate states, the simulations should treat these degenerate states equivalently. CISD-IP (single and double excitation configuration interaction with ionization) can be used to treat degenerate states of the cation on an equal footing by representing the cation wavefunctions with ionizing single (1 hole) and double (2 holes/1 particle) excitations from the neutral molecule. Since CISD-IP includes single excitations for each of the monocation states, time dependent CISD-IP with a complex absorbing potential (TDCISDIP-CAP) can also be used to simulate ionization to the dications states. In this work, TDCIS-CAP and TDCISDIP-CAP have been used to simulate the angular dependence of ionization of the neon cation and acetylene cation. In both cases, the second electron is ionized predominantly from an orbital perpendicular to the orbital involved in the first ionization. The TDCISDIP-CAP simulations show some features involving interactions between the monocation states that are not seen in the TDCIS-CAP simulations.},

However, this simple and efficient approach is unable to account for the “anomalous” bond-breaking kinetics increasingly observed in force spectroscopy experiments and simulations, e.g., in the form of non-exponential distributions of bond lifetimes under constant load. Here, we show that such characteristic traits arise naturally in a rigorous extension of the one-dimensional theory that accounts for the transient dynamics of a generic set of coupled degrees of freedom. These “hidden modes” affect the reaction dynamics in various ways, depending on their relaxation spectrum and the loading protocol, giving rise, in particular, to apparent static and dynamic disorder. In two complementary asymptotic limits, we are able to find exact analytical expressions for pertinent experimental observables, such as the mean rupture force and the rupture–force distribution. Intriguingly, our asymptotic results become unconditionally exact at high loading rates, thus providing us with a microscopically consistent theory of rapid force spectroscopy that avoids the usual Markov assumption.},

  abstract = {Marcus and Landauer–Büttiker approaches to charge transport through molecular junctions describe two contrasting mechanisms of electronic conduction. In previous work, we have shown how these charge transport theories can be unified in the single-level case by incorporating lifetime broadening into the second-order quantum master equation. Here, we extend our previous treatment by incorporating lifetime broadening in the spirit of the self-consistent Born approximation. By comparing both theories to numerically converged hierarchical-equations-of-motion results, we demonstrate that our novel self-consistent approach rectifies shortcomings of our earlier framework, which are present especially in the case of relatively strong electron–vibrational coupling. We also discuss circumstances under which the theory developed here simplifies to the generalized theory developed in our earlier work. Finally, by considering the high-temperature limit of our new self-consistent treatment, we show how lifetime broadening can also be self-consistently incorporated into Marcus theory. Overall, we demonstrate that the self-consistent approach constitutes a more accurate description of molecular conduction while retaining most of the conceptual simplicity of our earlier framework.},

The third-generation charge optimized many-body potential is employed to determine the validity of uniform spherical representations of the nanoparticles in predicting dissolution potentials (the Kelvin model). To understand the early stages of catalyst dissolution, implicit solvation techniques based on the self-consistent continuum solvation method are applied. It is demonstrated that interfacial charge and polarization can shift the dissolution energies by amounts on the order of 0.74 eV depending on the surface site and nanoparticle shape, leading to the unexpected preferential removal of platinum cations from highly coordinated sites in some cases.},

The potentials are optimized as such to reproduce the excited-state energy surface obtained using time-dependent density functional theory, but can be generalized to other more accurate quantum chemical methods. We believe that the presented method is not only suitable for studies on excited-state proton transfer and ion mobility in general systems but can also be extended to investigate more involved processes, such as photo-induced isomerization.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of metal atoms on nanostructures, such as graphene and nanotubes, plays an important role in catalysis, electronic doping, and tuning material properties. Quantum chemical calculations permit the investigation of this process to discover desirable interactions and obtain mechanistic insights into adsorbate behavior, of which the binding strength is a central quantity. Binding strengths, however, vary widely in the literature, even when using almost identical computational methods. To address this issue, we investigate the adsorption of a variety of metals onto graphene, carbon nanotubes, and boron nitride nanotubes. As is well-known, calculations on periodic structures require a sufficiently large system size to remove interactions between periodic images. Our results indicate that there are both direct and indirect mechanisms for this interaction, where the latter can require even larger system sizes than typically employed. The magnitude and distance of the effect depends on the electronic state of the substrate and the open- or closed-shell nature of the adsorbate. For instance, insulating substrates (e.g., boron nitride nanotubes) show essentially no dependence on system size, whereas metallic or semi-metallic systems can have a substantial effect due to the delocalized nature of the electronic states interacting with the adsorbate. We derive a scaling relation for the length dependence with a representative tight-binding model. These results demonstrate how to extrapolate the binding energies to the isolated-impurity limit.},

Using a continuous wave anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy technique recently developed in our laboratory, in this study, we measured the temperature and lifetime of hot electrons in gold and copper nanostructures in order to understand how the choice of metal impacts hot electron dynamics during steady state illumination. We found that hot electrons in copper are more abundant and more reactive than those in gold, suggesting that copper nanostructures may be a more promising platform for performing hot electron photochemistry.},

  abstract = {Rare events are processes that occur upon the emergence of unlikely fluctuations. Unlike what their name suggests, rare events are fairly ubiquitous in nature, as the occurrence of many structural transformations in biology and material sciences is predicated upon crossing large free energy barriers. Probing the kinetics and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of possible barrier crossings in a system is critical to predicting and controlling its structural and functional properties. Due to their activated nature, however, rare events are exceptionally difficult to study using conventional experimental and computational techniques. In recent decades, a wide variety of specialized computational techniques—known as advanced sampling techniques—have been developed to systematically capture improbable fluctuations relevant to rare events. In this perspective, we focus on a technique called forward flux sampling [Allen et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 124 , 024102 (2006)] and overview its recent methodological variants and extensions. We also provide a detailed overview of its application to study a wide variety of rare events and map out potential avenues for further explorations.},

  abstract = {Organisms often use cyclic changes in the concentrations of chemical species to precisely time biological functions. Underlying these biochemical clocks are chemical reactions and transport processes, which are inherently stochastic. Understanding the physical basis for robust biochemical oscillations in the presence of fluctuations has thus emerged as an important problem. In a previous paper [C. del Junco and S. Vaikuntanathan, Phys. Rev. E 101 , 012410 (2020)], we explored this question using the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of single-ring Markov state models of biochemical networks that support oscillations. Our finding was that they can exploit non-equilibrium driving to robustly maintain the period and coherence of oscillations in the presence of randomness in the rates. Here, we extend our work to Markov state models consisting of a large cycle decorated with multiple small cycles. These additional cycles are intended to represent alternate pathways that the oscillator may take as it fluctuates about its average path. Combining a mapping to single-cycle networks based on first passage time distributions with our previously developed theory, we are able to make analytical predictions for the period and coherence of oscillations in these networks. One implication of our predictions is that a high energy budget can make different network topologies and arrangements of rates degenerate as far as the period and coherence of oscillations are concerned. Excellent agreement between analytical and numerical results confirms that this is the case. Our results suggest that biochemical oscillators can be more robust to fluctuations in the path of the oscillator when they have a high energy budget.},

A rich variety of cluster structures are observed as a function of trap steepness, trap size, and particle density. In addition to the consistent results with previous studies for a harmonic confinement, we observe some new stable structures, including a hybrid cluster structure consisting of clumps surrounded by a circular stripe, parallel stripes, or homogeneous voids surrounded by a ringlike arrangement of clumps, and a gear-like cluster with fringed outer rims evenly arranged along the circumference. Our work reveals that such self-organized structures arise due to the radial density reconfiguration in a finite confined system corresponding to the unconstrained systems, which is controlled by the interplay between the long-range repulsions and the attractions to the minimum of the confinement potential. Such results are likely relevant in understanding the structural properties of confined mermaid systems.},

A general expression is derived based on local particle concentration and osmotic pressure differences that are balanced by forces on colloids due to energy landscape gradients. This analysis is applied to colloidal particles in high frequency AC electric fields within octupolar electrodes, where the energy landscape can be shaped in two dimensions. These results are also directly applicable to any particles having induced dipoles in spatially non-uniform electromagnetic fields. Predictions based on modeling colloids with an effective hard disk equation of state indicate inhomogeneous solid and fluid states coexisting on different shaped energy landscapes including multiple minima. Model predictions show excellent agreement with time-averaged Brownian dynamic simulations at equilibrium. Findings demonstrate a general approach to understand colloidal phase behavior on energy landscapes due to external fields, which could enable control of colloidal microstructures on morphing energy landscapes and the inverse design of fields to assemble hierarchically structured colloidal materials.},

We study the segmental dynamics of star polymer melts via molecular dynamics simulations and examine the cooperative nature of segmental motion in star melts. In particular, we quantify how the molecular architecture of star polymers, i.e., the number of arms and the length of those arms, affects the glass transition temperature T g , the non-Gaussian nature of molecular displacements, the collective string-like motion of monomers, and the role of chain connectivity in the cooperative motion. Although varying the number of arms f and the molecular mass M a of the star arms can significantly influence the average star molecular shape, all our relaxation data can be quantitatively described in a unified way by the string model of glass formation, an activated transport model that derives from the Adam–Gibbs model, where the degree of cooperative motion is identified with the average length L of string-like particle exchange motions observed in our simulations. Previous work has shown the consistency of the string model with simulations of linear polymers at constant volume and constant pressure, as well as for thin supported polymer films and nanocomposites with variable polymer–surface interactions, where there are likewise large mobility gradients as in the star polymer melts studied in the present paper.},

Although the intermediated precursors that play a role in determining the polymorphs are predominantly bcc ordered, the polymorph selection is rather different at different stages. The precursors that have a relatively high orientational order will be on average in a denser region than uniform liquids, but microscopically the crystal nucleation happens without a density change. The average density of nuclei first increases significantly, and then almost keeps independent on the crystallite size after the growing post-critical nucleus becomes large enough. With such a large enough system, the crystal growth rate is able to be calculated directly by doing a linear fit to the temporal evolution of growing crystallite size. The obtained value of the growth rate indicates that the actual crystal growth in the Lennard-Jones system where the crystal–liquid interface has several kinds of structures is possibly driven by both collision-controlled and diffusion-controlled mechanisms.},

In the existing implementations, radial site–site interaction potentials are assumed, thus precluding extensive coarse-graining that usually requires anisotropic potentials. In this work, we extended the force-matching approach to coarse-grained models with axially symmetric sites and implemented it to the UNRES model of polypeptide chains developed in our laboratory, in which the only interaction sites are united peptide groups and united side chains, the α -carbon atoms serving as anchor points. The optimizable parameters were those of the UNRES energy function and not whole potential profiles, which provide better transferability. We tested the implementation with the 20-residue tryptophan-cage miniprotein, selected as the training protein, starting from the NEWCT-9P variant of UNRES. The reference forces were obtained from implicit- and explicit-solvent simulations. Using a target function composed of a force-matching term and a maximum-likelihood term that drives the force field at reproducing the NMR-determined conformational ensembles at three selected temperatures, force fields were obtained which did not produce site–site clashes for the structures simulated with all-atom molecular dynamics with AMBER, and modeled the structures of α -helical proteins with resolution comparable to that of the NEWCT-9P force field. The new force fields also produced the free-energy landscapes of tryptophan cage similar to those obtained from the all-atom molecular dynamics runs.},

Nitrogen (N 2 ) is known to dissociate on iron surfaces, a precursor for ammonia production in the Haber–Bosch process, where the dissociation of N 2 is the limiting step in the reaction under equilibrium conditions. However, little is known about N 2 adsorption on other iron-based materials, such as iron oxide surfaces that are ubiquitous in soils, steel pipelines, and other industrial materials. An atomistic description is reported for the binding of N 2 on the Fe 3 O 4 (001) surface using first principles calculations with ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Two primary adsorption sites are experimentally identified from N 2 dissociation on Fe 3 O 4 (001). The electronic signatures associated with the valence band region unambiguously show how the electronic structure of magnetite transforms near ambient pressures due to the binding of atomic nitrogen to different surface sites. Overall, the experimental and theoretical results of our study bridge the gap between ultra-high vacuum studies and reaction conditions to provide insight into other nitrogen-based chemistry on iron oxide surfaces that impact the agriculture and energy industries.},

  abstract = {In the presence of advection at a constant flow rate in a rectilinear geometry, the properties of planar A + B → C reaction fronts feature the same temporal scalings as in the pure reaction–diffusion case. In a radial injection geometry where A is injected into B radially at a constant flow rate Q , temporal scalings are conserved, but the related coefficients depend on the injection flow rate Q and on the ratio γ of initial concentrations of the reactants. We show here that this dependence of the front properties on the radial velocity allows us to tune the amount of product obtained in the course of time by varying the flow rate. We compare theoretically the efficiency of the rectilinear and radial geometries by computing the amount of product C generated in the course of time or per volume of reactant injected. We show that a curve γ c ( Q ) can be defined in the parameter space ( γ , Q ) below which, for similar experimental conditions, the total amount of C is larger in the radial case. In addition, another curve γ * ( Q ) &lt; γ c ( Q ) can be defined such that for γ &lt; γ * , the total amount of C produced is larger in the radial geometry, even if the production of C per unit area of the contact interface between the two reactants is larger in the rectilinear case. This comes from the fact that the length of the contact zone increases with the radius in the radial case, which allows us to produce in fine more product C for a same injected volume of reactant or in reactors of a same volume than in the rectilinear case. These results pave the way to the geometrical optimization of the properties of chemical fronts.},

  abstract = {Catalytic transformation of methane (CH 4 ) into methanol in a single step is a challenging issue for the utilization of CH 4 . We present a direct method for converting CH 4 into methanol with high selectivity over a Pt/CeO 2 catalyst which contains ionic Pt 2+ species supported on a CeO 2 nanoparticle. The Pt/CeO 2 catalyst reproducibly yielded 6.27 mmol/g of Pt with a selectivity of over 95\% at 300 °C when CH 4 and CO are used as reactants, while the catalyst had a lower activity when using only CH 4 without CO. Active lattice oxygen created on the Pt and CeO 2 interface provides selective reaction pathways for the conversion of CH 4 to methanol. Based on high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption near-edge structure, extended x-ray absorption fine structure, catalytic studies, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanistic pathway involving CH 4 activation at the active site in the vicinity of Pt 2+ species.},

Despite differing by only one oxygen atom, the stoichiometric Ti 3 O 6 and the sub-stoichiometric (“reduced”) Ti 3 O 5 clusters exhibit very different structures and preferred binding sites. The Ti 3 O 6 clusters bind at step edges and form small assemblies (2–4 clusters) on Au terraces, while the “reduced” Ti 3 O 5 clusters form much larger fractal-like assemblies that can extend across step boundaries. Annealing the Ti 3 O 5,6 /Au(111) systems to higher temperatures causes changes in the size-distributions of cluster assemblies, but does not lead to the formation of TiO x nanoislands for temperatures ≤700 K. Reactivity studies show that the reduced Ti 3 O 5 cluster has higher activity than Ti 3 O 6 for 2-propanol dehydration, although both clusters exhibit substantial activity for dehydrogenation to acetone. Calculations using DFT+U suggest that the differences in aggregate morphology and reactivity are associated with the number of undercoordinated Ti 3c sites in the supported clusters.},

  abstract = {Tin dioxide (SnO 2 ) has various applications due to its unique surface and electronic properties. These properties are strongly influenced by Sn oxidation states and associated defect chemistries. Recently, the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into less harmful molecules has been demonstrated using SnO 2 catalysts. A common VOC, 2-propanol (isopropyl alcohol, IPA), has been used as a model compound to better understand SnO 2 reaction kinetics. We have used ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) to characterize the surface chemistry of IPA and O 2 mixtures on stoichiometric, unreconstructed SnO 2 (110)-(1 × 1) surfaces. AP-XPS experiments were performed for IPA pressures ≤3 mbar, various IPA/O 2 ratios, and several reaction temperatures. These measurements allowed us to determine the chemical states of adsorbed species on SnO 2 (110)-(1 × 1) under numerous experimental conditions. We found that both the IPA/O 2 ratio and sample temperature strongly influence reaction chemistries. AP-XPS valence-band spectra indicate that the surface was partially reduced from Sn 4+ to Sn 2+ during reactions with IPA. In situ mass spectrometry and gas-phase AP-XPS results indicate that the main reaction product was acetone under these conditions. For O 2 and IPA mixtures, the reaction kinetics substantially increased and the surface remained solely Sn 4+ . We believe that O 2 replenished surface oxygen vacancies and that SnO 2 bridging and in-plane oxygen are likely the active oxygen species. Moreover, addition of O 2 to the reaction results in a reduction in formation of acetone and an increase in formation of CO 2 and H 2 O. Based on these studies, we have developed a reaction model that describes the catalytic oxidation of IPA on stoichiometric SnO 2 (110)-(1 × 1) surfaces.},

We report a detailed study of the x-ray induced desorption of a number of neutral, cationic, and anionic species from amorphous solid water. We discuss the desorption mechanisms and the relative contributions of Auger and secondary electrons (x-ray induced electron stimulated desorption) and initial excitation (direct desorption) as well as the role of photochemistry. Anions are shown to desorb not just through processes linked with secondary electrons but also through direct dissociation of the core-excited molecule. The desorption spectra of oxygen ions (O + , OH + , H 2 O + , O − , and OH − ) give a new perspective on their previously reported very low desorption yields for most types of irradiations of water, showing that they mostly originate from the dissociation of photoproducts such as H 2 O 2 .},

However, experimentally tuning the plasmon resonance of such dimers for the observation is difficult. In this work, we calculate the anti-crossing property of dimers coated with thin dye films according to the classical electromagnetism. This property is quantitatively evaluated according to the coupled oscillator model composed of a plasmon and a molecular exciton representing the molecular multi-level system. A comparison of the film thickness dependences of dimer spectral changes with those of silver ellipsoidal NPs indicates that the dipole plasmons localized in the dimer gap are coupled with molecular excitons of the film much stronger than the dipole plasmons of ellipsoidal NPs. Furthermore, the anti-crossing behavior of coupled resonances is investigated while tuning plasmon resonance by changing the morphology and refractive index of the surrounding medium. The spectral changes observed for ellipsoidal NPs clearly exhibit anti-crossing property; however, the anti-crossing behavior of dimers is more complex due to the strong coupling of dipoles and higher-order plasmons with multiple molecular excitons. We find that the anti-crossing for dimers is clearly confirmed by the refractive index dependence of coupled resonance.},

  abstract = {A clear understanding of the structural transformation of copper-oxide-based oxygen carriers accompanying their reduction by fuels helps to design more efficient oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion. Herein, density functional theory calculations have been performed on the bulk CuO, CuO(111) surface, and (CuO) 32 cluster models with the same number of CuO molecular units to investigate structural transformation accompanying the reduction. The results showed that the averaged reaction energies of desorbing an oxygen molecule from the bulk and surface models are roughly the same [246.2 kJ/(mol O 2 ) and 245.9 kJ/(mol O 2 ), respectively]. The slab model does not significantly lower the overall reaction energy compared to the bulk model. In contrast, the averaged reaction energy using the cluster model is significantly lower [127.5 kJ/(mol O 2 )] than that of bulk and slab models. The key structural difference is the obvious Cu–Cu bond formation in the cluster model, which would result in nucleation of a metallic Cu phase. The results also showed that different states can be reached by desorbing different number oxygen atoms in a single step, corresponding to different reaction rates, when the system reaches the same level of reduction. These results demonstrate the complexity of reactions involving solid state materials and are consistent with the structural diversity observed experimentally. This study illustrates the importance of particle sizes and reaction conditions in the formation of suboxides during CuO reduction.},

In this work, we extend the theoretical investigation to systems containing size-asymmetric electrolytes that may exhibit a vapor-liquid like phase transition in the bulk phase. The effects of pore size and surface electric potential on the phase diagram and microscopic structures of the confined electrolytes were studied over a broad range of parameters. We found that decreasing the pore size or increasing the surface potential could destabilize the liquid phase in micropores, and capillary evaporation could occur regardless of the size asymmetry between cations and anions. Compared to that in a symmetric ionic system, the vapor-liquid phase separation is more likely to take place as the size asymmetry becomes more pronounced. The phase transition would alter the “accessibility” of ions to micropores and lead to coexisting micropores with different surface charge densities as identified by Monte Carlo simulation.},

We investigate to what extent differences in the spontaneous curvature of the two lipids affect the line tension. To this end, we supplement the standard Landau-Ginzburg model for the line tension between coexisting phases by an elastic energy that accounts for lipid splay and tilt. The spontaneous curvature of the two lipids enters into our model through the splay deformation energy. We calculate the structure of the interfacial region and the line tension between the coexisting domains numerically and analytically, the former based on the full non-linear model and the latter upon employing an approximation in the free energy that linearizes the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations. We demonstrate that our analytical approximation is in excellent agreement with the full non-linear model and use it to identify relevant length scales and two physical regimes of the interfacial profile, double-exponential decay, and damped oscillations. The dependence of the line tension on the spontaneous curvatures of the individual lipids is crucially dependent on how the bulk phases are affected. In the special case that the bulk phases remain inert, the line tension decreases when the difference between the spontaneous curvatures of the two lipid types grows.},

Scanning tunneling microscopy images acquired at a mesoscopic scale indicate that Fe oxide grows layer-by-layer on the bare Ni(111) surface, while the nucleation of three-dimensional clusters is induced by graphene. Atomically resolved images reveal that Fe oxide adopts an in-plane lattice constant similar to that of the FeO(111) surface when deposited on Ni(111) and graphene/Ni(111), indicating in both cases, a weak interaction between the overlayer and the substrate.

In this study, we developed a model of a graphene nanobubble based on classical density functional theory and the elastic theory of membranes. The proposed model takes into account the inhomogeneity of the enclosed substance, the nonrigidity of the wall, and the alternating volume. As an example application, we utilize the developed model to investigate fluid argon inside graphene nanobubbles at room temperature. We observed a constant height-to-radius ratio over the whole range of radii considered, which is in agreement with the results from experiments and molecular dynamics simulations.

A partially permeable membrane presents a time-tuneable feature that changes the effective pore interaction with the solute and thus actively changes permeability with time. In general, we find that slow flickering frequencies effectively decrease the osmotic pressure and large flickering frequencies do not change it. In the presence of an asymmetric membrane, we find a resonant frequency where pumping of the solute is performed and can be analyzed in terms of ratchet transport. We discuss and highlight the properties of this resonant osmotic transport. Furthermore, we show that dynamic osmosis allows us to pump the solute at the nanoscale using less energy than reverse osmosis.

  abstract = {The interfaces between metal oxides and liquids represent the next frontier in the study of oxide chemistry. In this work, (110)-oriented rutile TiO 2 wafers were annealed in oxidative atmospheres and immersed in aqueous KCl solutions of pH 3, 6, and 11. Topographic imaging of the TiO 2 wafers was carried out in solution via atomic force microscopy using the frequency-modulation force detection technique. Crystalline terraces of 100 nm in width were observed with no sign of solution-induced etching. In a pH-6 solution, ridges parallel to the [001] axis with trenches in between were observed and assigned to the rows of oxygen anions protruding from the surface plane to the solution. Individual anions were further resolved in the ridges, revealing atomic-size protrusions located on the (1 × 1) meshes of the (110) truncation. The topography in an acidic solution (pH 3) was similar to that observed in a neutral solution and could be interpreted as protruding oxygen anions covered partially by protons. In a basic solution with pH 11, qualitatively different features were observed; atomic-size swellings formed a p(2 × 1) superstructure covering the surface, which was hypothesized to be Ti–OH − on five-fold coordinated Ti cations in the surface plane. These results show the feasibility of advanced atomic force microscopy for probing metal-oxide surfaces submerged in liquids.},

  abstract = {Indium oxide has received attention as an exciting candidate for catalyzing the CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol due to its high selectivity (&gt;80\%). Compared to the extent of research on the activity of indium oxide-based powder catalysts, very little is known about the phenomena associated with the formation of surface alloys involving indium or the growth mechanism for indium oxide nanoparticles. In this report, scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to elucidate the growth mode, structure, and chemical state of In/Au(111) alloys and InO x /Au(111) inverse model catalysts. Our study reveals distinct morphological differences between In/Au(111) and InO x /Au(111), and the InO x structure also depends strongly on the preparation conditions. In/Au surface alloy systems with extremely low coverage (0.02 ML) form islands preferentially on the elbow sites of reconstructed Au(111) herringbone, regardless of hexagonally closed packed and face centered cubic stacking. At higher coverage (0.1 ML), the In islands expand over the herringbone in the ⟨110⟩ direction and create two dimensional domain structures over the entire surfaces. Moreover, this 2D domain structure is disturbed by temperature with high dispersion of indium atoms observed during the annealing process. Oxidation of the In/Au(111) surface alloys with O 2 at 550 K produces InO x /Au(111) systems which contain various sizes of InO x aggregates (from 0.7 nm to 10 nm). On the other hand, InO x /Au(111) surfaces prepared by vapor deposition of In at 550 K in an O 2 background exhibit highly dispersed and uniformly small InO x particles (∼1 nm). Both InO x systems were confirmed to be partially oxidized by XPS.},

Finally, under 2 × 10 4 L, the film fully transformed to hematite α-Fe 2 O 3 (0001), maintaining a high single-crystal quality. A comparison of the conversion electron Mössbauer spectra and low energy electron diffraction pattern showed that at intermediate oxidation stages, hematite dominated at the surface, whereas a spinel phase was still observed in the deeper layers. The magnetite–hematite conversion was fully reversed by annealing under ultra-high vacuum at temperatures exceeding 600 K, and despite a change in morphology, the magnetite film preserved the original crystal structure and orientation.},

  abstract = {The vibrational Infrared and Raman spectra of six interstitial oxygen defects in silicon containing a Si—O—Si bridge between adjacent Si atoms are obtained from all-electron B3LYP calculations within a supercell scheme, as embodied in the CRYSTAL code. Two series of defects have been considered, starting from the single interstitial defect, O 1 . The first consists of four defects, O 1, n , in which two O 1 defects are separated by (n − 1) Si atoms, up to n = 4. The second consists of four defects, O n , in which nO 1 defects surround a single Si atom, with n = 1–4, where O 4 has the same local nearest neighbor structure as α -quartz. For both series of defects, the equilibrium geometries, charge distributions, and band structures are reported and analyzed. The addition of 1–4 oxygen atoms to the perfect lattice generates 3–12 new vibrational modes, which, as a result of the lighter atomic mass of O with respect to Si, are expected to occur at wavenumbers higher than 521 cm −1 , the highest frequency of pristine silicon, thereby generating a unique new Raman spectrum. However, only a small subset of these new modes is found in the spectrum. They appear at 1153 cm −1 (O 1 ), at 1049 cm −1 and 1100 cm −1 (O 1,2 ), at 1108 cm −1 (O 1,3 ), at 1130 cm −1 and 1138 cm −1 (O 1,4 ), and 773 cm −1 , 1057 cm −1 , and 1086 cm −1 (O 4 ), and can be considered “fingerprints” of the respective defects, as they are sufficiently well separated from each other. Graphical animations indicate the nature and intensity of each of the observed modes which are not overtones or combinations.},

With these new results, two semi-empirical models for the Soret effect, which are based on the pseudo-isotope effect and on the single-component thermophobicities, could significantly be expanded and put on a broader common experimental basis. In particular, for the longer alkanes, above decane, a simplified version of the pseudo-isotope effect yields a good description. In the dilute limit, the agreement of the chemical contributions to the Soret coefficient is perfect, but there are some unexplained systematic deviations at finite concentrations. We have used these Soret coefficients, together with the measurements of 1-bromonaphthalene in the n -alkanes, to expand the database for the thermophobicities of equimolar binary mixtures. Due to a vanishing mixing term in symmetric mixtures, the heats of transport computed from the Soret coefficients can be considered as differences in additive single component properties, the thermophobicities. This allows an ordering of the substances according to these numbers. In a binary mixture, the component with the higher thermophobicity migrates toward the cold side. With the new measurements, the database now contains 24 compounds with 107 out of 276 possible binary mixtures measured.},

Detection of D 2 H + indicates a formation process involving two hydrogen atoms from the methyl side of the molecule and a proton from the hydroxyl side, while detection of D 3 + indicates local formation involving only the methyl group. Both mechanisms are thought to involve a neutral D 2 moiety. An adaptive control strategy that employs image-based feedback to guide the learning algorithm results in an enhancement of the D 2 H + / D 3 + ratio by a factor of approximately two. The optimized pulses have secondary structures 110–210 fs after the main pulse and result in photofragments that have different kinetic energy release distributions than those produced from near transform limited pulses. Systematic changes to the linear chirp and higher order dispersion terms of the laser pulse are compared to the results obtained with the optimized pulse shapes.},

The reactivity of Mn x MoO y − ( x = 1, 2; y = 3, 4) clusters toward H 2 O was investigated via time-of-flight mass spectrometry with clear evidence of cluster oxidation and corresponding H 2 production, specifically for Mn x MoO 3 − ( x = 1, 2) clusters. Unlike previously studied Mo x O y − clusters, which assumed a broad distribution of stoichiometries (typically x ≤ y ≤ 3 x ), both MnMoO y − and Mn 2 MoO y − preferentially formed y = 3 and 4 compositions in significant quantities under our source conditions. The electronic and molecular structures of the Mn x MoO y ( x = 1, 2; y = 3, 4) anion and neutral clusters were probed with anion photoelectron spectroscopy and analyzed with supporting density functional theory calculations. Our studies suggest that both metal centers are involved in initial cluster–water complex formation, while Mo is the center that undergoes oxidation; hence, reactivity terminates when Mo is saturated in its highest oxidation state of +6. Across these four clusters, Mn remains relatively reduced and is stable in a high-spin electronic configuration. The preferential reactivity of water molecules toward the Mo center rather than Mn is rationalized by the much lower relative oxophilicity of Mn.},

  abstract = {Nanoscale plasmonic field enhancement at sub-wavelength metallic particles is crucial for surface sensitive spectroscopy, ultrafast microscopy, and nanoscale energy transduction. Here, we demonstrate control of the spatial distribution of localized surface plasmon modes at sub-optical-wavelength crystalline silver (Ag) micropyramids grown on a Si(001) surface. We employ multiphoton photoemission electron microscopy (mP-PEEM) to image how the plasmonic field distributions vary with the photon energy, light polarization, and phase in coherent two-pulse excitation. For photon energy hυ &gt; 2.0 eV, the mP-PEEM images show single photoemission locus, which splits into a dipolar pattern that straddles the Ag crystal at a lower energy. We attribute the variation to the migration of plasmon resonances from the Ag/vacuum to the Ag/Si interfaces by choice of the photon energy. Furthermore, the dipolar response of the Ag/Si interface follows the polarization state of light: for linearly polarized excitations, the plasmon dipole follows the in-plane electric field vector, while for circularly polarized excitations, it tilts in the direction of the handedness due to the conversion of spin angular momentum of light into orbital angular momentum of the plasmons excited in the sample. Finally, we show the coherent control of the spatial plasmon distribution by exciting the sample with two identical circularly polarized light pulses with delay defined with attosecond precision. The near field distribution wobbles at the pyramid base as the pump–probe delay is advanced due to interferences among the contributing fields. We illustrate how the frequency, polarization, and pulse structure can be used to design and control plasmon fields on the nanofemto scale for applications in chemistry and physics.},

Steady-state entropy and diffusive noise strength can be neglected in this limit. The relevance to biological, ecological, and climate models is apparent.},

  abstract = {For the rational design of new fluorophores, reliable predictions of fluorescence quantum yields from first principles would be of great help. However, efficient computational approaches for predicting transition rates usually assume that the vibrational structure is harmonic. While the harmonic approximation has been used successfully to predict vibrationally resolved spectra and radiative rates, its reliability for non-radiative rates is much more questionable. Since non-adiabatic transitions convert large amounts of electronic energy into vibrational energy, the highly excited final vibrational states deviate greatly from harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. We employ a time-dependent formalism to compute radiative and non-radiative rates for transitions and study the dependence on model parameters. For several coumarin dyes, we compare different adiabatic and vertical harmonic models (AS, ASF, AH, VG, VGF, and VH), in order to dissect the importance of displacements, frequency changes, and Duschinsky rotations. In addition, we analyze the effect of different broadening functions (Gaussian, Lorentzian, or Voigt). Moreover, to assess the qualitative influence of anharmonicity on the internal conversion rate, we develop a simplified anharmonic model. We address the reliability of these models considering the potential errors introduced by the harmonic approximation and the phenomenological width of the broadening function.},

The relaxation process involves the reorganization of spin state populations and the decay of spin state coherences. In general, individual populations and coherences may exhibit different relaxation time constants. Particular spin configurations may exhibit exceptionally long relaxation time constants. Such spin configurations are known as long-lived spin order. The existence of long-lived spin order is a direct consequence of the symmetries of the system. For nuclear spin systems, rotational and permutational symmetries are of fundamental importance. Based on the Schur–Weyl duality theorem, we describe a theoretical framework for the study of rotational and permutational dual-symmetries in the context of long-lived spin order. Making use of the proposed formalism, we derive refined bounds on the number on long-lived spin populations and coherences for systems exhibiting rotational-permutational dual-symmetries.},

It was recently shown [E. Ospadov et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 115 , E11578–E11585 (2018)] to yield chemically relevant bonding distances, in line with known empirical values. In this work, we show that extension of the concept to non-integer electron number yields additional information about atomic systems and can be used to detect the difficulty of adding or subtracting electrons. Notably, it reflects the ease of bonding in open p -shells and its greater difficulty in open s -shells. The latter manifests in significant discontinuities in the turning radius as the electron number changes the principal quantum number of the outermost electronic shell (e.g., going from Na to Na 2+ ). We then show that a non-integer picture is required to correctly interpret bonding and dissociation in H 2 + ⁠ . Results are consistent when properties are calculated exactly or via an appropriate approximation. They can be interpreted in the context of conceptual density functional theory.},

  abstract = {Molecule-metal interfaces have a broad range of applications in nanoscale materials science. Accurate characterization of their electronic structures from first-principles is key in understanding material and device properties. The GW approach within many-body perturbation theory is the state-of-the-art and can in principle yield accurate quasiparticle energy levels and interfacial level alignments that are in quantitative agreement with experiments. However, the interfaces are large heterogeneous systems that are currently challenging for first-principles GW calculations. In this work, we develop a GW -based dielectric embedding approach for molecule-metal interfaces, significantly reducing the computational cost of direct GW without sacrificing the accuracy. To be specific, we perform explicit GW calculations only in the simulation cell of the molecular adsorbate, in which the dielectric effect of the metallic substrate is embedded. This is made possible via a real-space truncation of the substrate polarizability and the use of the interface plasma frequency in the adsorbate GW calculation. Here, we focus on the level alignment at weakly coupled molecule-metal interfaces, i.e., the energy difference between a molecular frontier orbital resonance and the substrate Fermi level. We demonstrate our method and assess a few GW -based approximations using two well-studied systems, benzene adsorbed on the Al (111) and on the graphite (0001) surfaces.},

  abstract = {Dipole-bound anions can be theoretically characterized at three fundamentally different levels. The highest are ab initio calculations, which themselves range from fairly approximate, say, Koopmans’s Theorem (KT) or second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, to highly sophisticated, say, the electron affinity equation-of-motion couple-cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple substitutions, which rivals experiments in reliability. The next level down is represented by one-electron model Hamiltonians. Again, one-electron model Hamiltonians can be fairly approximate, especially if the molecular system is modeled by a simple point-dipole and point-polarizable site; however, very reliable models have been developed for specific systems, for example, water clusters. At the lowest level, one can qualitatively explain trends in classes of dipole-bound anions in terms of the dipole moment, μ , the polarizability, α , and the so-called excluded volume, V x . This project aims at the qualitative level. While the dipole moment and the polarizability possess clear-cut definitions, the excluded volume must—similar to all molecular volumes—remain a rather vaguely defined term, and so far, we are unaware of any quantitative definition in the literature. Here, we introduce and investigate three descriptors for V x . To this end, we first establish a dataset with consistent ab initio results for 25 amine N -oxides structures. Then, we demonstrate that the descriptors are indeed able to explain trends for sets of isomers and conformers and investigate to what extent the descriptors are able to predict electron binding energy of dipole-bound states using simple quantitative structure-property relationship-like models. It turns out that μ and V x provide a reasonably accurate prediction of the electrostatic part of the electron bind energy (the KT value) and that the polarizability α provides an acceptable prediction of the electron correlation contribution.},

  abstract = {Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) has been effectively applied to very large configuration interaction (CI) problems and was recently adapted for use as an active space solver and combined with orbital optimization. In this work, we detail an approach within FCIQMC to allow for efficient sampling of fully internally contracted multireference perturbation theories within the same stochastic framework. Schemes are described to allow for the close control over the resolution of stochastic sampling of the effective higher-body intermediates within the active space. It is found that while complete active space second-order perturbation theory seems less amenable to a stochastic reformulation, strongly contracted N -Electron Valence second-order Perturbation Theory (NEVPT2) is far more stable, requiring a similar number of walkers to converge the sc-NEVPT2 expectation values as to converge the underlying CI problem. We demonstrate the application of the stochastic approach to the computation of sc-NEVPT2 within a (24, 24) active space in a biologically relevant system and show that small numbers of walkers are sufficient for a faithful sampling of the sc-NEVPT2 energy to chemical accuracy, despite the active space already exceeding the limits of practicality for traditional approaches. This raises prospects of an efficient stochastic solver for multireference chemical problems requiring large active spaces, with an accurate treatment of external orbitals.},

Here, we present an analytical expression for the reduced density operator in terms of an effective Hamiltonian for a high temperature case. Comparing with numerically exact results, we show that our theory is accurate for slow baths and up to intermediate system–bath coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that the equilibrium state does not depend on the shape of spectral density in the slow bath regime. The key quantity in our theory is the effective coupling between the states, which depends exponentially on the ratio of the reorganization energy to temperature and, thus, has opposite temperature dependence than could be expected from the small polaron transformation.},

Such forcefields can be classified as “soft” or “hard” based on the value of the partial charge attributed to Si atoms, wherein softer forcefields rely on smaller partial charges. Here, we use machine learning to efficiently explore the “landscape” of Buckingham forcefields for silica, that is, the evolution of the overall forcefield accuracy as a function of the forcefield parameters. Interestingly, we find that soft and hard forcefields correspond to two distinct, yet competitive local minima in this landscape. By analyzing the structure of the silica configurations predicted by soft and hard forcefields, we show that although soft and hard potentials offer competitive accuracy in describing the short-range order structure, soft potentials feature a higher ability to describe the medium-range order.},

Experimentally, non-defective structures are almost impossible to achieve due to synthetic constraints. Therefore, it is crucial to account for vacancies when evaluating the characteristics of these materials. The electronic structure of oxygen-depleted oxides deeply differs from that of the native forms, in particular, of reducible metal oxides, where excess electrons can localize in various distinct positions. In this perspective, we present recent developments from our group describing the complexity of these defective materials that highlight the need for an accurate description of (i) intrinsic vacancies in polar terminations, (ii) multiple geometries and complex electronic structures with several states attainable at typical working conditions, and (iii) the associated dynamics for both vacancy diffusion and the coexistence of more than one electronic structure. All these aspects widen our current understanding of defects in oxides and need to be adequately introduced in emerging high-throughput screening methodologies.},

As a simple means to describe these experimental and simulated data, Buchenberg et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7 , 25 (2016)] suggested a master equation model that accounts for the energy transport from an initially excited residue to some target residue. The transfer rates of the model were obtained from two scaling rules, which account for the energy transport through the backbone and via tertiary contacts, respectively, and were parameterized using simulation data of a small α -helical protein at low temperatures. To extend the applicability of the model to general proteins at room temperature, here a new parameterization is presented, which is based on extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a number of model systems. With typical transfer times of 0.5–1 ps between adjacent residues, backbone transport represents the fastest channel of energy flow. It is well described by a diffusive-type scaling rule, which requires only an overall backbone diffusion coefficient and interatom distances as input. Contact transport, e.g., via hydrogen bonds, is considerably slower (6–30 ps) at room temperature. A new scaling rule depending on the inverse square contact distance is suggested, which is shown to successfully describe the energy transport in the allosteric protein PDZ3. Since both scaling rules require only the structure of the considered system, the model provides a simple and general means to predict energy transport in proteins. To identify the pathways of energy transport, Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations are performed, which highlight the competition between backbone and contact transport channels.},

These biomolecular condensates include certain extracellular materials and intracellular compartments that are characterized as “membraneless organelles.” Analytical theories are a valuable, computationally efficient tool for addressing general principles. LLPS of neutral homopolymers is quite well described by theory, but it has been a challenge to develop general theories for the LLPS of heteropolymers involving charge-charge interactions. Here, we present a theory that combines a random-phase-approximation treatment of polymer density fluctuations and an account of intrachain conformational heterogeneity based on renormalized Kuhn lengths to provide predictions of LLPS properties as a function of pH, salt, and charge patterning along the chain sequence. Advancing beyond more limited analytical approaches, our LLPS theory is applicable to a wide variety of charged sequences ranging from highly charged polyelectrolytes to neutral or nearly neutral polyampholytes. This theory should be useful in high-throughput screening of protein and other sequences for their LLPS propensities and can serve as a basis for more comprehensive theories that incorporate nonelectrostatic interactions. Experimental ramifications of our theory are discussed.},

Characterization of the microscopic reaction processes that underlie these phenomena have yielded insights into the progression of such diseases and may inform rational approaches for the design of drugs to halt them. Experimental evidence suggests that most of these reaction processes are intrinsically catalytic in nature and may display enzymelike saturation effects under conditions typical of biological systems, yet a unified modeling framework accounting for these saturation effects is still lacking. In this paper, we therefore present a universal kinetic model for biofilament formation in which every fundamental process in the reaction network can be catalytic. The single closed-form expression derived is capable of describing with high accuracy a wide range of mechanisms of biofilament formation and providing the first integrated rate law of a system in which multiple reaction processes are saturated. Moreover, its unprecedented mathematical simplicity permits us to very clearly interpret the effects of increasing saturation on the overall kinetics. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by fitting it to the data of in vitro Aβ40 aggregation. Remarkably, we find that primary nucleation becomes saturated, demonstrating that it must be heterogeneous, occurring at interfaces and not in solution.},

  abstract = {SAFT-γ Mie, a molecular group-contribution equation of state with foundations in the statistical associating fluid theory framework, is a promising means for developing accurate and transferable coarse-grained force fields for complex polymer systems. We recently presented a new approach for incorporating bonded potentials derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations into fused-sphere SAFT-γ Mie homopolymer chains by means of a shape factor parameter, which allows for bond distances less than the tangent-sphere value required in conventional SAFT-γ Mie force fields. In this study, we explore the application of the fused-sphere SAFT-γ Mie approach to copolymers. In particular, we demonstrate its capabilities at modeling poly(vinyl alcohol- co -vinyl butyral) (PVB), an important commercial copolymer widely used as an interlayer in laminated safety glass applications. We found that shape factors determined from poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(vinyl butyral) homopolymers do not in general correctly reproduce random copolymer densities when standard SAFT-γ Mie mixing rules are applied. However, shape factors optimized to reproduce the density of a random copolymer of intermediate composition resulted in a model that accurately represents density across a wide range of chemical compositions. Our PVB model reproduced copolymer glass transition temperature in agreement with experimental data, but heat capacity was underpredicted. Finally, we demonstrate that atomistic details may be inserted into equilibrated fused-sphere SAFT-γ Mie copolymer melts through a geometric reverse-mapping algorithm.},

We model a rough colloidal particle as a spherical core with small beads embedded on its surface. The critical point of smooth spherical particle systems predicted by theory and simulations is in quantitative agreement. An increase in surface roughness due to an increase in either the number of beads or the diameter of the beads has a modest effect on the local structure of the system in the supercritical region. In contrast, increasing surface roughness consistently shifts the vapor–liquid coexistence curves to higher temperatures. The critical temperature is found to be a quadratic function of the number of beads. At a fixed bead size and number of beads, the critical temperature does not vary with the arrangement of beads on the core. Both IET and GEMC simulations predict that unlike critical temperatures, critical packing fractions vary non-monotonically with surface roughness. We find that the feasibility and accuracy of the integral equation theory depend sensitively on the chosen closure combination.},

The model-free method assumes no specific mathematical form, such as reciprocal linearity, and the configurational properties are referred to an isochronal state to eliminate the bias associated with the definition of the ideal glassy state. The scaling ability of a given configurational property is strongly material-dependent with the logarithm of τ scaling better with TS c and H c for poly(vinyl acetate), with TS c , H c , and U c for poly(vinyl chloride), and with TS c , H c , and V c for linear and star polystyrene.

V 2 p , O 1 s , C 1 s , and valence band XPS spectra were collected as a function of relative humidity in a series of isotherm and isobar experiments. Experiments were carried out on two VO 2 thin films on TiO 2 (100) substrates, prepared with different surface cleaning procedures. Hydroxyl and molecular water surface species were identified, with up to 0.5 ML hydroxide present at the minimum relative humidity, and a consistent molecular water adsorption onset occurring around 0.01\% relative humidity. The work function was found to increase with increasing relative humidity, suggesting that surface water and hydroxyl species are oriented with the hydrogen atoms directed away from the surface. Changes in the valence band were also observed as a function of relative humidity. The results were similar to those observed in APXPS experiments on other transition metal oxide surfaces, suggesting that H 2 O–OH and H 2 O–H 2 O surface complex formation plays an important role in the oxide wetting process and water dissociation. Compared to polycrystalline vanadium metal, these vanadium oxide films generate less hydroxide and appear to be more favorable for molecular water adsorption.},

We found that the MEL is negative, i.e., the EL decreases with the applied field strength, B . In addition, the MEL( B ) response has a Lorentzian line shape whose width depends on the perovskite used. We interpret the MEL( B ) response using the “ Δg mechanism” in which the spin of the injected electron–hole (e–h) pairs oscillates between singlet and triplet configurations due to different precession frequencies of the electron and hole constituents that originate from the difference, Δg , in the electron and hole gyromagnetic constants, g . In this model, the MEL( B ) linewidth is inversely proportional to the spin lifetime and Δg . The model used is validated by directly measuring the spin lifetime of photogenerated e–h pairs using the circularly polarized pump–probe transmission technique with 100 fs resolution.},

Hydrogen peroxide adsorbed dissociatively on CeO 2 forming adsorbed peroxo (O—O) species, as observed through vibrational features at 890 cm −1 and (830–855) cm −1 (FTIR). The signal at 890 cm −1 disappeared when a pulse of propylene was passed through the catalyst, and at the same time, adsorbed PO was observed (a sharp IR mode at 827 cm −1 ; ring deformation). The reaction between gas phase propylene and adsorbed peroxide species suggested the Eley–Rideal type mechanism. The absence of a ring opening reaction of PO at room temperature may indicate that CeO 2 can be a suitable oxide for epoxidation of hydrocarbons. PO started to decompose above 323 K, as observed from FTIR and TPD results. TPD spectra of PO show its desorption at 365 K, with a small fraction decomposing into acetaldehyde and formaldehyde due to partial decomposition, while CO 2 and CO are released at higher temperatures.

Here, we investigate charge transfer and recombination at the interface between the thiophene-based semiconducting ligands and the lead halide inorganic sublattices using time-resolved photoluminescence and transient reflection spectroscopy in single two-dimensional perovskite crystals. These measurements demonstrate the charge transfer time around 10 ps and long-lived charge-separated state over the nanosecond time scale in two-dimensional ligand-perovskite heterostructures.

  abstract = {Semiconductor–metal heterojunction nanostructures possess an ability to store electrons upon photoexcitation through Fermi level equilibration. The unique role of capping ligands in modulating the equilibration of Fermi level in CdSe–Au heteronanostructures is explored by taking alkyl thiols and alkyl amines as examples. Alkyl thiol having its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) above the valence band of the heterojunction nanostructure inhibits the exciton recombination by scavenging the photogenerated hole. This leads to the elevation in the Fermi level of Au and equilibration with the conduction band of CdSe. The Fermi level equilibrated electrons are further transferred to an acceptor molecule such as methyl viologen, demonstrating the potential of heterojunction nanostructures capped with hole accepting ligands for charge transport application in photovoltaics. In contrast, alkyl amine being a non-hole acceptor ligand with its HOMO placed below its valence band promotes rapid Au mediated exciton recombination, limiting its usefulness in charge transport application. Thus, the energetics of ligands on heterojunction nanostructures plays a decisive role in Fermi level equilibration.},

Here, we consider the likely mechanisms that underlie this strong photoresponse. We investigate the role of the plasmonic layer and examine the response using silver and gold nanoparticles of similar dimensions and spatial arrangement. The effect on local doping, strain, and absorption properties of the hybrid is also probed by photocurrent measurements and Raman and UV-visible spectroscopy. We find that the local doping from the silver nanoparticles is stronger than that from gold and correlates with a measured photosensitivity that is larger in devices with a higher contact area between the plasmonic nanomaterials and the graphene layer.},

  abstract = {Employing molecular photoswitches, we can combine solar energy conversion, storage, and release in an extremely simple single molecule system. In order to release the stored energy as electricity, the photoswitch has to interact with a semiconducting electrode surface. In this work, we explore a solar-energy-storing model system, consisting of a molecular photoswitch anchored to an atomically defined oxide surface in a liquid electrolyte and under potential control. Previously, this model system has been proven to be operational under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. We used the tailor-made norbornadiene derivative 2-cyano-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)norbornadiene (CNBD) and characterized its photochemical and electrochemical properties in an organic electrolyte. Next, we assembled a monolayer of CNBD on a well-ordered Co 3 O 4 (111) surface by physical vapor deposition in UHV. This model interface was then transferred into the liquid electrolyte and investigated by photoelectrochemical infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy experiments. We demonstrate that the anchored monolayer of CNBD can be converted photochemically to its energy-rich counterpart 2-cyano-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)quadricyclane (CQC) under potential control. However, the reconversion potential of anchored CQC overlaps with the oxidation and decomposition potential of CNBD, which limits the electrochemically triggered reconversion.},

  abstract = {The key process in organic solar cell operation is charge separation under light illumination. Due to the low dielectric constant of organic materials, the Coulomb attraction energy within the interfacial charge-transfer state (CTS) is larger than the thermal energy. Understanding the mechanism of charge separation at the organic donor/acceptor interface still remains a challenge and requires knowledge of the CTS temporal evolution. To address this problem, the CTS in the benchmark photovoltaic blend PCDTBT/PC 71 BM was studied by the out-of-phase Electron Spin Echo (ESE). The protocol for determining the CTS geminate recombination rate for certain electron-hole distances was developed. Simulating the out-of-phase ESE trace for the CTS in the PCDTBT/PC 71 BM blend allows precise determination of the electron-hole distance distribution function and its evolution with the increase in the delay after the laser flash. Distances of charge separation up to 6 nm were detected upon thermalization at a temperature of 20 K. Assuming the exponential decay of the recombination rate, the attenuation factor β = 0.08 Å −1 is estimated for the PCDTBT/PC 71 BM blend. Such a low attenuation factor is probably caused by a high degree of hole delocalization along the PCDTBT chain.},

Different orientations with different symmetries can result in different nanostructures based on the dimers. Interestingly, the residual segments of ABA molecules can generate four Cu adatoms as the coordination center on Cu(100) to form a novel coordination complex after annealing, which is the first report for trapping four adatoms as a coordination center.

On the contrary, 13\% of adsorbed HCOOH molecules were already dissociated into monodentate formate species on Cu(997) even at 83 K and 17\% of adsorbed formic acid molecules were transformed to bidentate formate species by heating at 300 K, indicating that the stepped Cu surface has higher reactivity for HCOOH dissociation at low temperature. On the Zn-Cu(997) surface, 20\% of formic acid became bidentate formate species in contrast to the case with Zn-Cu(111). Thus, the Zn deposited Cu step surface shows special activity for adsorption and dissociation of formic acid. The desorption peak maxima of the formate decomposition products (CO 2 and H 2 ) on Zn-Cu(997) were shifted to higher temperatures than those on Cu(997). Zn on Cu surfaces plays an important role in the stabilization of formate species, which probably leads to the decrease in the activation barrier for hydrogenation on the Zn-Cu alloyed surface.},

  abstract = {Surface chemistry and photochemistry of small molecules on the rutile TiO 2 (001) and TiO 2 (011)-(2 × 1) surfaces were studied by low energy electron diffraction, thermal desorption spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the TiO 2 (001) surface mainly exhibits the defects of Ti interstitials in the near-surface region, while the TiO 2 (011)-(2 × 1) surface mainly exhibits the defects of double-oxygen vacancies. The defect structures of TiO 2 surfaces strongly affect their adsorption and thermal/photodesorption behaviors. On the TiO 2 (001) surface, CH 3 OH and H 2 O dissociatively adsorb at the surface Ti sites near Ti interstitials; O 2 molecularly adsorbs at the surface Ti sites adjacent to Ti interstitials, forming photoactive O 2 species that undergoes a hole-mediated photodesorption process; CO adsorbs at the nearest surface Ti sites close to the Ti interstitials, but CO 2 does not, and the resulting CO species is photoactive; and both CO and CO 2 species adsorbed at the normal Ti 4+ sites are photoinactive. On the TiO 2 (011)-(2 × 1) surface, O 2 adsorbs only at the double-oxygen vacancy sites, and the resulting O 2 species dissociates to form two oxygen atoms to refill in the oxygen vacancies upon heating; CO 2 adsorbs at the double-oxygen vacancy sites, but CO does not, and the resulting CO 2 species is photoactive; and both CO and CO 2 species adsorbed at the surface Ti 4+ sites are photoinactive. These results broaden the fundamental understandings of the chemistry and photochemistry of TiO 2 surfaces, and the established structure–reactivity relation of small molecules on TiO 2 surfaces is useful in probing complex structures of TiO 2 powder catalysts.},

  abstract = {Cs is a promoter of Cu-based catalysts for the synthesis of alcohols from CO 2 hydrogenation. Scanning tunneling microscopy and ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to study the morphology and chemical properties of surfaces generated by the deposition of cesium on Cu 2 O/Cu(111) and Cu(111) substrates. CsO x nanostructures were formed after Cs metal was deposited on Cu 2 O/Cu(111) at 300 K. The formed CsO x protrude over the surface of copper oxide by 2–4 Å, with the dimension at the base of the nanostructures being in the range of 1–3 nm. Heating to elevated temperature induced significant changes in the size and dispersion of the CsO x nanostructures, and there was a clear reconstruction of the copper oxide substrate, which then exhibited long range order with a hexagonally packed structure. The as-deposited and annealed surfaces of CsO x /Cu 2 O/Cu(111) were more reactive toward CO 2 than plain Cu 2 O/Cu(111) or clean Cu(111). However, none of them were stable in the presence of H 2 , which fully reduced the copper oxide at 400–450 K. In CsO x /Cu(111), the CsO x nanoclusters were dispersed all over the metallic copper in no particular order. The CsO x species had an average width of 2 nm and ∼1 Å height. The CsO x /Cu(111) systems exhibited the highest activity for the binding and dissociation of CO 2 , suggesting that the CsO x -copper interface plays a key role in alcohol synthesis.},

  abstract = {Continued interest regarding the rheometric measurements of molten sulfur has persisted due to the need for industrial-scale transportation and handling of the material in a liquid phase. This has allowed for extended research developments to attain a fundamental understanding of the fluid. This work reports novel high temperature modulus data over the λ-transition region for liquid elemental sulfur, measured through the use of a modified Anton-Paar Modular Compact Rheometer 302. From these measurements, further insight was gained on the viscoelastic behavior and reptative relaxation times for liquid elemental sulfur. The slow relaxation time, τ s , related to reptative behavior, was found to be between 0.24 s and 0.28 s at 190 °C. Utilizing the Maxwell relation, this was determined to correspond to an estimated viscosity range from 72 000 × 10 −3 Pa s to 95 000 × 10 −3 Pa s, which is in agreement with previous viscosity studies on liquid sulfur. A Cole–Cole plot of the experimental data also displayed characteristics of Debye-like relaxation, suggesting that the slow relaxation process was related to local S-S bond scission and recombination in sulfur chains and was not a relaxation coinciding with a polymeric chain mode. Finally, consecutive heating and cooling of the sulfur sample gave replicate values up to 210 °C on the third heating cycle, where an apparent structural change took place possibly due to cycling over the secondary transition, producing a thermal history, or sulfur reactions with trace impurities. This 210 °C temperature was found to have some recurrence within the literature.},

The temperature-dependent evolution of the 31 P NMR spectral line shapes indicates that the constituent PO 4 tetrahedral chains in this liquid undergo rapid rotational reorientation. The time scale of this dynamics is in complete agreement with that of shear relaxation and, thus, must be responsible for the viscous flow of this liquid. These results demonstrate for the first time that, although the shear relaxation of the network oxide glass-forming liquids is typically controlled by the scission and renewal of bonds between the network-forming cations and oxygen atoms, such a scenario may not always be tenable for liquids with low-dimensional structures consisting of chains.},

The degree of crystallization of the polymer film at long times decreases progressively with increasing f , and no crystallization is observed beyond f = 8. Crystallization for smaller values of f develops as a sigmoidally shaped wavefront initiating from the supporting crystalline interface. We suggest that large shape fluctuations and the competition of length scales of star polymers with high f lead to inhibited crystallization.},

SbH 2 exhibits only three LIF bands, assigned as 2 1 0 ⁠ , 0 0 0 ⁠ , and 2 0 1 ⁠ , with a fluorescence lifetime (τ), which decreases from ∼50 ns for 0 0 to &lt;10 ns for 2 1 . LIF transitions to the 0 0 (τ ∼ 2 µ s), 2 1 (τ ∼ 400 ns), and 2 2 (τ ∼ 75 ns) upper vibronic states of SbD 2 were also observed. High-resolution spectra exhibited large spin-rotation splittings and small resolved antimony hyperfine splittings due to a substantial Fermi contact interaction in the excited state. The experimentally determined rotational constants gave effective molecular structures of r 0 ″ = 1.724(2) Å, θ 0 ″ = 90.38(7)° and r 0 ′ = 1.693(6) Å, θ 0 ′ = 120.6(3)°. The ground state bending vibrational levels up to eight quanta (6404 cm −1 ) in SbH 2 and 12 quanta (6853 cm −1 ) in SbD 2 were measured from dispersed fluorescence spectra.

  abstract = {Benchmark ab initio calculations have been performed for poly( p -phenylenevinylene) (PPV) dimers, a paradigmatic material for studying excitation energy transfer mechanisms. Second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory was utilized with the scaled opposite spin approach (SOS-MP2) and correlation consistent basis sets to determine the geometric properties and interaction energies in the ground state. Vertical excitations and optimized structures for the S 1 state were computed using the SOS second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction method. For the ground state properties, extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit and correction for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) were performed. While all results computed with different basis sets and considering BSSE correction or not agreed at the CBS limit, a strong bias was observed either using augmented basis sets or BSSE corrections, proving that these approaches are not advisable for calculating intermolecular distances and interaction energies with smaller basis sets. The lower states for vertical excitations were largely local excitons where the hole/electron pair was confined to single chains. For higher excited states, interchain charge transfer (CT) states were also observed. Geometry optimization of the S 1 state led to significant reductions in the intermolecular distances and energetic stabilization, with Stokes shifts between 1.4 eV and 0.9 eV (with increasing chain length), and significant CT values between 0.5 e and 0.4 e .},

We demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to an initial-state preparation effect of photoexcitation that leads to similar initial populations of triplet states for both optical excitation regions. Due to the low intersystem crossing rates, the initial triplet populations are not perturbed on the time scale of the experiment, so they determine the relative intensities of the paramagnetic resonance spectra. The effect is surprising given the weak spin-orbit interactions of organic molecules. Such initial-state preparation effects are likely to occur in systems where the intersystem crossing time scales are long compared to the time scale of the experiment.},

In this paper, we consider three coupled polar molecules arranged in a linear chain and trapped in an electric field with gradient. By employing the pendular states of polar molecules as qubits, we successfully realize three-qubit quantum gates and quantum algorithms via the multi-target optimal control theory. Explicitly speaking, through the designs of the optimal laser pulses with multiple iterations, the triqubit Toffoli gate, the triqubit quantum adders, and the triqubit quantum Fourier transform can be achieved in only one operational step with high fidelities and large transition probabilities. Moreover, by combining the optimized Hadamard, oracle, and diffusion gate pulses, we simulate the Grover algorithm in the three-dipole system and show that the algorithm can perform well for search problems. In addition, the behaviors of the fidelity and the average transition probability with respect to iteration numbers are compared and analyzed for each gate pulse. Our findings could pave the way toward scalability for molecular quantum computing based on the pendular states and could be extended to implement multi-particle gate operation in the molecular system.},

Here, we show how measuring the capacitance in both the frequency and the time domain can be used to study ionic dynamics within perovskite-based devices, quantifying activation energy, diffusion coefficient, sign of charge, concentration, and the length of the ionic double layer in the vicinity of the interfaces. Measuring the transient of the capacitance furthermore allows for distinguishing between ionic and electronic effects.},

  abstract = {Low energy vibrations in the excited state have been hypothesized to play an important role in quickly and efficiently generating free charges in bulk heterojunctions of some conjugated polymer systems. While time-resolved vibrational spectroscopies seemingly are well poised to address the relationship between kinetics and vibrational motions after initial photoexcitation, uncertainty in the measurement arises due to overlapping signals and difficulties in assigning observed oscillatory signals to the molecular response. Here, we demonstrate a high sensitivity strategy to distinguish between signal oscillations originating from lab noise and those molecular in origin in order to isolate the low energy excited-state vibrations in the model conjugated copolymer PCDTBT. Furthermore, to distinguish modes that may be implicated in different kinetic pathways, coherent signal oscillations extracted from 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) are compared for the polymer in two solvents with different polarities resulting in different kinetics. We observe that the change in solvent affects dynamics on the &gt;2 ps scale but not on the time scale required for free charge generation in heterojunctions (∼200 fs time scale). By the same token, the excited state vibrational modes that appear and disappear based on solvent polarity may also be associated with the slower kinetic process. The observation of low energy vibrational motions coupled to the excited state manifold that persists through the solvent change and thus can be associated with the fast kinetic process supports the hypothesis that direct polaron formation, rather than exciton formation and diffusion followed by interfacial charge separation, is a more likely route toward free charges in organic heterostructures.},

However, the screened range-separated hybrid functionals proposed so far are biased either toward compact or slowly varying densities. In this paper, we propose a screened range-separated hybrid functional, named HSEint, which can well describe these density regimes, achieving good accuracy for both molecular and solid-state systems. The semilocal part of the proposed functional is based on the PBEint generalized gradient approximation [E. Fabiano et al. , Phys. Rev. B 82 , 113104 (2010)], constructed for hybrid interfaces. To improve the functional performance, we employ exact or nearly exact constraints in the construction of range-separated hybrid functional, such as recovering of the local density linear response and semiclassical atom linear response.},

  abstract = {Understanding native point defects is fundamental in order to comprehend the properties of TiO 2 anatase in technological applications. The previous first-principles reports of defect-relevant quantities, such as formation energies and charge transition levels, are, however, scattered over a wide range. We perform a comparative study employing different approaches based on semilocal with Hubbard correction (DFT+ U ) and screened hybrid functionals in order to investigate the dependence defect properties on the employed computational method. While the defects in TiO 2 anatase, as in most transition-metal oxides, generally induce the localization of electrons or holes on atomic sites, we notice that, provided an alignment of the valence bands has been performed, the calculated defect formation energies and transition levels using semilocal functionals are in a fair agreement with those obtained using hybrid functionals. A similar conclusion can be reached for the thermochemistry of the Ti–O system and the limit values of the elemental chemical potentials. We interpret this as a cancellation of error between the self-interaction error and the overbinding of the O 2 molecule in semilocal functionals. Inclusion of a U term in the electron Hamiltonian offers a convenient way for obtaining more precise geometric and electronic configurations of the defective systems.},

FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom. The model presented herein is fast and lightweight enough for use in general chemistry problems as well as molecular dynamics simulations.},

In our method, we pump the excited state using entangled TPA and indirectly measure the optically forbidden intermediate state through the photon emission from the excited state to the intermediate state. The condition required for this method is only that the transition rate between the excited and intermediate states is sufficiently high. Using our proposed method, we show that the optically forbidden state can be detected with a high degree of accuracy when highly efficient and selective TPA is realized.},

We here present an all-electron implementation of the GW +BSE formalism for molecules, using numeric atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis sets. We present benchmarks for low-lying excitation energies for a set of small organic molecules, denoted in the literature as “Thiel’s set.” Literature reference data based on Gaussian-type orbitals are reproduced to about one millielectron-volt precision for the molecular benchmark set, when using the same GW quasiparticle energies and basis sets as the input to the BSE calculations. For valence correlation consistent NAO basis sets, as well as for standard NAO basis sets for ground state density-functional theory with extended augmentation functions, we demonstrate excellent convergence of the predicted low-lying excitations to the complete basis set limit. A simple and affordable augmented NAO basis set denoted “tier2+aug2” is recommended as a particularly efficient formulation for production calculations. We finally demonstrate that the same convergence properties also apply to linear-response time-dependent density functional theory within the NAO formalism.},

When the starting configuration provided as an input to a MC calculation is far from equilibrium, an inordinate amount of computational effort may be required to bring the system closer to equilibrium in the pre-equilibration step of the MC calculation. In order to alleviate this cost, a new computational strategy is presented with the aim of rapidly generating starting off-lattice atomic structures that are already close to equilibrium. The method involves preparing a collection of on-lattice configurations using fast reverse MC calculations. Each configuration corresponds to a different value of short-range order parameter(s). Next, by performing short MC calculations with each starting structure, one measures the extent to which the distribution of local atomic arrangements has changed. The optimal configuration exhibits the smallest change in the distribution. While the optimal configuration can serve as an input to longer MC calculations, in many situations, the resulting structure may be directly used for the estimation of thermodynamic properties. Application of our approach to several off-lattice binary and ternary metal alloy systems with phase separation, good mixing, ordering, and surface segregation is demonstrated. A speed-up of &gt;100–1000 times over the standard MC approach is achieved even with small systems containing a few thousand particles, and close-to-equilibrium structures containing million atoms can be rapidly prepared using our method within a day on a standard desktop computer.},

As a solution, combining hematite with a noble metal can enhance the photocatalytic performance toward longer wavelength. Gold nanoparticles indicate characteristic absorption in the visible and NIR regions and photo-induced injection of electrons into the semiconductor. In this study, a hybrid material of hematite photoanodes with gold nanostructures was fabricated and the carrier dynamics under NIR excitation was elucidated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed strong positive absorption under NIR excitation of Au nanorods (NRs) on the hematite anode indicated an increased electron density in hematite due to electron transfer from AuNRs, demonstrating efficient charge carrier generation in hematite by the decorated gold nanostructure.},

Using ab initio calculations and Franck-Condon simulations, three electronic transitions are identified and their adiabatic ionization energy is determined E i ( a + 2 Π u ← X 1 Σ g + ) = 12.440 ( 10 ) eV, E i ( X + 4 Σ g − ← a 3 Π u ) = 11.795 ( 10 ) eV, and E i (a +2 Π u ← a 3 Π u ) = 12.361(10) eV. From the three origin bands, the following energy differences are extracted: Δ E (a − X) = 0.079(10) eV and Δ E (a + − X + ) = 0.567(10) eV. The adiabatic ionization potential corresponding to the forbidden one-photon transition X + ← X is derived and amounts to 11.873(10) eV, in very good agreement with the most recent measurement by Krechkivska et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 144 , 144305 (2016)]. The enthalpy of formation of the doublet ground state C 2 + cation in the gas phase is determined at 0 K, Δ f H 0 ( 0 K ) ( C 2 + ( Π u 2 ) ) = 2019.9 ( 10 ) kJ mol −1 . In addition, we report the first experimental ion yield of C 2 for which only a simple estimate was used up to now in the photochemistry models of astrophysical media due to the lack of experimental data.},

  abstract = {The discretized path integral expression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) of a system interacting with a dissipative harmonic bath is fully entangled because of influence functional terms that couple the variables at different time points. The iterative decomposition of the path integral, which exploits the finite length of influence functional memory, involves a tensor propagator whose size grows exponentially with the memory length. The present Communication disentangles the path integral by recursively spreading the temporal entanglement over longer path segments, while decreasing its contribution. Eventually, the entangled term becomes sufficiently small and may be neglected, leading to iterative propagation of the RDM through simple multiplication of matrices whose size is equal to that of the bare system. It is found that the temporal entanglement length is practically equal to the bath-induced memory length. The small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) is stable and very efficient, extending the applicability of numerically exact real-time path integral methods to multi-state systems.},

Development of accurate and practical methods to treat these effects is one of the long standing problems in classical site density functional theory (SDFT). One particular instance when these issues become particularly severe is the case of classical interaction potentials with auxiliary sites or dummy atoms. In this situation, current SDFT implementations, such as the three-dimensional reference interaction site model, lead to nonphysical results. We re-examine this issue in this work using our recent reformulation of SDFT (Valiev and Chuev, J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp. 2018 , 093201).

This perspective discusses the major features of DMRG, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses also in comparison with other novel approaches.

Herein, we review several precursor chemisorption mechanisms and the effect of chemisorption on ALD growth. We then follow with a discussion on diffusion and its impact on film growth during ALD. Together, these two fundamental processes of chemisorption and diffusion underlie the majority of mechanisms which contribute to material growth during a given ALD process, and the recognition of their role allows for more rational design of ALD parameters.},

For micrometer-sized particles moving in a liquid (“microswimmers”), most of the basic features have been described by using the model of overdamped active Brownian motion. However, for macroscopic particles or microparticles moving in a gas, inertial effects become relevant such that the dynamics is underdamped. Therefore, recently, active particles with inertia have been described by extending the active Brownian motion model to active Langevin dynamics that include inertia. In this perspective article, recent developments of active particles with inertia (“microflyers,” “hoppers,” or “runners”) are summarized both for single particle properties and for collective effects of many particles. These include inertial delay effects between particle velocity and self-propulsion direction, tuning of the long-time self-diffusion by the moment of inertia, effects of fictitious forces in noninertial frames, and the influence of inertia on motility-induced phase separation. Possible future developments and perspectives are also proposed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Nonthermal effects of the electromagnetic (EM) field in the radio and microwave frequency ranges on basic biological matter are difficult to detect and thus remain poorly understood. In this work, all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of an amyloidogenic peptide response to nonionizing radiation of varying field characteristics. The results showed that the EM field induced peptide conformations dependent on the field frequency and strength. At the high field strength (0.7 V/nm rms ), the peptide explored a wider conformational space as the frequency increased from 1.0 to 5.0 GHz. At the intermediate strength fields (0.07–0.0385 V/nm rms ), the frequencies of 1.0 and 2.5 GHz resulted in the peptide being trapped in specific conformations, with 1.0 GHz enabling both fibril-forming and fibril-inhibiting conformations, while 2.5 GHz led to formation of mostly fibril-forming conformations. In contrast, the 5.0 GHz frequency caused increased peptide dynamics and more extended conformations with fibril-enabling aromatic side-chain arrangement akin to the structures formed under ambient conditions. All the simulated frequencies at low strength fields (0.007–0.0007 V/nm rms ) resulted in the formation of amyloid-prone hairpin conformations similar to those formed under the weak static electric field and ambient conditions. These results suggest that specific ranges of EM field parameters produce peptide conformations unfavorable for formation of amyloid fibrils, a phenomenon that can be exploited in treatment and prevention of amyloid diseases. Alternatively, EM field parameters can be selected to modulate the formation of well-ordered peptide assemblies as a rational design strategy for engineering biocompatible materials.},

  abstract = {The molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation technique is powerful for the investigation of conformational equilibrium properties of biomolecules. In particular, free energy surfaces of the torsion angles (those degrees of freedom from which the geometry mostly depends) allow one to access conformational states, as well as kinetic information, i.e., if the transitions between conformational states occur by simple jumps between wells or if conformational regions close to these states also are populated. The information obtained from MD simulations may depend substantially on the force field employed, and thus, a validation procedure is essential. NMR relaxation data are expected to be highly sensitive to the details of the torsional free energy surface. As a case-study, we consider the disaccharide α- l -Rha p -(1 → 2)-α- l -Rha p -OMe that features only two important torsion angles, ϕ and ψ , which define the interglycosidic orientation of the sugar residues relative to each other, governed mainly by the exo -anomeric effect and steric interactions, respectively. In water, a ψ − state is preferred, whereas in DMSO, it is a ψ + state, suggesting inherent flexibility at the torsion angle. MD simulations indicated that bistable potentials describe the conformational region well. To test whether a unimodal distribution suffices or if a bimodal distribution better represents molecular conformational preferences, we performed an alchemical morphing of the torsional free energy surface and computed T 1 , T 2 , and NOE 13 C NMR relaxation data that were compared to experimental data. All three NMR observables are substantially affected by the morphing procedure, and the results strongly support a bimodal Boltzmann equilibrium density with a major and a minor conformational state bisected at ψ ≈ 0°, in accord with MD simulations in an explicit solvent.},

  abstract = {Enhanced sampling methods, such as forward flux sampling (FFS), have great capacity for accelerating stochastic simulations of nonequilibrium biochemical systems involving rare events. However, the description of the tradeoffs between simulation efficiency and error in FFS remains incomplete. We present a novel and mathematically rigorous analysis of the errors in FFS that, for the first time, covers the contribution of every phase of the simulation. We derive a closed form expression for the optimally efficient count of samples to take in each FFS phase in terms of a fixed constraint on sampling error. We introduce a new method, forward flux pilot sampling (FFPilot), that is designed to take full advantage of our optimizing equation without prior information or assumptions about the phase weights and costs along the transition path. In simulations of both single and multidimensional gene regulatory networks, FFPilot is able to completely control sampling error. We then discuss how memory effects can introduce additional error when relaxation along the transition path is slow. This extra error can be traced to correlations between the FFS phases and can be controlled by monitoring the covariance between them. Finally, we show that, in sets of simulations with matched error, FFPilot is on the order of tens-to-hundreds of times faster than direct sampling and noticeably more efficient than previous FFS methods.},

  abstract = {One-electron oxidation of adenine (A) leads initially to the formation of adenine radical cation (A •+ ). Subsequent deprotonation of A •+ can provoke deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, which further causes senescence, cancer formation, and even cell death. However, compared with considerable reports on A •+ reactions in free deoxyadenosine (dA) and duplex DNA, studies in non-B-form DNA that play critical biological roles are rare at present. It is thus of vital importance to explore non-B-form DNA, among which the triplex is an emerging topic. Herein, we investigate the deprotonation behavior of A •+ in the TAT triplex with continuous A bases by time-resolved laser flash photolysis. The rate constants for the one-oxidation of triplex 8.4 × 10 8 M −1 s −1 and A •+ deprotonation 1.3 × 10 7 s −1 are obtained. The kinetic isotope effect of A •+ deprotonation in the TAT triplex is 1.8, which is characteristic of a direct release of the proton into the solvent similar to free base dA. It is thus elucidated that the A •+ proton bound with the third strand is most likely to be released into the solvent because of the weaker Hoogsteen H-bonding interaction and the presence of the highly mobile hydration waters within the third strand. Additionally, it is confirmed through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that the deprotonation of A •+ results in the dissociation of the third strand and disruption of the secondary structure of the triplex.

  abstract = {Efficient separation of particles has ever-growing importance in both fundamental research and nanotechnological applications. However, such particles usually suffer from some fluctuations from external surroundings and outside intervention from unknown directions. Here, we numerically investigate the transport of Brownian particles in a straight channel with regular arrays of equilateral triangle obstacles. The particles can be rectified by the triangle obstacles under the action of an oscillating (square wave) force. At the given amplitude and frequency of the oscillating force, the transport is sensitively dependent on the force direction and particle size. In the cases of longitudinal and transversal oscillating force, the particles with different sizes exhibit different transport behaviors. Interestingly, under a constant force in the longitudinal direction, the phenomenon of particle separation is observed, where the particles with different radii will move in different directions. Furthermore, we also study the transport of Brownian particles driven by a tilt oscillating force. By choosing proper force directions, we can observe the gating phenomenon and transport reversal. Under different driving conditions, we can separate particles of different sizes and make them move in opposite directions.},

  abstract = {For a nanostructure sitting on top of an AlGaN:Er 3+ thin film, a new thermal imaging technique is presented where dual cameras collect bandpass filtered videos from the H and S bands of Er 3+ emission. We combine this thermal imaging technique with our newly developed time-resolved temperature measurement technique which relies on luminescence thermometry using Er 3+ emission. This technique collects time-resolved traces from the H and S bands of Er 3+ emission. The H and S signal traces are then used to reconstruct the time-resolved temperature transient when a nanostructure is illuminated with a pulsed 532 nm light. Two different types of samples are interrogated with these techniques (drop-casted gold nanosphere cluster and lithographically prepared gold nanodot) on the AlGaN:Er 3+ film. Steady-state and time-resolved temperature data are collected when the samples are immersed in air and water. The results of time-resolved temperature-jump measurements from a cluster of gold nanospheres show extremely slow heat transfer when the cluster is immersed in water and nearly 200-fold increase when immersed in air. The low thermal diffusivity for the cluster in water suggests poor thermal contact between the cluster and the thermal bath. The lithographically prepared nanodot has much better adhesion to the AlGaN film, resulting in much higher thermal diffusivity in both air and water. This proof-of-concept demonstration opens a new way to measure the dynamics of the local heat generation and dissipation at the nanoparticle-media interface.},

  abstract = {Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) are gaining considerable attention due to the unique far-field and near-field optical properties and applications. Additionally, the Fermi energy, which is the chemical potential, of plasmonic nanoparticles is one of the key properties to control hot-electron and -hole transfer at the interface between plasmonic nanoparticles and a semiconductor. In this article, we tried to control the diffusion potential of the plasmonic system by manipulating the interface dipole. We fabricated solid-state photoelectric conversion devices in which gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are located between strontium titanate (SrTiO 3 ) as an electron transfer material and nickel oxide (NiO) as a hole transport material. Lanthanum aluminate as an interface dipole layer was deposited on the atomic layer scale at the three-phase interface of Au-NPs, SrTiO 3 , and NiO, and the effect was investigated by photoelectric measurements. Importantly, the diffusion potential between the plasmonic metal and a semiconductor can be arbitrarily controlled by the averaged thickness and direction of the interface dipole layer. The insertion of an only one unit cell (uc) interface dipole layer, whose thickness was less than 0.5 nm, dramatically controlled the diffusion potential formed between the plasmonic nanoparticles and surrounding media. This is a new methodology to control the plasmonic potential without applying external stimuli, such as an applied potential or photoirradiation, and without changing the base materials. In particular, it is very beneficial for plasmonic devices in that the interface dipole has the ability not only to decrease but also to increase the open-circuit voltage on the order of several hundreds of millivolts.},

In situ XRD shows that the SPT occurs from a monoclinic SRO phase to a tetragonal SRO phase near ∼200 °C, regardless of the pressure environment. On the other hand, significant core level shifts in both the Ru and Sr photoemission spectra are found under ultrahigh vacuum, but not under the oxygen pressure environment. The directions and behavior of the core level shift of Ru and Sr are attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancy across the SPT temperature of SRO. The analysis of in situ XRD and AP-XPS results provides an evidence for the formation of metastable surface oxide possibly due to the migration of internal oxygen atoms across the SPT temperature, indicating the close relationship between oxygen vacancy and SPT in SRO thin films.},

The values of pH int of SNARF-MSN suspended in water were different from the pH of the bulk solution (pH bulk ). The addition of acid or base to aqueous suspensions of SNARF-MSN induced much larger changes in pH bulk than pH int , indicating that the interface has buffering capacity. Grafting additional organic functional groups onto the surface of SNARF-MSN controls the pH int of its buffering region. The responses of pH int to variations in pH bulk are consistent with the acid/base properties of the surface groups as determined by their pK a and are affected by electrostatic interactions between charged interfacial species as evidenced by the dependence of ζ-potential on pH bulk . Finally, as a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the hydrolysis rate of an acid-sensitive acetal can be controlled by adjusting pH int via suitable functionalization of the MSN surface. Our findings can lead to the development of nanoreactors that protect sensitive species from adverse conditions and tune their chemical reactivity.},

Not only is the long-term stability of these materials improved via nanostructuring, their optical bandgaps are also tunable by the nanocrystal (NC) size. However, theoretical understanding of the impact of the NC size on the phase stability and bandgap is still lacking. In this work, the relative phase stability of CsPbI 3 as a function of the crystal size and the chemical potential is investigated by density functional theory. The optically active phases ( α - and γ -phase) are found to be thermodynamically stabilized against the yellow δ -phase by reducing the size of the NC below 5.6 nm in a CsI-rich environment. We developed a more accurate quantum confinement model to predict the change in bandgaps at the sub–10 nm regime by including a finite-well effect. These predictions have important implications for synthesizing ever more stable perovskite NCs and bandgap engineering.},

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) is observed to be chain length dependent, where the PLQY of BUTY-VA, OCTY-CA, and DODE-LA MAPbBr 3 PQDs is 82\% ± 4\%, 68\% ± 7\%, and 18\% ± 2\%, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of each PQD film reveal that there is a slight increase in conductivity from reducing the capping ligand chain length from 8 carbon atoms (OCTY-CA) to 4 carbon atoms (BUTY-VA). Using the Butler-Volmer equation, the charge transfer factor β for BUTY-VA and OCTY-CA MAPbBr 3 PQD films in a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate-dichloromethane electrolyte solution was calculated to be 0.36 and 0.31, respectively. From an Arrhenius analysis, the activation energy (E a ) for charge transport between the PQD film and the electrolyte was calculated to be 77 and 90 meV for BUTY-VA and OCTY-CA MAPbBr 3 PQD films, respectively. Moreover, passivating PQDs with capping ligands with 12 carbon atoms (DODE-LA) almost completely insulates the PQDs and diminishes charge transport. This is also observed in transient photocurrent density measurements. The results suggest that the inter-PQD distance in this solid film is too long for effective tunneling to occur. However, using BUTY-VA capping ligands to improve electronic properties of PQD solid film comes with a cost of stability.},

This method reveals the super-Arrhenius dynamics that characterizes TMB above its glass transition, which occurs at about 204 K. To extend the temperature range in which the molecular dynamics can be studied, 11 B nuclear magnetic resonance experiments are additionally carried out on rotating and stationary samples: Exploiting dynamic second-order shifts, spin-relaxation times, line shape effects, as well as stimulated-echo and two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy, a coherent picture regarding the dynamics of this glass former is gained.},

  abstract = {We propose a microscopic theory for the decoupling of self-diffusion and structural relaxation in glass-forming liquids within the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) activated dynamics framework. Our central hypothesis is that the heterogeneity relevant to this problem is static fluctuations of local density on the scale of 3–4 particle diameters and how this changes local packing correlations. These fluctuations modify the degree of dynamical cage expansion that mechanistically couples intracage large amplitude hopping and longer range collective elasticity in ECNLE theory. Decoupling only emerges in the deeply supercooled regime where the strongly temperature dependent elastic barrier becomes non-negligible relative to its noncooperative local analog. The theory makes predictions for various aspects of the decoupling phenomenon, including apparent fractional power law Stokes-Einstein behavior, that appear to be consistent with experiments and simulations on hard sphere fluids and molecular liquids. Of central importance is a microscopic connection between the barrier fluctuation variance and most probable barrier height. Sensible results are also obtained for the nonexponential stretching of a generic relaxation time correlation function and its temperature evolution. Nonuniversality can arise from the relative importance of the local and collective barriers (related to fragility) and the precise magnitude of the length scale that defines the transition from local cage to elastic physics. Comparison is made with a traplike model based on a Gaussian distribution of barriers.},

Although this consensus is applicable for the elastic electron scattering of most atoms and molecules, it is violated for helium where the experimental differential cross sections deviate from the first Born approximation prediction gradually with the decrease of squared momentum transfer at the same impact electron energy. Since this anomalous phenomenon was observed more than 40 years ago, the intrinsic mechanism is not explicit. In the present work, using the high-resolution x-ray scattering, we isolate the scattering contribution from the nucleus and directly obtain the pure electronic structure of helium. Then, the anomalous asymptotic behavior of the elastic electron scattering of helium has been elucidated, i.e., in the small squared momentum transfer region, the scattering contribution from the target’s electrons is counteracted by the one from the atomic nucleus, which results in the residual contribution beyond the first Born approximation being drastically enlarged.},

The electron affinity of Ir was measured to be 12 614.97(9) cm −1 or 1.564 057(11) eV. We find that the Wigner threshold law is still valid for the threshold photodetachment of Ir − through a p-wave fitting of the photodetachment channel I r − 5 d 8 6 s 23 F 4 → Ir 5 d 8 6 s b 4 F 9 / 2 ⁠ . The photoelectron angular distributions of photodetachment channels I r − 5 d 8 6 s 23 F 4 → Ir 5 d 7 6 s 2 a 4 F 9 / 2 and I r − 5 d 8 6 s 23 F 4 → Ir 5 d 8 6 s b 4 F 9 / 2 were also investigated. The behavior of anisotropy parameter β indicates a strong interaction between the two channels. Moreover, the energy level 3 P 2 of Ir − , which was not observed in the previous works, was experimentally determined to be 4163.24(16) cm −1 above the ground state.},

  abstract = {Dynamics of the cycloreversion reaction of a photochromic diarylethene derivative with a small ring-opening reaction yield (∼1\%) was investigated by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reaction rate constant and activation barrier on the reaction coordinate were quantitatively analyzed on the basis of the temperature and excitation wavelength dependencies of the reaction yield and excited state dynamics. From the comparison of the present results with those in a more reactive derivative, we concluded that a key factor regulating the overall reaction yield is the branching ratio at the conical intersection where the excited state population is split into the product and the initial reactant. The excitation wavelength dependence of the dynamics indicated that the geometrical relaxation and vibrational cooling proceed in a few picosecond time scale behind the cycloreversion process, and the vibrational excess energy assists the molecule to climb up the energy barrier.},

  abstract = {Recently, an alternative approach to dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the liquid state was introduced using optical illumination instead of microwave pumping. By exciting a suitable dye to the triplet state which undergoes a diffusive encounter with a persistent radical forming a quartet-doublet pair in the encounter complex, dynamic electron polarization (DEP) is generated via the radical-triplet pair mechanism. Subsequent cross-relaxation generates nuclear polarization without the need for microwave saturation of the electronic transitions. Here, we present a theoretical justification for the initial experimental results by means of numerical simulations. These allow investigation of the effects of various experimental parameters, such as radical and dye concentrations, sample geometry, and laser power, on the DNP enhancement factors, providing targets for experimental optimization. It is predicted that reducing the sample volume will result in larger enhancements by permitting a higher concentration of triplets in a sample of increased optical density. We also explore the effects of the pulsed laser rather than continuous-wave illumination, rationalizing the failure to observe the optical DNP effect under illumination conditions common to DEP experiments. Examining the influence of the illumination duty cycle, the conditions necessary to permit the use of pulsed illumination without compromising signal enhancement are determined, which may reduce undesirable laser heating effects. This first simulation of the optical DNP method therefore underpins the further development of the technology.},

  abstract = {Strong coupling of quantum emitters with confined electromagnetic modes of nanophotonic structures may be used to change optical, chemical, and transport properties of materials, with significant theoretical effort invested toward a better understanding of this phenomenon. However, a full theoretical description of both matter and light is an extremely challenging task. Typical theoretical approaches simplify the description of the photonic environment by describing it as a single mode or few modes. While this approximation is accurate in some cases, it breaks down strongly in complex environments, such as within plasmonic nanocavities, and the electromagnetic environment must be fully taken into account. This requires the quantum description of a continuum of bosonic modes, a problem that is computationally hard. We here investigate a compromise where the quantum character of light is taken into account at modest computational cost. To do so, we focus on a quantum emitter that interacts with an arbitrary photonic spectral density and employ the cumulant, or cluster, expansion method to the Heisenberg equations of motion up to first, second, and third order. We benchmark the method by comparing it with exact solutions for specific situations and show that it can accurately represent dynamics for many parameter ranges.},

We demonstrated that the presence of Ni atoms in contact with the substrate massively enhances their activity with at least a 7-order of magnitude increase in the turnover of water production with respect to the case where only Pt lay at the interface. We further discussed how the nanoalloy shape affects the activity showing that truncated octahedra are 10 2 more active than cuboctahedra of similar size. We explained our results in terms of their distinct distribution and occurrence of the most active sites for oxygen reduction leading to the stabilization of different chemical species during the reaction dynamics.

  abstract = {Fermi’s golden rule defines the transition rate between weakly coupled states and can thus be used to describe a multitude of molecular processes including electron-transfer reactions and light-matter interaction. However, it can only be calculated if the wave functions of all internal states are known, which is typically not the case in molecular systems. Marcus theory provides a closed-form expression for the rate constant, which is a classical limit of the golden rule, and indicates the existence of a normal regime and an inverted regime. Semiclassical instanton theory presents a more accurate approximation to the golden-rule rate including nuclear quantum effects such as tunneling, which has so far been applicable to complex anharmonic systems in the normal regime only. In this paper, we extend the instanton method to the inverted regime and study the properties of the periodic orbit, which describes the tunneling mechanism via two imaginary-time trajectories, one of which now travels in negative imaginary time. It is known that tunneling is particularly prevalent in the inverted regime, even at room temperature, and thus, this method is expected to be useful in studying a wide range of molecular transitions occurring in this regime.},

  abstract = {Natural orbitals are often used to achieve a more compact representation of correlated wave-functions. Using natural orbitals computed as eigenstates of the virtual–virtual block of the state density matrix instead of the canonical Hartree–Fock orbitals results in smaller errors when the same fraction of virtual space is frozen. This strategy, termed frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach, is effective in reducing the cost of regular coupled-cluster (CC) calculations and some multistate methods, such as EOM-IP-CC (equation-of-motion CC for ionization potentials). This contribution extends the FNO approach to the EOM-SF-CC ansatz (EOM-CC with spin-flip). In contrast to EOM-IP-CCSD, EOM-SF-CCSD relies on high-spin open-shell references. Using FNOs computed for an open-shell reference leads to an erratic behavior of the EOM-SF-CC energies and properties due to an inconsistent truncation of the α and β orbital spaces. A general solution to problems arising in the EOM-CC calculations utilizing open-shell references, termed OSFNO (open-shell FNO), is proposed. By means of singular value decomposition (SVD) of the overlap matrix of the α and β orbitals, the OSFNO algorithm identifies the corresponding orbitals and determines virtual orbitals corresponding to the singly occupied space. This is followed by SVD of the singlet part of the state density matrix in the remaining virtual orbital subspace. The so-computed FNOs preserve the spin purity of the open-shell orbital subspace to the extent allowed by the original reference, thus facilitating a safe truncation of the virtual space. The performance of OSFNO is benchmarked for selected diradicals and triradicals.},

Strong MFEs on K ( t ) are predicted that originate from the Δ g and hyperfine driven singlet-triplet mixing in the RP. The effects of spin relaxation on the magnetic field are studied, as well as the influence of the dipole-dipole interaction between the electron spins of the RP. In the two-dimensional case, this interaction is not averaged out by diffusion and it strongly affects the MFE.

  abstract = {Many fundamental biological processes are regulated by protein-DNA complexes called synaptosomes , which possess multiple interaction sites. Despite the critical importance of synaptosomes, the mechanisms of their formation are not well understood. Because of the multisite nature of participating proteins, it is widely believed that their search for specific sites on DNA involves the formation and breaking of DNA loops and sliding in the looped configurations. In reality, DNA in live cells is densely covered by other biological molecules that might interfere with the formation of synaptosomes. In this work, we developed a theoretical approach to evaluate the role of obstacles in the target search of multisite proteins when the formation of DNA loops and the sliding in looped configurations are possible. Our theoretical method is based on analysis of a discrete-state stochastic model that uses a master equations approach and extensive computer simulations. It is found that the obstacle slows down the search dynamics in the system when DNA loops are long-lived, but the effect is minimal for short-lived DNA loops. In addition, the relative positions of the target and the obstacle strongly influence the target search kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of the obstacle might increase the noise in the system. These observations are discussed using physical-chemical arguments. Our theoretical approach clarifies the molecular mechanisms of formation of protein-DNA complexes with multiple interactions sites.},

  abstract = {We report on photoisomerization kinetics of azobenzene containing surfactants in aqueous solution. The surfactant molecule consists of a positively charged trimethylammonium bromide head group, a hydrophobic spacer connecting via 6 to 10 CH 2 groups to the azobenzene unit, and the hydrophobic tail of 1 and 3CH 2 groups. Under exposure to light, the azobenzene photoisomerizes from more stable trans- to metastable cis -state, which can be switched back either thermally in dark or by illumination with light of a longer wavelength. The surfactant isomerization is described by a kinetic model of a pseudo first order reaction approaching equilibrium, where the intensity controls the rate of isomerization until the equilibrated state. The rate constants of the trans-cis and cis-trans photoisomerization are calculated as a function of several parameters such as wavelength and intensity of light, the surfactant concentration, and the length of the hydrophobic tail. The thermal relaxation rate from cis - to trans- state is studied as well. The surfactant isomerization shows a different kinetic below and above the critical micellar concentration of the trans isomer due to steric hindrance within the densely packed micelle but does not depend on the spacer length.},

  abstract = {Single molecule tracking experiments inside a hydrated polymer network have shown that the tracer motion is subdiffusive due to the viscoelastic environment inside the gel-like network. This property can be related to the negative autocorrelation of the instantaneous displacements at short times. Although the displacements of the individual tracers exhibit Gaussian statistics, the displacement distribution of all the trajectories combined from different spatial locations of the polymer network exhibits a non-Gaussian distribution. Here, we analyze many individual tracer trajectories to show that the central portion of the non-Gaussian distribution can be well approximated by an exponential distribution that spreads sublinearly with time. We explain all these features seen in the experiment by a generalized Langevin model for an overdamped particle with algebraically decaying correlations. We show that the degree of non-Gaussianity can change with the extent of heterogeneity, which is controlled in our model by the experimentally observed distributions of the motion parameters.},

  abstract = {Phase separation can be driven by the association of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes in solution, a process known as complex coacervation. This can manifest as macrophase separation, which arises when both polymer species are homopolyelectrolytes, or can lead to microphase separation when one or both of the charged species are block copolyelectrolytes. This is not a strict dichotomy; recently, macrophase separation was observed for a number of copolymers containing sequence-defined patterns of neutral vs charged monomers, including patterns with lengthy blocks. The specific pattern can affect the strength of this macrophase separation, yet at some block length, microphase separation is expected to emerge. In this article, we describe how to incorporate a theory of sequence-defined coacervation into self-consistent field theory, allowing the study of sequence-defined polyelectrolytes in inhomogeneous systems. We show that blocky sequences can affect electrostatically driven macrophase separation and can transition to microphase separation as the blockiness of sequences increases. This micro- to macrophase separation transition is a function of both the blockiness of the sequence, the number of blocks, and the concentration of salt.},

We find that ε increases with length, peaking at 159 400 M −1 cm −1 for oF 3 and then decreases for longer chains. ε does not scale with 1/n or e −n to reach a constant value at long length, as predicted by the commonly applied oligomer extrapolation approximation, although spectral shifts, oscillator strengths, and transition dipole moments do reach limiting values for chains near 10 units long. While computations describe the triplet in oF 2 and oF 3 as having similar geometries with a single flattened dihedral angle between units, computations and simulations suggest that in longer oligomers motion along the chains of the short 2–3 unit, the long T 1 state is probably the source of the unusual changes in ε. These occur because hopping along the chain is sufficiently fast that the dihedrals between fluorene units cannot fully relax. At a length near 10 units, hopping and dihedral angle changes produce a steady state distribution of geometries with only small changes from the ground state, which persist for longer chains. Additional decreases in ε from pF 28 to pF 84 are plausibly due to a small number of chain defects which result in loss of triplets.},

This method employed in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and microfocused X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. An STM tip-shadowing method was used to synthesize patterned areas of Au nanoparticles on the substrate with different coverages and sizes. Patterns were identified and imaged using a UV photoelectron emission microscope. The Au 4f core level binding energies of the nanoparticles were investigated as a function of Au nanoparticle coverage and size. A combination of initial and final state effects modifies the binding energies of the Au 4f core levels as the nanoparticle size changes. When single Au atoms and Au 3 clusters are present, the Au 4f 7/2 binding energy, 84.42 eV, is similar to that observed at a high coverage (1.8 monolayer equivalent), resulting from a cancellation of initial and final state effects. As the coverage is increased, there is a decrease in binding energy, which then increases at a higher coverage to 84.39 eV. These results are consistent with a Volmer-Weber nucleation-growth model of Au nanoparticles at oxygen vacancies, resulting in electron transfer to the nanoparticles.},

Real space imaging was used to determine the propagation lengths L SPP of the leaky PSPP modes, and back focal plane measurements generated ω vs k dispersion curves, which yield the PSPP group velocities v g . The combination of these two experiments was used to calculate the PSPP lifetime via T 1 = L SPP / v g . The difference in T 1 times between bare and thiol coated nanostripes was used to determine the dephasing rate due to CID Γ CID for the adsorbed thiol molecules. A variety of different thiol molecules were examined, as well as nanostripes with different dimensions. The values of Γ CID are similar for the different systems and are an order-of-magnitude smaller than the typical values observed for the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of Au nanoparticles. Scaling the measured Γ CID values by the effective path length for electron-surface scattering shows that the CID effect for the PSPP modes of the nanostripes is similar to that for the LSPR modes of nanoparticles. This is somewhat surprising given that PSPPs and LSPRs have different properties: PSPPs have a well-defined momentum, whereas LSPRs do not. The magnitude of Γ CID for the nanostripes could be increased by reducing their dimensions, principally the height of the nanostructures. However, decreasing dimensions for the leaky PSPP mode increases radiation damping, which would make it challenging to accurately measure Γ CID .},

  abstract = {Controversies on the surface termination of α-Fe 2 O 3 (0001) focus on its surface stoichiometry dependence on the oxygen chemical potential. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations applying the commonly accepted Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional to a strongly correlated system predict the best matching surface termination, but would produce a delocalization error, resulting in an inappropriate bandgap, and thus are not applicable for comprehensive hematite system studies. Besides, the widely applied PBE+ U scheme cannot provide evidence for existence of some of the successfully synthesized stoichiometric α-Fe 2 O 3 (0001) surfaces. Hence, a better scheme is needed for hematite DFT studies. This work investigates whether the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) approximation reported by Perdew et al. could provide an improved result for the as-mentioned problem, and whether SCAN can be applied to hematite systems. By comparing the results calculated with the PBE, SCAN, PBE+ U , and SCAN+ U schemes, we find that SCAN and SCAN+ U improves the description of the electronic structure of different stoichiometric α-Fe 2 O 3 (0001) surfaces with respect to the PBE results, and that they give a consistent prediction of the surface terminations. Besides, the bulk lattice constants and the bulk density of states are also improved with the SCAN functional. This study provides a general characterization of the α-Fe 2 O 3 (0001) surfaces and rationalizes how the SCAN approximation improves the results of hematite surface calculations.},

Upon further temperature cycling, the resonance dip position shifts reversibly, with a notable red shift upon temperature increase.

  abstract = {Metal halide perovskites are promising candidates for next-generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. The flexible nature of the octahedral network introduces complexity when understanding their physical behavior. It has been shown that these materials are prone to decomposition and phase competition, and the local crystal structure often deviates from the average space group symmetry. To make stable phase-pure perovskites, understanding their structure–composition relations is of central importance. We demonstrate, from lattice dynamics calculations, that the 24 inorganic perovskites ABX 3 (A = Cs, Rb; B = Ge, Sn, Pb; X = F, Cl, Br, I) exhibit instabilities in their cubic phase. These instabilities include cation displacements, octahedral tilting, and Jahn-Teller distortions. The magnitudes of the instabilities vary depending on the chemical identity and ionic radii of the composition. The tilting instabilities are energetically dominant and reduce as the tolerance factor increases, whereas cation displacements and Jahn-Teller type distortions depend on the interactions between the constituent ions. We further considered representative tetragonal, orthorhombic, and monoclinic perovskite phases to obtain phonon-stable structures for each composition. This work provides insights into the thermodynamic driving force of the instabilities and will help guide computer simulations and experimental synthesis in material screening.},

Sn addition, either before or after cluster deposition, is found to strongly affect the binding properties of a model alkene, ethylene, changing the number and type of binding sites, and suppressing decomposition leading to carbon deposition and poisoning of the catalyst. Density functional theory on a model system, Pt 4 Sn 3 /alumina, shows that the Sn and Pt atoms are mixed, forming alloy clusters with substantial electron transfer from Sn to Pt. The presence of Sn also makes all the thermally accessible structures closed shell, such that ethylene binds only by π-bonding to a single Pt atom.

  abstract = {Surface properties of ferroelectrics are promising for catalysis due to the spontaneous electric polarization that can be reversed by an applied electric field. While several theoretical studies show different catalytic activities for differently polarized ferroelectric surfaces at zero electric potential, little work was devoted to catalysis on ferroelectric surfaces at higher electric potentials. Under these conditions that are relevant for photocatalytic experiments and applications, surfaces are usually oxidized. Using density functional theory calculations, we show for LaTiO 2 N and BaTiO 3 that this oxidation heavily impacts and even determines the electronic properties of the catalyst surface and therefore leads to similar reaction free energies for the catalytic steps of the oxygen evolution reaction, irrespective of the bulk polarization. This is opposed to experimental studies, which found different activities for differently polarized catalyst surface domains under oxidizing conditions. We therefore conclude that the experimentally observed activity difference does not originate from the surface polarization following the bulk polarization, but rather from different bulk polarization directions leading to different adsorbate coverages or even surface reconstructions.},

  abstract = {Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, we report a nonmonotonic dependence of the shear stress on the strength of a continuously increasing (i.e., time-varying) external magnetic field ( H ) in a liquid-crystalline mixture of magnetic and nonmagnetic anisotropic particles. We relate the origin of this nonmonotonicity of the transient dynamics to the competing effects of particle alignment along the shear-induced direction, on the one hand, and the magnetic field direction, on the other hand. To isolate the role of these competing effects, we consider a two-component mixture composed of particles with effectively identical steric interactions, where the orientations of a small fraction, i.e., the magnetic ones, are coupled to the external magnetic field. By increasing H from zero, the orientations of the magnetic particles show a Fréederickz-like transition and eventually start deviating from the shear-induced orientation, leading to an increase in shear stress. Upon further increase of H , a demixing of the magnetic particles from the nonmagnetic ones occurs, which leads to a drop in shear stress, hence creating a nonmonotonic response to H . Unlike the equilibrium demixing phenomena reported in previous studies, the demixing observed here is neither due to size-polydispersity nor due to a wall-induced nematic transition. Based on a simplified Onsager analysis, we rather argue that it occurs solely due to packing entropy of particles with different shear- or magnetic-field-induced orientations.},

  abstract = {Methane hydrate was recently shown, both experimentally and through simulations, to be stable up to the remarkably high pressure of 150 GPa. A new methane hydrate high-pressure (MH-IV) phase, reminiscent of ice at ambient pressure, was described for pressures above approximately 40 GPa. We disentangle here the main contributions to the relative stability of the lower pressure, denoted MH-III, and the high-pressure MH-IV structures. Through several simulation techniques, including metadynamics and path integral molecular dynamics for nuclear quantum effects, we analyze the phase transition mechanism, which implies hydrogen bond breaking and reforming, as well as methane reordering. The transition pathway is far from trivial, and the quantum delocalization of the hydrogen nuclei plays a significant role.},

We show that Purcell’s theorem still holds at the nanoscale, despite the local structure and the medium’s fluctuations. Then, with the purpose of both orienting the swimmer’s displacement and increasing the breakdown of the theorem, we study the effect of an electric field on a polarized version of these swimmers. For small and large fields, the time asymmetrical swimmer is more efficient, as suggested by Purcell. However, we find a field range for which Purcell’s theorem is broken for the time symmetric motor. Results suggest that the breakdown of the theorem arises from the competition of the orientation field and Brownian forces, while for larger fields, the field destroys the effect of fluctuations restoring the theorem.},

The obtained translational diffusion coefficients of 14 N-pDTEMPONE were analyzed in terms of the Cohen–Turnbull free volume theory. It was found that the Cohen-Turnbull theory describes, exceptionally well, the translational diffusion of 14 N-pDTEMPONE in all the ionic liquids in the measured temperature range. In addition, the Cohen-Turnbull theory was applied to the viscosity and self-diffusion coefficients of the cation and anion—taken from literature—in the same ionic liquids. The critical free volume for the self-diffusion of the cation and anion in a given ionic liquid is the same, which suggests that the diffusion of each ionic pair is coordinated. The critical free volumes for the 14 N-pDTEMPONE diffusion, self-diffusion, and viscosity for a given cation were about 20\% greater in the TFSI based ionic liquids than in the BF 4 based ionic liquids. It appears that the ratio of the critical free volumes for a given cation between the two series correlates with the ratio of their densities.},

  abstract = {Countless molecular dynamics studies have relied on available ion and water force field parameters to model aqueous electrolyte solutions. The TIP4P/2005 model has proven itself to be among the best rigid water force fields, whereas many of the most successful ion parameters were optimized in combination with SPC/E, TIP3P, or TIP4P/Ew water. Many researchers have combined these ions with TIP4P/2005, hoping to leverage the strengths of both parameter sets. To assess if this widely used approach is justified and to provide a guide in selecting ion parameters, we investigated the transferability of various commonly used monovalent and multivalent ion parameters to the TIP4P/2005 water model. The transferability is evaluated in terms of ion hydration free energy, hydration radius, coordination number, and self-diffusion coefficient at infinite dilution. For selected ion parameters, we also investigated density, ion pairing, chemical potential, and mean ionic activity coefficients at finite concentrations. We found that not all ions are equally transferable to TIP4P/2005 without compromising their performance. In particular, ions optimized for TIP3P water were found to be poorly transferable to TIP4P/2005, whereas ions optimized for TIP4P/Ew water provided nearly perfect transferability. The latter ions also showed good overall agreement with experimental values. The one exception is that no combination of ion parameters and water model considered here was found to accurately reproduce experimental self-diffusion coefficients. Additionally, we found that cations optimized for SPC/E and TIP3P water displayed consistent underpredictions in the hydration free energy, whereas anions consistently overpredicted the hydration free energy.},

This diameter is within the range of probable sizes that the reported families of critical silane clusters could have based on their actual molecular structure.

We first considered gas-phase clusters with different atomic compositions; then, we deposited all of them on a pristine (100)MgO surface and finally on a more realistic (100)MgO F-center. We performed a global and unrestricted search of the (cluster + surface) geometry. The Mexican enhanced genetic algorithm has been used to exhaustively explore the potential energy surface. Our results show that O 2 activation depends on the Au n /Ag m ratio. It has been found that both metals involved play different and important roles toward (a) the actual O 2 dissociation and (b) weakening of the oxygen-cluster bond, which, in turn, may promote the possibility of a catalytic process to take place, such as the oxidation process of CO and NO x among others.},

Although some theoretical papers have supposed possible roles for it in more complicated systems, it has yet to be experimentally observed. To aid experiment in detecting this molecule, we have examined the H 2 O + SO 2 potential energy surface at the CCSDT(Q)/CBS//CCSD(T)-F12b/cc-pVTZ-F12b level of theory to resolve standing discrepancies in previous reports and predict the gas-phase vibrational spectrum for H 2 SO 3 . We find that sulfurous acid has two potentially detectable rotamers, separated by 1.1 kcal mol −1 Δ H 0K with a torsional barrier of 1.6 kcal mol −1 . The sulfonic acid isomer is only 6.9 kcal mol −1 above the lowest enthalpy sulfurous acid rotamer, but the barrier to form it is 57.2 kcal mol −1 . Error in previous reports can be attributed to misidentified stationary points, the use of density functionals that perform poorly for this system, and, most importantly, the basis set sensitivity of sulfur. Using VPT2+K, we determine that the intense S=O stretch fundamental of each species is separated from other intense peaks by at least 25 cm −1 , providing a target for identification by infrared spectroscopy.},

Hirshfeld partitioning and charge density localization are applied to express polarizability derivatives as charge flow modulations. Model systems consisting of pyridines, thiols, and carbenes interacting with metal clusters are studied using time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate that the mode-specific enhancements can be explained as Raman bonds conjugated across the molecule-metal interface. We also illustrate that the changes in Raman intensities induced by electric fields or chemical substitutions can generally be interpreted as changes of charge flows. The model is shown to work consistently for different types of molecule-metal bonds. Furthermore, our work shows that increasing the Raman bond conjugation across the interface leads to stronger chemical enhancements. The Raman bond model developed in this work provides a quantitative and intuitive interpretation of the chemical mechanism in SERS.},

  abstract = {Coordination numbers are among the central quantities to describe the local environment of atoms and are thus used in various applications such as structure analysis, fingerprints, and parameters. Yet, there is no consensus regarding a practical algorithm, and many proposed methods are designed for specific systems. In this work, we propose a scale-free and parameter-free algorithm for nearest neighbor identification. This algorithm extends the powerful Solid-Angle based Nearest-Neighbor (SANN) framework to explicitly include local anisotropy. As such, our Anisotropically corrected SANN (ASANN) algorithm provides with a fast, robust, and adaptive method for computing coordination numbers. The ASANN algorithm is applied to flat and corrugated metallic surfaces to demonstrate that the expected coordination numbers are retrieved without the need for any system-specific adjustments. The same applies to the description of the coordination numbers of metal atoms in AuCu nanoparticles, and we show that ASANN based coordination numbers are well adapted for automatically counting neighbors and the establishment of cluster expansions. Analysis of classical molecular dynamics simulations of an electrified graphite electrode reveals a strong link between the coordination number of Cs + ions and their position within the double layer, a relation that is absent for Na + , which keeps its first solvation shell even close to the electrode.},

  abstract = {Reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, especially those employing acceleration techniques, can provide useful insights on the mechanism underlying the transformation of buried organic matter, yet, so far, it remains extremely difficult to predict the time scales associated with these processes at moderate temperatures (i.e., when such time scales are considerably larger than those accessible to MD). We propose here an accelerated method based on flux sampling and kinetic integration along a 1D order parameter that can considerably extend the accessible time scales. We demonstrate the utility of this technique in an application to the dehydration of crystalline cellulose at temperatures ranging from 1900 K to 1500 K. The full decomposition is obtained at all temperatures apart from T = 1500 K, showing the same distribution of the main volatiles (H 2 O, CO, and CO 2 ) as recently obtained using replica exchange molecular dynamics. The kinetics of the process is well fitted with an Arrhenius law with E a = 93 kcal/mol and k 0 = 9 × 10 19 s −1 , which are somehow larger than experimental reports. Unexpectedly, the process seems to considerably slow down at lower temperatures, severely departing from the Arrhenius regime, probably because of an inadequate choice of the order parameter. Nevertheless, we show that the proposed method allows considerable time sampling at low temperatures compared to conventional MD.},

  abstract = {This paper presents techniques for Fock matrix construction that are designed for high performance on shared and distributed memory parallel computers when using Gaussian basis sets. Four main techniques are considered. (1) To calculate electron repulsion integrals, we demonstrate batching together the calculation of multiple shell quartets of the same angular momentum class so that the calculation of large sets of primitive integrals can be efficiently vectorized. (2) For multithreaded summation of entries into the Fock matrix, we investigate using a combination of atomic operations and thread-local copies of the Fock matrix. (3) For distributed memory parallel computers, we present a globally accessible matrix class for accessing distributed Fock and density matrices. The new matrix class introduces a batched mode for remote memory access that can reduce the synchronization cost. (4) For density fitting, we exploit both symmetry (of the Coulomb and exchange matrices) and sparsity (of 3-index tensors) and give a performance comparison of density fitting and the conventional direct calculation approach. The techniques are implemented in an open-source software library called GTFock.},

The electrostatic force is defined by particle dimensions and charge, dielectric constants of the interacting particles and medium, and the interparticle separation distance; and it is expressed in the form of an integral over the particle surface. The switching behavior between like charge repulsion and attraction is demonstrated as depending on the ratio of the major and minor axes of spheroids. When the major and minor axes are equal, the theory yields a solution equivalent to that obtained for spherical particles. Limiting cases are presented for nonpolarizable spheroids, which describe the electrostatic behavior of charged rods, discs, and point charges.

We extend this approach to the influence of more than one change in chemical environment and show a methodological way of resolution. This is achieved by taking double differences of corresponding σ NOE / σ ROE ratios of the systems studied and separating specific, unspecific, and intermediate influence.

  abstract = {It is believed that the density functional theory (DFT) describes most elements with s , p , and d orbitals very well, except some materials that have strongly localized and correlated valence electrons. In this work, we find that the widely employed exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, including local-density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and meta-GGA, underestimate the shear modulus and phase stability of V and Nb greatly. The advanced hybrid functional that is usually better for correlated systems, on the other hand, completely fails in these two simple metals. This striking failure is revealed due to the orbital localization error in GGA, which is further deteriorated by hybrid functionals. This observation is corroborated by a similar failure of DFT+ U and van der Waals functionals when applied to V and Nb. To remedy this problem, a semiempirical approach of DFT+ J is proposed, which can delocalize electrons by facilitating the on-site exchange. Furthermore, it is observed that including density derivatives slightly improves the performance of the semilocal functionals, with meta-GGA outperforms GGA, and the latter is better than LDA. This discovery indicates the possibility and necessity to include higher-order density derivatives beyond the Laplacian level for the purpose of removing the orbital localization error (mainly from d orbitals) and delocalization error (mainly from s and p orbitals) completely in V and Nb so that a better description of their electronic structures is achieved. The same strategy can be applied to the other d electron system and f electron system.},

The aim is to test whether more computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer better transferability between solution and solid phases, with the ultimate goal being the study of crystal nucleation, growth, and other interfacial phenomena involving these ionic compounds. In the context of hybrid perovskites, AMOEBA force field parameters already exist for several elements in solution, and we decided to leave them unchanged and to only parameterize the missing ones (Pb 2+ and CH 3 NH 3 + ions) in order to maximize transferability and avoid overfitting to the specific examples studied here. Overall, we find that AMOEBA yields accurate hydration free energies (within 5\%) for typical ionic species while showing the correct ordering of stability for the different crystal polymorphs of CsPbI 3 and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 . Although the existing parameters do not accurately reproduce all transition temperatures and lattice parameters, AMOEBA offers better transferability between solution and solid states than existing nonpolarizable force fields.},

  abstract = {The coupled cluster method with single-, double-, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] is considered to be one of the most reliable quantum chemistry theories. However, the steep scaling of CCSD(T) has limited its application to small or medium-sized systems for a long time. In our previous work, the linear scaling domain based local pair natural orbital CCSD variant (DLPNO-CCSD) has been developed for closed-shell and open-shell. However, it is known from extensive benchmark studies that triple-excitation contributions are important to reach chemical accuracy. In the present work, two linear scaling (T) approximations for open-shell DLPNO-CCSD are implemented and compared: (a) an algorithm based on the semicanonical approximation, in which off-diagonal Fock matrix elements in the occupied space are neglected [referred to as DLPNO-(T 0 )]; and (b) an improved algorithm in which the triples amplitudes are computed iteratively [referred to as DLPNO-(T)]. This work is based on the previous open-shell DLPNO-CCSD algorithm [M. Saitow et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 146 , 164105 (2017)] as well as the iterative (T) correction for closed-shell systems [Y. Guo et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 148 , 011101 (2018)]. Our results show that the new open-shell perturbative corrections, DLPNO-(T 0 /T), can predict accurate absolute and relative correlation energies relative to the canonical reference calculations with the same basis set. The absolute energies from DLPNO-(T) are significantly more accurate than those of DLPNO-(T 0 ). The additional computational effort of DLPNO-(T) relative to DLPNO-(T 0 ) is a factor of 4 on average. We report calculations on systems with more than 4000 basis functions.},

In our “bottom-up approach” to this problem, we once proposed a working minimal model of water-splitting cycle in terms of a mononuclear Mn oxo complex as a catalyst along with water clusters [K. Yamamoto and K. Takatsuka, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 20 , 6708 (2018)]. However, this catalyst is not self-contained in that the cycle additionally needs buffering molecules for electrons and protons in order to reload the Mn complex with electrons and protons, which are lost by photoinduced charge separation processes. We here show that a binuclear Mn oxo complex works as a self-contained photocatalyst without further assistant of additional reagents and propose another catalytic cycle in terms of this photocatalyst. Besides charge separation and proton relay transfer, the proposed cycle consists of other fundamental chemical dynamics including electron–proton reloading, radical relay-transfer, and Mn reduction. The feasibility of the present water-splitting cycle is examined by means of full dimensional nonadiabatic electron–wavepacket dynamics based on multireference electronic wavefunctions and energy profiles estimated with rather accurate quantum chemical methods for all the metastable states appearing in the cycle.},

A new methodology for calculating precise and accurate values of E s is presented. It is shown for the first time that E s rather than E is constant during structural changes occurring within a supercooled liquid. It is also explained how to prepare and conduct microsecond range bulk-phase NVE simulations with essentially zero energy drift without the need for thermostating. The drift is analyzed with block averaging and new drift functions of the shadow energy. With such minimal drift, extremely small and accurate standard errors in the mean for quantities like E s , E , and temperature, T , can be obtained. Values of the standard error for E s of ≈10 −10 in molecule-based reduced units can be routinely achieved for simulations of 10 8 time steps. This corresponds to a simulation temperature drift of ≈10 −6 K/ μ s, six orders of magnitude smaller than generally considered to be acceptable for protein simulations. We also show for the first time how these treatments can be extended with no loss of accuracy to polyatomic systems with both flexible degrees of freedom and arbitrary geometric constraints imposed via the SHAKE algorithm. As a bonus, estimates of simulation-average kinetic and total energies from high order velocity expressions can be obtained to a good approximation from 2nd order velocities and the average mean square force (for polyatomics, this refers to per site, including any constraint forces).},

Further decomposition of the most important amplitudes obtained from these SVDs allows for the analysis of the dispersion-specific virtual orbitals that are naturally localized. Consistent with previous work on intermolecular dispersion interactions in dimers, it is found that three important geminals arise and account for the majority of dispersion interactions at the long range, even in the many body intramolecular case. Furthermore, it is shown that as few as three localized virtual orbitals per occupied orbital can be enough to capture all pairwise long-range dispersion interactions within a molecule.},

Here, we demonstrate that by applying the Jacobi-Davidson algorithm, one can solve the generalized eigenvalue problem iteratively without having to build and store the matrices in question. The resulting direct linear method greatly lowers the cost and improves the scaling of the algorithm with respect to the number of parameters. To further improve the efficiency of optimization for wavefunctions with a large number of parameters, we use the first order method AMSGrad far from the minimum as it is very inexpensive and only switch to the direct linear method near the end of the optimization where methods such as AMSGrad have long convergence tails. We apply this improved optimizer to wavefunctions with real and orbital space Jastrow factors applied to a symmetry-projected generalized Hartree-Fock reference. Systems addressed include atomic systems such as beryllium and neon, molecular systems such as the carbon dimer and iron( ii ) porphyrin, and model systems such as the Hubbard model and hydrogen chains.},

The most suitable algorithm to maintain a dihedral-angle constraint is numerically compared to the alternative to use distance constraints to this end.

  abstract = {A Monte Carlo method is proposed for transforming high-dimensional potential energy surfaces evaluated on discrete grid points into a sum-of-products form, more precisely into a Canonical Polyadic Decomposition form. To this end, a modified existing ansatz based on the alternating least squares method is used, in which numerically exact integrals are replaced with Monte Carlo integrals. This largely reduces the numerical cost by avoiding the evaluation of the potential on all grid points and allows the treatment of surfaces with many degrees of freedom. Calculations on the 15D potential of the protonated water dimer (Zundel cation) in a sum-of-products form are presented and compared to the results obtained in a previous work [M. Schröder and H.-D. Meyer, J. Chem. Phys. 147 , 064105 (2017)], where a sum-of-products form of the potential was obtained in the Tucker format.},

To this end, coarse-grained simulations of the release process were performed. In this way, the inner structure and topology of the polymer network can be explicitly taken into account as well. Our in silico experiments reveal that the boundary condition of constant surface concentration is not appropriate for nanogels. In particular, the predictions based on the perfect sink condition clearly overestimate the fraction of drug released. In addition, these simulations provide values for the release exponent that depends on both the diameter of drug molecules and the number of drug molecules loaded in the matrix, which clearly contrasts with the classical prediction of a constant release exponent. Consequently, the widely used classification of drug release mechanisms based on this kinetic exponent must be extended to include new situations.},

A simple, yet highly effective strategy of obtaining high-order dipoles with small, computationally less expensive basis sets is described. Using the finite field method for computing dipoles, energies calculated with small basis sets can be extrapolated to produce dipoles that are comparable to those obtained in high order calculations. The method reduces computational resources by approximately 50\% (allowing the calculation of reliable dipole moments for larger molecules) and simultaneously improves the agreement with experimentally measured infrared transition intensities. For atmospherically important molecules, which are typically too large to consider the use of large basis sets, this procedure will provide the necessary means of improving calculated spectral intensities by several percent.},

  abstract = {This study attempted to propose an efficient scheme at the coupled cluster linear response (CCLR) level to perform large-scale excited-state calculations of not only local excitations but also nonlocal ones such as charge transfers and transitions between delocalized orbitals. Although standard applications of fragmentation techniques to the excited-state calculations brought about the limitations that could only deal with local excitations, this study solved the problem by evaluating the excited states as the poles of dynamical polarizability. Because such an approach previously succeeded at the time-dependent density functional theory level [H. Nakai and T. Yoshikawa, J. Chem. Phys. 146 , 124123 (2017)], this study was considered as an extension to the CCLR level. To evaluate the dynamical polarizability at the CCLR level, we revisited three equivalent formulas, namely, coupled-perturbed self-consistent field (CPSCF), random phase approximation (RPA), and Green’s function (GF). We further extended these formulas to the linear-scaling methods based on the divide-and-conquer (DC) technique. We implemented the CCLR with singles and doubles (CCSDLR) program for the six schemes, i.e., the standard and DC-type CPSCF, RPA, and GF. Illustrative applications of the present methods demonstrated the accuracy and efficiency. Although the standard three treatments could exactly reproduced the conventional frequency-domain CCSDLR results, their computational costs were commonly higher than that of the conventional ones due to large amount of computations for individual frequencies of the external electric field. The DC-type treatments, which approximately reproduced the conventional results, could achieve quasilinear scaling computational costs. Among them, DC-GF was found to exhibit the best performance.},

This setup considerably enlarges the functional space used in the machine learning optimization as compared to the previous work [S.-C. Lin and M. Oettel, SciPost Phys. 6 , 025 (2019)] where the functional is limited to a simple polynomial form. As a result, we find a good approximation for the exact hard rod functional and its direct correlation function. For the Lennard–Jones fluid, we let the network learn (i) the full excess free energy functional and (ii) the excess free energy functional related to interparticle attractions. Both functionals show a good agreement with simulated density profiles for thermodynamic parameters inside and outside the training region.},

  abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has enabled a myriad of bioimaging advances due to its photophysical and photochemical properties. To deepen the mechanistic understanding of such light-induced processes, novel derivatives of GFP chromophore p -HBDI were engineered by fluorination or bromination of the phenolic moiety into superphotoacids, which efficiently undergo excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) in aqueous solution within the short lifetime of the excited state, as opposed to p -HBDI where efficient ESPT is not observed. In addition, we tuned the excited-state lifetime from picoseconds to nanoseconds by conformational locking of the p -HBDI backbone, essentially transforming the nonfluorescent chromophores into highly fluorescent ones. The unlocked superphotoacids undergo a barrierless ESPT without much solvent activity, whereas the locked counterparts exhibit two distinct solvent-involved ESPT pathways. Comparative analysis of femtosecond transient absorption spectra of these unlocked and locked superphotoacids reveals that the ESPT rates adopt an “inverted” kinetic behavior as the thermodynamic driving force increases upon locking the backbone. Further experimental and theoretical investigations are expected to shed more light on the interplay between the modified electronic structure (mainly by dihalogenation) and nuclear motions (by conformational locking) of the functionalized GFP derivatives (e.g., fluorescence on and off).},

Metal-ion doping has been proven to have a robust influence on the electronic band structure, PL behavior, and charge carrier recombination dynamics.

In this study, we used coarse-grained dissipative particle dynamics simulations to clarify the influence of pore morphology on the self-diffusion of water in linear-triblock-copolymer membranes. We considered representative lamellar, cylindrical, and gyroid morphologies and present results for both the global and local diffusivities of water in the pores. Our results suggest that the diffusivity of water in the confined, polymer-coated pores differs from that in the unconfined bulk. Explicitly, in confinement, the mobility of water is reduced by the hydrodynamic friction arising from the hydrophilic blocks coating the pore walls. We demonstrate that in lamella and cylindrical morphologies, the latter effects can be rendered as a universal function of the pore size relative to the brush height of the hydrophilic blocks.},

Characteristically, these clusters move ballistically during their formation but dynamically revert their velocity and temporarily move opposite to the self-propulsion direction of the Janus particles they contain. Here, we explore a simple effective model of colloidal mixtures that allows reproducing most aspects seen in experiments, including the morphology and the velocity-reversal of the clusters. We attribute the latter to the nonreciprocal phoretic attractions of the passive particles to the active colloids’ caps, taking place even at close contact and pushing the active particles backwards. When the phoretic interactions are repulsive, in turn, they cause dynamical aggregation of passive colloids in the chemical density minima produced by the active particles, as recently seen in experiments; in other parameter regimes, they induce traveling fronts of active particles pursued by passive ones coexisting with an active gas.},

  abstract = {The electrostatic Schwinger-Dyson equations are derived and solved for an electrolyte mixture composed of monovalent and multivalent ions confined to a negatively charged nanoslit. The closure of these equations is based on an asymmetric treatment of the ionic species with respect to their electrostatic coupling strength: the weakly coupled monovalent ions are treated within a gaussian approximation, while the multivalent counterions of high coupling strength are incorporated with a strong-coupling approach. The resulting self-consistent formalism includes explicitly the interactions of the multivalent counterions with the monovalent salt. In highly charged membranes characterized by a pronounced multivalent counterion adsorption, these interactions take over the salt-membrane charge coupling. As a result, the increment of the negative membrane charge brings further salt anions into the slit pore and excludes salt cations from the pore into the reservoir. The corresponding like-charge attraction and opposite-charge repulsion effect is amplified by the pore confinement but suppressed by salt addition into the reservoir. The effect is particularly pronounced in high dielectric membranes where the attractive polarization forces lead to a dense multivalent cation layer at the membrane walls. These cation layers act as an effective positive surface charge, resulting in a total monovalent cation exclusion and a strong anion excess even in the case of neutral membrane walls.},

  abstract = {We present a method that takes advantage of the Brownian motion of a colloidal particle to experimentally determine the area stretch modulus of giant liposomes in solution, in regard to the continuum mechanics theory of elasticity. The characteristic parameters of the corresponding model are measured by using the three-dimensional version of digital video microscopy. Such an approach makes use of the diffraction pattern generated by fluorescent spheres found below the focal plane of the microscope objective, allowing the spatial location of the sphere and, thus, the reconstruction of its trajectory. When this particle probe is localized in the neighborhood of a bilayer membrane, its motion causes an elastic distortion of the membrane that is quantifiable. More importantly, such deformation is related to the mentioned modulus, whose measured values are consistent with experimental data obtained through well-known techniques.},

  abstract = {A synthetic challenge in faceted metal oxide nanocrystals (NCs) is realizing tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) near-field response in the infrared (IR). Cube-shaped nanoparticles of noble metals exhibit LSPR spectral tunability limited to visible spectral range. Here, we describe the colloidal synthesis of fluorine, tin codoped indium oxide (F,Sn:In 2 O 3 ) NC cubes with tunable IR range LSPR for around 10 nm particle sizes. Free carrier concentration is tuned through controlled Sn dopant incorporation, where Sn is an aliovalent n -type dopant in the In 2 O 3 lattice. F shapes the NC morphology into cubes by functioning as a surfactant on the {100} crystallographic facets. Cube shaped F,Sn:In 2 O 3 NCs exhibit narrow, shape-dependent multimodal LSPR due to corner, edge, and face centered modes. Monolayer NC arrays are fabricated through a liquid-air interface assembly, further demonstrating tunable LSPR response as NC film nanocavities that can heighten near-field enhancement (NFE). The tunable F,Sn:In 2 O 3 NC near-field is coupled with PbS quantum dots, via the Purcell effect. The detuning frequency between the nanocavity and exciton is varied, resulting in IR near-field dependent enhanced exciton lifetime decay. LSPR near-field tunability is directly visualized through IR range scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS). STEM-EELS mapping of the spatially confined near-field in the F,Sn:In 2 O 3 NC array interparticle gap demonstrates elevated NFE tunability in the arrays.},

Surfaces of CeO 2 (111) doped with quadrivalent (Ti, Zr), trivalent (Al, Ga, Sc, Y, La), or divalent (Ca, Sr, Ba) cations are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations modified for onsite Coulomb interactions (DFT + U ). Trivalent (except for Al) and divalent cation doping induces the formation of intrinsic oxygen vacancy (O vac ), which is backfilled easily by H 2 O. Partially OH-terminated surfaces are formed. Furthermore, dissociative adsorption of H 2 O is simulated on the OH terminated surfaces (for trivalent or divalent cation doped models) and pure surfaces (for Al and quadrivalent cation doped surfaces). The ionic radius is crucially important. In fact, H 2 O dissociates spontaneously on the small cations. Although a slight change is induced by doping as for the H 2 O adsorption energy at Ce sites, the H 2 O dissociative adsorption at Ce sites is well-assisted by dopants with a smaller ionic radius. In terms of the amount of promoted Ce sites, the arrangement of dopant sites is also fundamentally important.},

  abstract = {High-density cultured neuronal networks have been used to evaluate synchronized features of neuronal populations. Voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging of a dissociated cultured neuronal network is a critical method for studying synchronized neuronal activity in single cells. However, the signals of VSD are generally too faint—that is, the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is too low—to detect neuronal activity. In our previous research, a silver (Ag) plasmonic chip enhanced the fluorescence intensity of VSD to detect spontaneous neural spikes on VSD imaging. However, no high-density network was cultivated on the Ag plasmonic chip, perhaps because of the chemical instability of the Ag surface. In this study, to overcome the instability of the chip, we used a chemically stable gold (Au) plasmonic dish, which was a plastic dish with a plasmonic chip pasted to the bottom, to observe neuronal activity in a high-density neuronal network. We expected that the S/N in real-time VSD imaging of the Au plasmonic chip would be improved compared to that of a conventional glass-bottomed dish, and we also expected to detect frequent neural spikes. The increase in the number of spikes when inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors were inhibited suggests that the spikes corresponded to neural activity. Therefore, real-time VSD imaging of an Au plasmonic dish was effective for measuring spontaneous network activity in a high-density neuronal network at the spatial resolution of a single cell.},

The absorption cross sections of the various Au nanoparticles linearly increase with respect to their increasing dimensions, hence being ideal tunable systems for the enhancement of the electric field in the dichalcogenide layers under visible and near infrared. The photocurrent through the MoTe 2 and MoS 2 substrates was enhanced by the addition of Au nanoparticles when the plasmonic response was localized in the area of the particle in contact with the substrate. Based on these findings, the use of Au nanoparticles can greatly improve the unique photocurrent properties of Mo dichalcogenides; however, nanoparticle orientation and size must be considered to tune the enhancement at the specific wavelengths. This computational work provides useful design rules for the use of plasmonic nanomaterials in photocatalytic and photocurrent enhancement of transition metal dichalcogenides.},

  abstract = {The origins of the complex Fe 2p X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) of hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 ) are analyzed and related to the character of the bonding in this compound. This analysis provides a new and novel view of the reasons for XPS binding energies (BEs) and BE shifts, which deepens the current understanding and interpretation of the physical and chemical significance of the XPS. In particular, many-body effects are considered for the initial and the final, 2p-hole configuration wavefunctions. It is shown that a one-body or one-configuration analysis is not sufficient and that the many-body, many-determinantal, and many-configurational character of the wavefunctions must be taken into account to describe and understand why the XPS intensity is spread over an extremely large number of final 2p-hole multiplets. The focus is on the consequences of angular momentum coupling of the core and valence open shell electrons, the ligand field splittings of the valence shell orbitals, and the degree of covalent mixing of the Fe(3d) electrons with the O(2p) electrons. Novel theoretical methods are used to estimate the importance of these various terms. An important consequence of covalency is a reduction in the energy separation of the multiplets. Although shake satellites are not considered explicitly, the total losses of intensity from the angular momentum multiplets to shake satellites is determined and related to the covalent character of the Fe-O interaction. The losses are found to be the same for Fe 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 ionization.},

Using elastic and quasielastic neutron scattering techniques and group theoretical analysis, we studied the structural phase transitions and rotational modes of the C 8 H 17 NH 3 + cation in (OA) 2 PbI 4 . Our results show that, in the high-temperature orthorhombic ( T &gt; 310 K) phase, the OA + cation exhibits a combination of a twofold rotation of the NH 3 –CH 2 head group about the crystal c -axis with a characteristic relaxation time of ∼6.2 ps, threefold rotations (C 3 ) of NH 3 and CH 3 terminal groups, and slow librations of the other atoms. Contrastingly, only the C 3 rotation is present in the intermediate-temperature orthorhombic (238 K &lt; T &lt; 310 K) and low-temperature monoclinic ( T &lt; 238 K) phases.},

  abstract = {Lithium-sulfur batteries show remarkable potential for energy storage applications due to their high-specific capacity and the low cost of active materials, especially sulfur. However, whereas there is a consensus about the use of lithium metal as the negative electrode, there is not a clear and widely accepted architectural design for the positive electrode of sulfur batteries. The difficulties arise when trying to find a balance between high-surface-area architectures and practical utilization of the sulfur content. Intensive understanding of the interfacial mechanisms becomes then crucial to design optimized carbon-hosted sulfur architectures with enhanced electrochemical performance. In this work, we use density functional theory (DFT)-based first principles calculations to describe and characterize the growing mechanisms of Li 2 S active material on graphene, taken as an example of a nonencapsulated carbon host for the positive electrode of Li-S batteries. We first unravel the two growing mechanisms of Li 2 S supported nanostructures, which explain recent experimental findings on real-time monitoring of interfacial deposition of lithium sulfides during discharge, obtained by means of in situ atomic force microscopy. Then, using a combination of mathematical tools and DFT calculations, we obtain the first cycle voltage plot, explaining the three different regions observed that ultimately lead to the formation of high-order polysulfides upon charge. Finally, we show how the different Li 2 S supported nanostructures can be characterized in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Altogether, this work provides useful insights for the rational design of new carbon-hosted sulfur architectures with optimized characteristics for the positive electrode of lithium-sulfur batteries.},

Here, we demonstrate that a photogenerated radical (spin qubit) pair within a covalent donor-chromophore-acceptor molecule can be used to successfully execute a CNOT gate with high fidelity. The donor is tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), the chromophore is 8-aminonaphthalene-1,8-dicarboximide (ANI), and the acceptor is pyromellitimide (PI). Selective photoexcitation of ANI with a 416 nm laser pulse results in subnanosecond formation of the TTF •+ -ANI-PI •− radical (spin qubit) pair at 85 K having a 1.8 µ s phase memory time. This is sufficiently long to execute a CNOT gate using a sequence of five microwave pulses followed by a sequence of two pulses that read out all the elements of the density matrix. Comparing these data to a simulation of the data that assumes ideal conditions results in a fidelity of 0.97 for the execution of the CNOT gate. These results show that photogenerated molecular spin qubit pairs can be used to execute this essential quantum gate at modest temperatures, which affords the possibility that chemical synthesis can be used to develop structures to execute more complex quantum logic operations using electron spins.},

  abstract = {Tillandsia landbeckii is a rootless plant thriving in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert of Chile. These plants use unique cellulose-based microscopic structures called trichomes to collect fresh water from coastal fog. The trichomes rely on a passive mechanism to maintain an asymmetrical transport of water: they allow for the fast absorption of liquid water deposited by sporadic fog events while preventing evaporation during extended drought periods. Inspired by the trichome’s design, we study fluid transport through a micrometric valve. Combining Grand Canonical Monte Carlo with Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations, we first analyze the adsorption and transport of a fluid through a single nanopore at different chemical potentials. We then scale up the atomic results using a lattice approach, and simulate the transport at the micrometric scale. Results obtained for a model Lennard-Jones fluid and TIP4P/2005 water were compared, allowing us to identify the key physical parameters for achieving a passive hydraulic valve. Our results show that the difference in transport properties of water vapor and liquid water within the cellulose layer is the basis for the ability of the Tillandsia trichome to function as a water valve. Finally, we predict a critical pore dimension above which the cellulose layer can form an efficient valve.},

  abstract = {We perform extensive numerical simulations of a paradigmatic model glass former, the hard-sphere fluid with 10\% polydispersity. We sample from the ensemble of trajectories with fixed observation time, whereby single trajectories are generated by event-driven molecular dynamics. We show that these trajectories can be characterized in terms of the local structure, and we find a dynamical-structural (active-inactive) phase transition between two dynamical phases: one dominated by liquidlike trajectories with a low degree of local order and one dominated by glassylike trajectories with a high degree of local order. We show that both phases coexist and are separated by a spatiotemporal interface. Sampling exceptionally long trajectories allows us to perform a systematic finite-size scaling analysis. We find excellent agreement with Binder’s scaling theory for first-order transitions. Interestingly, the coexistence region narrows at higher densities, supporting the idea of a critical point controlling the dynamic arrest. Scaling of the susceptibility suggests that the critical behavior falls into the universality class of directed percolation in 3 + 1 dimensions.},

  abstract = {For the HCl molecule, four photodissociation channels are open in the excitation energy region 14.6–15.0 eV: H(2 s ) + Cl( 2 P 3/2 ), H(2 p ) + Cl( 2 P 3/2 ), H(2 s ) + Cl( 2 P 1/2 ), and H(2 p ) + Cl( 2 P 1/2 ). We measured the fragment angular distributions and the branching ratios of the four dissociation channels by using the extreme ultraviolet laser pump and UV laser probe, delay-time-curve, and velocity map imaging methods. The channel-resolved fragment angular distributions and fragment yield spectra show that various Rydberg states (superexcited states) contribute to the absorption cross sections, including the [A 2 Σ + ]4 pσ , [A 2 Σ + ]4 pπ , [A 2 Σ + ]3 dσ , [A 2 Σ + ]3 dπ , and [A 2 Σ + ]5 sσ states. Most of the H(2 s ) + Cl( 2 P 1/2 ) channels correlate with the 1 Σ + states, while the other channels correlate with mixing excitations of the 1 Σ + and 1,3 Π states. The channel branching ratios are dependent on the excitation energies. When the four channels are open, the channel branching ratios of H(2 s ) + Cl( 2 P 3/2 ) and H(2 p ) + Cl( 2 P 1/2 ) are small. Based on the recent ab initio potential energy curves, the Rydberg states converging to the ion-core A 2 Σ + are proposed to be predissociated by the nuclear vibrational continua of the Rydberg states converging to the ion-core X 2 Π.},

  abstract = {Helium nanodroplets can serve as reaction containers for photoinduced time-resolved studies of cold, isolated molecular systems that are otherwise inaccessible. Recently, three different dynamical processes, triggered by photoexcitation of a single atom inside a droplet, were observed in their natural time scale: Expansion of the He solvation shell (He bubble) within 600 fs initiates a collective bubble oscillation with a ∼30 ps oscillation period, followed by dopant ejection after ∼60 ps. Here, we present a systematic investigation of these processes by combining time-resolved photoelectron and photoion spectroscopy with time-dependent He density functional theory simulations. By variation of the photoexcitation energy, we find that the full excess excitation energy, represented by the blue-shifted in-droplet excitation band, is completely transferred to the He environment during the bubble expansion. Surprisingly, we find that variation of the droplet size has only a minor influence on the ejection time, providing insight into the spatial distribution of the ground-state atoms before photoexcitation. Simulated particle trajectories after photoexcitation are in agreement with experimental observations and suggest that the majority of ground-state atoms are located at around 16 Å below the droplet surface. Bubble expansion and oscillation are purely local effects, depending only on the ultimate dopant environment. These solvation-induced dynamics will be superimposed on intramolecular dynamics of molecular systems, and a mechanistic description is fundamental for the interpretation of future experiments.},

Absorption signals are recorded using near quantum shot noise limited laser absorption methods. The fully resolved absorption spectra of the CH stretch ( ν 1 ) fundamental band and a partial progression of transitions of the HCF bend plus CF stretch ( ν 2 + ν 3 ) combination band are observed and show clear evidence of a strong rovibrational coupling between the ν 1 K a ′ = 2 and ν 2 + ν 3 K a ′ = 3 manifolds, including the observation of “dark state” transitions. A detailed perturbation analysis of a c-type Coriolis interaction is carried out for these two coupled vibrational states, providing experimental determination of precise rovibrational constants. A combined ground state combination difference fit of the transitions to the ν 1 and ν 2 + ν 3 vibrational states in this study with previously reported LIF Ã(0,0,0) ← X ̃ (0,0,0) data has been done to increase the accuracy of the ground state rotational constants [M. Kakimoto et al. , J. Mol. Spec. 88 , 300–310 (1981)]. Moreover, we report, for the first time, hot band ( ν 1 + ν 3 ← ν 3 ) transitions due to vibrationally excited HCF in the CF stretch mode, ν 3 . The high-resolution results for all vibrational frequencies and rotational constants are in good agreement with and significantly extend the analysis of the rovibrational manifold of HCF. The present ground state and ν 3 spectroscopic parameters now permit improved predictions for pure rotational and ν 3 fundamental transitions to aid spectral searches for HCF in the laboratory and the interstellar medium.},

  abstract = {Clocking of electronically and vibrationally state-resolved channels of the fast photodissociation of CH 3 I in the A -band is re-examined in a combined experimental and theoretical study. Experimentally, a femtosecond pump-probe scheme is employed in the modality of resonant probing by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of the methyl fragment in different vibrational states and detection through fragment velocity map ion (VMI) imaging as a function of the time delay. We revisit excitation to the center of the A -band at 268 nm and report new results for excitation to the blue of the band center at 243 nm. Theoretically, two approaches have been employed to shed light into the observations: first, a reduced dimensionality 4D nonadiabatic wavepacket calculation using the potential energy surfaces by Xie et al. [J. Phys. Chem. A 104 , 1009 (2000)]; and second, a full dimension 9D trajectory surface-hopping calculation on the same potential energy surfaces, including the quantization of vibrational states of the methyl product. In addition, high level ab initio electronic structure calculations have been carried out to describe the CH 3 3 p z Rydberg state involved in the (2 + 1) REMPI probing process, as a function of the carbon-iodine (C–I) distance. A general qualitative agreement is obtained between experiment and theory, but the effect of methyl vibrational excitation in the umbrella mode on the clocking times is not well reproduced. The theoretical results reveal that no significant effect on the state-resolved appearance times is exerted by the nonadiabatic crossing through the conical intersection present in the first absorption band. The vibrationally state resolved clocking times observed experimentally can be rationalized when the (2 + 1) REMPI probing process is considered. None of the other probing methods applied thus far, i.e., multiphoton ionization photoelectron spectroscopy, soft X-ray inner-shell photoelectron spectroscopy, VUV single-photon ionization, and XUV core-to-valence transient absorption spectroscopy, have been able to provide quantum state-resolved (vibrational) clocking times. More experiments would be needed to disentangle the fine details in the clocking times and dissociation dynamics arising from the detection of specific quantum-states of the molecular fragments.},

The expected alignment is indeed observed in the case of O 2 molecules ionized by intense laser pulses of 800 nm wavelength and 25 fs duration, as observed through velocity imaging of the fragments. Strikingly, when 35 fs pulses of 400 nm wavelength of comparable intensity are employed, an anomalous hindering of this alignment is observed. In both cases, we propose dissociation pathways for the energetic ions consistent with the recorded kinetic energy distributions. Using a semiclassical model of induced rotation of the molecular ion that involves polarizabilities of the participating excited states, both behaviors are reproduced. The model suggests that the difference in the observations can be attributed to a transient negative polarizability in an intermediate state of the proposed pathway.},

Here, we present results obtained by photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) that allows for determining the sign of J . By variation of the magnetic field from 1 mT to 9.4 T, pronounced absorptive maxima of CIDNP were detected for more than 20 1 H nuclei disregarding the sign of their hyperfine coupling constants in the transient charge separated state, with positions of maxima close to those found by the MARY technique. Quantitative comparison of the observed CIDNP signals for various D-X-A dyads reveals an increase in the CIDNP enhancement factor with increasing population of the triplet state determined by MARY spectroscopy at zero magnetic field. For CIDNP of the methyl groups of the TAA donor dyads, we found in all studies a good linear dependence between the CIDNP signal amplitude and the initial population of the CS triplet state. The linear relationship together with the absorptive CIDNP allows us to conclude that (i) the sign of the electronic exchange interaction J ex is positive, (ii) CIDNP is formed predominantly in the vicinity of level anticrossing between the T + and S electronic levels, and (iii) coherent triplet-singlet transitions are induced by hyperfine interaction and accompanied by simultaneous electron and nuclear spin flip, T + β → S α ⁠ .},

  abstract = {Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) is an inexpensive and simple hyperpolarization technique that is capable of boosting nuclear magnetic resonance sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. It utilizes the reversible binding of para -hydrogen, as hydride ligands, and a substrate of interest to a metal catalyst to allow for polarization transfer from para -hydrogen into substrate nuclear spins. While the resulting nuclear spin populations can be dramatically larger than those normally created, their lifetime sets a strict upper limit on the experimental timeframe. Consequently, short nuclear spin lifetimes are a challenge for hyperpolarized metabolic imaging. In this report, we demonstrate how both hyperpolarization and long nuclear spin lifetime can be simultaneously achieved in nitrogen-15 containing derivatives of pyridazine and phthalazine by SABRE. These substrates were chosen to reflect two distinct classes of 15 N 2 -coupled species that differ according to their chemical symmetry and thereby achieve different nuclear spin lifetimes. The pyridazine derivative proves to exhibit a signal lifetime of ∼2.5 min and can be produced with a signal enhancement of ∼2700. In contrast, while the phthalazine derivative yields a superior 15 000-fold 15 N signal enhancement at 11.7 T, it has a much shorter signal lifetime.},

Lang and F. Neese, J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 104104 (2019)]. The multipartitioning idea allows the use of state-specific 0th order Hamiltonians in a multistate framework and could therefore alleviate the mentioned problem. However, the effective Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian in the traditional formulation of multipartitioning, which can lead to unphysical behavior, especially for nearly degenerate states. In order to achieve a more balanced treatment of states with different physical character and at the same time have a Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, we combine in this work multipartitioning with canonical Van Vleck perturbation theory. At the 2nd order, the result is a Hermitian variant of multipartitioning quasidegenerate N-electron valence state perturbation theory. The effect of model space noninvariance of the method is discussed and the benefit of a Hermitian formulation is highlighted with numerical examples. The method is shown to give good results for the calculation of electronic transitions of the [CuCl 4 ] 2 − complex and for the calculation of electron paramagnetic resonance parameters, which are two examples where the balance between ligand field and charge transfer configurations is of utmost importance.},

  abstract = {We present a method for efficient calculation of intramolecular vibrational excitations of H 2 O inside C 60 , together with the low-energy intermolecular translation-rotation states within each intramolecular vibrational manifold. Apart from assuming rigid C 60 , this nine-dimensional (9D) quantum treatment is fully coupled. Following the recently introduced approach [P. M. Felker and Z. Bačić, J. Chem. Phys. 151 , 024305 (2019)], the full 9D vibrational Hamiltonian of H 2 O@C 60 is partitioned into two reduced-dimension Hamiltonians, a 6D one for the intermolecular vibrations and another in 3D for the intramolecular degrees of freedom, and a 9D remainder term. The two reduced-dimension Hamiltonians are diagonalized, and their eigenvectors are used to build up a product contracted basis in which the full vibrational Hamiltonian is diagonalized. The efficiency of this methodology derives from the insight of our earlier study referenced above that converged high-energy intramolecular vibrational excitations of weakly bound molecular complexes can be obtained from fully coupled quantum calculations where the full-dimensional product contracted basis includes only a small number of intermolecular vibrational eigenstates spanning the range of energies much below those of the intramolecular vibrational states of interest. In this study, the eigenstates included in the 6D intermolecular contacted basis extend to only 410 cm −1 above the ground state, which is much less than the H 2 O stretch and bend fundamentals, at ≈3700 and ≈1600 cm −1 , respectively. The 9D calculations predict that the fundamentals of all three intramolecular modes, as well as the bend overtone, of the caged H 2 O are blueshifted relative to those of the gas-phase H 2 O, the two stretch modes much more so than the bend. Excitation of the bend mode affects the energies of the low-lying H 2 O rotational states significantly more than exciting either of the stretching modes. The center-of-mass translational fundamental is virtually unaffected by the excitation of any of the intramolecular vibrational modes. Further progress hinges on the experimental measurement of the vibrational frequency shifts in H 2 O@C 60 and ab initio calculation of a high-quality 9D potential energy surface for this endohedral complex, neither of which is presently available.},

  abstract = {Implementation of the harmonically mapped averaging (HMA) framework in the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) is presented for on-the-fly computations of the energy, pressure, and heat capacity of crystalline systems during canonical molecular dynamics simulations. HMA has a low central processing unit and storage requirements and is straightforward to use. As a case study, the properties of the Lennard-Jones and embedded-atom model (parameterized for nickel) crystals are computed. The results demonstrate the higher efficiency of the new class compared to the inbuilt LAMMPS classes for calculating these properties. However, HMA loses its effectiveness in systems where diffusion occurs in the crystal, and an example is presented to allow this behavior to be recognized. In addition to its improved precision, HMA is less affected by small errors introduced by having a larger time step in molecular dynamics simulations. We also present an analysis of the effect of potential truncation on anharmonic properties, and show that artifacts of truncation on the HMA averages can be eliminated simply by shifting the potential energy to zero at the truncation radius. Full properties can be obtained by adding easily computed values for the lattice and harmonic properties using the untruncated potential.},

Using geometrical optimization, we locate minima and transition states on the landscape for pentamers. We show that it is easy to find the parameters that give the lowest energy minimum and that the distribution of minima on the alchemical landscape is concentrated in particular areas. In contrast to the usual changes to an energy landscape when adding more degrees of freedom, we find that introducing alchemical degrees of freedom can reduce the number of minima. Moreover, compared to landscapes of the same system with fixed parameters, these minima on the alchemical landscape are separated by high barriers. We classify transition states on the alchemical landscape by whether they become minima or remain transition states when the potential parameters are fixed at the stationary point value. We show that those that become minima have a significant alchemical component in the direction of the pathway, while those that remain as transition states can be characterized mainly in terms of atomic displacements.},

The scheme known as gauge including atomic orbitals (GIAOs) is employed to treat the gauge origin problem. This ADFT-GIAO formulation possesses an inherent high computational performance, allowing for the calculation of the EPR g-tensor of molecules containing some hundreds of atoms in reasonable computational time employing moderate computational resources. The effect of the use of a gauge independent auxiliary density on the quality of the g-tensor calculation for the evaluation of the exchange-correlation contribution is analyzed in this work. The best agreement with the experiment is obtained with the BLYP functional (Becke 1988 exchange and Lee-Yang-Parr correlation) in combination with a double- ζ basis set, in particular aug-cc-pVDZ. Furthermore, models of endohedral fullerenes N@C n , with n = {60, 70, 100, 180, 240}, were used for benchmarking its computational performance.},

  abstract = {Within materials informatics, a rapidly developing subfield of materials research, past (curated) data are mined and learned for either discovering new materials or identifying new functionalities of known materials. This paper provides an example of this process. Starting from a recently developed (very diverse) dataset which includes 1346 hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), we downselect a subset of 350 three dimensional HOIPs to a final set of four lead-free HOIPs, including CH 3 NH 3 SnI 3 , HC(NH 2 ) 2 SnI 3 , NH 2 NH 3 SnI 3 , and NH 2 (CH 2 ) 3 SnI 3 , in which the first two were experimentally synthesized and the others remain hypothetical. Using first-principles based computational methods, we show that these HOIPs have preferable electronic band structures and carrier effective mass, good optical properties, and high spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency. Compared to the experimental data, we find that state-of-the-art numerical methods can predict the electronic and optical properties fairly well, while the current model for the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency is inadequate for capturing the power conversion efficiency of a solar absorber. We suggest that the HOIP dataset should be expanded to include larger structures of HOIPs, thereby being more useful for future data-mining and machine-learning approaches.},

  abstract = {Numerous combinations of cations and anions are possible for the production of ionic liquids with fine-tuned properties once the correlation with the molecular structure is known. In this sense, computer simulations are useful tools to explain and even predict the properties of ionic liquids. However, quantum mechanical methods are usually restricted to either small clusters or short time scales so that parameterized force fields are required to study the bulk liquids. In this work, a method is proposed to enable a comparison between the quantum mechanical system and both polarizable and nonpolarizable force fields by means of the calculation of free energy surfaces for the translational motion of the anion around the cation in gas phase. This method was tested for imidazolium-based cations with 3 different anions, [BF 4 ] − , [N(CN) 2 ] − , and [NTf 2 ] − . Better agreement was found with the density functional theory calculations when polarizability is introduced in the force field. In addition, the ion pair free energy surfaces reproduced the main structural patterns observed in the first coordination shell in molecular dynamics simulations of the bulk liquid, proving to be useful probes for the liquid phase structure that can be computed with higher level methods and the comparison with forcefields can indicate further improvements in their parameterization.},

Here, we present a theoretical approach which can account for both the plasmon-exciton coupling and the e-p interaction and produce all the spectral line shapes ranging from Fano antiresonance to Rabi splitting by simply tuning the coupling strength or plasmon damping rate. Additionally, we demonstrate the evolution of vibronic spectra and exciton dynamics with the coupling strength, plasmon damping rate, and detuning energy. It is found that the vibronic structures appearing in Rabi-like spectra are worse resolved, wider, and more largely shifted than those appearing in the Fano regime, attributed to the more significant deformation of the molecular vibrational wavepacket in the Rabi-like regime than that in the Fano regime as the molecular e-p interaction increases. The positive/negative value of detuning energy can induce different degrees of the vibrational wavepacket deformation and subsequently a different effect on the spectra in different coupling regimes.},

  abstract = {Accurate description of the ionization process in DNA is crucial to the understanding of the DNA damage under exposure to ionizing radiation and the exploration of the potential application of DNA strands in nanoelectronics. In this work, by employing our recently developed Green’s function coupled-cluster library on supercomputing facilities, we have studied the spectral functions of several guanine–cytosine (G–C) base pair structures ([G–C] n , n = 1–3) for the first time in a relatively broad near-valence regime ([−25.0, −5.0] eV) in the coupled-cluster with singles and doubles level. Our focus is to give a preliminary many-body coupled-cluster understanding and guideline of the vertical ionization energy (VIE), spectral profile, and ionization feature changes of these systems as the system size expands in this near-valence regime. The results show that, as the system size expands, even though the lowest VIEs keep decreasing, the changes of spectral function profile and the relative peak positions get unexpectedly smaller. Further analysis of the ionized states associated with the most intensive peak in the spectral functions reveals non-negligible |2 h , 1 p ⟩’s in the ionized wave functions of the considered G–C base pair systems. The leading |2 h , 1 p ⟩’s associated with the main ionizations from the cytosine part of the G–C base pairs feature a transition from the intra-base-pair cytosine π → π * excitation to the inter-base-pair electron excitation as the size of G–C base pairs expands, which also indicates the minimum quantum region in the many-body calculations of DNA systems.},
