  abstract     = {Motivated by the notion of Lagrangian multiforms, which provide a Lagrangian formulation of integrability, and by the results of the authors on the role of covariant Hamiltonian formalism for integrable field theories, we propose the notion of Hamiltonian multiforms for integrable 1 + 1-dimensional field theories. They provide the Hamiltonian counterpart of Lagrangian multiforms and encapsulate in a single object an arbitrary number of flows within an integrable hierarchy. For a given hierarchy, taking a Lagrangian multiform as the starting point, we provide a systematic construction of a Hamiltonian multiform based on a generalization of techniques of covariant Hamiltonian field theory. This also produces two other important objects: a symplectic multiform and the related multi-time Poisson bracket. They reduce to a multisymplectic form and the related covariant Poisson bracket if we restrict our attention to a single flow in the hierarchy. Our framework offers an alternative approach to define and derive conservation laws for a hierarchy. We illustrate our results on three examples: the potential Korteweg–de Vries hierarchy, the sine-Gordon hierarchy (in light-cone coordinates), and the Ablowitz–Kaup–Newell–Segur hierarchy.},

  abstract     = {This work provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a symbolic dynamical system to admit a sequence of periodic approximations in the Hausdorff topology. The key result proved and applied here uses graphs that are called De Bruijn graphs, Rauzy graphs, or Anderson–Putnam complex, depending on the community. Combining this with a previous result, the present work justifies rigorously the accuracy and reliability of algorithmic methods used to compute numerically the spectra of a large class of self-adjoint operators. The so-called Hamiltonians describe the effective dynamic of a quantum particle in aperiodic media. No restrictions on the structure of these operators other than general regularity assumptions are imposed. In particular, nearest-neighbor correlation is not necessary. Examples for the Fibonacci and the Golay–Rudin–Shapiro sequences are explicitly provided illustrating this discussion. While the first sequence has been thoroughly studied by physicists and mathematicians alike, a shroud of mystery still surrounds the latter when it comes to spectral properties. In light of this, the present paper gives a new result here that might help uncovering a solution.},

We examine geometric implementations of these algebroids in the para-Hermitian manifold, which is a realization of the doubled space–time in DFT. We show that the strong constraint in DFT is necessary to realize the doubled and non-trivial Poisson structures but can be relaxed for some algebroids.

An approach to the study of such a problem is proposed. We use the inverse scattering transform method in the form of the matrix Riemann–Hilbert (RH) problem, using simultaneous spectral analysis of both the Lax equations. The proposed matrix RH problem solves the problem of the propagation of a sinusoidal signal in an unperturbed stable medium (attenuator). It is proved that this RH problem provides the causality principle for the region t &lt; x , and for the region of the light cone, 0 &lt; x &lt; t allows us to find the asymptotics of the transmitted signal. First, we study the asymptotics of the RH problem for large times, and then, we obtain asymptotic formulas for the mixed problem solution of the Maxwell–Bloch equations when the attenuator is long enough. Three sectors are obtained in the light cone where the asymptotics have essentially different behaviors.},

  abstract     = {The class of integral variational functionals for paths in smooth manifolds, whose extremals are (nonparameterized) sets , is considered in this study. Recently, it was shown that for the functionals depending on tangent vectors, this property follows from any of the following two equivalent conditions: (a) the Lagrange function, defined on the tangent bundle, is positively homogeneous in the components of tangent vectors and (b) the Lepage differential form of the Lagrange function is projectable onto the Grassmann fibrations of rank 1 and order 1 (projective bundle); the classical Hilbert form was rediscovered this way as the projection of the Lepage form. In this paper, we extend these results to variational functionals of any order. Projectability conditions onto Grassmann fibrations of any order are found. The case of projective bundles is then studied in full generality. The proofs are based on the Euler–Zermelo conditions and the properties of higher-order Grassmann fibrations of rank 1. As an application, equations for set solutions in Riemannian geometry are derived.},

Then, we face the study of the resulting model exploiting statistical-mechanics tools in a low-load regime. More precisely, we prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit of the related free energy and we derive the self-consistence equations for its order parameters. These equations are solved numerically to get a phase diagram describing the performance of the system as an associative memory as a function of its intrinsic parameters (i.e., the degree of noise and of correlation among patterns). We find that beyond the standard retrieval and ergodic phases, the relativistic system exhibits correlated and symmetric regions, which are genuine effects of temporal correlation, whose width is, respectively, reduced and increased with respect to the classical case.},

It is shown how these first integrals can be associated via the inverse Noether theorem with a gauged weak Noether symmetry, which admits the given first integral as a Noether integral. It is shown also that the associated Noether symmetry is possible to satisfy the conditions for a Hojman or a form-invariance symmetry; therefore, the so-called non-Noetherian first integrals are gauged weak Noether integrals. The application of the theorem requires a certain algorithm due to the complexity of the special conditions involved. We demonstrate this algorithm by a number of solved examples.

  abstract     = {Zero rest-mass fields of spin 1 (the electromagnetic field) and spin 2 propagating on flat space and their corresponding Newman–Penrose (NP) constants are studied near spatial infinity. The aim of this analysis is to clarify the correspondence between data for these fields on a spacelike hypersurface and the value of their corresponding NP constants at future and past null infinity. To do so, Friedrich’s framework of the cylinder at spatial infinity is employed to show that, expanding the initial data in terms spherical harmonics and powers of the geodesic spatial distance ρ to spatial infinity, the NP constants correspond to the data for the second highest possible spherical harmonic at a fixed order in ρ . In addition, it is shown that for generic initial data within the class considered in this article, there is no natural correspondence between the NP constants at future and past null infinity—for both the Maxwell and spin-2 field. However, if the initial data are time-symmetric, then the NP constants at future and past null infinity have the same information.},

We find various characterizations within the Kundt class in terms of nil-Killing vector fields and obtain a theorem classifying algebraic stability of tensors, which has an application in finding sufficient criteria for a type III deformation of the metric to preserve spi’s. This is used in order to specify Lie algebras of nil-Killing vector fields that preserve the spi’s, for degenerate Kundt metrics. Using this we discuss the characterization of Kundt-Constant scalar invariants spacetimes in terms of nil-Killing vector fields.},

  abstract     = {The reduced thin-sandwich equations (RTSE) appear within Wheeler’s thin-sandwich approach toward the Einstein constraint equations (ECE) of general relativity. It is known that these equations cannot be well-posed, in general, but, on closed manifolds, sufficient conditions for well-posedness have been established. In particular, it has been shown that the RTSE are well posed in a neighborhood of umbilical solutions of the constraint equations without conformal Killing fields. In this paper, we will analyze such a set of equations on the manifolds Euclidean at infinity in a neighborhood of asymptotically Euclidean (AE) solutions of the ECE. The main conclusion in this direction is that on AE-manifolds admitting a Yamabe positive metric, the solutions of the RTSE parameterize an open subset in the space of solutions of the ECE. In addition, we show that in the case of closed manifolds, these equations are well-posed around umbilical solutions of the ECE admitting Killing fields and present some relevant examples. Finally, it will be shown that in the set of umbilical solutions of the vacuum ECE on closed manifolds, the RTSE are generically well-posed.},

This model is a cartoon “matrix model”: the interaction graph mimics that of a single-trace matrix model, which can be holographically dual to quantum gravity. We prove (non-perturbatively in 1/ N and without averaging over any ensemble) that the scrambling time of this model is at least of order log N , consistent with the fast scrambling conjecture.

Among several quantum effects, the phase-space noncommutativity, which arises due to a deformed Heisenberg–Weyl algebra, is of fundamental relevance in quantum systems where quantum signatures and high energy physics play important roles. In low energy physics, however, it may be relevant to address how a quantum deformed algebra could influence some general thermodynamic protocols, employing the well-known noncommutative quantum mechanics in phase-space. In this work, we investigate the heat flow of two interacting quantum systems in the perspective of noncommutativity phase-space effects and show that by controlling the new constants introduced in the quantum theory, the heat flow from the hot to the cold system may be enhanced, thus decreasing the time required to reach thermal equilibrium. We also give a brief discussion on the robustness of the second law of thermodynamics in the context of noncommutative quantum mechanics.},

Any O -operator induces a hom-pre-Lie algebra structure. We express the cochain complex of an O -operator in terms of the specific hom-Lie algebra cochain complex. If the structure maps in a hom-Lie algebra and its representation are invertible, then we can extend the above cochain complex to a deformation complex for O -operators by adding the space of zero cochains. Subsequently, we study formal deformations of O -operators on regular hom-Lie algebras in terms of the deformation cohomology. In the end, we deduce deformations of s -Rota–Baxter operators (of weight 0) and skew-symmetric r -matrices on hom-Lie algebras as particular cases of O -operators on hom-Lie algebras.},

The aim of this paper is to make a rigorous connection between the Levy–Lieb functional theory and the local density approximation. Our justification is valid for fermionic systems with a general class of smooth short range interaction potentials, in the regime of slowly varying densities.

  abstract     = {Unitary matrices arise in many ways in physics, in particular as a time evolution operator. For a periodically driven system, one frequently wishes to compute a Floquet Hamiltonian that should be a Hermitian operator H such that e − iTH = U ( T ), where U ( T ) is the time evolution operator at time corresponding to the period of the system. That is, we want H to be equal to − i times a matrix logarithm of U ( T ). If the system has a symmetry, such as time reversal symmetry, one can expect H to have a symmetry beyond being Hermitian. We discuss here practical numerical algorithms on computing matrix logarithms that have certain symmetries, which can be used to compute Floquet Hamiltonians that have appropriate symmetries. Along the way, we prove some results on how a symmetry in the Floquet operator U ( T ) can lead to a symmetry in a basis of Floquet eigenstates.},

In this formulation, chains in algebraic topology are used, and master equations are described on graphs that consist of vertices representing states and of directed edges representing transition matrices. It is then shown that master equations under the detailed balance conditions are equivalent to discrete diffusion equations, where the Laplacians are defined as self-adjoint operators with respect to introduced inner products. An isospectral property of these Laplacians is shown for non-zero eigenvalues, and its applications are given. The convergence to the equilibrium state is shown by analyzing this class of diffusion equations. In addition, a systematic way to derive closed dynamical systems for expectation values is given. For the case that the detailed balance conditions are not imposed, master equations are expressed as a form of a continuity equation.},

We give a general description of how to extend on-shell redundant symmetries in topological gauge theories to off-shell correspondences between symmetries in terms of quasi-isomorphisms of L ∞ -algebras. We use this to extend the on-shell equivalence between gravity and Chern–Simons theory in three dimensions to an explicit L ∞ -quasi-isomorphism between differential graded Lie algebras, which applies off-shell and for degenerate dynamical metrics. In contrast, we show that there is no morphism between the L ∞ -algebra underlying gravity and the differential graded Lie algebra governing BF theory in four dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Quantum permutation matrices and quantum magic squares are generalizations of permutation matrices and magic squares, where the entries are no longer numbers but elements from arbitrary (non-commutative) algebras. The famous Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem characterizes magic squares as convex combinations of permutation matrices. In the non-commutative case, the corresponding question is as follows: Does every quantum magic square belong to the matrix convex hull of quantum permutation matrices? That is, does every quantum magic square dilate to a quantum permutation matrix? Here, we show that this is false even in the simplest non-commutative case. We also classify the quantum magic squares that dilate to a quantum permutation matrix with commuting entries and prove a quantitative lower bound on the diameter of this set. Finally, we conclude that not all Arveson extreme points of the free spectrahedron of quantum magic squares are quantum permutation matrices.},

The diffeomorphism defines a second Lorentzian metric h , the pullback of g . Motivated by elasticity theory, we introduce a Lagrangian expressed algebraically (without differentiations) via our pair of metrics. Analysis of the resulting nonlinear field equations produces three main results. First, we show that for Ricci-flat manifolds, our linearized field equations are Maxwell’s equations in the Lorenz gauge with exact current. Second, for Minkowski space, we construct explicit massless solutions of our nonlinear field equations; these come in two distinct types, right-handed and left-handed. Third, for Minkowski space, we construct explicit massive solutions of our nonlinear field equations; these contain a positive parameter that has the geometric meaning of quantum mechanical mass and a real parameter that may be interpreted as electric charge. In constructing explicit solutions of nonlinear field equations, we resort to group-theoretic ideas: we identify special four-dimensional subgroups of the Poincaré group and seek diffeomorphisms compatible with their action in a suitable sense.},

In the center of this work stands a rigorous proof on how one can choose the initial data to cancel out all secular terms in the resonant system. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that the only possible choice for the existence of time periodic solutions bifurcating from the first mode is when the error terms in the expansion are all proportional to this dominant one mode. Finally, we use techniques from ordinary differential equations and establish the existence of time periodic solutions for the initial data proportional to the first mode of the linearized operator.},

To prove this result, we first construct a sequence of approximate solutions to the NSK equations and then show that the sequence converges, as both viscosity and capillarity tend simultaneously to zero, to this rarefaction wave. The uniform convergence rates are also obtained. The key ingredients of our proof are the re-scaling technique and energy estimates.},

They are constructed from a fiducial state by minimizing the Hamiltonian’s expectation value after averaging with a temporal window function. We show the SLE to be expressible solely in terms of the (state independent) commutator function. They also admit a convergent series expansion in powers of the spatial momentum, both for massive and for massless theories. In the massless case, the leading infrared behavior is found to be Minkowski-like for all scale factors. This provides a new cure for the infrared divergences in Friedmann–Lemaître spacetimes with accelerated expansion. As a consequence, massless SLEs are viable candidates for pre-inflationary vacua, and in a soluble model, they are shown to entail a qualitatively correct primordial power spectrum.},

There are 314 distinct bialgebras and, among them, 25 Hopf algebras, with at most one of these from one vertex to another. We find a unique smallest noncommutative and noncocommutative one, which is moreover self-dual and resembles a digital version of u q ( sl 2 ). We also find a unique self-dual Hopf algebra in one anyonic variable x 4 = 0. For all our Hopf algebras, we determine the integral and associated Fourier transform operator, viewed as a representation of the quiver. We also find all quasitriangular or “universal R-matrix” structures on our Hopf algebras. These induce solutions of the Yang–Baxter or braid relations in any representation.},

The coupled master T -operator of the quantum Gaudin model satisfies the bilinear identity of the universal character hierarchy, which is an extension of the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili hierarchy. In addition, for the generalized quantum integrable spin chains with rational GL ( N )-invariant R -matrices, we construct its coupled master T -operator, which represents a generating function for two-folds commuting quantum transfer matrices.

@article{ ,
  abstract     = {An old problem in mathematical physics deals with the structure of the dispersion relation of the Schrödinger operator −Δ + V ( x ) in R n with periodic potential near the edges of the spectrum, i.e., near extrema of the dispersion relation. A well-known and widely believed conjecture says that generically (with respect to perturbations of the periodic potential), the extrema are attained by a single branch of the dispersion relation, are isolated, and have nondegenerate Hessian (i.e., dispersion relations are graphs of Morse functions). The important notion of effective masses in solid state physics, as well as the Liouville property, Green’s function asymptotics, and so on hinges upon this property. The progress in proving this conjecture has been slow. It is natural to try to look at discrete problems, where the dispersion relation is (in appropriate coordinates) an algebraic, rather than analytic, variety. Moreover, such models are often used for computation in solid state physics (the tight binding model). Alas, counterexamples exist even for Schrödinger operators on simple 2D-periodic two-atomic structures, showing that the genericity fails in some discrete situations. We start with establishing in a very general situation the following natural dichotomy: the non-degeneracy of extrema either fails or holds in the complement of a proper algebraic subset of the parameters. Thus, a random choice of a point in the parameter space gives the correct answer “with probability one.” Noticing that the known counterexample has only two free parameters, one can suspect that this might be too tight for the genericity to hold. We thus consider the maximal Z 2 -periodic two-atomic nearest-cell interaction graph, which has nine edges per unit cell and the discrete “Laplace–Beltrami” operator on it, which has nine free parameters. We then use methods from computational and combinatorial algebraic geometry to prove the genericity conjecture for this graph. Since the proof is non-trivial and would be much harder for more general structures, we show three different approaches to the genericity, which might be suitable in various situations. It is also proven in this case that adding more parameters indeed cannot destroy the genericity result. This allows us to list all “bad” periodic subgraphs of the one we consider and discover that in all these cases the genericity fails for “trivial” reasons only.},

The statistical distribution is then constructed in the recovered four dimensional canonical phase space. Projecting in the original reference frame, we show that the statistical distribution departs from standard Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. The deviation is a function of the knottedness of the phase space, which is measured by the helicity density of the topological constraint.

We study the eigenvalues of a generalized number operator ( ⁠ N = β α ⁠ ) and construct the Hilbert space, classified by values of a complex coordinate ( λ 0 ): the eigenvalues lie on a circle. For θ being an irrational multiple of 2 π , we get an infinite-dimensional representation; however, for a rational multiple ( ⁠ M N ⁠ ) of 2 π , it is finite-dimensional, parameterized by the complex coordinate λ 0 . The case for N = 2, θ = π is the usual Clifford algebra for fermions, while the case for N = ∞ , θ = 0 is the Heisenberg algebra of bosons, albeit with two copies for positive and negative eigenvalues. We find a smooth transition from the fermion to the boson situation as N → ∞ from N = 2. After constructing the Hilbert space from the algebra, the cases for N = 2, 3 can be mapped to the “fuzzy sphere” of SU (2), while for general N , the “fuzzy pancake” is found to be the correct representation. Then, we motivate the study of coherent states, which are the eigenstates of α (the lowering operator), labeled by complex numbers for non-zero λ 0 . We specialize the study of coherent states to the very interesting case of λ 0 = 0 and construct a calculus of the generalized Grassmann variables that result, applying it to compute a partition function for these particles. We then make some remarks about extending this study to that of anyons.},

  abstract     = {We identify many new solvable subcases of the general dynamical system characterized by two autonomous first-order ordinary differential equations with purely quadratic right-hand sides and the solvable character of these dynamical systems amounting to the possibility to obtain the solution of their initial value problem via algebraic operations. Equivalently, by considering the analytic continuation of these systems to complex time, their algebraically solvable character corresponds to the fact that their general solution either is single-valued or features only a finite number of algebraic branch points as functions of complex time (the independent variable). Thus, our results provide a major enlargement of the class of solvable systems beyond those with a single-valued general solution identified by Garnier about 60 years ago. An interesting property of several of these new dynamical systems is the elementary character of their general solution, identifiable as the roots of a polynomial with explicitly obtainable time-dependent coefficients. We also mention that, using a time-dependent change of (dependent and independent) variables involving the imaginary parameter i ω , isochronous variants of each of the algebraically solvable models we identify, can be explicitly exhibited: by this we mean that these variants all feature the remarkable property that their generic solution is periodic with a period that is a fixed integer multiple of the basic period T = 2 π / ω .},

Functions between quantum sets are certain binary relations that can be characterized in terms of this dagger compact structure, and the resulting category of quantum sets and functions generalizes the category of ordinary sets and functions in the manner of noncommutative mathematics. In particular, this category is dual to a subcategory of von Neumann algebras. The basic properties of quantum sets are presented thoroughly, with the noncommutative dictionary in mind, and with an eye to convenient application. As a motivating example, a notion of quantum graph coloring is derived within this framework, and it is shown to be equivalent to the notion that appears in the quantum information theory literature.},

We collectively refer to the elements of this class of processes as random n -bridges (RnBs), where n refers to the cardinality of the set of conditioning laws, which can be chosen arbitrarily. We prove that if the underlying càdlàg process is Markov, then its RnB is Markov for n = 1 and has a particular Markov-like property for n &gt; 1. As a canonical subclass, we construct Brownian RnBs (BRnBs) and provide their anticipative representation as well as their non-anticipative semimartingale representation. This motivates the second part of this paper, wherein we apply BRnBs to describe an energy-based state reduction in a composite quantum system involving a set of commuting observables measured successively at different times. The highly tractable so-called energy-based quantum state reduction models are significant in their role as the most important alternative to the popular CLS model. We ask the random variables composing the anticipative form of a BRnB to take the eigenvalues of a set of compatible Hamiltonians and provide a new stochastic Schrödinger evolution on a complex Hilbert space that models sequential reduction dynamics of the eigenstates through a single wave function. By doing so, we also extend the Brody–Hughston finite-time collapse model to a many-body setup with sequential measurements.},

  abstract     = {We present a universal, in Vogel’s sense, expression for the quantum dimension of the Cartan product of arbitrary powers of the adjoint and X 2 representations of simple Lie algebras. The same formula mysteriously yields quantum dimensions of some other representations of the same Lie algebra for permuted universal parameters, provided linear resolvability of singularities is applied. We list these representations for the exceptional algebras and their stable versions for the classical algebras (when the rank of the classical algebra is sufficiently large with regard to the powers of representations). Universal formulas may have singularities at the points in Vogel’s plane, corresponding to some simple Lie algebras. We prove that our formula is linearly resolvable at all those singular points, i.e., yields finite answers when restricted either on the classical or the exceptional lines, and make a conjecture that these answers coincide with (quantum) dimensions of some irreducible representations. In a number of cases, particularly, in the case of so (8) algebra, which belongs both to the orthogonal and the exceptional lines, it is confirmed that both resolutions yield relevant answers. We note that an irreducible representation may have several universal formulas for its (quantum) dimension and discuss the impact of this phenomenon to the method presented by Cohen and de Man [C. R.Acad. Sci., Ser. 1 322 (5), 427–432 (1996)] for derivation of universal formulas.},

We consider the process where the position and the height of the wall change as follows: First, the potential increases from zero to a very large value, and so a narrow potential wall is formed and almost splits the interval into two parts; then, the wall moves to a different position, after which the height of the wall decreases to zero again. We show that even though the rate of variation of the potential’s parameters can be arbitrarily slow, this process alternates adiabatic and non-adiabatic dynamics, leading to a non-trivial permutation of the instantaneous energy eigenstates. Furthermore, we consider potentials with several narrow walls and show how an arbitrarily slow motion of the walls can lead the system from any given state to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of any other state, thus proving the approximate controllability of the above Schrödinger equation by means of a soft, quasi-adiabatic variation of the potential.},

  abstract     = {A common approach to the theory of nonlocal Poisson brackets, seen from the operatorial point of view, has been to keep implicit the sets on which these brackets act. In this paper, we aim to explicitly define appropriate functional spaces underlying the theory of 1 co-dimensional weakly nonlocal Poisson brackets, motivating the definitions, and to prove the validity in this context of some classical results in the field. We start by introducing the spaces for the local case, which will serve as building tools for those in the nonlocal one. The precise definition and the study of these nonlocal functionals are the core of this work; in particular, we work out a characterization of the variational derivative of such objects. We then translate everything to the level of manifolds, defining a global version of the functionals, and introduce the notion nonlocal Poisson brackets in this context. We conclude by applying all the machinery to prove a theorem due to Ferapontov. This last application is the natural conclusion of our discussion and shows that the spaces we introduce are suitable objects to work with when studying topics in this theory.},

In this scheme, the C *-algebraic approach is employed to the phase transition problem. Note that these kinds of models do not have one-dimensional analogs, i.e., the considered model persists only on trees. It turns out that if the Ising part interactions vanish, then the model with only competing XY -interactions on the Cayley tree of order two does not have a phase transition. By phase transition, we mean the existence of two distinct QMCs that are not quasi-equivalent and their supports do not overlap. Moreover, it is also shown that the QMC associated with the model has a clustering property, which implies that the von Neumann algebras corresponding to the states are factors.},

In fact, such a system of rings around a protostar has been observed recently in the constellation Taurus. In this paper, we use the time dependent Euler–Poisson equations to find out under what conditions such a pattern formation can take place. To this end, we consider these equations assuming that the gas is composed of incompressible stratified fluid. Under these assumptions, the original six governing equations are then reduced to three. These equations are then solved analytically (approximately), and these solutions are used to determine the evolution of the mass density distribution within the interstellar gas cloud. We show that under proper conditions, mass density waves can emerge within the cloud.},

If n is even and the dimension is n − 3, then all masses with an odd label are equal and all masses with an even label are equal. Additionally, we prove that the same results hold true for any solution of an n + 1-body problem for which n of the point masses behave like an equally spaced choreography and the n + 1th point mass is fixed at the origin. Furthermore, we deduce that if the curve along which the point masses of a choreography move has an axis of symmetry, the masses have to be equal if n = 3 and that if n = 4, if three of the point masses behave as stated and the fourth mass is fixed at a point, the masses of the first three point masses are all equal. Finally, we prove for the n -body problem in spaces of negative constant Gaussian curvature that if n &lt; 6, n ≠ 4, equally spaced choreographic solutions should have equal masses, and for n = 4, the even labeled masses are equal and the odd labeled masses are equal and that the same holds true for the n -body problem in spaces of positive constant Gaussian curvature, as long as the point masses do not move along a great circle. Additionally, we show that these last two results are also true for any solution to the n + 1-body problem in spaces of negative constant Gaussian curvature and the n + 1-body problem in spaces of positive constant Gaussian curvature, respectively, for the case that n of the point masses behave like an equally spaced choreography and the n + 1 is fixed at a point.},

All the maps originate from Desargues lattices, which provide geometric realization of solutions to the non-Abelian Hirota–Miwa system. The first map is derived using the original Hirota’s gauge for the corresponding linear problem, and the second one is derived from its affine (non-homogeneous) description. We also provide an interpretation of the maps within the local Yang–Baxter equation approach. We exploit the decomposition of the second map into two simpler maps, which, as we show, satisfy the pentagonal condition. We also provide geometric meaning of the matching ten-term condition between the pentagonal maps. The generic description of Desargues lattices in homogeneous coordinates allows us to define another solution of the Zamolodchikov equation, but with a functional parameter that should be adjusted in a particular way. Its ultra-local reduction produces a birational quantum map (with two central parameters) with the Zamolodchikov property, which preserves Weyl commutation relations. In the classical limit, our construction gives the corresponding Poisson map, satisfying the Zamolodchikov condition.},

In this paper, we show that the evolution equations for open thermodynamic systems, i.e., systems exchanging heat and matter with the exterior, admit an intrinsic formulation in terms of Dirac structures. We focus on simple systems in which the thermodynamic state is described by a single entropy variable. A main difficulty compared to the case of closed systems lies in the explicit time dependence of the constraint associated with entropy production. We overcome this issue by working with the geometric setting of time-dependent nonholonomic mechanics. We define two types of Dirac dynamical systems for the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of open systems, based either on the generalized energy or the Lagrangian.

  abstract     = {This paper studies how the static non-linear electromagnetic-vacuum spacetime of a point nucleus with a negative bare mass affects the self-adjointness of the general-relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian for a test electron, without and with an anomalous magnetic moment. This study interpolates between the previously studied extreme cases of a test electron in (a) the Reissner–Weyl–Nordström spacetime (Maxwell’s electromagnetic vacuum), which sports a very strong curvature singularity with negative infinite bare mass, and (b) the Hoffmann spacetime (Born or Born–Infeld’s electromagnetic vacuum) with vanishing bare mass, which features the mildest possible curvature singularity. The main conclusion reached is: on electrostatic spacetimes of a point nucleus with a strictly negative bare mass (which may be − ∞ ), essential self-adjointness fails unless the radial electric field diverges sufficiently fast at the nucleus and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron is taken into account. Thus, on the Hoffmann spacetime with a (strictly) negative bare mass, the Dirac Hamiltonian of a test electron, with or without anomalous magnetic moment, is not essentially self-adjoint. All these operators have self-adjoint extensions, though, with the usual essential spectrum (− ∞ , − m e c 2 ] ∪ [ m e c 2 , ∞ ) and an infinite discrete spectrum located in the gap (− m e c 2 , m e c 2 ).},

  abstract     = {We study the 2D vertex operator algebra (VOA) construction in 4D N = 2 superconformal field theories on S 3 × S 1 , focusing on both old puzzles and new observations. The VOA lives on a two-torus T 2 ⊂ S 3 × S 1 ⁠ , it is 1 2 Z -graded, and this torus is equipped with the natural choice of spin structure (1,0) for the Z + 1 2 -graded operators, corresponding to the NS sector vacuum character. By analyzing the possible refinements of the Schur index that preserves the VOA, we find that it admits discrete deformations, which allows access to the remaining spin structures (1,1), (0,1), and (0,0), of which the latter two involve the inclusion of a particular surface defect. For Lagrangian theories, we perform the detailed analysis: we describe the natural supersymmetric background, perform localization, and derive the gauged symplectic boson action on a torus in any spin structure. In the absence of flavor fugacities, the 2D and 4D path integrals precisely match, including the Casimir factors. We further analyze the 2D theory: we identify its integration cycle and the two-point functions and interpret flavor holonomies as screening charges in the VOA. Next, we make some observations about modularity; the T -transformation acts on our four partition functions and lifts to a large diffeomorphism on S 3 × S 1 . More interestingly, we generalize the four partition functions on the torus to an infinite family labeled by both the spin structure and the integration cycle inside the complexified maximal torus of the gauge group. Members of this family transform into one another under the full modular group, and we confirm the recent observation that the S -transform of the Schur index in Lagrangian theories exhibits logarithmic behavior. Finally, we comment on how locally our background reproduces the Ω-background.},

The nonlinear terms are superlinear at infinity and at the origin. By using a change of variable, we turn the quasilinear system into a nonlinear system where we can establish a variational approach with a fine analysis on the Nehari method. For the nonexistence result, we compare the potentials with periodic potentials proving the nonexistence of ground state solutions.},

This distribution-valued random field is extended to a QS with N + 1 marked boundary points (MBPs) with N ∈ Z ≥ 0 ⁠ . We propose the conformal welding problem for it in the case of N ∈ Z ≥ 1 ⁠ . If N = 1, it is reduced to the problem introduced by Sheffield, who solved it by coupling the QS with the Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE). When N ≥ 3, there naturally appears room for making the configuration of MBPs random, and hence, a new problem arises how to determine the probability law of the configuration. We report that the multiple SLE in H driven by the Dyson model on R helps us to fix the problems and makes them solvable for any N ≥ 3. We also propose the flow line problem for an imaginary surface with boundary condition changing points (BCCPs). In the case when the number of BCCPs is two, this problem was solved by Miller and Sheffield. We address the general case with an arbitrary number of BCCPs in a similar manner to the conformal welding problem. We again find that the multiple SLE driven by the Dyson model plays a key role to solve the flow line problem.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we derive a mathematical model for an open system that exchanges particles and momentum with a reservoir from their joint Hamiltonian dynamics. The complexity of this many-particle problem is addressed by introducing a countable set of n -particle phase space distribution functions just for the open subsystem, while accounting for the reservoir only in terms of statistical expectations. From the Liouville equation for the full system, we derive a set of coupled Liouville-type equations for the n -particle distributions by marginalization with respect to reservoir states. The resulting equation hierarchy describes the external momentum forcing of the open system by the reservoir across its boundaries, and it covers the effects of particle exchanges, which induce probability transfers between the n - and ( n + 1)-particle distributions. Similarities and differences with the Bergmann–Lebowitz model of open systems [P. G. Bergmann and J. L. Lebowitz, Phys.

However, linearization around a singular equilibrium point (which commonly exists in noncanonical Hamiltonian systems) works out differently, resulting in breaking of the Hamiltonian symmetry of spectra; time-reversal asymmetry causes chirality . This interesting phenomenon was first found in analyzing the chiral motion of the rattleback, a boat-shaped top having misaligned axes of inertia and geometry [Z. Yoshida et al. , Phys. Lett. A 381 , 2772–2777 (2017)]. To elucidate how chiral spectra are generated, we study the three-dimensional Lie–Poisson systems and classify the prototypes of singularities that cause symmetry breaking. The central idea is the deformation of the underlying Lie algebra; invoking Bianchi’s list of all three-dimensional Lie algebras, we show that the so-called class-B algebras, which are produced by asymmetric deformations of the simple algebra s o ( 3 ) ⁠ , yield chiral spectra when linearized around their singularities. The theory of deformation is generalized to higher dimensions, including the infinite-dimensional Poisson manifolds relevant to fluid mechanics.},

In this paper (Paper I), we propose a generalization of the embedding of torsionfree Galilean and Carrollian manifolds inside larger classes of gravitational waves. On the Galilean side, the quotient procedure of Duval et al. is extended to gravitational waves endowed with a lightlike hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vector field. This extension is shown to provide the natural geometric framework underlying the generalization by Lichnerowicz of the Eisenhart lift. On the Carrollian side, a new class of gravitational waves – dubbed Dodgson waves – is introduced and geometrically characterized. Dodgson waves are shown to admit a lightlike foliation by Carrollian manifolds and furthermore to be the largest subclass of gravitational waves satisfying this property. This extended class allows us to generalize the embedding procedure to a larger class of Carrollian manifolds that we explicitly identify. As an application of the general formalism, (Anti) de Sitter spacetime is shown to admit a lightlike foliation by codimension one (A)dS Carroll manifolds.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a detailed correspondence was established between, on one side, four- and five-dimensional large- N supersymmetric gauge theories with N = 2 supersymmetry and adjoint matter and, on the other side, integrable 1 + 1-dimensional quantum hydrodynamics. Under this correspondence, the phenomenon of dimensional transmutation, familiar in asymptotically free quantum field theories, gets mapped to the transition from the elliptic Calogero–Moser many-body system to the closed Toda chain. In this paper, we attempt to formulate the hydrodynamical counterpart of the dimensional transmutation phenomenon inspired by the identification of the periodic intermediate long wave equation as the hydrodynamical limit of the elliptic Calogero–Moser/Ruijsenaars–Schneider system. We also conjecture that the chiral flow in the vortex fluid provides the proper framework for the microscopic description of such dimensional transmutation in 1 + 1D hydrodynamics. We provide a geometric description of this phenomenon in terms of the Atiyah Drinfeld Hitchin Manin moduli space.},

  abstract     = {Causal fermion systems incorporate local gauge symmetry in the sense that the Lagrangian and all inherent structures are invariant under local phase transformations of the physical wave functions. In the present paper, it is explained and worked out in detail that, despite this local gauge freedom, the structures of a causal fermion system give rise to distinguished gauges where the local gauge freedom is fixed completely up to global gauge transformations. The main method is to use spectral and polar decompositions of operators on Hilbert spaces and on indefinite inner product spaces. We also introduce and make use of a Riemannian metric, which is induced on the manifold of all regular correlation operators by the Hilbert–Schmidt scalar product. Gaussian coordinate systems corresponding to this Riemannian metric are constructed. Moreover, we work with so-called wave charts where the physical wave functions are used as coordinates. Our constructions and results are illustrated in the example of Dirac sea configurations in finite and infinite spatial volume.},

A quantitative description of the above characterization of the strong convergence in terms of appropriate metrics on the sets of quantum channels and Stinespring isometries is given. As a result, the uniform selective continuity of the complementary operation with respect to the strong convergence is established. The discontinuity of the unitary dilation is shown by constructing a strongly converging sequence of quantum channels that cannot be represented as a reduction of a strongly converging sequence of unitary channels. The Stinespring representation of strongly converging sequences of quantum channels allows us to prove the lower semicontinuity of the entropic disturbance as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble). Some corollaries of this property are considered.},

  abstract     = {In quantum theory, it is known for a pair of noncommutative observables that there is no state on which they take simultaneously definite values and that there is no joint measurement of them. They are called preparation uncertainty and measurement uncertainty, respectively, and research has unveiled that they are not independent from but related with each other in a quantitative way. This study aims to reveal whether similar relations to quantum ones hold also in generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). In particular, a certain class of GPTs is considered, which can be characterized by transitivity and self-duality and regarded as extensions of quantum theory. It is proved that there are close connections expressed quantitatively between two types of uncertainty on a pair observables also in those theories: if preparation uncertainty exists, then measurement uncertainty also exists, and they are described by similar inequalities. Our results manifest that their correspondences are not specific to quantum theory but more universal ones.},

  abstract     = {A quantum walk describes the discrete unitary evolution of a quantum particle on a discrete graph. Some quantum walks, referred to as the Weyl and Dirac walks, provide a description of the free evolution of relativistic quantum fields in the small wave-vector regime. The clash between the intrinsic discreteness of quantum walks and the continuous symmetries of special relativity is resolved by giving a definition of change of inertial frame in terms of a change of values of the constants of motion, which leaves the walk operator unchanged. Starting from the family of 1 + 1 dimensional Dirac walks with all possible values of the mass parameter, we introduce a unique walk encompassing the latter as an extra degree of freedom, and we derive its group of changes of inertial frames. This symmetry group contains a non-linear realization of S O + ( 2 , 1 ) ⋉ R 3 ⁠ ; since one of the two space-like dimensions does not correspond to an actual spatial degree of freedom but rather the mass, we interpret it as a 2 + 1 dimensional de Sitter group. This group also contains a non-linear realization of the proper orthochronous Poincaré group S O + ( 1 , 1 ) ⋉ R 2 in 1 + 1 dimension, as the ones considered within the framework of doubly special relativity, which recovers the usual relativistic symmetry in the limit of small wave-vectors and masses. Surprisingly, for the Dirac walk with a fixed value of the mass parameter, the group of allowed changes of reference frame does not have a consistent interpretation in the limit of small wave-vectors.},

In particular, when the cover task is classical communication, we show that the cypher task can be classical communication or entanglement sharing; when the cover task is entanglement sharing and the main channel is noiseless, we show that the cypher task can be randomness sharing; when the cover task is quantum communication and the main channel is noiseless, we show that the cypher task can be classical communication. In the latter case, our results improve earlier ones by relaxing the need for a shared key between the transmitter and the receiver and hold under milder assumptions on the cover quantum communication code.},

Choosing P 2 , X 2 , and the dilation operator as a basis for the Lie algebra, we obtain that, out of the six possible orderings for the Wei–Norman factorization of the evolution operator for the GCK Hamiltonian, three of them can be expressed in terms of its classical solutions and the other three involve the classical solutions associated with a mirror Hamiltonian obtained by inverting the mass. In addition, we generalize the Wei–Norman procedure to compute the factorization of other operators, such as a generalized Fresnel transform and the Arnold transform (and its generalizations), obtaining also in these cases a semiclassical interpretation for the functions in the exponents of the Wei–Norman factorization. The singularities of the functions appearing in the Wei–Norman factorization are related to the caustic points of Morse theory, and the expression of the evolution operator at the caustics is obtained using a limiting procedure, where the Fourier transform of the initial state appears along with the Guoy phase.},

They have finite limits that are the Landau levels. These limits play the role of thresholds in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. We provide an asymptotic expansion of the band functions at infinity. Each Landau level concerns an infinity of band functions, and each energy level is intersected by an infinity of band functions. We show that among the band functions that intersect a fixed energy level, the derivative can be arbitrary small. We apply this result to prove that even if they are localized in energy away from the thresholds, quantum states possess a bulk component. A similar result is also true in classical mechanics.},

This fact was recently used to discover an unexpected relation between classical and quantum motions that goes beyond the results provided by the Ehrenfest theorem. The Newtonian dynamics was shown to be the Schrödinger dynamics of states constrained to a submanifold of the space of states, identified with the classical phase space of the system. Quantum observables are identified with vector fields on the space of states. The commutators of observables are expressed through the curvature of the space. The resulting embedding of the Newtonian and Schrödinger dynamics into a unified geometric framework is rigid in the sense that the Schrödinger dynamics is a unique extension of the Newtonian one. Under the embedding, the normal distribution of measurement results associated with a classical measurement implies the Born rule for the probability of transition of quantum states. The mathematics of the discovered relationship between the classical and the quantum is reviewed and investigated here in detail and applied to the process of measurement of spin and position observables.},

  abstract     = {A general theorem due to Howe of dual action of a classical group and a certain non-associative algebra on a space of symmetric or alternating tensors is reformulated in a setting of second quantization, and familiar examples in atomic and nuclear physics are discussed. The special case of orthogonal–orthogonal duality is treated in detail. It is shown that, like it was done by Helmers more than half a century ago in the analogous case of symplectic–symplectic duality, one can base a proof of the orthogonal–orthogonal duality theorem and a precise characterization of the relation between the equivalence classes of the dually related irreducible representations on a calculation of characters by combining it, in this case, with an analysis of the representation of a reflection. Young diagrams for the description of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of orthogonal Lie algebras are introduced. The properties of a reflection of the number non-conserving part in the dual relationship between orthogonal Lie algebras corroborate a picture of an almost perfect symmetry between the partners.},

Replacing in this formula the forcing by the nonlinearity and using data in Sobolev spaces suggested by the space–time regularity of the Cauchy problem of the linear KdVm equation give an iteration map for the ibvp, which is shown to be a contraction in an appropriately chosen solution space. The proof relies on key linear estimates and a bilinear estimate similar to the one used for the KdV equation on the line by Kenig, Ponce, and Vega [J. Am. Math. Soc. 4 , 323–347 (1991)].},

  abstract     = {We study the long-time asymptotics of prototypical non-linear diffusion equations. Specifically, we consider the case of a non-degenerate diffusivity function that is a (non-negative) polynomial of the dependent variable of the problem. We motivate these types of equations using Einstein’s random walk paradigm, leading to a partial differential equation in non-divergence form. On the other hand, using conservation principles leads to a partial differential equation in divergence form. A transformation is derived to handle both cases. Then, a maximum principle (on both an unbounded and a bounded domain) is proved in order to obtain bounds above and below for the time-evolution of the solutions to the non-linear diffusion problem. Specifically, these bounds are based on the fundamental solution of the linear problem (the so-called Aronson’s Green function). Having thus sandwiched the long-time asymptotics of solutions to the non-linear problems between two fundamental solutions of the linear problem, we prove that, unlike the case of degenerate diffusion, a non-degenerate diffusion equation’s solution converges onto the linear diffusion solution at long times. Select numerical examples support the mathematical theorems and illustrate the convergence process. Our results have implications on how to interpret asymptotic scalings of potentially anomalous diffusion processes (such as in the flow of particulate materials) that have been discussed in the applied physics literature.},

Second, we give two new blow-up criteria that one of them is obtained to remove the exponent restriction by using an extended form of the concavity method and the other one is a blow-up result of weak solutions with arbitrarily high initial energy.

The crucial point is to prove the existence of an upper bound η ( h ) on the maximum power D 1+ η ( h ) of D that can appear for the contribution at a given order N 2−2 h in the large N expansion. We conjecture that η ( h ) = h in a large class of models. In the case of traceless Hermitian matrices with the quartic tetrahedral interaction, we are able to prove that η ( h ) ≤ 2 h ; the sharper bound η ( h ) = h is proven for a complex bipartite version of the model, with no need to impose a tracelessness condition. We also prove that η ( h ) = h for the Hermitian model with the sextic wheel interaction, again with no need to impose a tracelessness condition.},

  abstract     = {An autonomous holonomic dynamical system is described by a system of second order differential equations whose solution gives the trajectories of the system. The solution is facilitated by the use of first integrals (FIs) that are used to reduce the order of the system of differential equations and, if there are enough of them, to determine the solution. Therefore, in the study of dynamical systems, it is important that there exists a systematic method to determine the FIs of second order differential equations. On the other hand, a system of second order differential equations defines (as a rule) a kinetic energy (or Lagrangian), which provides a symmetric second order tensor that we call the kinetic metric. This metric via its symmetries (or collineations) brings into the scene the differential geometry that provides numerous results and methods concerning the determination of these symmetries. It is apparent that if one manages to provide a systematic way that will relate the determination of the FIs of a given dynamical system to the symmetries of the kinetic metric defined by this very system, then one will have at his/her disposal the powerful methods of differential geometry in the determination of the FIs and, consequently, the solution of the dynamical equations. This was also a partial aspect of Lie’s work on the symmetries of differential equations. The subject of this work is to provide a theorem that realizes this scenario. The method we follow has been considered previously in the literature and consists of the following steps: Consider the generic quadratic FI of the form I = K a b ( t , q c ) q ̇ a q ̇ b + K a ( t , q c ) q ̇ a + K ( t , q c ) ⁠ , where K ab ( t , q c ), K a ( t , q c ), and K ( t , q c ) are unknown tensor quantities and require dI / dt = 0. This condition leads to a system of differential equations involving the coefficients K ab ( t , q c ), K a ( t , q c ), and K ( t , q c ) whose solution provides all possible quadratic FIs of this form. We demonstrate the application of the theorem in the classical cases of the geodesic equations and the generalized Kepler potential in which we obtain all the known results in a systematic way. We also obtain and discuss the time-dependent FIs that are as important as the autonomous FIs determined by other methods.},

A choice of coordinate system, frame basis, and spin-connection must be made to obtain a solution from the field equations of a given teleparallel gravity theory. It is worthwhile to express solutions in an invariant manner in terms of torsion invariants to distinguish between different solutions. In this paper, we discuss the symmetries of teleparallel gravity theories, describe the classification of the torsion tensor and its covariant derivative, and define scalar invariants in terms of the torsion. In particular, we propose a modification of the Cartan–Karlhede algorithm for geometries with torsion (and no curvature or nonmetricity). The algorithm determines the dimension of the symmetry group for a solution and suggests an alternative frame-based approach to calculating symmetries. We prove that the only maximally symmetric solution to any theory of gravitation admitting a non-zero torsion tensor is Minkowski space. As an illustration, we apply the algorithm to six particular exact teleparallel geometries. From these examples, we notice that the symmetry group of the solutions of a teleparallel gravity theory is potentially smaller than their metric-based analogs in general relativity.},

It follows that the whole formalism is, by construction, manifestly conformally invariant. We first show that a choice of asymptotic shear amounts to a choice of linear differential operator of order 2 on the bundle of scales of null-infinity. We refer to these operators as Poincaré operators. We then show that Poincaré operators are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular class of tractor connections, which we call “null-normal” (they generalize the normal tractor connection of conformal geometry). The tractor curvature encodes the presence of gravitational waves, and the non-uniqueness of flat null-normal tractor connections corresponds to the “degeneracy of gravity vacua” that has been extensively discussed in the literature. This work thus brings back the investigation of the radiative phase space of gravity to the study of (Cartan) connections and associated bundles. This should allow us, in particular, to proliferate invariants of the phase space.},

Instead of studying the Schwinger functions arising from the Euclidean approach, we study the Wightman distributions directly. We use the non-rigorous Feynman integral for a given quantum field theory as a guide for the rigorous definition of the characteristic functional corresponding to the Lagrangian, but this approach limits us to time-ordered Wightman distributions. We use the idea that if a classical action is perturbed by an interaction involving only N excitations, then one should be able to express the resulting characteristic functional rigorously in terms of the previous characteristic functional. Implementation requires the modification of the classical action with imaginary terms involving the excitation amplitudes. If the previous characteristic functional has a measure-theoretic representation of some kind, then one can subsequently remove these auxiliary terms with a limiting argument. We continue to consider the scalar Minkowskian quantum field theory with the free, massive case as our starting point. The characteristic functional can be defined in terms of the Minkowskian Feynman propagator, and previously, we constructed a probabilistic representation of the functional. In the appendix of that previous paper, we introduced the scalar quartic field interaction with only N space–time excitations. Under the condition that their Fourier transforms be all supported on one side of the mass hyperboloid, we constructed the resulting characteristic functional. In this paper, we construct the characteristic functional in the case where both regions of energy–momentum space contribute to the finite collection of excitations.},

Previous results were shown to work on certain graphs, such as linear chains, square and triangular lattices, and branched chains. We prove that similar protocols work much more generally in a large class of (semi-)bipartite graphs. In particular, under random couplings, adiabatic transfer is possible on graphs that admit a perfect matching both when the sender is removed and when the receiver is removed. Many of the favorable stability properties of STIRAP/CTAP are inherited, and our results readily apply to transfer between multiple potential senders and receivers. We numerically test transfer between the leaves of a tree and find surprisingly accurate transfer, especially when straddling is used. Our results may find applications in short-distance communication between multiple quantum computers and open up a new question in graph theory about the spectral gap around the value 0.},

  abstract     = {We develop a mathematically rigorous theory for the quantum transfer processes in degenerate donor–acceptor dimers in contact with a thermal environment. We explicitly calculate the transfer rates and the acceptor population efficiency. The latter depends critically on the initial donor state. We show that quantum coherence in the initial state enhances the transfer process. If the electron is initially shared coherently by the donor levels, then the efficiency can reach values close to 100\%, while an incoherent initial donor state will significantly suppress the efficiency. The results are useful for a better understanding of the quantum electron transport in many chemical, solid state, and biological systems with complex degenerate and quasi-degenerate energy landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Complex-valued functions defined on a finite interval [ a , b ] generalizing power functions of the type ( x − x 0 ) n for n ≥ 0 are studied. These functions called Φ-generalized powers, Φ being a given nonzero complex-valued function on the interval, were considered to construct a general solution representation of the Sturm–Liouville equation in terms of the spectral parameter [V. V. Kravchenko and R. M. Porter, Math. Methods Appl. Sci. 33 (4), 459–468 (2010)]. The Φ-generalized powers can be considered as natural basis functions for the one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics systems taking Φ = ψ 0 2 ⁠ , where the function ψ 0 ( x ) is the ground state wave function of one of the supersymmetric scalar Hamiltonians. Several properties are obtained such as Φ-symmetric conjugate and antisymmetry of the Φ-generalized powers, a supersymmetric binomial identity for these functions, a supersymmetric Pythagorean elliptic (hyperbolic) identity involving four Φ-trigonometric (Φ-hyperbolic) functions, as well as a supersymmetric Taylor series expressed in terms of the Φ-derivatives. We show that the first n Φ-generalized powers are a fundamental set of solutions associated with nonconstant coefficient homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations of order n + 1. Finally, we present a general solution representation of the stationary Schrödinger equation in terms of geometric series where the Volterra compositions of the first type are considered.},

Appl. Math. 78 , 193–217 (2020)] presented a proof of an Onsager type conjecture on the renormalization property and the entropy conservation laws for the relativistic Vlasov–Maxwell system. Particularly, the authors proved that if the distribution function u ∈ L ∞ ( 0 , T ; W θ , p ( R 6 ) ) and the electromagnetic field E , B ∈ L ∞ ( 0 , T ; W κ , q ( R 3 ) ) with θ , κ ∈ (0, 1) such that θκ + κ + 3 θ − 1 &gt; 0 and 1/ p + 1/ q ≤ 1, then the renormalization property and entropy conservation laws hold. To determine a complete proof of this work, in this paper, we improve their results under weaker regularity assumptions for a weak solution to the relativistic Vlasov–Maxwell equations. More precisely, we show that under similar hypotheses, the renormalization property and entropy conservation laws for the weak solution to the relativistic Vlasov–Maxwell system even hold for the endpoint case θκ + κ + 3 θ − 1 = 0. Our proof is based on better estimations on regularization operators.},

In particular, based on this equivalent minimizing problem, we can easily obtain the sharp threshold of global existence and blow-up for the time-dependent equation. Moreover, we can show that all normalized ground state standing waves are strongly unstable by blow-up. Our results are a complementary to the results of Peng and Shi [J. Math.

We first present a simpler proof of the main result in the work of Sideris [Commun. Math. Phys. 101 (4), 475–485 (1985)]: the global classical solution is non-existent for compressible Euler equations even for some small initial data. Then, we apply this approach to nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics in two space dimensions. Finally, we consider second order quasilinear hyperbolic systems with quadratic nonlinearity arising from elastodynamics of isotropic hyperelastic materials by ignoring the cubic and higher order terms. Under some restriction on the coefficients of the nonlinear terms that imply genuine nonlinearity, we show that the classical solutions to these equations can still blow up in finite time even if the initial data are small enough.},

With the supersymmetry method, we find families of non-parity-time-symmetric complex partner potentials, which share the same spectrum as base potentials with known real spectra, such as the (complex) Wadati potentials. Different from previous supersymmetry derivations of potentials with real spectra, our derivation does not utilize discrete eigenmodes of base potentials. As a result, our partner potentials feature explicit analytical expressions, which contain free functions. With the pseudo-Hermiticity method, we derive a new class of non-parity-time-symmetric complex potentials with free functions and constants, whose eigenvalues appear as conjugate pairs. This eigenvalue symmetry forces the spectrum to be all-real for a wide range of choices of these functions and constants in the potential. Tuning these free functions and constants, phase transition can also be induced, where conjugate pairs of complex eigenvalues emerge in the spectrum.},

We also use the results of the CWY theory to build quantum line operators for 2D Toda models and compute the one loop contribution of two intersecting lines exchanging one gluon. Other features such as local symmetries and comments on extension of our method to other 2D integrable models are also discussed. We also comment on some basic points that still need a refinement before discussing about a fully consistent embedding of Lax pairs into CWY theory.},

Modeling using continuous dynamics and discrete events together with their interactions much enlarged the applicability of Langevin equations in a random environment. Strong damping and fast switching are characterized by the use of multiple small parameters, resulting in singularly perturbed systems. The motivation of our work stems from the reduction of complexity for complex systems. Under suitable conditions, it is established that the solutions of the Langevin equations satisfy a large deviations principle. Then, we apply our results to statistical physics problems of a small particle in time-inhomogeneous environment and low temperature. Some connections to other fields in physics are also given.},

The sheet lies in a uniform and isotropic medium and serves as a model for some two-dimensional (2D) conducting materials such as the doped monolayer graphene. We formulate a homogeneous system of integral equations for the electric field tangential to the plane of the sheet. By the Wiener–Hopf method, we convert this system to coupled functional equations on the real line for the Fourier transforms of the fields in the surface coordinate normal to the edge and solve these equations exactly. The derived EP dispersion relation smoothly connects two regimes: a low-frequency regime, where the EP wave number, q , can be comparable to the propagation constant, k 0 , of the ambient medium, and the nonretarded frequency regime in which | q | ≫ | k 0 |. Our analysis indicates two types of 2D surface plasmon-polaritons on the sheet away from the edge. We extend the formalism to the geometry of two coplanar sheets.},

  abstract     = {In flat spacetime, two inequivalent vacuum states that arise rather naturally are the Rindler vacuum | R 〉 and the Minkowski vacuum | M 〉 ⁠ . We discuss several aspects of the Rindler vacuum, concentrating on the propagator and Schwinger (heat) kernel defined using | R 〉 ⁠ , both in the Lorentzian and Euclidean sectors. We start by exploring an intriguing result due to Candelas and Raine [J. Math. Phys. 17 , 2101 (1976)], viz., that G R ⁠ , the Feynman propagator corresponding to | R 〉 ⁠ , can be expressed as a curious integral transform of G M ⁠ , the Feynman propagator in | M 〉 ⁠ . We show that this relation follows from the well-known result that G M can be written as a periodic sum of G R ⁠ , in the Rindler time τ , with the period (in proper units) 2 πi . We further show that the integral transform result holds for a wide class of pairs of bi-scalars F M , F R ⁠ , provided that F M can be represented as a periodic sum of F R with period 2 πi . We provide an explicit procedure to retrieve F R from its periodic sum F M for a wide class of functions. An example of particular interest is the pair of Schwinger kernels K M , K R ⁠ , corresponding to the Minkowski and Rindler vacua. We obtain an explicit expression for K R and clarify several conceptual and technical issues related to these biscalars both in the Euclidean and Lorentzian sectors. In particular, we address the issue of retrieving the information contained in all the four wedges of the Rindler frame in the Lorentzian sector, starting from the Euclidean Rindler (polar) coordinates. This is possible but requires four different types of analytic continuations based on one unifying principle. Our procedure allows the generalization of these results to any (bifurcate Killing) horizon in curved spacetime.},

In this general model, a jammer has side information about the channel input. We determine a single letter formula for the correlation assisted capacity. As an application of our main result, we determine the correlation assisted common randomness generation capacity. In this scenario, the two channel users have access to correlation as a resource and further use an AVCQC with an informed jammer for additional discussion. The goal is to create common randomness between the two channel users. We also analyze these capacity formulas when only a small number of signals from the correlation are available. For the correlation assisted common randomness generation capacity, we show an additional interesting property: For a sufficient amount of “public communication,” common randomness generation capacity is Turing computable; however, without this public communication constraint, the correlation assisted common randomness generation capacity is, in general, not Turing computable. Furthermore, we show that even without knowing the capacity formula of the deterministic capacity using the maximal error criterion, we can show that it is impossible to evaluate the performance algorithmically on any current or future digital computer.},

The latter is described by a spin model whose main feature is that it possesses a maximum number of excitations. The approach adopted here leads to a nonlinear extension of the Dicke model that takes into account both the intensity dependent coupling between the atoms and the radiation field and an additional nonlinear Kerr-like or Pösch–Teller-like oscillator term, depending on the degree of nonlinearity. We use the energy surface minimization method to demonstrate that the extended Dicke model exhibits a quantum phase transition, and we analyze its dependence upon the maximum number of excitations of the model. Our analysis is carried out via three methods: through mean-field analysis (i.e., by using the tensor product of coherent states), by using parity-preserving symmetry-adapted states (using the critical values obtained in the mean-field analysis and numerically minimizing the energy surface), and by means of the exact quantum solution (i.e., by numerically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian). Possible connections with the qp -deformed algebras are also discussed.},

To answer this question, we use the “tridiagonal representation approach” to solve the wave equation at the given energy by expanding the wavefunction in a series of energy-dependent square integrable basis functions in configuration space. The expansion coefficients satisfy a three-term recursion relation, which is solved in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Depending on the selected energy, we show that one of the potential parameters must assume a value from within a discrete set called the “potential parameter spectrum” (PPS). This discrete set is obtained from the spectrum of the above polynomials and can be either a finite or an infinite set. Inverting the relation between the energy and the PPS gives the bound state energy spectrum. Therefore, the answer to the above question is affirmative.},

This opens the possibility to get the wavefunctions from the spectrum, an elusive goal of many fields in physics. Here, the formula is assessed for simple potentials, recovering the theoretical wavefunctions within machine accuracy. A striking feature of this eigenvalue–eigenvector relation is that it does not require knowing any of the entries of the working matrix. However, it requires the knowledge of the eigenvalues of the minor matrices (in which a row and a column have been deleted from the original matrix). We found a pattern in these sub-matrix spectra, allowing us to get the eigenvectors analytically. The physical information hidden behind this pattern is analyzed.},

In the last step, we take both a large N limit and a non-relativistic limit (meaning c tending to infinity) to close the argument. Deriving such a mean-field limit for interactions with Coulomb singularity is a difficult task; therefore, we introduce an N -dependent mollifier to smoothen the interactions. Note that the length scale of our mollifier is N − α for an α that can be chosen arbitrarily close to but smaller than 1/3, which improves previous results in the literature on deriving Vlasov–Maxwell in the non-relativistic setting.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we are concerned with non-isentropic Navier–Stokes equations governing compressible viscous and heat-conductive gases. We formulate an additional regularity assumption of low frequencies in R d ( d ≥ 3 ) and then establish the sharp time-weighted inequality, which allows us to get the time-decay estimates of global strong solutions in the L p critical Besov spaces. Precisely, it is shown that if the initial data belong to some Besov space B ̇ 2 , ∞ − s 1 with s 1 ∈ ( 1 − d 2 , s 0 ] ( s 0 ≜ 2 d p − d 2 ) ⁠ , then the L p norm of the critical global solutions admits the time decay t − s 1 2 − d 2 ( 1 2 − 1 p ) (in particular, t − d 2 p if s 1 = s 0 ), which coincides with that of the heat kernel in the L p framework. In comparison with the work of Danchin and Xu [J. Math. Fluid Mech. 20 , 1641–1665 (2018)], the low-frequency assumption is improved such that the regularity s 1 belongs to the whole range ( 1 − d 2 , s 0 ] ⁠ .},

The equation behaves as the usual diffusion phenomenon over the low frequency domain, while it admits a feature of regularity-loss on the high frequency part. The feature of regularity-loss leads to the weakly dissipative property of the equation. To overcome the weakly dissipative property, the time-weighted energy is introduced, and extra regularity on the initial data is required. Under suitable conditions on the initial data and space dimensions, we prove the global existence and time-decay rates of solutions. The proof is based on the spectral analysis for the solution operators, time-weighted energy, and the contraction mapping theorem. Moreover, we also establish the asymptotic profiles of global solutions involving the nonlinear term for n ≥ 3, ν ∈ ( 0 , 1 2 ) and n ≥ 4, ν ∈ [ 1 2 , 1 ) ⁠ , respectively.},

This is obtained by including the former differential equation in an isomonodromic system and using some homogeneity conditions to introduce ℏ . The topological recursion is then proved to provide a formal series expansion of the corresponding tau-function whose coefficients can thus be expressed in terms of intersections of tautological classes in the Deligne–Mumford compactification of the moduli space of surfaces.

  abstract     = {Recently, a class of partition functions associated with higher rank rational and trigonometric integrable models were introduced by Foda and Manabe. We use the dynamical R -matrix of the elliptic quantum group E τ , η ( gl 3 ) to introduce an elliptic analog of the partition functions associated with E τ , η ( gl 3 ). We investigate the partition functions of Foda–Manabe type by developing a nested version of the elliptic Izergin–Korepin analysis and present the explicit forms as symmetrization of multivariable elliptic functions. We show that special cases are essentially the elliptic weight functions introduced in the works by Rimányi, Tarasov, and Varchenko; Konno; and Felder, Rimányi, and Varchenko.},

These components can disappear in the functioning process. Each component assumes two possible states, called plus and minus , and interacts at every time step only with its nearest neighbors. The following two transformations happen: The first one is called flip , under its action, a component in state minus turns into a plus with probability β . The second one is called annihilation , under its action, whenever a component in state plus is a left neighbor of a component in state minus, both components disappear with probability α . Let us consider a set of initial measures to the process. For these measures, we show the upper bound for the mean time of convergence, which is a function of the initial measure. Moreover, we obtain the upper bound to the mean quantity of minuses on the process in each time step. Considering the initial measure concentrated at the configuration whose components are in the state minus, we improved a well-known result that the process is non-ergodic when β &lt; α 2 /250. Now, we are able to offer non-ergodicity when β &lt; 9 α 2 /1000. We also established new conditions to the ergodicity of the process.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear WKB is a multiscale technique for studying locally plane-wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Its application comprises two steps: (1) replacement of the original PDE with an extended system separating the large scales from the small and (2) reduction of the extended system to its slow manifold. In the context of variational fluid theories with particle relabeling symmetry, nonlinear WKB in the mean Eulerian frame is known to possess a variational structure. This much has been demonstrated using, for instance, the theoretical apparatus known as the generalized Lagrangian mean. On the other hand, the variational structure of nonlinear WKB in the conventional Eulerian frame remains mysterious. By exhibiting a variational principle for the extended equations from step (1) above, we demonstrate that nonlinear WKB in the Eulerian frame is in fact variational. Remarkably, the variational principle for the extended system admits loops of relabeling transformations as a symmetry group. Noether’s theorem therefore implies that the extended Eulerian equations possess a family of circulation invariants parameterized by S 1 . As an illustrative example, we use our results to systematically deduce a variational model of high-frequency acoustic waves interacting with a larger-scale compressible isothermal flow.},

Later, these were extended to monotone metrics on the set of positive operators whose traces are not always the one based on completely positive, trace preserving maps. It was shown that these extended monotone metrics were characterized by operator monotone functions continuously parameterized by traces of positive operators and did not have some ideal properties such as monotonicity and convexity with respect to the positive operators. In this paper, we introduce another extension of quantum monotone metrics that have monotonicity under completely positive, trace non-increasing maps and additive noise. We prove that our extended monotone metrics can be characterized only by static operator monotone functions from few assumptions without assuming continuities of metrics. We show that our monotone metrics have some natural properties such as additivity of direct sum, convexity, and monotonicity with respect to positive operators.},

  abstract     = {We examine the quantization of pseudoclassical dynamical systems, models that have classically anticommuting variables, in the Schrödinger picture. We quantize these systems, which can be viewed as classical models of particle spin, using the generalized Gupta–Bleuler method as well as the reduced phase space method in even dimensions. With minimal modifications, the standard constructions of Schrödinger quantum mechanics of constrained systems work for pseudoclassical systems. We generalize the standard Schrödinger norm and implement the correct adjointness properties of observables and constraints. We construct the state space corresponding to spinors as physical wave functions of anticommuting variables, finding that there are superselection sectors in both the physical and ghost subspaces. The physical states are isomorphic to those of the Dirac–Kähler formulation of fermions, though the inner product in Dirac–Kähler theory is not equivalent to ours.},

  abstract     = {It is shown that the N = 1 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SQM) can be extended to a Z 2 n -graded superalgebra. This is done by presenting quantum mechanical models that realize, with the aid of Clifford gamma matrices, the Z 2 n -graded Poincaré algebra in one-dimensional spacetime. Reflecting the fact that the Z 2 n -graded Poincaré algebra has a number of central elements, a sequence of models defining the Z 2 n -graded version of SQM is provided for a given value of n . In a model of the sequence, the central elements having the same Z 2 n -degree are realized as dependent or independent operators. It is observed that as the Clifford algebras of larger dimension are used, more central elements are realized as independent operators.},

Explicit calculations are carried out to demonstrate the conservation of probability if a proper definition of the final state is adopted. Finally, this formalism is applied to two-flavor neutrino oscillations ν μ → ν μ and ν μ → ν τ in vacuum, where the exact PT symmetry requires the vacuum mixing angle to be maximal, which is compatible with current neutrino oscillation experiments. A possible generalization to the three-flavor case is briefly discussed.},

The main tool will be a necessary condition for complete integrability of classical Hamiltonian systems obtained by Ramis and myself [Morales-Ruiz and Ramis, Methods Appl. Anal. 8 , 33–96 (2001); see also Morales-Ruiz, in Differential Galois Theory and Non-Integrability of Hamiltonian Systems, Modern Birkhäuser Classics (Springer, Basel, 1999)]; if a finite dimensional complex analytical Hamiltonian system is completely integrable with meromorphic first integrals, then the identity component of the Galois group of the variational equation around any integral curve must be abelian. A corollary of this result is that, for finite dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems, the semiclassical approach is computable in a closed form in the framework of the differential Galois theory. This explains in a very precise way the success of quantum semiclassical computations for integrable Hamiltonian systems.},

If the properties of the waveguide slowly vary along its axis and the phase velocities of two modes have a degeneracy point or are almost degenerate near some point, the transformation of modes may occur. The conditions are formulated under which we can find formal asymptotic expansions of modes outside the vicinity of the degeneracy point and write out explicitly the transition matrix. The starting point is rewriting the governing equations in the form of the Schrödinger type equation. The Hamiltonian is assumed to be the result of a small perturbation of an operator with a degeneracy point of the crossing types of two eigenvalues. The perturbation of the Hamiltonian produces a close pair of simple degeneracy points. Two regimes of mode transformation for the Schrödinger type equation are identified: avoided crossing of eigenvalues (corresponding to complex degeneracy points) and an explicit unavoidable crossing (with real degeneracy points).},

[Chaos 28 , 053116 (2018)]. For the proposed PSM on the hyperboloid, we first establish the global existence of a solution via the extension of a local solution to a global one by the continuity argument and then show that the solutions are uniformly bounded by a quantity only depending on the initial data and the coupling strength although the underlying manifold is not compact. In this paper, we consider both attractive and repulsive couplings. For an attractive regime, we show that the complete synchronization occurs for all initial data, whereas for a repulsive regime, we show that distances between particles diverge to infinity, as time goes on. Finally, we present several numerical results consistent with our theoretical results.},

This allows us to recover and improve earlier versions of this result in dimensions n = 2 and n = 4 by Fathizadeh and Khalkhali. We also recover Connes’s integration formula for flat noncommutative tori of McDonald, Sukochev, and Zanin. As a further application, we prove a curved version of this integration formula in terms of the Laplace–Beltrami operator defined by an arbitrary Riemannian metric. For the class of the so-called self-compatible Riemannian metrics (including the conformally flat metrics of Connes and Tretkoff), this shows that Connes’s noncommutative integral allows us to recover the Riemannian density. This exhibits a neat link between this notion of noncommutative integral and noncommutative measure theory in the sense of operator algebras. As an application of these results, we set up a natural notion of scalar curvature for curved noncommutative tori.},

  abstract     = {When a quantum system is distributed to spatially separated parties, it is natural to consider how the system evolves when the parties perform local quantum operations with classical communication (LOCC). However, the structure of LOCC channels is exceedingly complex, leaving many important physical problems unsolved. In this paper, we consider generalized resource theories of entanglement based on different relaxations to the class of LOCC. The behavior of various entanglement measures is studied under non-entangling channels, as well as the newly introduced classes of dually non-entangling and positive partial transpose (PPT)-preserving channels. In an effort to better understand the nature of LOCC bound entanglement, we study the problem of entanglement distillation in these generalized resource theories. We first show that unlike LOCC, general non-entangling maps can be superactivated, in the sense that two copies of the same non-entangling map can, nevertheless, be entangling. On the single-copy level, we demonstrate that every NPT entangled state can be converted into an LOCC-distillable state using channels that are both dually non-entangling and having a PPT Choi representation and that every state can be converted into an LOCC-distillable state using operations belonging to any family of polytopes that approximate LOCC. We then turn to the stochastic convertibility of multipartite pure states and show that any two states can be interconverted by any polytope approximation to the set of separable channels. Finally, as an analog to k -positive maps, we introduce and analyze the set of k -non-entangling channels.},

  abstract     = {It is a well-known and classical result that spectrally stable traveling waves of a general reaction-diffusion system in one spatial dimension are asymptotically stable with exponential relaxation rates. In a series of works in the 1990s, Goodman [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 311 , 683 (1989)], Kapitula [Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 349 , 1901 (1997)], and Xin [Commun. Partial Differ. Equations 17 , 1889 (1992)] considered plane traveling waves for such systems and they have succeeded in showing asymptotic stability for such objects. Interestingly, the (estimates for the) relaxation rates that they have exhibited are all algebraic and dimension dependent. It was heuristically argued that as the spectral gap closes in dimensions n ≥ 2, algebraic rates are the best possible. In this paper, we revisit this issue. We rigorously calculate the sharp relaxation rates in L ∞ based spaces, both for the asymptotic phase and the radiation terms. They are, indeed, algebraic, but about twice better than the best ones obtained in these early works although this can be mostly attributed to the inefficiencies of using Sobolev embeddings to control L ∞ norms by high order L 2 based Sobolev spaces. Finally, we explicitly construct the leading order profiles, both for the phase and for the radiation terms. Our approach relies on the method of scaling variables, as introduced in the work of Gallay and Wayne [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 163 , 209 (2002) and Gallay and Wayne, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 360 , 2155 (2002)] and, in fact, provides sharp relaxation rates in a class of weighted L 2 spaces as well.},

The discrete indices and continuous variables of special functions are in correspondence with the representations of their algebra of symmetry, which induce discrete and continuous bases coexisting on a rigged Hilbert space supporting the representation. Meaningful operators are shown to be continuous on the spaces of test vectors and the dual. Here, the chosen special functions, called “algebraic Jacobi functions,” are related to the Jacobi polynomials, and the Lie algebra is su (2, 2). These functions with m and q fixed also exhibit a su (1, 1)-symmetry. Different discrete and continuous bases are introduced. An extension in the spirit of the associated Legendre polynomials and the spherical harmonics is presented introducing the “Jacobi harmonics” that are a generalization of the spherical harmonics to the three-dimensional hypersphere S 3 .},

We start by obtaining all possible singularity patterns for a general asymmetric trihomographic system and discard those patterns that cannot lead to confined singularities. Working with the remaining ones, we implement the confinement conditions and derive the corresponding discrete Painlevé equations, which involve two variables. By eliminating either of these variables we obtain a “symmetric” equation. Examining all these equations of a single variable, we find that they coincide exactly with those derived in previous works of ours, thereby establishing the completeness of our results.},

This model can be seen as a two-dimensional Wigner jellium, not necessarily charge-neutral, and with particles allowed to exist beyond the support of the smeared charge. The full space integrability condition requires a low enough temperature or high enough total smeared charge. This condition does not allow, at the same time, total charge-neutrality and determinantal structure. The model shares similarities with both the complex Ginibre ensemble and the Forrester–Krishnapur spherical ensemble of random matrix theory. In particular, for a certain regime of temperature and total charge, the equilibrium measure is uniform on a disk as in the Ginibre ensemble, while the modulus of the farthest particle has heavy-tailed fluctuations as in the Forrester–Krishnapur spherical ensemble. We also touch upon a higher temperature regime producing a crossover equilibrium measure, as well as a transition to Gumbel edge fluctuations. More results in the same spirit on edge fluctuations are explored by the second author together with Raphael Butez.},

The method combines the Penrose conformal compactification and geometric energy estimates in order to work out a definition of peeling at all orders in terms of Sobolev regularity near I ⁠ , instead of C k regularity at I ⁠ , and then provides the optimal spaces of initial data such that the associated solution satisfies peeling at a given order. The results confirm that the analogous decay and regularity assumptions on initial data in the Minkowski and Kerr spacetimes produce the same regularity across null infinity. Our results are local near spacelike infinity and are valid for all values of the angular momentum of the spacetime, including for fast Kerr metrics.},

The model is defined on a fine toroidal lattice, and we seek control as the lattice spacing goes to zero. The problem is analyzed using Balaban’s formulation of the renormalization group. This involves a sequence of transformations consisting of a split into large and small field regions, then block averaging, and then scaling. The effective actions generated by this method depend strongly on certain multi-scale propagators and minimizers. The study of these objects both for fermions and for gauge fields is the content of this paper. Earlier work on the subject is reviewed. In addition for fermions, a polymer expansion is obtained for the determinants of the fermion propagators. For the gauge field, a detailed local regularity result is obtained for the minimizers.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, we study the initial value problem of a system consisting of a quantum scalar field weakly interacting with a classical one. The quantum field obeys a Klein–Gordon equation with a potential proportional to the classical field. The classical field obeys an inhomogeneous Klein–Gordon equation sourced by the renormalized expectation value of the squared quantum field in a Hadamard state, ⟨Ψ|Φ 2 Ψ⟩. Thus, the system of equations for the scalar field is reminiscent of the semi-classical Einstein field equations with a Klein–Gordon field, where classical geometry is sourced by the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the quantum field, and the Klein–Gordon equation depends on the metric explicitly. We show that a unique asymptotic solution for the system can be obtained perturbatively at any fixed finite order in the weak coupling from initial data, provided that the interaction is switched on and off smoothly in a spacetime region to the future of the initial data surface. This allows one to provide “free” initial data for the decoupled system that guarantees that the Wightman function of the quantum field be of Hadamard form and hence that the renormalized ⟨Ψ|Φ 2 Ψ⟩ exist (in a perturbative sense) and be smooth. We comment on how to relax the switching of the interaction, which might be relevant for the corresponding problem in semiclassical gravity.},

The space representing quantum noise is the symmetric Fock space over L 2 R + ⁠ . Using the isomorphism of this space with the space of square-integrable functionals of the Poisson process, the equations can be represented as classical stochastic differential equations, driven by Poisson processes. This leads to a discontinuous dynamical state reduction which we compare to the Ghirardi-–Rimini–Weber model. A purely quantum object, the norm process, is found, which plays the role of an observer {in the sense of Everett [H. Everett III, Rev. Mod.

These coherent states are studied in the case when the algebra is the generically non-commutative Manin plane. In usual quantization schemes, one starts with a classical phase space and then quantizes it in order to produce annihilation operators and then their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. However, we do this in the opposite order, namely, the set of the eigenvalues of the previously defined annihilation operator is identified as a generalization of a classical mechanical phase space. We introduce the resolution of the identity, upper and lower symbols, and a coherent state quantization, which in turn quantizes the Toeplitz quantization. We thereby have a curious composition of quantization schemes. We proceed by identifying a generalized Segal–Bargmann space S B of square-integrable, anti-holomorphic functions as the image of a coherent state transform. Then, S B has a reproducing kernel function, which allows us to define a secondary Toeplitz quantization, whose symbols are functions. Finally, this is compared with the coherent states of the Toeplitz quantization of a closely related non-commutative space known as the paragrassmann algebra.},

The analysis is based on the asymptotically reduced equations derived for rotationally constrained dynamics with no-slip boundaries, and hence, includes a lower order correction that accounts for the Ekman layer and corresponding Ekman pumping into the bulk. Using the auxiliary functional method, we find that, to leading order, the temporally averaged heat transport is bounded above as a function of the Rayleigh and Ekman numbers Ra and Ek according to Nu ≤ 0.3704 Ra 2 Ek 2 . Dependent on the relative values of the thermal forcing represented by Ra and the effects of rotation represented by Ek , this bound is both an improvement on earlier rigorous upper bounds and provides a partial explanation of recent numerical and experimental results that were consistent yet surprising relative to the previously derived upper bound of Nu ≲ Ra 3 Ek 4 .},

His prediction—topological effects are bona fide wave and not quantum phenomena—has been confirmed in a number of experiments [Z. Wang et al. , Nature 461 , 772–775 (2009)]. However, theoretical physicists have tacitly used three different definitions for the bulk Chern numbers that enter the bulk-edge correspondence—on the basis of electromagnetic Bloch functions, electric Bloch functions, and magnetic Bloch functions. We use vector bundle theoretic arguments to prove that in media such as those considered by Haldane, these three potentially different Chern numbers necessarily agree with one another, and consequently, any one of them can be used in Haldane’s photonic bulk-edge correspondence.},

Here, ⊥ denotes a degree −2 bidirectional interior product built from the metric and δ is the divergence or codifferential. We also recover that δ obeys a 7-term relation making the exterior algebra into a Batalin−Vilkovisky algebra. These formulas arise naturally from a novel view of Riemannian structures as cocycles governing the central extension of the classical exterior algebra to a quantum one, motivated by ideas for quantum gravity. The approach also works when the initial exterior algebra is already quantum, allowing us to construct examples of quantum Riemannian structures, including quantum Levi−Civita connections, as cocycle data. Combining with the semidirect product of a differential graded algebra by the quantum differential algebra Ω( t , d t ) in one variable, we recover a differential quantization of M × R associated to any conformal Killing vector field on a Riemannian manifold M .},

By choosing a suitable non-Abelian gauge field, we investigate the spectrum in two-dimensional space, paying particular attention to the role of the total angular momentum.

Whether two graph states are equivalent up to single-qubit Clifford operations is known to be decidable in polynomial time and has been studied in the context of producing certain required states in a quantum network in relation to stabilizer codes. The reason for the latter is that single-qubit Clifford equivalent graph states exactly correspond to equivalent stabilizer codes. We here consider that the computational complexity of, given a graph state | G ⟩, counting the number of graph states, single-qubit Clifford equivalent to | G ⟩. We show that this problem is # P -complete. To prove our main result, we make use of the notion of isotropic systems in graph theory.

  abstract     = {We implement a SU(1, 1) covariant integral quantization of functions on the unit disk. The latter can be viewed as the phase space for the motion of a “massive” test particle on (1+1)-anti-de Sitter space-time, and the relevant unitary irreducible representations of SU(1, 1) corresponding to the quantum version of such motions are found in the discrete series and its lower limit. Our quantization method depends on the choice of a weight function on the phase space in such a way that different weight functions yield different quantizations. For instance, the Perelomov coherent states quantization is derived from a particular choice. Semi-classical portraits or lower symbols of main physically relevant operators are determined, and the statistical meaning of the weight function is discussed.},

In our proof, we first present the vertical velocity as a function of density and horizontal velocity, which plays a role in using the Faedo–Galerkin method to obtain the global existence of the approximate solutions. Then, we obtain the key estimates of lower bound of the density, the Bresch–Desjardins entropy on the approximate solutions. Finally, we apply compactness arguments to obtain global existence of weak solutions by vanishing the parameters in our approximate system step-by-step.},

The limit of the radius is a Gumbel distribution. The main observation is that the joint density function of the eigenvalues of the chiral ensemble, after a transformation, becomes a rotation-invariant determinantal point process on the complex plane. Then, the eigenvalues are studied by the tools developed by Jiang and Qi [J. Theor. Probab. 30 , 326 (2017); 32 , 353 (2019)].

Based on a geometric realization of doubled space-time as a para-Hermitian manifold, we examine exterior algebras and a para-Dolbeault cohomology on DFT and discuss the structure of the Drinfel’d double behind the DFT gauge symmetry. Similar to the Courant algebroid in the generalized geometry, Lagrangian sub-bundles ( L , L ̃ ) in a para-Hermitian manifold play Dirac-like structures in the Vaisman algebroid. We find that an algebraic origin of the strong constraint in DFT is traced back to the compatibility condition needed for ( L , L ̃ ) to be a Lie bialgebroid.

  abstract     = {Advective diffusion plays a key role in the transport of salt, heat, buoys, and markers in geophysical flows, in the dispersion of pollutants and trace gases in the atmosphere, and even in the dynamics of sea ice floes influenced by winds and ocean currents. The long time, large scale behavior of such systems is equivalent to an enhanced diffusion process with an effective diffusivity matrix D * ⁠ . Three decades ago, a Stieltjes integral representation for the homogenized matrix, involving a spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator, was developed. However, analytical calculations of D * have been obtained for only a few simple flows, and numerical computations of the effective behavior based on this spectral representation have apparently not been attempted. We overcome these limitations by providing a mathematical foundation for the computation of Stieltjes integral representations of D * ⁠ . We explore two different approaches and for each approach we derive new Stieltjes integral representations and rigorous bounds for the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of D * ⁠ , involving the molecular diffusivity and a spectral measure μ of a self-adjoint operator that depends on the characteristics of a randomly perturbed periodic flow. In discrete formulations of each approach, we express μ explicitly in terms of standard (or generalized) eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hermitian matrices. We develop and implement an efficient numerical algorithm that combines beneficial numerical attributes of each approach. We use this method to compute the effective behavior for model flows and relate spectral characteristics to flow geometry and transport properties.},

  abstract     = {Since the late 1950s, the dynamics of a charged particle’s “guiding center” in a strong, inhomogeneous magnetic field have been understood in terms of near-identity coordinate transformations. The basic idea has been to approximately transform away the coupling between the fast gyration around magnetic fields lines and the remaining slow dynamics. This basic understanding now serves as a foundation for describing the kinetic theory of strongly magnetized plasmas. I present a new way to understand guiding center dynamics that does not involve complicated coordinate transformations. Starting from a dynamical system formulation of the motion of parameterized loops in a charged particle’s phase space, I identify a formal slow manifold in loop space. Dynamics on this formal slow manifold are equivalent to guiding center dynamics to all orders in perturbation theory. After demonstrating that loop space dynamics comprises an infinite-dimensional noncanonical Hamiltonian system, I recover the well-known Hamiltonian formulation of guiding center motion by restricting the (pre)symplectic structure on loop space to the finite-dimensional guiding center formal slow manifold.},

Second, we investigate the uniform time-delay structure effect on the emergent dynamics of the Lohe matrix model and show that complete aggregation can occur when the size of the time-delay is sufficiently small. Finally, we study the interplay between the network structure and time-delayed interactions in the asymptotic dynamics of the Lohe matrix model. In this case, we cannot expect complete synchronous behavior.

Our result implies that PT-symmetry breaking is equivalent to the onset of instabilities of pseudo-Hermitian systems, which was systematically studied by Krein et al. [Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR N.S. 73 , 445 (1950)]. In particular, we show that the mechanism of PT-symmetry breaking is the resonance between two eigenmodes with opposite signs of actions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we associate a Higgs bundle over P 1 with a Higgs quiver. We need to consider the Higgs representation of Higgs quivers, where the difference of Higgs representation from the usual linear representation is putting an O P 1 -module at each vertex in the quiver, and then changing the Higgs field on the underlying vector bundle is equivalent to changing the Higgs representations. We can also treat the space of Higgs fields as a space of the representations of the so-called Higgs structure quiver with the action of a reductive group. We produce some new quivers from the Higgs structure quiver and its representations, such as double quivers and Bogomol’nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield quivers related to quiver gauge theory, and study some topology of moduli space of corresponding stable representations, encoded in the structure of a Higgs bundle. We also introduce some algebraic structures on some vector spaces constructed from the Higgs structure quiver as the generalizations of classical Hall algebra and cohomological Hall algebra via bipartite quivers; the complexities of these algebraic structures are reflected in the nonassociativity of multiplications arising from preservation of some ( Z 2 ) r -graded structure.},

We then show that for each m &gt; 2, the depth of N m ⊂ M is always two. Observing that N m ⊂ M is reducible for all m &gt; 2, we study in great detail the weak Kac algebra structure of the relative commutant ( N m ) ′ ∩ M 2 ⁠ .},

Our main purpose is to show an existence result of non-scattering energies. Precisely, we show a Weyl-type lower bound for the number of non-scattering energies. Usually, a scattered wave occurs for every incident wave by the inhomogeneity of the media. However, there may exist suitable wavenumbers and patterns of incident waves such that the corresponding scattered wave vanishes. We call (the square of) this wavenumber a non-scattering energy in this paper. The problem of non-scattering energies can be reduced to a well-known interior transmission eigenvalue problem.},
